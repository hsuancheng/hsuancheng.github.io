We evaluated the MDR/XDRTB colour plate thin-layer agar test (TB-CX) for M. tuberculosis DST by directly testing sputum at University of Gondar Hospital.Sputum samples were each divided into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was mixed with disinfectant and applied directly to the TB-CX quadrant petri-plate containing culture medium with and without isoniazid, rifampicin or ciprofloxacin. Concurrently, the other aliquot was decontaminated with sodium hydroxide, centrifuged and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen media, then the stored M. tuberculosis isolates were sub-cultured in BACTEC™ Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube™ (MGIT) 960 for reference DST.TB-CX text yielded DST results for 94% (123/131) of positive samples. For paired DST results, median days from sputum processing to DST was 12 for TB-CX versus 35 for LJ-MGIT (P < 0.001). Compared with LJ-MGIT for isoniazid, rifampicin and MDR-TB, TB-CX test had: 59%, 96% and 95% sensitivity; 96%, 94% and 98% specificity; and 85%, 94% and 98% agreement, respectively. All ciprofloxacin DST results were susceptible by both methods.The TB-CX was simple and rapid for M. tuberculosis DST. Discordant DST results may have resulted from sub-optimal storage and different isoniazid concentrations used in TB-CX versus the reference standard test.Copyright © 2019.

Yet, the fate of highly invasive fouling species in a rapidly acidifying ocean remains poorly understood, due to lack of information on multigenerational consequences at different levels of biological organization. Here, we investigated antioxidant responses of the mussel, Musculista senhousia, a swiftly spreading invasive fouling species in global coastal waters, following transgenerational exposure to elevated pCO. In the face of seawater acidification, M. senhousia without a prior history of transgenerational exposure to elevated pCO showed resistance to lipid peroxidation, but significantly increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), indicated oxidative stress responses. However, enhanced transgenerational  occurred, as exemplified by observations that mussels originating from parents exposed to elevated pCO exhibited significantly lower activities of SOD, CAT and GPx in comparison to those spawn from parents exposed to ambient pCO. Rapid transgenerational acclimation of M. senhousia in terms of reduced oxidative stress responses can likely be linked to the enhanced capacity of maintaining acid-base homeostasis previously demonstrated. These findings provide the first evidence of transgenerational plasticity at the biochemical level in highly invasive fouling bivalve species, and represent a step forward in understanding how they respond and acclimate in an acidifying ocean.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to investigate changes in the phenotypic profile of B cells in TDLNs of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) during disease progression. Mononuclear cells were isolated from TDLNs and stained with antibodies for CD19 and other B cell-related markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD19 B cells comprised 38.6 ± 8.9% of lymphocytes in TDLNs of HNSCC. Comparison of metastatic and non-metastatic LNs disclosed no significant differences in the frequencies of B cell subsets including antigen-experienced, naïve, switched, unswitched, atypical memory, marginal zone-like B cells, and B cells with regulatory phenotypes. The percentage of atypical memory (CD27IgMIgD) B cells was significantly higher in patients with tongue SCC with no involved LNs (p = 0.033) and correlated inversely with the number of involved LNs. The frequency of CD24CD38 B cells was significantly higher in non-metastatic LNs of patients with grade I compared to grade II (p = 0.016), and the percentage of CD5 B cells decreased as tumors progressed from stage III to IV (p = 0.008). Our data show that in TDLNs of HNSCC, the frequency of B cells with atypical memory and regulatory phenotypes was significantly associated with good prognostic factors; however, their function remains to be investigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694141>Peptide Epitope Hot Spots of CD4 T Cell Recognition Within Influenza Hemagglutinin During the Primary Response to Infection.</a></h1><p>Antibodies specific for the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza virus are critical for protective  to infection. Our studies show that CD4 T cells specific for epitopes derived from HA are the most effective in providing help for the HA-specific B cell responses to infection and vaccination. In this study, we asked whether HA epitopes recognized by CD4 T cells in the primary response to infection are equally distributed across the HA protein or if certain segments are enriched in CD4 T cell epitopes. Mice that collectively expressed eight alternative MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) class II molecules, that would each have different peptide binding specificities, were infected with an H1N1 influenza virus. CD4 T cell peptide epitope specificities were identified by cytokine EliSpots. These studies revealed that the HA-specific CD4 T cell epitopes cluster in two distinct regions of HA and that some segments of HA are completely devoid of CD4 T cell epitopes. When located on the HA structure, it appears that the regions that most poorly recruit CD4 T cells are sequestered within the interior of the HA trimer, perhaps inaccessible to the proteolytic machinery inside the endosomal compartments of antigen presenting cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697689>Assessing reliability of intra-tumor heterogeneity estimates from single sample whole exome sequencing data.</a></h1><p>Tumors are made of evolving and heterogeneous populations of cells which arise from successive appearance and expansion of subclonal populations, following acquisition of mutations conferring them a selective advantage. Those subclonal populations can be sensitive or resistant to different treatments, and provide information about tumor aetiology and future evolution. Hence, it is important to be able to assess the level of heterogeneity of tumors with high reliability for clinical applications. In the past few years, a large number of methods have been proposed to estimate intra-tumor heterogeneity from whole exome sequencing (WES) data, but the accuracy and robustness of these methods on real data remains elusive. Here we systematically apply and compare 6 computational methods to estimate tumor heterogeneity on 1,697 WES samples from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) covering 3 cancer types (breast invasive carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), and two distinct input mutation sets. We observe significant differences between the estimates produced by different methods, and identify several likely confounding factors in heterogeneity assessment for the different methods. We further show that the prognostic value of tumor heterogeneity for survival prediction is limited in those datasets, and find no evidence that it improves over prognosis based on other clinical variables. In conclusion, heterogeneity inference from WES data on a single sample, and its use in cancer prognosis, should be considered with caution. Other approaches to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity such as those based on multiple samples may be preferable for clinical applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690657>Sterile activation of invariant natural killer T cells by ER-stressed antigen-presenting cells.</a></h1><p>Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells have the unique ability to shape  during antitumor immune responses and other forms of sterile and nonsterile inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted a variety of classes of endogenous and pathogen-derived lipid antigens that can trigger iNKT cell activation under sterile and nonsterile conditions. However, the context and mechanisms that drive the presentation of self-lipid antigens in sterile inflammation remain unclear. Here we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stressed myeloid cells, via signaling events modulated by the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway, increase CD1d-mediated presentation of immunogenic endogenous lipid species, which results in enhanced iNKT cell activation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that actin cytoskeletal reorganization during ER stress results in an altered distribution of CD1d on the cell surface, which contributes to enhanced iNKT cell activation. These results define a previously unidentified mechanism that controls iNKT cell activation during sterile inflammation.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Traditional treatment strategies are ineffective and improving the treatment of colon cancer is an urgent need. Targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibodies has shown some therapeutic effectiveness and has advantages. Additionally, the Stat3 inhibitor nifuroxazide was employed to promote the antitumor activity. Here, we hypothesized that combining nifuroxazide with PD-1 small interfering RNA carried by attenuated Salmonella would exert a synergistic antitumor effect on colon cancer. Indeed, treatment with this combination effectively inhibited the development of colon cancer in mice and improved the survival rate. These two novel anticancer agents worked synergistically to elicit potent antitumor  and achieve improved therapeutic efficacy. The underlying mechanisms are mainly involved with immune regulation and cell apoptosis. This study provides a previous framework for combining this Stat3 inhibitor with RNAi designed to block immune checkpoint signaling for cancer therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684192>Emerging Role of LY6E in Virus-Host Interactions.</a></h1><p>As a canonical lymphocyte antigen-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor Ly6/uPAR family protein, lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E), plays important roles in immunological regulation, T cell physiology, and oncogenesis. Emerging evidence indicates that LY6E is also involved in the modulation of viral infection. Consequently, viral infection and associated pathogenesis have been associated with altered LY6E gene expression.

Dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is known to improve testis function and sperm parameters, thereby male fertility. This study piloted whether dietary DHA influences testis development and function in rats exposed to prenatal EtOH.Pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 30) received either EtOH (3 g/kg, twice a day, n = 14) or dextrose (n = 16) throughout pregnancy. Moreover, they were fed either diet supplemented with (Cont + DHA, n = 8, EtOH + DHA, n = 6) or without DHA (1.4% w/w of total fatty acids) (Cont, EtOH, n = 8 each), with pups being continued on their mothers' diet after weaning. Tissues were collected at gestational day (GD) 20, postnatal day (PD) 4, 21, 49 and 90 for analyzing testicular developmental markers and sperm parameters, and plasma for testosterone.Dietary DHA increased serum testosterone at GD20 (p < .05) and sperm normal morphology at PD90 (p < .0001) compared to the group without DHA supplementation. Dietary DHA also increased the height of germinal epithelium at peripuberty, PD49 (p < .03). The EtOH exposure induced a marked decline in the testicular gene expression of StAR at PD49 (p < .02) than those of non-EtOH treated group.These findings indicate that dietary DHA may positively contribute to male fertility by impacting sperm normal morphology likely by increasing fetal testosterone level. Prenatal EtOH exposure did not adversely affect the overall testis developmental markers during development and sperm parameters in adulthood.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687869>Age-stratified analysis of serotype-specific baseline  against group B streptococcus.</a></h1><p>Group B streptococcus (GBS) vaccines are currently under development. Data on the natural  in diverse age groups will aid establishing the GBS immunization policy. In this study, thirty serum samples were collected from three age groups (neonates/infants, pregnant women, and the elderly) between August 2016 and July 2017. Serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) was assessed using a GBS multiplex opsonophagocytic killing assay (MOPA) against serotypes Ia, III, and V. The mean OPA titers for serotype Ia of the three age groups were not significantly different (p = 0.156), but were tended to be lower in neonates/infants (mean ± standard deviation, 137 ± 278). For serotype III and V, the mean OPA titer of neonates/infants (338 ± 623 and 161 ± 445, respectively) was significantly lower than that of pregnant women (1377 ± 1167 and 9414 ± 6394) and the elderly (1350 ± 1741 and 3669 ± 5597) ( = 0.002). In conclusion, the lower levels of OPA titers against all tested serotypes in neonates/infants, despite high maternal titers, indicates that intrapartum GBS vaccinations may be required for efficient placental transfer of serotype-specific GBS antibodies with high avidity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695470>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate suppresses neutrophil migration speed in a transgenic zebrafish model accompanied by reduced inflammatory mediators.</a></h1><p>Polyphenol catechins from green tea, particularly (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), exhibits numerous beneficial health effects, although the mechanisms remain unclear.In this study, the mechanism of EGCG-mediated healing in an experimentally injured zebrafish model was examined at the cellular and molecular level using confocal microscopy and gene expression analysis.The mechanisms of action of EGCG were shown to involve: (1) reducing neutrophil response (accumulation, travel speed, and distance) and (2) downregulating the expression of IL-1β, TNFα, and related signaling pathways. As determined by dynamic time-lapse tracking studies, the local accumulation of neutrophils with high migration speeds after wounding (n=33 cells, v=0.020 μm/s, d=37.8 μm), underwent significant reduction following treatment with EGCG doses of 300 μM (n=22 cells, v=0.013 μm/s, d=39.5 μm) and 600 μM (n=18 cells, v=0.008 μm/s, d=9.53 μm). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that several signature genes in the IL-1β, TNFα, and related signaling pathways were downregulated after EGCG treatment.The convenience, transparency, and simplicity of the zebrafish model facilitate tracking of fluorescent neutrophils in real time, in order to monitor inflammation, and assess the impact of therapeutic agents.© 2019 Nguyen et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696186>Flaxseed oil supplementation improves intestinal function and , associated with altered intestinal microbiome and fatty acid profile in pigs with intrauterine growth retardation.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed oil (FO), enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is an important oil source for intestinal development and health. We aimed to study the different effects of FO versus soybean oil (SO) on growth, intestinal health and immune function of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using a weaned piglet model. Forty pairs of male IUGR and normal birth weight piglets, weaned at 21 ± 1 d, were fed diets containing either 4% FO or SO for 3 weeks consecutively. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal function parameters, immunology and microbiota composition were determined. IUGR led to a poor growth rate, nutrient digestibility and abnormal immunology variables, whereas feeding FO diet improved systemic and gut , as indicated by increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G and decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and down-regulated intestinal expression of genes (MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-10). Although IUGR tended to decrease villous height, feeding FO diet tended to increase the villi-crypt ratio and up-regulated expressions of tight junction genes (Claudin-1 and ZO-1), together with increased mucosa contents of n-3 PUFAs and a lower Σn-6/Σn-3 ratio. Besides, FO diet decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria Spirochaetes, and increased phylum Actinobacteria, and genera Blautia and Bifidobacterium in colonic digesta. Our findings indicate that IUGR impairs growth rate, nutrient digestibility, and partly immunology variables, whereas feeding FO-supplemented diet could improve intestinal function and  of both IUGR and NBW pigs, associated with the altered gut microbiome and mucosal fatty acid profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697703>Structural mechanism for regulation of DNA binding of BpsR, a Bordetella regulator of biofilm formation, by 6-hydroxynicotinic acid.</a></h1><p>Bordetella bacteria are respiratory pathogens of humans, birds, and livestock. Bordetella pertussis the causative agent of whopping cough remains a significant health issue. The transcriptional regulator, BpsR, represses a number of Bordetella genes relating to virulence, cell adhesion, cell motility, and nicotinic acid metabolism. DNA binding of BpsR is allosterically regulated by interaction with 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6HNA), the first product in the nicotinic acid degradation pathway. To understand the mechanism of this regulation, we have determined the crystal structures of BpsR and BpsR in complex with 6HNA. The structures reveal that BpsR binding of 6HNA induces a conformational change in the protein to prevent DNA binding. We have also identified homologs of BpsR in other Gram negative bacteria in which the amino acids involved in recognition of 6HNA are conserved, suggesting a similar mechanism for regulating nicotinic acid degradation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689529>Low chikungunya virus seroprevalence two years after emergence in Fiji.</a></h1><p>In Fiji, autochthonous chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection was first detected in March 2015. In a previous serosurvey conducted during October-November 2015, we reported a prevalence of anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies of 0.9%. In the present study, we investigated the seroprevalence of CHIKV two years after its emergence in Fiji.Sera from 320 residents of Fiji recruited in June 2017, from the same cohort of individuals that participated in the serosurvey in 2015, were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against CHIKV using a recombinant antigen-based microsphere immunoassay.Between 2015 and 2017, CHIKV seroprevalence among residents increased from 0.9% (3/333) to 12.8% (41/320). Of the participants with available serum samples collected in both 2015 and 2017 (n = 200), 31 (15.5%) who were seronegative in 2015 had seroconverted to CHIKV in 2017.Our findings suggest that low-level transmission of CHIKV occurred during the two years following the emergence of the virus in Fiji. No CHIKV infection has been reported in Fiji since 2017, but due to the presumed low herd  of the population, the risk of CHIKV re-emergence is high. Consequently, chikungunya should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile diseases in Fiji.Copyright © 2019.

Under physiological conditions, vascular inflammation offers a template for the establishment of effective intravascular , with platelets providing neutrophils with an array of signals that increase their activation threshold, thus limiting collateral damage to tissues and promoting termination of the inflammatory response. By contrast, persistent systemic inflammation as observed in immune-mediated diseases, such as systemic vasculitides, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by platelet and neutrophil reciprocal activation, which ultimately culminates in the generation of thrombo-inflammatory lesions, fostering vascular injury and organ damage. Here, we discuss recent evidence regarding the multifaceted aspects of platelet-neutrophil interactions from bone marrow precursors to shed microparticles. Moreover, we analyse shared and disease-specific events due to an aberrant deployment of these interactions in human diseases.

This drug, modulating sphingosine receptors, regulates the trafficking of lymphocytes between primary and secondary lymphoid organs, trapping naïve T cells and central memory T cells in secondary lymphoid organs, without affecting effector memory T cells and therefore without compromising immunosurveillance. Additionally, fingolimod inhibits expression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines and enhances regulatory T-cell differentiation. It also acts on the B arm of  through an increased ratio of naïve to memory B cells, higher percentage of plasma cells, and highly increased proportion of transitional B cells as well as additional regulatory subsets. Fingolimod treatment enhances the capacity of regulatory B cells to transmigrate across brain endothelial cells. In fact, patients treated with fingolimod have increased regulatory B-cell frequency in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Since diet can impact fish , this work investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of 5% Gracilaria sp. aqueous extract (GRA) on seabass antioxidant capacity and resistance against Phdp. After infection, mortality was delayed in fish fed GRA, which also revealed increased lysozyme activity levels, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation, suggesting higher antioxidant capacity than in fish fed a control diet. Dietary GRA induced a down-regulation of hepatic stress-responsive heat shock proteins (grp-78, grp-170, grp-94, grp-75), while bacterial infection caused a down-regulation in antioxidant genes (prdx4 and mn-sod). Diet and infection interaction down-regulated the transcription levels of genes associated with oxidative stress response (prdx5 and gpx4) in liver. In head-kidney, GRA led to an up-regulation of genes associated with inflammation (il34, ccr9, cd33) and a down-regulation of genes related to cytokine signalling (mif, il1b, defb, a2m, myd88). Additionally, bacterial infection up-regulated immunoglobulins production (IgMs) and down-regulated the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide leap2 in head kidney.

We aimed to study the fate of HCV-specific CD4 T cells after viral elimination.HCV-specific CD4 T cell responses were longitudinally analyzed using MHC class II tetramer-technology, multicolor flow cytometry and RNA sequencing in a cohort of chronically HCV-infected patients undergoing therapy with direct-acting antivirals. In addition, HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies and CXCL13 levels were analyzed.We observed that the frequency of HCV-specific CD4 T cells increased within two weeks after initiation of DAA therapy. Multicolor flow cytometry revealed a downregulation of exhaustion and activation markers and an upregulation of memory-associated markers. While cells with a Th1 phenotype were the predominant subset at baseline, cells with phenotypic and transcriptional characteristics of follicular T helper cells increasingly shaped the circulating HCV-specific CD4 T cell repertoire, suggesting antigen-independent survival of this subset. These changes were accompanied by a decline of HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies and the germinal center activity.We identified a population of HCV-specific CD4 T cells with a follicular T helper cell signature that is maintained after therapy-induced elimination of persistent infection and may constitute an important target population for vaccination efforts to prevent re-infection and immunotherapeutic approaches for persistent viral infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686988>IL-37 Plays a Beneficial Role in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Interleukin-37 (IL-37) acts as an inhibitor of innate and adaptive . However, the exact role of IL-37 in the patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains to be elucidated.Patients were classified into 4 groups: normal coronary artery (NCA), stable angina (SA), unstable angina (UA), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The circulating Treg, Th1, and Th17 frequencies were measured. The effect of IL-37 on stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the influence of IL-37 on DCs were explored. In addition, the role of IL-37-treated tDCs on Treg cell expansion and the stability of these tDCs were also tested.Our results showed that the circulating Treg frequencies were decreased, while Th1 and Th17 frequencies were increased in ACS patients, and that IL-37 expanded Tregs but suppressed Th1 and Th17 cells in activated PBMCs derived from ACS patients. Of note, IL-37-treated human DCs obtained a tolerogenic phenotype, and such tDCs promoted expansion of Tregs and decreased the Th1 and Th17 populations when cocultured with CD4 T cells. Interestingly, IL-37-treated DCs from patients with ACS are phenotypically and functionally comparable to IL-37-treated DCs from NCA patients, and tolerogenic properties of IL-37-treated DCs were highly stable.In conclusion, our results reveal a beneficial role of IL-37 in the patients with ACS and suggest that autologous IL-37-treated tDCs may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the patients with ACS.Copyright © 2019 Xiaobo Mao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696230>Expression profiling in exercised mdx suggests a role for extracellular proteins in the dystrophic muscle immune response.</a></h1><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle wasting disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene that lead to the absence or severe reduction of dystrophin protein in muscle. The mdx mouse, also dystrophin deficient, is the model most widely used to study the pathology and test potential therapies, but the phenotype is milder than human DMD. This limits the magnitude and range of histological damage parameters and molecular changes that can be measured in pre-clinical drug testing. We used three weeks of voluntary wheel running to exacerbate the mdx phenotype. In mdx mice voluntary exercise increased the amount of damaged necrotic tissue and macrophage infiltration. Global gene expression profiling revealed that exercise induced additional and larger gene expression changes in mdx mice and the pathways most impacted by exercise were all related to immune function or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. When we compared the matrisome and inflammation genes that were dysregulated in mdx with those commonly differentially expressed in DMD, we found the exercised mdx molecular signature more closely resembled that of DMD. These gene expression changes in the exercised mdx model thus provide more scope to assess the effects of pre-clinical treatments. Our gene profiling comparisons also highlighted upregulation of extracellular matrix proteins involved in innate  pathways, proteases that can release them, and downstream receptors and signalling molecules in exercised mdx and DMD, suggesting that the ECM could be a major source of pro-inflammatory molecules that trigger and maintain the immune response in dystrophic muscle.© The Author(s) 2019.

While the genetic basis of variation in immune responses have been investigated in these systems, there is a poor understanding of how genetic variation influences  in natural, untreated populations living in complex environments. Here, we examine the genetic architecture of variation in immune traits in the Soay sheep of St Kilda, an unmanaged population of sheep infected with strongyle gastrointestinal nematodes. We assayed IgA, IgE and IgG antibodies against the prevalent nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta in the blood plasma of > 3,000 sheep collected over 26 years. Antibody levels were significantly heritable (h2 = 0.21 to 0.57) and highly stable over an individual's lifespan. IgA levels were strongly associated with a region on chromosome 24 explaining 21.1% and 24.5% of heritable variation in lambs and adults, respectively. This region was adjacent to two candidate loci, Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator (CIITA) and C-Type Lectin Domain Containing 16A (CLEC16A). Lamb IgA levels were also associated with the immunoglobulin heavy constant loci (IGH) complex, and adult IgE levels and lamb IgA and IgG levels were associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This study provides evidence of high heritability of a complex immunological trait under natural conditions and provides the first evidence from a genome-wide study that large effect genes located outside the MHC region exist for immune traits in the wild.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694037>Effect of Andrographolide and Its Analogs on Bacterial Infection: A Review.</a></h1><p>Bacterial infections remain the leading cause of death in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients.

The research was carried out on 28 cows with clinical endometritis. Animals were divided into four groups, each composed of seven cows, depending on the i.u. preparation used: Group A, cefapirin; Group B, methisoprinol; Group C, cefapirin and methisoprinol simultaneously; and a control group-without medication. The study was performed using flow cytometry method. Summarizing the results of the research, i.u. infusion of cefapirin caused a weakening of the effector phase of the local uterine immune response; however, it enhanced leukocyte chemotaxis and antigen presentation. After i.u. administration of methisoprinol, the stimulation of specific uterine  mechanisms was mainly observed. The use of both mentioned preparations showed the strengthening of specific uterine immunological mechanisms presumably caused by methisoprinol, despite the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic. Intrauterine use of immunostimulatory substances can improve the effectiveness of the endometritis treatment in cows by improving specific local mechanisms of uterine . As a consequence, it may enhance the effector function of immune competent cells and finally eliminate inflammation.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685310>Regulatory innate lymphoid cells suppress innate  and reduce renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.</a></h1><p>Innate lymphoid cells are a recently recognized group of immune cells with critical roles in tissue homeostasis and inflammation. Regulatory innate lymphoid cells are a newly identified subset of innate lymphoid cells, which play a suppressive role in the innate immune response, favoring the resolution of intestinal inflammation. However, the expression and role of regulatory innate lymphoid cells in kidney has not been reported. Here, we show that regulatory innate lymphoid cells are present in both human and mouse kidney, express similar surface markers and form a similar proportion of total kidney innate lymphoid cells. Regulatory innate lymphoid cells from kidney were expanded in vitro with a combination of IL-2, IL-7 and transforming growth factor-β. These cells exhibited immunosuppressive effects on innate immune cells via secretion of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β. Moreover, treatment with IL-2/IL-2 antibody complexes (IL-2C) promoted expansion of regulatory innate lymphoid cells in vivo, and prevent renal ischemia/reperfusion injury in Rag-/- mice that lack adaptive immune cells including Tregs. Depletion of regulatory innate lymphoid cells with anti-CD25 antibody abolished the beneficial effects of IL-2C in the Rag-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded regulatory innate lymphoid cells improved renal function and attenuated histologic damage when given before or after induction of ischemia/reperfusion injury in association with reduction of neutrophil infiltration and induction of reparative M2 macrophages in kidney. Thus, our study shows that regulatory innate lymphoid cells suppress innate renal inflammation and ischemia/reperfusion injury.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

Most pathogenic viruses encode proteins that interfere with the activation of host innate immune responses. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV interferes with the expression of interferon (IFN) genes and inhibits IFN-induced antiviral responses. ZIKV infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-λ1 is an important antiviral molecule. In this study, we analyzed the effects of ZIKV proteins on the activation of IFN-λ1 promoter. All ZIKV proteins were cloned and transiently expressed. ZIKV NS5, but no other ZIKV protein, was able to interfere with the RIG-I signaling pathway. This inhibition took place upstream of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) resulting in reduced phosphorylation of IRF3 and reduced activation of IFN-λ1 promoter. Furthermore, we showed that ZIKV NS5 interacts with the protein kinase IKKε, which is likely critical to the observed inhibition of phosphorylation of IRF3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682447>Biodegradable Mesoporous Silica Achieved via Carbon Nanodots-Incorporated Framework Swelling for Debris-mediated Photothermal Synergistic Immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Incorporating carbon nanodots (CD) into mesoporous silica framework for extensive biomedicine, especially for the desirable cancer immunotherapy, is considered to be an unexplored challenge. Herein, a hydrogen bond/electrostatic-assisted co-assembly strategy was smartly exploited to uniformly incorporate polymer-coated CD into ordered mesoporous silica framework (CD@MSN). The obtained CD@MSN were not only biodegradable via the framework-incorporated CD-induced swelling, but also capable of gathering dispersive CD with enhanced photothermal effect and elevated targeting accumulation, which therefore can achieve photothermal imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) in vitro and in vivo. Much interestingly, benefiting from the biodegraded debris, it was found that CD@MSN-mediated PTT can synergistically achieve immune-mediated inhibition of tumor metastasis via stimulating the proliferation and activation of NK cells and macrophages, and simultaneously up-regulating the secretion of corresponding cytokines (IFN-γ and Granzyme B). This work proposed an unusual synthesis of biodegradable mesoporous silica and provided an innovative insight into the biodegradable nanoparticles-associated anticancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683003>Dietary administration of PVC and PE microplastics produces histological damage, oxidative stress and immunoregulation in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.).</a></h1><p>Worldwide, plastic waste is increasingly being discharged into the oceans, where it breaks down into smaller particles. Of these particles, the ingestion of microplastics (MPs; particles smaller than 5 mm) have been documented in some aquatic animals, including fish, whose health and welfare suffer as a consequence. However, their precise effects are not completely understood. To shed light on this issue, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) specimens were fed diets containing 0 (control), 100 or 500 mg polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyethylene (PE) MPs kg diet for three weeks, after which samples of liver, intestine, skin mucus and head kidney (HK) were obtained. A histological study of the liver and intestine revealed important alterations in the fish fed the MP diets, compared with control fish. At a functional level, PE-MPs, but not PVC-MPs, decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, suggesting a certain level of oxidative stress. As regards , the intake of PVC-MPs increased the phagocytic and respiratory burst activities of HK leucocytes whilst the intake of PE-MPs increased skin mucus immunoglobulin M levels and the respiratory burst activity of leucocytes. The results suggest that the short-medium term intake of PVC- or PE-MPs by fish slightly depresses their  and produces oxidative stress. However, based on the histological alterations found, it seems that longer exposure times might lead to irreversible damage that could compromise fish health and welfare.Copyright © 2019.

Preventing infections is becoming increasingly important, as frontline antibiotics become less effective and frequently induce recurrence by disrupting intestinal microbiota. The clinically most advanced vaccine approaches prevent symptoms once C. difficile infection is established by inducing  to secreted clostridial cytotoxins. However, they do not inhibit bacterial colonization and thereby favor asymptomatic carriage. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the C. difficile surface glycans PS-I, PS-II, and PS-III are immunogenic and serve as basis for colonization-preventing vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that glycoconjugate vaccine candidates based on synthetic oligosaccharides protected mice from infections with two different C. difficile strains. Four synthetic antigens, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were conjugated to CRM197, a carrier protein used in commercial vaccines. The vaccine candidates induced glycan-specific antibodies in mice and substantially limited C. difficile colonization and colitis after experimental infection. The glycoconjugates ameliorated intestinal pathology more substantially than a toxin-targeting vaccine. Colonization of the gut by C. difficile was selectively inhibited while intestinal microbiota remained preserved. Passive transfer experiments with anti-PS-I serum revealed that protection is mediated by specific anti-glycan antibodies, however, cell-mediated  likely also contributed to protection in vivo. Thus, glycoconjugate vaccines against C. difficile are a complementary approach to toxin-targeting strategies and are advancing through preclinical work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693760>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 and lysosomal dyshomeostasis in Parkinson disease.</a></h1><p>Over the last two decades, a number of studies have underlined the importance of lysosomal-based degradative pathways in maintaining the homeostasis of post-mitotic cells, and revealed the remarkable contribution of a functional autophagic machinery in the promotion of longevity. In contrast, defects in the clearance of organelles and aberrant protein aggregates have been linked to accelerated neuronal loss and neurological dysfunction. Several neurodegenerative disorders, among which Alzheimer disease (AD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to name a few, are associated with alterations of the autophagy and endo-lysosomal pathways. In Parkinson disease (PD), the most prevalent genetic determinant, Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), is believed to be involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle traffic, autophagy and lysosomal function. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms by which LRRK2 regulates lysosomal-based degradative pathways in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and discuss the impact of pathogenic PD mutations in contributing to lysosomal dyshomeostasis.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694153>Let-7f: A New Potential Circulating Biomarker Identified by miRNA Profiling of Cells Isolated from Human Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.</a></h1><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a progressive vascular disease responsible for 1-4% of the deaths in elderly men. This study aimed to characterize specific microRNA (miRNA) expression in aneurysmal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages in order to identify circulating miRNAs associated with AAA. We screened 850 miRNAs in aneurysmal SMCs, M1 and M2 macrophages, and in control SMCs isolated by micro-dissection from aortic biopsies using microarray analysis. In all, 92 miRNAs were detected and 10 miRNAs were selected for validation by qRT-PCR in isolated cells ( = 5), whole control and aneurysmal aorta biopsies ( = 13), and plasma from patients ( = 24) undergoing AAA (over 50 mm) repair matched to patients ( = 18) with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with atherosclerosis but not AAA. Seven miRNAs were modulated similarly in all aneurysmal cells. The Let-7f was downregulated in aneurysmal cells compared to control SMCs with a significant lower expression in M1 compared to M2 macrophages (0.1 fold,  = 0.03), correlated with a significant downregulation in whole aneurysmal aorta compared to control aorta (0.2 fold,  = 0.03). Significant levels of circulating let-7f ( = 0.048) were found in AAA patients compared to PAD patients with no significant correlation with aortic diameter ( = 0.03). Our study underlines the utility of profiling isolated aneurysmal cells to identify other miRNAs for which the modulation of expression might be masked when the whole aorta is used. The results highlight let-7f as a new potential biomarker for AAA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692913>Superinfection of hepatitis A virus in hepatocytes infected with hepatitis B virus.</a></h1><p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis including acute liver failure. Hepatitis B infection (HBV) occurs worldwide, with the highest rates in Asian and African countries, and there are several reports that HAV infection may have a more severe clinical course in patients with chronic HBV infection. We previously demonstrated that Japanese miso extracts have inhibitory effects on HAV replication. In the present study, we examined the replication of HAV and HBV in a hepatocyte superinfection model and the inhibitory effects of Japanese miso extracts on both viruses. According to the results, HAV infection inhibited HBV replication in superinfected hepatocytes, and Japanese rice-koji miso extracts had inhibitory effects on HAV replication. Our findings provide useful information for clinicians in managing HAV infection in patients with chronic HBV infection.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695701>Antigen Sampling -Expressing Epithelial Cells Are the Functional Equivalents of Mammalian M Cells in the Avian Follicle-Associated Epithelium.</a></h1><p>The follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) is a specialized structure that samples luminal antigens and transports them into mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). In mammals, transcytosis of antigens across the gut epithelium is performed by a subset of FAE cells known as M cells. Here we show that colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is expressed by a subset of cells in the avian bursa of Fabricius FAE. Expression was initially detected using a -reporter transgene that also label subsets of bursal macrophages. Immunohistochemical detection using a specific monoclonal antibody confirmed abundant expression of CSF1R on the basolateral membrane of FAE cells. -transgene expressing bursal FAE cells were enriched for expression of markers previously reported as putative M cell markers, including annexin A10 and CD44. They were further distinguished from a population of -transgene negative epithelial cells within FAE by high apical F-actin expression and differential staining with the lectins jacalin, PHA-L and SNA. Bursal FAE cells that express the -reporter transgene were responsible for the bulk of FAE transcytosis of labeled microparticles in the size range 0.02-0.1 μm. Unlike mammalian M cells, they did not readily take up larger bacterial sized microparticles (0.5 μm). Their role in uptake of bacteria was tested using , which can enter via M cells in mammals. Labeled  serovar Typhimurium entered bursal tissue via the FAE. Entry was partially dependent upon Type III secretion system-1. However, the majority of invading bacteria were localized to -negative FAE cells and in resident phagocytes that express the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4. -expressing FAE cells in infected follicles showed evidence of cell death and shedding into the bursal lumen. In mammals, CSF1R expression in the gut is restricted to macrophages which only indirectly control M cell differentiation. The novel expression of CSF1R in birds suggests that these functional equivalents to mammalian M cells may have different ontological origins and their development and function are likely to be regulated by different growth factors.Copyright © 2019 Balic, Chintoan-Uta, Vohra, Sutton, Cassady-Cain, Hu, Donaldson, Stevens, Mabbott, Hume, Sang and Vervelde.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683605>Genome Maintenance Proteins Modulate Autoimmunity Mediated Primed Adaptation by the  Type I-E CRISPR-Cas System.</a></h1><p>Bacteria and archaea use CRISPR-Cas adaptive  systems to interfere with viruses, plasmids, and other mobile genetic elements. During the process of adaptation, CRISPR-Cas systems acquire  by incorporating short fragments of invaders' genomes into CRISPR arrays. The acquisition of fragments of host genomes leads to autoimmunity and may drive chromosomal rearrangements, negative cell selection, and influence bacterial evolution. In this study, we investigated the role of proteins involved in genome stability maintenance in spacer acquisition by the  type I-E CRISPR-Cas system targeting its own genome. We show here, that the deletion of  decreases adaptation efficiency and affects accuracy of spacers incorporation into CRISPR array. Primed adaptation efficiency is also dramatically inhibited in double mutants lacking  and  but not in single mutants suggesting independent involvement and redundancy of RecBCD and SbcCD pathways in spacer acquisition. While the presence of at least one of two complexes is crucial for efficient primed adaptation, RecBCD and SbcCD affect the pattern of acquired spacers. Overall, our data suggest distinct roles of the RecBCD and SbcCD complexes and of RecJ in spacer precursor selection and insertion into CRISPR array and highlight the functional interplay between CRISPR-Cas systems and host genome maintenance mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694387>Dietary mycotoxins exposure and child growth, immune system, morbidity, and mortality: a systematic literature review.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to systematically review associations between dietary mycotoxins exposure and child growth and morbidity of children aged 5 years or younger. Peer-reviewed literature was searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Experimental and observational studies were considered. The exposures were dietary mycotoxins during pregnancy, lactation and childhood, and mycotoxins concentrations in the diet, breast milk, urine, and blood. From a total of 4869 references, 86 full-text papers were extracted of which 50 were included in this review. The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated and quality of the collective evidence was assessed using GRADE. Uncertainty remains whether mycotoxins exposure affects child growth,  and mortality and the overall quality of the evidence is very low. Overall however, we cannot rule out a possible association between dietary mycotoxins, in particular, AF and FUM and child malnutrition. Our analyses were limited by the reporting quality, difference in findings, heterogeneity of outcomes, mycotoxins detection methods, and the observational nature of most studies. Robust study designs with adequate sample size, use of validated biomarkers of exposure and assessment of co-occurrence of mycotoxins and their synergistic effects are required to provide the further evidence regarding a potential effect of dietary mycotoxins exposure on child growth and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694973>Bacterial load of  in the posterior oropharynx, tonsillar fossae and saliva among gay and bisexual men with untreated oropharyngeal chlamydia.</a></h1><p> The aim of this study was to determine whether  (CT) could be detected in saliva and if infection is specific to an anatomical site in the oropharynx. Men who have sex with men (MSM) who were diagnosed with oropharyngeal chlamydia at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre in 2017-2018 were invited to participate upon returning for treatment. Swabs at the tonsillar fossae, posterior oropharynx, and a saliva sample were collected. Throat samples were tested for CT by Aptima Combo 2 assay. The bacterial loads of CT in all samples were assessed by qPCR detecting the  gene. We calculated the positivity and bacterial load of CT for all samples. Forty-two MSM were included. Median age was 28 (interquartile range [IQR]:24-33). 32 participants (76.2%; 95%CI:60.5% to 87.9%) had CT detected by qPCR at both the tonsillar fossae and the posterior oropharynx, followed by 9.5% (n=4; 95%CI:2.7% to 22.6%) positive at the posterior oropharynx only, and 4.8% (n=2; 95%CI:0.58% to 16.2%) positive at the tonsillar fossae only. Twenty-nine MSM had CT detected in saliva (69.0%; 95%CI:52.9% to 82.3%). The median CT load in saliva was 446 copies/ml (IQR:204-1,390), in the tonsillar fossae was 893 copies/swab (IQR:390-13,224), and in posterior oropharynx was 1,204 copies/swab (IQR:330-16,211). There was no significant difference in CT load between the tonsillar fossae and the posterior oropharynx (p=0.119).

Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 diabetes. While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix metabolism, no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of βTC6, a pancreatic β-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683000>A Kruppel-like factor from Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrKLF) involved in innate  against pathogen infection.</a></h1><p>Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) belong to a family of zinc finger-containing transcription factors that are widely present in eukaryotes.

Lack of effective point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests applicable in resources-limited endemic areas is a critical barrier to effective treatment and control of leishmaniasis. The development of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has provided a new tool towards the development of a POC diagnostic test based on the amplification of pathogen DNA. LAMP does not require a thermocycler, is relatively inexpensive, and is simple to perform with high amplification sensitivity and specificity. In this review, we discuss the current technical developments, applications, diagnostic performance, challenges, and future of LAMP for molecular diagnosis and surveillance of Leishmania parasites. Studies employing the LAMP assay to diagnose human leishmaniasis have reported sensitivities of 80% to 100% and specificities of 94% to 100%.

The lentiviral vector that overexpresses or knockdown GM16343 was constructed, transfected into CD8T cells, and stimulated with interleukin 36β, and the amount of interferon γ secreted was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A mouse subcutaneous xenograft model that stably express interleukin 36β was established, and the tumor size and mouse survival time were observed by stimulation with CD8T cells overexpression or knockdown of GM16343.A total of 12 long noncoding RNAs with significant differences were screened by gene chip analysis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the difference in GM16343 was larger, and the difference between the groups was observed to be the most significant. Compared to control group, CD8T cells overexpressing GM16343 increased the secretion of interferon γ, and the tumor diameter of the mice after stimulation showed significant reduction, and the survival time showed significant prolongation. Compared to control group, the CD8T cells after GM16343 were knocked down.

The aim of this study was to explore whether the complement response to Streptococcus pneumoniae differed according to CD status, and could serve as an explanation for the excess risk of IPD in CD. Twenty-two children with CD and 18 controls, born 1999-2008, were included at Kalmar County Hospital, Sweden. The degree of complement activation was evaluated by comparing levels of activation products C3a and sC5b-9 in plasma incubated for 30 min with Streptococcus pneumoniae and in non-incubated plasma. Complement analyses were performed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pneumococcal stimulation caused a statistically significant increase in C3a as well as sC5b-9 in both children with CD and controls but there was no difference in response between the groups. After incubation, C3a increased on average 4.6 times and sC5b-9 22 times in both the CD and the control group (p = 0.497 and p = 0.724 respectively).Conclusion: Complement response to Streptococcus pneumoniae seems to be similar in children with and without CD and is thus unlikely to contribute to the increased susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal disease in CD. What is Known: • An excess risk of pneumococcal infections has been demonstrated in individuals with celiac disease. • Infectious complications can depend on hyposplenism but alternative mechanisms are sparsely examined. What is New: • Complement activation in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae was examined in children with and without celiac disease but no differences could be demonstrated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685302>IL-10-producing regulatory B cells and plasmocytes: Molecular mechanisms and disease relevance.</a></h1><p>It has long been assumed that the functions of B cells reflected the roles of antibodies. However, B cells also decisively influence  via antibody-independent mechanisms including the presentation of antigen to T cells and the secretion of cytokines. In fact, B cell depletion therapy improves the course of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis by removing pro-inflammatory cytokine-producing B cells rather than by reducing autoantibody levels. Remarkably, B cells can also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, and subsequently suppress , providing protection from autoimmune diseases while interfering with beneficial responses against pathogens and cancers. A major mediator of this B cell regulatory function is their secretion of IL-10. There is considerable interest in identifying the mechanisms inducing the expression of IL-10 in B cells during the course of their activation. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms controlling IL-10 expression in B cells, and the evidence that IL-10-producing B cells play a protective role in human autoimmune diseases, underlying the relevance of this immunosuppressive axis for therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Management should be straightforward but appears not to be the case. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine monotherapy is the standard treatment which is effective in the majority of cases. However, 10-15% of patients established on levothyroxine do not feel their health is entirely restored and some patients prefer the addition of liothyronine. Proponents of liothyronine argue that the ratio of T3 and T4 hormones is substantially altered on T4 monotherapy and therefore both hormones may be needed for optimal health. This remains controversial as clinical trials have not demonstrated superiority of combination therapy (levothyroxine and liothyronine) over levothyroxine monotherapy. There is now a pressing need for further studies and in particular randomized controlled trials in this area. To help design and facilitate dedicated trials and better understand thyroid hormone replacement, this review summarizes the evidence where there is established knowledge and agreement (knowns) and areas where research is lacking (unknowns). Agreements include the extent of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine monotherapy, biases in testing for hypothyroidism and prescribing levothyroxine, as well as variable thresholds for prescribing levothyroxine and challenges in liothyronine dosing. The review will also highlight and summarize the unknowns including the long-term safety profile of liothyronine, and potential biomarkers to identify individuals who might benefit most from combination therapy.Copyright © 2019 Taylor, Eligar, Muller, Scholz, Dayan and Okosieme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696443>Effect of azadirachtin on mortality and immune response of leaf-cutting ants.</a></h1><p>Leaf-cutting ants are difficult pests to control because they have numerous defense strategies and are highly selective in their plant harvesting choices. The search for effective pest control methods that have minimal negative effects on the environment has been continuous. Azadirachtin, a compound extracted from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), is a promising alternative for the control of various pests, as it is toxic to some insects but readily degrades in the environment. In this study, we evaluated the effects of azadirachtin on the mortality, through topical exposure to the compound, and immune response, by introducing an artificial antigen into leaf-cutting ants Atta sexdens and Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus. Azadirachtin caused death to minor and major workers of both species in a concentration-dependent manner. Topical application of the compound did not diminish the immune response of ants in a microfilament encapsulation assay. Azadirachtin showed no effect on the immune response of workers but increased worker mortality, which indicates its potential as an ant control agent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688457>Platelets as key players in inflammation and infection.</a></h1><p>This review highlights recent insights into the role of platelets in acute inflammation and infection.Platelets exhibit intravascular crawling behavior and can collect and bundle bacteria. In addition, platelets are key in promoting intravascular thrombus formation in infection, a process termed 'immunothrombosis', which contributes to pathogen containment, but also potentially damages the host. Platelets are at the nexus of leukocyte recruitment and activation, yet they are at the same time crucial in preventing inflammation-associated hemorrhage and tissue damage. This multitasking requires specific receptors and pathways, depending on stimulus, organ and effector function.New findings highlight the complex interplay of innate , coagulation and platelets in inflammation and infection, and unravel novel molecular pathways and effector functions. These offer new potential therapeutic approaches, but require further extensive research to distinguish treatable proinflammatory from host-protective pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691927>Nutrition and Athlete Immune Health: New Perspectives on an Old Paradigm.</a></h1><p>Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections limit an athlete's availability to train and compete. To better understand how sick an athlete will become when they have an infection, a paradigm recently adopted from ecological immunology is presented that includes the concepts of immune resistance (the ability to destroy microbes) and immune tolerance (the ability to dampen defence yet control infection at a non-damaging level). This affords a new theoretical perspective on how nutrition may influence athlete immune health; paving the way for focused research efforts on tolerogenic nutritional supplements to reduce the infection burden in athletes. Looking through this new lens clarifies why nutritional supplements targeted at improving immune resistance in athletes show limited benefits: evidence supporting the old paradigm of immune suppression in athletes is lacking. Indeed, there is limited evidence that the dietary practices of athletes suppress , e.g. low-energy availability and train- or sleep-low carbohydrate. It goes without saying, irrespective of the dietary preference (omnivorous, vegetarian), that athletes are recommended to follow a balanced diet to avoid a frank deficiency of a nutrient required for proper immune function. The new theoretical perspective provided sharpens the focus on tolerogenic nutritional supplements shown to reduce the infection burden in athletes, e.g. probiotics, vitamin C and vitamin D. Further research should demonstrate the benefits of candidate tolerogenic supplements to reduce infection in athletes; without blunting training adaptations and without side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682998>Spleen melanomacrophage centers response of Nile tilapia during Aeromanas hydrophila and Mycobacterium marinum infections.</a></h1><p>In order to understand the pathophysiology of melanomcrophage centers (MMCs) formation during the tilapia defense response to bacterial infections, the present study evaluated the response, in terms of area, number and pigment constitution, of splenic MMCs of Oreochromis niloticus subjected to intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with Aeromonas hydrophila and Mycobacterium marinum. Eighty-four fish (396.9 ± 21.0 g) were randomly distributed into twelve plastic tanks (300 L), to constitute three treatments with 28 animals each: control group (inoculated with PBS); Infected with A. hydrophila (1 × 10 UFC mL); Infected with M. marinum (1 × 10 UFC mL). The spleen was collected in seven fish per treatment on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st day post-infection (DPI). The results revealed the participation of MMCs in the defense response of tilapia during bacterial infection by A. hydrophila and M. marinum, since there was an increase in the number and size of these cell aggregates. Variation of pigment accumulation with significant increase of hemosiderin, in infected tilapias by A. hydrophila, bacteria responsible for causing hemolytic anemia in fish was also found. On the other hand, M. marinum-infected tilapia had high amount of melanin in MMCs. In general, mycobacterial infections are notoriously difficult to treat, being characterized as a chronic disease. These findings demonstrate different strategies of fish response during the evolution of these bacterial diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The viral oncoprotein Tax triggers this constitutive activation by interacting with the ubiquitin-rich IKK complex. We previously demonstrated that Optineurin and TAX1BP1, two members of the ubiquitin-binding, Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM-1/p62)-like selective autophagy receptor family, are involved in Tax-mediated NF-κB signaling. Here, using a proximity-dependent biotinylation approach (BioID), we identify p62 as a new candidate partner of Tax and confirm the interaction in infected T cells. We then demonstrate that p62 knock-out in MEF cells as well as p62 knock-down in HEK293T cells significantly reduces Tax-mediated NF-κB activity. We further show that although p62 knock-down does not alter NF-κB activation in Jurkat T cells nor in infected T cells, p62 does potentiate Tax-mediated NF-κB activity upon over-expression in Jurkat T cells. We next show that p62 associates with the Tax/IKK signalosome in cells, and identify the 170-206 domain of p62 as sufficient for the direct, ubiquitin-independent interaction with Tax. However, we observe that this domain is dispensable for modulating Tax activity in cells, and functional analysis of p62 mutants indicates that p62 could potentiate Tax activity in cells by facilitating the association of ubiquitin chains with the Tax/IKK signalosome. Altogether, our results identify p62 as a new ubiquitin-dependent modulator of Tax activity on NF-κB, further highlighting the importance of ubiquitin in the signaling activity of the viral Tax oncoprotein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683847>The Roles of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in Avian Response to Viral Infection and Pathogenesis of Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases.</a></h1><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs that play important roles in the regulation of various biological processes including cell development and differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, immunoregulation and viral infections. Avian immunosuppressive diseases refer to those avian diseases caused by pathogens that target and damage the immune organs or cells of the host, increasing susceptibility to other microbial infections and the risk of failure in subsequent vaccination against other diseases. As such, once a disease with an immunosuppressive feature occurs in flocks, it would be difficult for the stakeholders to have an optimal economic income. Infectious bursal disease (IBD), avian leukemia (AL), Marek's disease (MD), chicken infectious anemia (CIA), reticuloendotheliosis (RE) and avian reovirus infection are on the top list of commonly-seen avian diseases with a feature of immunosuppression, posing an unmeasurable threat to the poultry industry across the globe. Understanding the pathogenesis of avian immunosuppressive disease is the basis for disease prevention and control. miRNAs have been shown to be involved in host response to pathogenic infections in chickens, including regulation of , tumorigenesis, cell proliferation and viral replication. Here we summarize current knowledge on the roles of miRNAs in avian response to viral infection and pathogenesis of avian immunosuppressive diseases, in particular, MD, AL, IBD and RE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687412>Gut Microbiota Modulation on Intestinal Mucosal Adaptive .</a></h1><p>The mammalian intestine harbors a remarkable number of microbes and their components and metabolites, which are fundamental for the instigation and development of the host immune system. The intestinal innate and adaptive  coordinate and interact with the symbionts contributing to the intestinal homeostasis through establishment of a mutually beneficial relationship by tolerating to symbiotic microbiota and retaining the ability to exert proinflammatory response towards invasive pathogens. Imbalance between the intestinal immune system and commensal organisms disrupts the intestinal microbiological homeostasis, leading to microbiota dysbiosis, compromised integrity of the intestinal barrier, and proinflammatory immune responses towards symbionts. This, in turn, exacerbates the degree of the imbalance. Intestinal adaptive  plays a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance towards symbionts and the integrity of intestinal barrier, while the innate immune system regulates the adaptive immune responses to intestinal commensal bacteria. In this review, we will summarize recent findings on the effects and mechanisms of gut microbiota on intestinal adaptive  and the plasticity of several immune cells under diverse microenvironmental settings.Copyright © 2019 Li Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691503>Effect of dietary tryptophan supplementation on growth performance, immune response and anti-oxidant status of broiler chickens from 7 to 21 days.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to investigate the optimum dietary level of tryptophan (Trp) supplementation at which broiler chickens have better growth with efficient immune system and anti-oxidant status.One hundred and twenty (n = 120) 1-day-old broiler chicks were fed a common commercial diet from days 1 to 7. On day 7, the chicks were randomly divided in three treatment groups, that is, Trp 0.2 [national research council (NRC) recommended level of tryptophan], Trp 0.3 (tryptophan supplemented at 0.3%) and Trp 0.5 (tryptophan supplemented at 0.5%). All the experimental diets were iso-caloric (ME; 3,000 kcal/kg) and iso-proteic (CP; 18.5%). Weekly data on feed intake and body weight gain (BWG) were recorded to calculate feed conversion ratio (FCR). On day 19, avian tuberculin was injected to note the cellular . On day 21, two birds per replicate were killed to determine carcass and visceral organ weights. Blood serum samples were collected for analysis of humoral immune response against sheep red blood cells, total oxidant and anti-oxidants by spectrophotometric method.Feed intake, carcass and visceral organ weights remained unaffected by dietary treatments while BWG and FCR tended to improve (p < .05) in broiler chicks fed the Trp 0.3 and the Trp 0.5 diets. Total oxidant status was also improved (p < .05) in broiler chicks fed the Trp 0.5 diet. Likewise, broiler chicks fed the Trp 0.3 and the Trp 0.5 diets tended to have better (p < .05) total anti-oxidant status, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and arylesterase (ARE). The overall antibodies response and IgG improved (p < .05) by the Trp 0.3 and Trp 0.5 diets compared to control. However, IgM level remained similar across the treatment. The cellular  against avian tuberculin improved at 24 hr post-injection but its effect disappeared at 48 hr.The results of present study revealed that Trp above the NRC recommended level may give better growth, immune response and anti-oxidant status in broiler chickens.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the antiviral efficacy of IFN-I is largely restricted by negative regulators of IFN-I signaling in cells. Therefore, identification of intracellular inhibitors of IFN-I signaling is important for developing novel targets to improve IFN-I antiviral therapy. In this study, we report that the deubiquitinase USP7 negatively regulates IFN-I-mediated antiviral activity. USP7 physically interacts with SOCS1 and enhances SOCS1 protein stability by deubiquitination effects, which in turn restricts IFN-I-induced activation of JAK-STAT1 signaling. Interestingly, viral infection upregulates USP7 and therefore facilitates viral immune evasion. Importantly, USP7 small-molecule inhibitors, P5091 and P22077, inhibit SOCS1 expression and enhance IFN-I antiviral efficacy. Our findings identify a novel regulator of IFN-I antiviral activity, and reveal that USP7 inhibitors could be potential enhancement agents for improving IFN-I antiviral therapy.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687413>Tau-Reactive Endogenous Antibodies: Origin, Functionality, and Implications for the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h1><p>In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau pathology manifested by the accumulation of intraneuronal tangles and soluble toxic oligomers emerges as a promising therapeutic target. Multiple anti-tau antibodies inhibiting the formation and propagation of cytotoxic tau or promoting its clearance and degradation have been tested in clinical trials, albeit with the inconclusive outcome. Antibodies against tau protein have been documented both in the brain circulatory system and at the periphery, but their origin and role under normal conditions and in AD remain unclear. While it is tempting to assign them a protective role in regulating tau level and removal of toxic variants, the supportive evidence remains sporadic, requiring systematic analysis and critical evaluation. Herein, we review recent data showing the occurrence of tau-reactive antibodies in the brain and peripheral circulation and discuss their origin and significance in tau clearance. Based on the emerging evidence, we cautiously propose that impairments of tau clearance at the periphery by humoral  might aggravate the tau pathology in the central nervous system, with implication for the neurodegenerative process of AD.Copyright © 2019 Lenka Hromadkova and Saak Victor Ovsepian.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693658>Correction: ADAMTS5 Is a Critical Regulator of Virus-Specific T Cell .</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002580.].</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682796>An optimized five-color/seven-parameter flow cytometry panel for immunophenotyping guinea pig peripheral blood lymphocytes.</a></h1><p>Guinea pigs are an ideal animal model for the study of several infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, legionellosis, brucellosis, and spotted fever rickettsiosis. In comparison to the murine model, clinical signs in guinea pigs are more representative of disease in humans, the guinea pig immune system is more similar to that of the human, and their large size offers logistic advantages for sample collection while following disease progression. Unfortunately, the advantage of using guinea pigs in biomedical research, particularly in understanding the immune response to infectious agents, is limited in large part by the paucity of available reagents and lack of genetically manipulated strains. Here, we expand the utility of guinea pigs in biomedical research by establishing an optimized five-color/seven-parameter polychromatic flow cytometric assay for immunophenotyping lymphocytes. This assay fills a need for immunophenotyping peripheral blood lymphocytes and is an improvement over current published flow cytometry assays for guinea pigs. We anticipate that our approach will be an important starting point for developing new assays to evaluate the cellular immune response to infectious diseases in the guinea pig model. Importantly, we are currently using this assay for evaluating  to spotted fever rickettsiosis in a guinea pig-tick-Rickettsia system, where CD8+ T cells are a critical contributor to the immune response. Developing resources to utilize the guinea pig more effectively will enhance our ability to understand infectious diseases where the guinea pig would otherwise be the ideal model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Flow cytometry determined monocyte and T-cell phenotypes; LPS and PHA-induced cytokine production was assessed following LPS and PHA stimulation by multiplex cytokine array; plasma IL-6, soluble CD163, and soluble CD14 were measured by ELISA.Twenty-two PLHIV with OUD and 37 PLHIV without OUD were included. PLHIV with OUD exhibited higher frequencies of intermediate (CD14CD16) and nonclassical (CD14CD16) monocytes when compared with PLHIV without OUD (P = 0.0025; P = 0.0001, respectively), regardless of HEP co-infection. Soluble CD163 and monocyte cell surface CD163 expression was increased among PLHIV with OUD and HEP, specifically. Regardless of HEP co-infection, PLHIV with OUD exhibited reduced production of IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha in response to LPS when compared with PLHIV without OUD; PHA-induced production of IL-10, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were also reduced among individuals with OUD.OUD among PLHIV are associated with altered monocyte phenotypes and a dysregulated innate cytokine response.

TP53 mutation can cause a range of changes in immune response, progression, and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, we aim to build an immunoscore prognostic model that may enhance the prognosis of CRC from an immunological perspective. We estimated the proportion of immune cells in the GSE39582 public dataset using the CIBERSORT (Cell type identification by estimating relative subset of known RNA transcripts) algorithm. Prognostic genes that were used to establish the immunoscore model were generated by the LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Cox regression model. We established and validated the immunoscore model in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohorts, respectively; significant differences of overall survival analysis were found between the low and high immunoscore groups or TP53 subgroups. In the multivariable Cox analysis, we observed that the immunoscore was an independent prognostic factor both in the GEO cohort (HR (Hazard ratio) 1.76, 95% CI (confidence intervals): 1.26-2.46) and the TCGA cohort (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.20-3.18).

We attempted to isolate this molecule, which was named dipterose-BSF, by gel-filtration and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cells as a marker of immunomodulatory activity. Dipterose-BSF had an average molecular weight of 1.47 × 10 and consisted of ten monosaccharides. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that dipterose-BSF enhanced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon β (IFNβ) in RAW264.7 cells. The inhibition of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) significantly attenuated NO production by dipterose-BSF, indicating that dipterose-BSF stimulates the induction of various cytokines in macrophages via the TLR signaling pathway. This observation was analogous with the activation of nuclear factor kappa B in RAW264.7 cells after exposure to dipterose-BSF. Our results suggest that dipterose-BSF has immunomodulatory potential through activating the host innate immune system, which allows it to be a novel immunomodulator for implementation as a functional food supplement in poultry, livestock, and farmed fish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697789>Porphyromonas gingivalis induces penetration of lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan through the gingival epithelium via degradation of junctional adhesion molecule 1.</a></h1><p>Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen in severe and chronic manifestations of periodontal disease, which is one of the most common infections of humans. A central feature of P. gingivalis pathogenicity is dysregulation of innate  at the gingival epithelial interface; however, the molecular basis underlying P. gingivalis-dependent abrogation of epithelial barrier function remains unknown. Gingival epithelial cells express junctional adhesion molecule (JAM1), a tight junction-associated protein, and JAM1 homodimers regulate epithelial barrier function. Here we show that Arg-specific or Lys-specific cysteine proteases (gingipains) secreted by P. gingivalis can specifically degrade JAM1 at K134 and R234 in gingival epithelial cells, resulting in permeability of the gingival epithelium to 40 kDa dextran, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and proteoglycan (PGN). A P. gingivalis strain lacking gingipains was impaired in degradation of JAM1. Knockdown of JAM1 in monolayer cells and a three-dimensional multilayered tissue model also increased permeability to LPS, PGN, and gingipains. Inversely, overexpression of JAM1 in epithelial cells prevented penetration by these agents following P. gingivalis infection. Our findings strongly suggest that P. gingivalis gingipains disrupt barrier function of stratified squamous epithelium via degradation of JAM1, allowing bacterial virulence factors to penetrate into subepithelial tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694900>Low temperature enhances plant  via salicylic acid pathway genes that are repressed by ethylene.</a></h1><p>Temperature has a large impact on plant immune responses.

This enhancement is dependent on SA signaling and is accompanied by upregulation of multiple SA biosynthesis and signaling genes at lower temperature. SA signaling is repressed by jasmonic acid and ethylene at both normal and low temperatures. The inhibition of SA biosynthesis by ethylene, while mainly through ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1/SALICYLIC ACID-INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2 (ICS1/SID2) at normal temperature, is through ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY5 (EDS5)/SID1, ICS2, and ICS1/SID2 at lower temperature.

Severe diarrhea is recognized as the leading cause of mortality for children below 5 years of age in developing countries. The only approved treatment against cryptosporidiosis, nitazoxanide, has limited efficacy in the most vulnerable patient populations, including malnourished children, and is ineffective in immunocompromised individuals. Here, we investigate inhibition of the parasitic cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3 (CPSF3) as a strategy to control  infection. We show that the oxaborole AN3661 selectively blocked  growth in human HCT-8 cells, and oral treatment with AN3661 reduced intestinal parasite burden in both immunocompromised and neonatal mouse models of infection with greater efficacy than nitazoxanide. Furthermore, we present crystal structures of recombinantly produced  CPSF3, revealing a mechanism of action whereby the mRNA processing activity of this enzyme is efficiently blocked by the binding of the oxaborole group at the metal-dependent catalytic center.

A current focus of anti-cancer research is harnessing the patient's own immune system for therapy. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an immune suppressor, is upregulated in various activated immune cells, such as T cells, and in viral infections and tumors.The objective of this study was to investigate the function of PD-1 inhibitor on the metastasisi of mouse colon cancer cells.In the present study, we established an in situ colon cancer mouse model using the CT26 cell line. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed to detect colon cancer cell metastasis. The levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD44 CD62L memory T cells, CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen were detected by flow cytometry (FCM).We found that anti-PD-1 therapy inhibited colon cancer cells metastasis to the small intestine, liver, and lung, and lengthened the survival time of mice. However, the depletion of CD8 suppressed the activity of anti-PD-1 antibodies. In response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were significantly increased, while IL-6, IL-17, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were decreased. CD8 depletion had the opposite effect. In addition, anti-PD-1 treatment significantly increased CD44 CD62L memory T cells, decreased CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 treatment cannot exert these roles when CD8 is depleted.These results suggest that PD-1 inhibitors rely on CD8+ T cells to exert anti-tumor  in colon cancer.© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698082>Inhibition of immune pathway-initiating hemolymph protease-14 by Manduca sexta serpin-12, a conserved mechanism for the regulation of melanization and Toll activation in insects.</a></h1><p>A network of serine proteases (SPs) and their non-catalytic homologs (SPHs) activates prophenoloxidase (proPO), Toll pathway, and other insect immune responses. However, integration and conservation of the network and its control mechanisms have not yet been fully understood. Here we present evidence that these responses are initiated through a conserved serine protease and negatively regulated by serpins in two species, Manduca sexta and Anopheles gambiae. We have shown that M. sexta serpin-12 reduces the proteolytic activation of HP6, HP8, proPO activating proteases (PAPs), SPHs, and POs in larval hemolymph, and we hypothesized that these effects are due to the inhibition of the immune pathway-initiating protease HP14. To test whether these changes are due to HP14 inhibition, we isolated a covalent complex of HP14 with serpin-12 from plasma using polyclonal antibodies against the HP14 protease domain or against serpin-12, and confirmed formation of the complex by 2D-electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry. Upon recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans or fungal β-1,3-glucan, the zymogen proHP14 became active HP14, which formed an SDS-stable complex with serpin-12 in vitro. Activation of proHP21 by HP14 was suppressed by serpin-12, consistent with the decrease in steps downstream of HP21, proteolytic activation of proPAP3, proSPH1/2 and proPO in hemolymph. Guided by the results of phylogenetic analysis, we cloned and expressed A. gambiae proSP217 (an ortholog of HP14) and core domains of A. gambiae serpin-11 and -17. The recombinant SP217 zymogen became active during expression, with cleavage between Tyr and Ile. Both MsHP14 and AgSP217 cleaved MsSerpin-12 and AgSRPN11 at Leu*Ser (P1*P1') and formed complexes in vitro. ProPO activation in M. sexta plasma increased after recombinant AgSP217 had been added, indicating that it may function in a similar manner as the endogenous initiating protease HP14. Based on these data, we propose that inhibition of an initiating modular protease by a serpin may be a common mechanism in holometabolous insects to regulate proPO activation and other protease-induced immune responses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We envisioned making modifications on the benzanilide scaffold of 1 resulting in a class of highly specific TLR7 inhibitors. Our efforts led to the discovery of a new TLR8 inhibitor (CU-115) and identification of a TLR7/8 dual inhibitor (CU-72), bearing a distinct diphenyl ether skeleton, with potential for TLR7 selectivity optimization. Given the role of TLR8 in auto-, we also optimized the potency of 2 and developed a new TLR8 inhibitor bearing a 1,3,4-oxadiazole motif.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697414>Globalization of Traditional Chinese Medicine: what are the issues for ensuring evidence-based diagnosis and therapy?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697400>Oligomerization of RIG-I and MDA5 2CARD Domains.</a></h1><p>The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and MDA5, are critical for host recognition of viral RNAs. These receptors contain a pair of N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD), an SF2 helicase core domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. Upon RLR activation, 2CARD associates with the CARD domain of MAVS, leading to the oligomerization of MAVS, downstream signaling and interferon induction. Unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) interacts with the 2CARD domain, and in the case of RIG-I, induce tetramer formation. However, the nature of the MDA5 2CARD signaling complex is not known. We have used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation to compare MDA5 2CARD and RIG-I 2CARD binding to polyUb and to characterize the assembly of MDA5 2CARD oligomers in the absence of polyUb. Multi-signal sedimentation velocity analysis indicates that Ub binds to RIG-I 2CARD with a 3:4 stoichiometry and cooperatively induces formation of a RIG-I 2CARD tetramer. In contrast, Ub and Ub interact with MDA5 2CARD weakly and form complexes with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometries but do not induce 2CARD oligomerization. In the absence of polyUb, MDA5 2CARD self-associates to forms large oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, RIG-I and MDA5 2CARD assembly processes are distinct. MDA5 2CARD concentration-dependent self-association, rather than polyUb binding, drives oligomerization, and MDA5 2CARD forms oligomers larger than tetramer. We propose a mechanism where MDA5 2CARD oligomers, rather than a stable tetramer, function to nucleate MAVS polymerization. This article is protected by copyright.

Pioneering work by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012 resulted in the creation of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool on the basis of this concept. The aim of this was to create a rapid, efficient, and versatile genome-editing tool to facilitate genetic manipulation. The mechanism relies on two components: the RNA guide which acts as a sentinel and a Cas protein complex which functions as a highly precise molecular knife. The guide RNA can be modified to match a DNA sequence of interest in the cell and accordingly be used to rectify mutations that may otherwise cause disease. Within a few years following the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, its usage has become ubiquitous. Its influence extends into many fields of biological sciences from biotechnology and biochemistry to molecular biology and biomedical sciences. The following review aims at shedding some light on to the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in the field of biomedical sciences, particularly gene therapy. An insight with relation to a few of the many diseases that are being tackled with the aid of the CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism and the trends, successes, and challenges of this application as a gene therapy are discussed in this review.Copyright © 2019 Odatha W.

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of JAK-STAT pathway components in regulating tumor initiation and metastatic progression, yet, the extent of how genetic alterations influence patient outcome is far from being understood.Focusing on 133 genes involved in JAK-STAT signaling, we investigated genomic, transcriptomic and clinical profiles of over 18,000 patients representing 21 diverse cancer types. We identified a core set of 28 putative gain- or loss-of-function JAK-STAT genes that correlated with survival outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Differential expression analyses between high- and low-expressing patient groups were performed to evaluate the consequences of JAK-STAT misexpression.We found that copy number alterations underpinning transcriptional dysregulation of JAK-STAT pathway genes differ within and between cancer types. Integrated analyses uniting genomic and transcriptomic datasets revealed a core set of JAK-STAT pathway genes that correlated with survival outcomes in brain, renal, lung and endometrial cancers. High JAK-STAT scores were associated with increased mortality rates in brain and renal cancers, but not in lung and endometrial cancers where hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling is a positive prognostic factor. Patients with aberrant JAK-STAT signaling demonstrated pan-cancer molecular features associated with misexpression of genes in other oncogenic pathways (Wnt, MAPK, TGF-β, PPAR and VEGF). Brain and renal tumors with hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling had increased regulatory T cell gene (Treg) expression. A combined model uniting JAK-STAT and Tregs allowed further delineation of risk groups where patients with high JAK-STAT and Treg scores consistently performed the worst.Providing a pan-cancer perspective of clinically-relevant JAK-STAT alterations, this study could serve as a framework for future research investigating anti-tumor  using combination therapy involving JAK-STAT and immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695799>STING activation in cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Cancer immunotherapy modulates and leverages the host immune system to treat cancer. The past decade has witnessed historical advancement of cancer immunotherapy. A myriad of approaches have been explored to elicit or augment anticancer innate  and/or adaptive . Recently, activation of stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), an intracellular receptor residing in the endoplasmic reticulum, has shown great potential to enhance antitumor  through the induction of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including type I IFNs. A number of natural and synthetic STING agonists have been discovered or developed, and tested in preclinical models and in the clinic for the immunotherapy of diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), such as cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), are a class of STING agonists that can elicit immune responses. However, natural CDNs are hydrophilic small molecules with negative charges and are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, leading to low bioavailability in target tissues yet unwanted toxicities and narrow therapeutic windows. Drug delivery systems, coupled with nucleic acid chemistry, have been exploited to address these challenges. Here, we will discuss the underlying immunological mechanisms and approaches to STING activation, with a focus on the delivery of STING agonists, for cancer immunotherapy.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697367>Ancient introgression between two ape malaria parasite species.</a></h1><p>The Laverania clade comprises the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum as well as at least seven additional parasite species that infect wild African apes. A recent analysis of Laverania genome sequences (Otto TD, et al. 2018. Genomes of all known members of a Plasmodium subgenus reveal paths to virulent human malaria. Nat Microbiol. 3:687-697) reported three instances of inter-species gene transfer, one of which had previously been described. Generating gene sequences from additional ape parasites and re-examining sequencing reads generated in the Otto et al. study, we identified one of the newly described gene transfers as an assembly artefact of sequences derived from a sample co-infected by two parasite species. The second gene transfer between ancestors of two divergent chimpanzee parasite lineages was confirmed, but involved a much larger number of genes than originally described, many of which encode exported proteins that remodel, or bind to, erythrocytes. Because successful hybridisation between Laverania species is very rare, it will be important to determine to what extent these gene transfers have shaped their host interactions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Females from the Anopheles gambiae species complex typically mate only once in their lifetime during which they receive sperm and seminal fluid proteins as well as a mating plug that contains the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. This hormone, which is also induced by blood-feeding, plays a major role in activating vitellogenesis for egg production. Here we show that female Anopheles coluzzii susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum infection is significantly higher in mated females compared to virgins. We also find that mating status has a major impact on the midgut transcriptome, detectable only under sugar-fed conditions: once females have blood-fed, the transcriptional changes that are induced by mating are likely masked by the widespread effects of blood-feeding on gene expression. To determine whether increased susceptibility to parasites could be driven by the additional 20E that mated females receive from males, we mimicked mating by injecting virgin females with 20E, finding that these females are significantly more susceptible to human malaria parasites than virgin females injected with the control 20E carrier. Further RNAseq was carried out to examine whether the genes that change upon 20E injection in the midgut are similar to those that change upon mating. We find that 79 midgut-expressed genes are regulated in common by both mating and 20E, and 96% (n = 76) of these are regulated in the same direction (up vs down in 20E/mated). Together, these findings show that male Anopheles mosquitoes induce changes in the female midgut that can affect female susceptibility to P. falciparum. This implies that in nature, males might contribute to malaria transmission in previously unappreciated ways, and that vector control strategies that target males may have additional benefits towards reducing transmission.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694911>A TCR β-Chain Motif Biases toward Recognition of Human CD1 Proteins.</a></h1><p>High-throughput TCR sequencing allows interrogation of the human TCR repertoire, potentially connecting TCR sequences to antigenic targets. Unlike the highly polymorphic MHC proteins, monomorphic Ag-presenting molecules such as MR1, CD1d, and CD1b present Ags to T cells with species-wide TCR motifs. CD1b tetramer studies and a survey of the 27 published CD1b-restricted TCRs demonstrated a TCR motif in humans defined by the TCR β-chain variable gene 4-1 (TRBV4-1) region. Unexpectedly, TRBV4-1 was involved in recognition of CD1b regardless of the chemical class of the carried lipid. Crystal structures of two CD1b-specific TRBV4-1 TCRs show that germline-encoded residues in CDR1 and CDR3 regions of TRBV4-1-encoded sequences interact with each other and consolidate the surface of the TCR. Mutational studies identified a key positively charged residue in TRBV4-1 and a key negatively charged residue in CD1b that is shared with CD1c, which is also recognized by TRBV4-1 TCRs. These data show that one TCR V region can mediate a mechanism of recognition of two related monomorphic Ag-presenting molecules that does not rely on a defined lipid Ag.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692435>Gut-Amygdala Interactions in Autism Spectrum Disorders: Developmental Roles via regulating Mitochondria, Exosomes,  and microRNAs.</a></h1><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have long been conceived as a developmental disorder. A growing body of data highlights a role for alterations in the gut in the pathoetiology and/or pathophysiology of ASD. Recent work shows alterations in the gut microbiome to have a significant impact on amygdala development in infancy, suggesting that the alterations in the gut microbiome may act to modulate not only amygdala development but how the amygdala modulates the development of the frontal cortex and other brain regions.This article reviews wide bodies of data pertaining to the developmental roles of the maternal and foetal gut and immune systems in the regulation of offspring brain development.A number of processes seem to be important in mediating how genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors interact in early development to regulate such gut-mediated changes in the amygdala, wider brain functioning and inter-area connectivity, including via regulation of microRNA (miR)-451, 14-3-3 proteins, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1 and the melatonergic pathways. As well as a decrease in the activity of monoamine oxidase, heightened levels of in miR-451 and CYP1B1, coupled to decreased 14-3-3 act to inhibit the synthesis of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin, contributing to the hyperserotonemia that is often evident in ASD, with consequences for mitochondria functioning and the content of released exosomes. These same factors are likely to play a role in regulating placental changes that underpin the association of ASD with preeclampsia and other perinatal risk factors, including exposure to heavy metals and air pollutants. Such alterations in placental and gut processes act to change the amygdala-driven biological underpinnings of affect-cognitive and affect-sensory interactions in the brain.Such a perspective readily incorporates previously disparate bodies of data in ASD, including the role of the mu-opioid receptor, dopamine signalling and dopamine receptors, as well as the changes occurring to oxytocin and taurine levels. This has a number of treatment implications, the most readily applicable being the utilization of sodium butyrate and melatonin.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695574>Using Multiple Scale Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Validating Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Models.</a></h1><p>Spatially explicit agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely utilized to simulate the dynamics of spatial processes that involve the interactions of individual agents. The assumptions embedded in the ABMs may be responsible for uncertainty in the model outcomes. To ensure the reliability of the outcomes in terms of their space-time patterns, model validation should be performed. In this paper, we propose the use of multiple scale spatio-temporal patterns for validating spatially explicit ABMs. We evaluated several specifications of vector-borne disease transmission models by comparing space-time patterns of model outcomes to observations at multiple scales via the sum of root mean square error (RMSE) measurement. The results indicate that specifications of the spatial configurations of residential area and  status of individual humans are of importance to reproduce observed patterns of dengue outbreaks at multiple space-time scales. Our approach to using multiple scale spatio-temporal patterns can help not only to understand the dynamic associations between model specifications and model outcomes, but also to validate spatially explicit ABMs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697809>The microenvironmental niche in classic Hodgkin lymphoma is enriched for CTLA-4- positive T-cells that are PD-1-negative.</a></h1><p>Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a tumor comprised of rare atypical germinal center-derived B-cells (Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg [HRS] cells) embedded within a robust but ineffective inflammatory milieu. The cHL tumor microenvironment (TME) is compartmentalized into "niches" rich in PD-L1-positive HRS cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which associate with PD-1-positive T-cells to suppress anti-tumor  via PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. Despite the exquisite sensitivity of cHL to PD-1 checkpoint blockade, most patients eventually relapse and need therapeutic alternatives. Using multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy, with digital image analysis, we find that cHL is highly enriched for non-T-regulatory, CTLA-4-positive T-cells, as compared to reactive lymphoid tissues, that outnumber PD-1- and LAG-3-positive T-cells. In addition, T-cells touching HRS cells are more frequently positive for CTLA-4 than for PD-1 or LAG-3. We further find that HRS cells, and a subset of TAMs, are positive for the CTLA-4 ligand CD86, and that the fractions of T-cells and TAMs that are CTLA-4-positive and CD86-positive, respectively, are greater within a 75um HRS cell niche relative to areas outside this region (CTLA4: 38% vs. 18%, p=0.0001; TAMs: 38% vs. 24%, p=0.0007). Importantly, CTLA-4-positive cells are present, and focally contact HRS cells, in recurrent cHL tumors following a variety of therapies, including PD-1 blockade. These results implicate CTLA-4:CD86 interactions as a component of the immunologically-privileged niche surrounding HRS cells, and raise the possibility that patients with cHL refractory to PD-1 blockade may benefit from CTLA-4-blockade.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688242>Small airway disease in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: insights and implications for the clinician.</a></h1><p>Small airway disease (SAD) is a common feature in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.

The molecular effects of smoking on oral immune homeostasis have not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of smoking-associated gene expression changes in healthy palatal mucosa and to identify potentially implicated immunologic pathways.Palatal biopsies, in the form of connective tissue grafts, were obtained from periodontally healthy smokers and non-smokers. Smoking status was biochemically verified (exhaled air CO and serum cotinine). Tissue samples were processed for next generation sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and immunohistochemistry. Gene set enrichment/pathway analysis and correlation analysis between gene expression and serum cotinine levels were also performed.Analysis of palatal tissues from 12 non-smokers and 10 smokers identified 830 significantly(p<0.05) differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 249 with fold change (FC) >2. Most increased in expression (≥5-FC) were CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and USP17L9P; most decreased (≥6-FC) were IL36A, DEFB4A, DEFB4B, SPRR2F, CCL20, KLK6, and ADH4. 203 DEGs (FC>2) were significantly correlated with serum cotinine levels. Significant enrichment pathways for cotinine-associated genes include antimicrobial humoral response, regulation of humoral response and various metabolic processes. qPCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed gene and protein expression of selected DEGs.Smoking has a significant effect on the transcriptome of normal human palatal mucosa and seems to target genes important for innate immune defenses, which may prove to be one of the key mechanisms by which tobacco smoking leads to increased periodontitis susceptibility.

However, the extent to which individuals with stable risk factors for depression, such as high genetic vulnerability, can benefit from the protective effects of physical activity, remains unknown. Using a longitudinal biobank cohort integrating genomic data from 7,968 individuals of European ancestry with high-dimensional electronic health records and lifestyle survey responses, we examined whether physical activity was prospectively associated with reduced risk for incident depression in the context of genetic vulnerability.We identified individuals with incident episodes of depression, based on two or more diagnostic billing codes for a depressive disorder within 2 years following their lifestyle survey, and no such codes in the year prior. Polygenic risk scores were derived based on large-scale genome-wide association results for major depression. We tested main effects of physical activity and polygenic risk scores on incident depression, and effects of physical activity within stratified groups of polygenic risk.Polygenic risk was associated with increased odds of incident depression, and physical activity showed a protective effect of similar but opposite magnitude, even after adjusting for BMI, employment status, educational attainment, and prior depression. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with reduced odds of incident depression across all levels of genetic vulnerability, even among individuals at highest polygenic risk.Real-world data from a large healthcare system suggest that individuals with high genetic vulnerability are more likely to avoid incident episodes of depression if they are physically active.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694938>Engineering Newcastle disease virus as oncolytic vector for intratumoral delivery of immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunocytokines.</a></h1><p>Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an attractive candidate for oncolytic immunotherapy due to its ability to replicate in tumor cells and potentially overcome the inherently immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment. The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy over the past few years represents a paradigm shift in cancer therapy. However, the prevalence of severe immune-related adverse events with CTLA-4 and PD1 pathway blockade in clinical studies especially in combination therapy groups, is a cause for concern. Immunotherapies with cytokines have also been extensively explored but they have been associated with adverse events in clinical trials. Oncolytic vectors engineered to express checkpoint blockade antibodies and cytokines could provide an avenue for reducing the clinical toxicity associated with systemic therapy by concentrating the immunomodulatory payload at the site of disease. In this study, we engineered six different recombinant viruses, NDVs expressing checkpoint inhibitors (rNDV-anti-PD1 and rNDV-anti-PDL1), superagonists (rNDV-anti-CD28) and immunocytokines, where these antibodies are fused to an immunostimulatory cytokine such as IL12 (rNDV-anti-CD28-mIL12, rNDV-anti-PD1-mIL12 and rNDV-anti-PDL1-mIL12). These six engineered viruses induced tumor control and survival benefit both in a highly aggressive unilateral and bilateral B16-F10 murine melanoma model, indicative of an abscopal effect. The data represent a strong proof-of-concept, on which further clinical evaluation could build. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has shown tremendous efficacy but also frequent and often severe side effects-especially when multiple drugs of this class are used simultaneously. Similarly, many investigational immunotherapy agents, which have shown promise in animal models, have failed in clinical trials due to dose-limiting toxicity when administered systemically. This study utilized a murine melanoma model to evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral injections of recombinant NDVs engineered to express multiple immunotherapeutic proteins with well-documented side effects in humans. Our results indicate that intratumoral administration of these recombinant NDVs, particularly when combined with systemic CTLA4 checkpoint inhibition, exerts a robust effect in treated and non-treated tumors indicative of a systemic anti-tumoral response. The intratumoral delivery of rNDVs expressing immunotherapeutic proteins may be an effective method of targeting immune cell populations most relevant for anti-tumoral  and allowing to restrict the use of systemic immunotherapy agents.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690592>Quantitative Proteome Analysis of -Deficient Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts Reveals the Range of the Autophagy-Modulated Basal Cellular Proteome.</a></h1><p>Basal autophagy is crucial for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. ATG5 is an essential protein for autophagosome formation, and its depletion has been extensively used as a tool to disrupt autophagy. Here, we characterize the impact of  deficiency on the cellular proteome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Using a tandem mass tagging (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis, we observe that 14% of identified proteins show dysregulated levels in  MEFs. These proteins were distributed across diverse biological processes, such as cell adhesion, development, differentiation, transport, metabolism, and immune responses. Several of the upregulated proteins were receptors involved in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, junction adhesion, and interferon/cytokine-receptor interactions and were validated as autophagy substrates. Nearly equal numbers of proteins, including several lysosomal proteins and enzymes, were downregulated, suggesting a complex role of autophagy/ATG5 in regulating their levels. The  MEFs had lower levels of key immune sensors and effectors, including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, MLKL, and STAT1/3/5/6, which were restored by reexpression of ATG5. While these cells could efficiently mount a type I interferon response to the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mimic poly(I·C), they were compromised in their inflammatory response to the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam3CSK4. Transcriptional activation and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in these cells could be recovered by ATG5 expression, supporting the role of autophagy in the TLR2-induced inflammatory response. This study provides a key resource for understanding the effect of autophagy/ATG5 deficiency on the fibroblast proteome. Autophagy performs housekeeping functions for cells and maintains a functional mode by degrading damaged proteins and organelles and providing energy under starvation conditions. The process is tightly regulated by the evolutionarily conserved  genes, of which  is one such crucial mediator. Here, we have done a comprehensive quantitative proteome analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack a functional autophagy pathway ( knockout). We observe that 14% of the identified cellular proteome is remodeled, and several proteins distributed across diverse cellular processes with functions in signaling, cell adhesion, development, and  show either higher or lower levels under autophagy-deficient conditions. These cells have lower levels of crucial immune proteins that are required to mount a protective inflammatory response. This study will serve as a valuable resource to determine the role of autophagy in modulating specific protein levels in cells.Copyright © 2019 Sharma et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691465>Psychological stress reduces the immunological benefits of breast milk.</a></h1><p>Our study aimed to assess the impact of maternal psychological stress on the immunological components of breast milk.

However, no EI case has been identified in France between 2015 and late 2018, despite an effective field surveillance of the pathogen and the disease. Vaccination against equine influenza virus (EIV) remains to this day one of the most effective methods to prevent or limit EI outbreaks and the lack of detection of the pathogen could be linked to vaccination coverage. The aim of this study was to evaluate EI  and vaccine coverage in France through a large-scale serological study. A total of 3004 archived surplus serums from French horses of all ages, breeds and sexes were selected from four different geographical regions and categories (i.e., sanitary check prior to exportation, sale, breeding protocol or illness diagnosis). EIV-specific antibody response was measured by single radial hemolysis (SRH) and an EIV-nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA (used as a DIVA test). Overall  coverage against EIV infection (i.e., titers induced by vaccination and/or natural infection above the clinical protection threshold) reached 87.6%. The EIV NP ELISA results showed that 83% of SRH positive serum samples from young horses (≤3 years old) did not have NP antibodies, which indicates that the SRH antibody response was likely induced by EI vaccination alone (the HA recombinant canarypoxvirus-based EI vaccine is mostly used in France) and supports the absence of EIV circulation in French horse populations between 2015 and late 2018, as reported by the French equine infectious diseases surveillance network (RESPE). Results from this study confirm a strong EI  in a large cohort of French horses, which provides an explanation to the lack of clinical EI in France in recent years and highlights the success of vaccination against this disease. However, such EI protection has been challenged since late 2018 by the incursion in the EU of a Florida Clade 1 sub-lineage EIV (undetected in France since 2009), which is also reported here.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684056>Succinate Coenzyme A Ligase Beta-Like Protein from  Suppresses the Immune Functions of Rat PBMCs in Vitro and Inhibits the Secretions of Interleukin-17 in Vivo.</a></h1><p> Succinate Coenzyme A ligase beta-like protein (SUCLA-β) is a subunit of Succinyl-coenzyme A synthetase, which is involved in substrate synergism, unusual kinetic reaction in which the presence of SUCLA-β for one partial reaction stimulates another partial reaction.  is a parasitic nematode, which may hinder the development of autoimmune diseases. Immunomodulatory effects of SUCLA-β from  in the parasite-host interaction are unidentified. In this study the gene encoding  SUCLA-β was cloned and expressed. Binding activities of recombinant  SUCLA-β (rTs-SUCLA-β) to rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were checked by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the immuno-regulatory effects of rTs-SUCLA-β on cell migration, cell proliferation, nitric oxide (NO) production and apoptosis were observed by co-incubation of rTs-SUCLA-β with rat PBMCs in vitro, while cytokine secretions in rTs-SUCLA-β treated rats were evaluated in vivo. Furthermore, phagocytosis of monocytes was detected by flow cytometry and effects of rTs-SUCLA-β-induced protective  on  adult worms and muscle larva were evaluated in rats. The IFA results revealed that rTs-SUCLA-β could bind to rat PBMCs. Treatment of PBMCs with rTs-SUCLA-β significantly decreased the monocyte phagocytosis, cell migration and cell proliferation, while NO production and apoptosis of PBMCs were unaffected. Results of the in vivo study showed that the IL-17 secretion decreased significantly after rTs-SUCLA-β administration in rats, while no significant effects were observed on the secretions of IFN-γ, IL-9, TGF-β and IL-4. Moreover, significant reduction of  muscle larvae burden and significant increase in anti-rTs-SUCLA-β immunoglobulin level of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a was observed in rTs-SUCLA-β-administered rats. The results indicated that rTs-SUCLA-β may be a potential target for controlling  infection by suppressing the immune functions of the rat PBMCs and by reducing the parasite burden.

We further analyzed the detection limit for biological nanoparticles, including viruses and EVs, and show that the CytoFLEX can detect viruses down to 81 nm and EVs at least as small as 65 nm. Moreover, we could immunophenotype EV surface antigens, including directly in blood and plasma, demonstrating the double labeling of platelet EVs with CD61 and CD9, as well as triple labeling with CD81 for an EV subpopulation in one donor. In order to assess the refractive indices (RIs) of the viruses and EVs, we devised a new method to inversely calculate the RIs using the intensity vs. size data together with Mie-theory scatter efficiencies scaled to reference-particle measurements. Each of the viruses tested had an equivalent RI, approximately 1.47 at 405 nm, which suggests that flow cytometry can be more broadly used to easily determine virus sizes. We also found that the RIs of EVs increase as the particle diameters decrease below 150 nm, increasing from 1.37 for 200 nm EVs up to 1.61 for 65 nm EVs, expanding the lower range of EVs that can be detected by light scatter. Overall, we demonstrate that the CytoFLEX has an unprecedented level of sensitivity compared to conventional flow cytometers. Accordingly, the CytoFLEX can be of great benefit to virology and EV research, and will help to expand the use of flow cytometry for minimally invasive liquid biopsies by allowing for the direct analysis of antigen expression on biological nanoparticles within patient samples, including blood, plasma, urine and bronchoalveolar lavages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688678>Information Is the Resolution of Uncertainty: Whole Genome Approaches to Genetic Diagnosis on the PICU.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695359>An Oral Whole-Cell Killed Nontypeable  Immunotherapeutic For The Prevention Of Acute Exacerbations Of Chronic Airway Disease.</a></h1><p>In subjects with chronic bronchitis, protection against acute bronchitis following oral administration of a whole-cell killed nontypeable  (NTHi) preparation was demonstrated in the mid-1980s. Subsequently, studies aiming to validate clinical efficacy of this oral treatment were complicated by a number of factors, including the modification of clinical definitions, the implications of which were not recognized at that time. The objective of this review is to integrate our pre-clinical and clinical research in this field conducted over the past 30 years to demonstrate the evolution of the idea of communication between mucosal surfaces through the common mucosal immune system and the development of an effective oral NTHi immunotherapy. Our earliest studies recruited subjects with chronic sputum production and high levels of culture-positive sputum for Gram-negative bacteria but by 2000, the clinical diagnostic focus had switched from "chronic bronchitis" to "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" (COPD), which was functionally defined using spirometry. This change led to variable clinical trial results, confirming the importance of chronic sputum production and culture-positive sputum. Additional conditioning factors such as patient age and gender were influential in study populations with low culture-positive sputum production. Through this period, studies in human and in rodent models provided new insights into airway protection mechanisms and the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. Key findings were the importance of a dysbiosis within the airway microbiome, and the critical role of an interdependence between the bronchus and the gut, with a Peyer's patch-dependent extra-bronchus "loop" controlling the composition of the bronchus microbiome. Within this context, intercurrent virus infections initiate a microbiome-dependant hypersensitivity reaction involving Peyer's patch-derived Th17 cells. We conclude that whole-cell killed NTHi immunotherapy has consistent and significant benefits when examined in the context of changing clinical disease definitions, age and gender, and has the potential to change the natural history of chronic airway disease.© 2019 Clancy and Cripps.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690396>Approach to primary immunodeficiency.</a></h1><p>Primary immunodeficiency diseases are inherited defects of the innate or adaptive arms of the immune system that lead to an increase in the incidence, frequency, or severity of infections and/or immune dysregulation. There may be defects in the adaptive arm of the immune system, including combined immunodeficiencies and antibody deficiency syndromes, or abnormalities in innate , such as defects of phagocytes, the complement pathway, or toll-like receptor mediated signaling. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae type B or Streptococcus pneumoniae may be characteristic of an antibody deficiency syndrome. Frequent viral, fungal, or protozoal infections may suggest T lymphocyte impairment. Multiple Staphylococcus skin infections and fungal infections may imply neutrophil dysfunction or the Hyper-IgE syndrome, and recurrent Neisseria infection is a characteristic manifestation of late complement component (C5-9, or the membrane attack complex) defects. Recurrent viral or pyogenic bacterial infections, often without the presence of a significant inflammatory response, suggest a defect in toll-like receptor signaling. Mycobacterial infections are characteristic of defects in the interleukin (IL) 12/interferon γ pathway. Screening of newborns for T-cell lymphopenia by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify T-cell receptor excision circles, which are formed when a T cell rearranges the variable region of its receptor, serves as a surrogate for newly synthesized naive T cells. Because of very low numbers of T-cell receptor excision circles, severe combined immunodeficiency, 22q11.2 syndrome, and other causes of T-cell lymphopenia have been identified in newborns.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694319>Non-Specific Lipid Transfer Proteins in  Dorof. et Migush.: Identification, Characterization and Expression Profiling in Response to Pathogens and Resistance Inducers.</a></h1><p>Non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs) represent a family of plant antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) implicated in diverse physiological processes. However, their role in induced resistance (IR) triggered by non-pathogenic fungal strains and their metabolites is poorly understood. In this work, using RNA-seq data and our AMP search pipeline, we analyzed the repertoire of nsLTP genes in the wheat  and studied their expression in response to  infection and treatment with the intracellular metabolites of  FS-94. A total of 243 putative nsLTPs were identified, which were classified into five structural types and characterized. Expression analysis showed that 121 TkLTPs including sets of paralogs with identical mature peptides displayed specific expression patters in response to different treatments pointing to their diverse roles in resistance development. We speculate that upregulated nsLTP genes are involved in protection due to their antimicrobial activity or signaling functions. Furthermore, we discovered that in IR-displaying plants, a vast majority of nsLTP genes were downregulated, suggesting their role as negative regulators of immune mechanisms activated by the FS-94 elicitors. The results obtained add to our knowledge of the role of nsLTPs in IR and provide candidate molecules for genetic engineering of crops to enhance disease resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685017>Whole-genome sequencing of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis isolates from Gadarif State, Sudan.</a></h1><p>Trachoma, caused by ocular Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Sudan first reported trachoma in the 1930s and has since been consistently endemic. Ocular C. trachomatis previously isolated from trachoma patients in Sudan in 1963 was antigenically identical to an isolate from Saudi Arabia (A/SA1). No contemporary ocular C. trachomatis whole genome sequences have been reported from Sudan.This study sequenced twenty ocular C. trachomatis isolates to improve understanding of pathogen diversity in North-East Africa and examine for genomic variation specific to Sudan, possibly related to the persistence of trachoma in surveyed communities. High quality, whole genome sequences were obtained from 12/20 isolates.All isolates were serovar A and had tarP and trpA sequences typical of classical, ocular C. trachomatis isolates. The Sudanese isolates formed a closely related subclade within the T2-trachoma clade of C. trachomatis phylogeny distinct from geographically disparate ocular isolates, with little intra-population diversity. We found 333 SNPs that were conserved in Sudanese ocular isolates but rare compared to other ocular C. trachomatis populations, which were focused in two genomic loci (CTA0172-CTA0173 and CTA0482).Limited intra-population diversity and geographical clustering of ocular C. trachomatis suggests minimal transmission between and slow diversification within trachoma-endemic communities. However, diversity may have been higher pre-treatment in these communities. Over-representation of Sudan-specific SNPs in three genes suggests they may have an impact on C. trachomatis growth and transmission in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685995>Mitochondria-localised ZNFX1 functions as a dsRNA sensor to initiate antiviral responses through MAVS.</a></h1><p>In the past two decades, emerging studies have suggested that DExD/H box helicases belonging to helicase superfamily 2 (SF2) play essential roles in antiviral innate . However, the antiviral functions of helicase SF1, which shares a conserved helicase core with SF2, are little understood. Here we demonstrate that zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1 (ZNFX1), a helicase SF1, is an interferon (IFN)-stimulated, mitochondrial-localised dsRNA sensor that specifically restricts the replication of RNA viruses. Upon virus infection, ZNFX1 immediately recognizes viral RNA through its Armadillo-type fold and P-loop domain and then interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein to initiate the type I IFN response without depending on retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs). In short, as is the case with interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) alone, ZNFX1 can induce IFN and ISG expression at an early stage of RNA virus infection to form a positively regulated loop of the well-known RLR signalling. This provides another layer of understanding of the complexity of antiviral .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682977>Long-term follow-up of antibody titers against measles, mumps, and rubella in recipients of allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantations.</a></h1><p>Outbreaks of viral infections, such as measles, are regularly observed and pose a serious threat to allogeneic HCT-recipients. The question how long cellular and humoral protective host  persists, and whether donor  can be transferred has not been clarified. Here, we present a retrospective analysis of humoral , i.e. serial antibody titers against measles, mumps, and rubella in 331 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our single center between 2002-2015. Associations between the loss of protective antibody levels and clinical patient characteristics and transplant parameters were examined. In general, antibody protection against measles persisted longer with 72% of patients maintaining sufficient titers at 5 years post HCT even without re-vaccination while at that time only 65% and 50% of patients had protective  against rubella and mumps, respectively. The great majority of donors were seropositive for all three viruses, however, it appeared that donor humoral  could not be transferred and had no impact on the post-HCT serostatus. Rather, the most relevant factor for persistence of protective antibody titers against measles and rubella was whether patients were born before introduction of the respective vaccine, and thus were immunized by the wild-type disease inducing virus instead of the vaccine. Moreover, the presence of moderate and severe chronic graft-versus host disease (GVHD) was associated with more rapid loss of immune protection. In contrast, underlying disease, intensity of the conditioning regimen, use of anti-thymocyte globulin, age, and graft source did not have an influence on antibody titers. Overall, our findings suggest that the majority of antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella originate from residual host cells, whereas the donor immune status appears to have no influence on antibody protection post-HCT.Copyright © 2019.

And natural immune response is activated first in this case. It differentiates pathogens by TLR. The aim - to enhance the efficacy of treatment of chronic catarrhal gingivitis in children suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus by means of improving the methods of pharmacological correction on the basis of investigation of the indices of local natural immune response and microbiological properties of the disease. We formed 2 group of the study. Children received basic insulin therapy. The treatment of chronic catarrhal gingivitis in children from the main group were suggested the antiseptic solution "Decasan"; pill of a probiotic action "BioGaia ProDentis" and the immune modulator "Imupret". Children from the comparative group were treated according to the common scheme. Oral microflora of children after treatment was decreased by 69,42% of general microbial number in children from the main group. Natural  state was also indicative of the improved protective mechanisms of the oral cavity in children from the main subgroup in the dynamics of treatment: twice as less level of mRNA TLR-2 expression was found in the main subgroup and mRNA TLR-4 - 45,44%.

Here, we investigated its expression levels and mechanism of action in gastric cancer (GC). Western blotting and GC tissue arrays were used to determine the expression levels of SPON2. ELISAs were performed to measure the serum levels of SPON2 in patients with GC. Two GC cell lines expressing low levels of SPON2 were used to analyse the effects of regulating SPON2 expression on proliferation, migration, invasion, the cell cycle and apoptosis. The results revealed that SPON2 was highly expressed in GC tissues from patients with relapse or metastasis. The levels of SPON2 in sera of patients with GC were significantly higher compared with those of healthy individuals and patients with atrophic gastritis. Knockdown of SPON2 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of SPON2 arrested the cell cycle in G1/S, accelerated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by blocking activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. In summary, this study suggests that SPON2 acts as an oncogene in the development of GC and may serve as a marker for the diagnosing GC as well as a new therapeutic target for GC.© 2019 The Authors.

Throughout the years, advances have been made in the knowledge of metabolic pathways and technological treatments of dietary fatty acids (FAs), resulting in safer and more widely available lipid supplements. There is an awareness of the positive nutraceutical effects of the addition of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to fat supplementation, which provides consumers with healthier animal products through manipulation of their characteristics. If it is true that benefits to human health can be derived from the consumption of animal products rich in bioactive fatty acids (FAs), then it is reasonable to think that the same effect can occur in the animals to which the supplements are administered. Therefore, recent advances in fat supplementation of dairy goats with reference to the effect on health status have been summarized.

The economic burden caused by virus infections such as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Swine influenza virus, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Porcine Circovirus 2, Foot and Mouth Disease Virus and many others are associated with severe morbidity, mortality, loss of production, trade restrictions and investments in control and prevention practices. Pigs can also have a role in zoonotic transmission of some viral infections to humans. Inactivated and modified-live virus vaccines are available against porcine viral infections with variable efficacy under field conditions. Thus, improvements over existing vaccines are necessary to: (1) Increase the breadth of protection against evolving viral strains and subtypes; (2) Control of emerging and re-emerging viruses; (3) Eradicate viruses localized in different geographic areas; and (4) Differentiate infected from vaccinated animals to improve disease control programs. Nanoparticles (NPs) generated from virus-like particles, biodegradable and biocompatible polymers and liposomes offer many advantages as vaccine delivery platform due to their unique physicochemical properties. NPs help in efficient antigen internalization and processing by antigen presenting cells and activate them to elicit innate and adaptive . Some of the NPs-based vaccines could be delivered through both parenteral and mucosal routes to trigger efficient mucosal and systemic immune responses and could be used to target specific immune cells such as mucosal microfold (M) cells and dendritic cells (DCs). In conclusion, NPs-based vaccines can serve as novel candidate vaccines against several porcine viral infections with the potential to enhance the broader protective efficacy under field conditions. This review highlights the recent developments in NPs-based vaccines against porcine viral pathogens and how the NPs-based vaccine delivery system induces innate and adaptive immune responses resulting in varied level of protective efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686315>Molecular and Phenotypic Characterization of Nine Patients with STAT1 GOF Mutations in China.</a></h1><p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a transcription factor that mediates cellular responses to interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines and growth factors in diverse cell types. STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations result in an unexpectedly wide range of clinical features. It remains unclear why STAT1 GOF mutations result in such a broad spectrum of phenotypes.We analyzed the clinical, molecular, and phenotypic characteristics of nine Chinese patients with STAT1 GOF mutations.This study enrolled nine patients with STAT1 GOF mutations including five novel mutations. We discuss the molecular and phenotypic characterization such as unique Penicillium marneffei lymphadenitis. Patients with STAT1 GOF mutations had defects in both innate and adaptive , including impaired T cell receptor (TCR) diversity; reduced numbers of naïve and effector memory CD4 T cells, memory B cells, and NK cells; and defects in the production of IL-17A and IFN-γ. In addition, experiments with primary immune cells revealed that enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation resulted from not only lower rates of STAT1 dephosphorylation but also increased total STAT1 expression.Our report provides the first comprehensive overview of the molecular genetics, clinical heterogeneity, and underlying immunological abnormalities of patients with STAT1 GOF mutations in China.

Although recent studies suggested the importance of type 2  in an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in adipose tissue, the regulatory effects of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines on systemic metabolic regulation are not fully understood. Recently, we identified the roles of the Th2 cytokine (interleukin 4 [IL-4] and IL-13)-induced adipokine, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), in adipose tissue in regulating systemic glucose metabolism via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation. Moreover, we showed that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is required to maintain these macrophage-regulating autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways via Th2 cytokine-induced secretion of GDF15. In this review, we discuss how the type 2 immune response and Th2 cytokines regulate metabolism in adipose tissue. Specifically, we review the systemic regulatory roles of Th2 cytokines in metabolic disease and the role of mitochondria in maintenance of type 2 responses in adipose tissue homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 Korean Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697387>Plasmodium vivax Malaria viewed through the lens of an eradicated European strain.</a></h1><p>The protozoan Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 42% of all cases of malaria outside Africa. The parasite is currently largely restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes in Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Though, it was historically present in most of Europe before being finally eradicated during the second half of the 20th century. The lack of genomic information on the extinct European lineage has prevented a clear understanding of historical population structuring and past migrations of P. vivax. We used medical microscope slides prepared in 1944 from malaria-affected patients from the Ebro Delta in Spain, one of the last footholds of malaria in Europe, to generate a genome of a European P. vivax strain. Population genetics and phylogenetic analyses placed this strain basal to a cluster including samples from the Americas. This genome allowed us to calibrate a genomic mutation rate for P. vivax, and to estimate the mean age of the last common ancestor between European and American strains to the 15th century. This date points to an introduction of the parasite during the European colonisation of the Americas. In addition, we found that some known variants for resistance to anti-malarial drugs, including Chloroquine and Sulfadoxine, were already present in this European strain, predating their use. Our results shed light on the evolution of an important human pathogen and illustrate the value of antique medical collections as a resource for retrieving genomic information on pathogens from the past.© The Author(s) 2019.

We implemented FreeSurfer to obtain cortical thickness estimates to contrast patterns of cortical thinning across groups and their clinical correlates.In Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, a largely similar pattern of regional cortical thinning was observed relative to controls apart from a more severe loss within the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures in Alzheimer's disease. In Parkinson disease dementia, regional cortical thickness was indistinguishable from controls and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting an 'intermediate' pattern of regional cortical change. In terms of global cortical thickness, group profiles were controls > Parkinson disease dementia > dementia with Lewy bodies > Alzheimer's disease (F ⩽ 123.2,  < 0.001), where percentage wise, the average difference compared to controls were -1.8%, -5.5% and -6.4%, respectively. In these samples, cortical thinning was also associated with cognitive decline in dementia with Lewy bodies but not in Parkinson disease dementia and Alzheimer's disease.In a large and well-characterised cohort of people with dementia, regional cortical thinning in dementia with Lewy bodies was broadly similar to Alzheimer's disease. There was preservation of the medial temporal lobe structures in dementia with Lewy bodies compared with Alzheimer's disease, supporting its inclusion as a supportive biomarker in the revised clinical criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies. However, there was less global cortical thinning in Parkinson disease dementia, with no significant regional difference between Parkinson disease dementia and controls. These findings highlight the overlap across the Alzheimer's disease/Parkinson disease dementia spectrum and the potential for differing mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689620>Identification of a blood-based 12-gene signature that predicts the severity of coronary artery stenosis: An integrative approach based on gene network construction, Support Vector Machine algorithm, and multi-cohort validation.</a></h1><p>We aimed to identify a blood-based gene expression score (GES) to predict the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) by integrative use of gene network construction, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, and multi-cohort validation.In the discovery phase, a public blood-based microarray dataset of 110 patients with known CAD was analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis to identify candidate hub genes. In the training set with 151 CAD patients, bioinformatically identified hub genes were experimentally verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and statistically filtered with the SVM algorithm to develop a GES. Internal and external validation of GES was performed in patients with suspected CAD from two validation cohorts (n = 209 and 206).The discovery phase screened 15 network-centric hub genes significantly correlated with the Duke CAD Severity Index. In the training cohort, 12 of 15 hub genes were filtered to construct a blood-based GES12, which showed good discrimination for higher modified Gensini scores (AUC: 0.798 and 0.812), higher Sullivan Extent scores (AUC: 0.776 and 0.778), and the presence of obstructive CAD (AUC: 0.834 and 0.792) in two validation cohorts. A nomogram comprising GES12, smoking status, hypertension status, low density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and body mass index further improved performance, with respect to discrimination, risk classification, and clinical utility, for prediction of coronary stenosis severity.GES12 is useful in predicting the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with known or suspected CAD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

'Travellers' were defined as individuals born outside of Australia who had resided in the country < 2 years. Associations between patient characteristics and chlamydia positivity were examined.ResultsChlamydia positivity was higher among travellers (11.2%) compared with Australian residents (8.5%; p < 0.001). Male travellers had higher chlamydia positivity (12.1%) than Australian males (9.3%; p < 0.001), as did female travellers (10.4%) compared with Australian females (7.7%; p < 0.001).

Therapeutic treatment with rMVA-CD40L-expressing tumor-associated antigens results in the control of established tumors. The expansion of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells is essential for the therapeutic antitumor effects. Strikingly, rMVA-CD40L also induces strong natural killer (NK) cell activation and expansion. Moreover, the combination of rMVA-CD40L and tumor-targeting antibodies results in increased therapeutic antitumor efficacy relying on the presence of Fc receptor and NK cells. We describe a translationally relevant therapeutic synergy between systemic viral vaccination and CD40L costimulation.

The success of checkpoint blockade therapy has demonstrated the potentially curative value of preexisting tumor-primed T cells in cancer treatment. Given the results from checkpoint blockade therapy, we hypothesized that endogenous T cells contribute to long-term survival following ACT. Here, we describe a therapeutic approach combining ACT with an oncolytic vaccine that allows simultaneous analysis of antitumor  mediated by transferred and endogenous T cells. We found that, in addition to promoting the expansion and tumor infiltration of the transferred T cells, oncolytic vaccines boosted tumor-primed host T cells. We determined that transferred T cells contributed to rapid destruction of large tumor masses while endogenous T cells concurrently prevented the emergence of antigen-loss variants. Moreover, while transferred T cells disappeared shortly after tumor regression, endogenous T cells secured long-term memory with a broad repertoire of antigen specificity. Our findings suggest that this combination strategy may exploit the full potential of ACT and tumor-primed host T cells to eliminate the primary tumor, prevent immune escape, and provide long-term protective memory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683654>Metabolomic Analysis of Influenza A Virus A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) Infected A549 Cells during First Cycle of Viral Replication.</a></h1><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) has developed strategies to utilize host metabolites which, after identification and isolation, can be used to discover the value of immunometabolism. During this study, to mimic the metabolic processes of influenza virus infection in human cells, we infect A549 cells with H1N1 (WSN) influenza virus and explore the metabolites with altered levels during the first cycle of influenza virus infection using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Q-TOF MS) technology.

These metabolites are correlated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mainly are involved in purine, lipid, and glutathione metabolisms.

There are approximately 5500 new UK cases of myeloma per annum, and one-quarter of patients will have a serious infection within 3 months of diagnosis. Newly diagnosed patients may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection. However, the use of prophylaxis has not been established in myeloma and may be associated with health-care-associated infections (HCAIs), such as . There is a need to assess the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the use of antibacterial prophylaxis against any risks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial.To assess the risks, benefits and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic levofloxacin in newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma patients.Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A central telephone randomisation service used a minimisation computer algorithm to allocate treatments in a 1 : 1 ratio.A total of 93 NHS hospitals throughout England, Northern Ireland and Wales.A total of 977 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma.Patients were randomised to receive levofloxacin or placebo tablets for 12 weeks at the start of antimyeloma treatment. Treatment allocation was blinded and balanced by centre, estimated glomerular filtration rate and intention to give high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. Follow-up was at 4-week intervals up to 16 weeks, with a further follow-up at 1 year.The primary outcome was to assess the number of febrile episodes (or deaths) in the first 12 weeks from randomisation. Secondary outcomes included number of deaths and infection-related deaths, days in hospital, carriage and invasive infections, response to antimyeloma treatment and its relation to infection, quality of life and overall survival within the first 12 weeks and beyond.In total, 977 patients were randomised (levofloxacin,  = 489; placebo,  = 488). A total of 134 (27%) events (febrile episodes,  = 119; deaths,  = 15) occurred in the placebo arm and 95 (19%) events (febrile episodes,  = 91; deaths,  = 4) occurred in the levofloxacin arm; the hazard ratio for time to first event (febrile episode or death) within the first 12 weeks was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.86;  = 0.002). Levofloxacin also reduced other infections (144 infections from 116 patients) compared with placebo (179 infections from 133 patients; -trend of 0.06). There was no difference in new acquisitions of , methicillin-resistant  and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative organisms when assessed up to 16 weeks. Levofloxacin produced slightly higher quality-adjusted life-year gains over 16 weeks, but had associated higher costs for health resource use. With a median follow-up of 52 weeks, there was no significant difference in overall survival ( = 0.94).Short duration of prophylactic antibiotics and cost-effectiveness.During the 12 weeks from new diagnosis, the addition of prophylactic levofloxacin to active myeloma treatment significantly reduced febrile episodes and deaths without increasing HCAIs or carriage. Future work should aim to establish the optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis and should involve the laboratory investigation of , inflammation and disease activity on stored samples funded by the TEAMM (Tackling Early Morbidity and Mortality in Myeloma) National Institute for Health Research Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation grant (reference number 14/24/04).Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN51731976.This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 23, No. 62.

Using antibiotic to promote growth has been banned in the most countries for this reason; so, we must search for feed additives alternative in animal production. One of them is the black seed (Nigella sativa). Fifty-four growing V-line unsexed rabbits, 4 weeks of age, with an average weight of 776.7 g were randomly allocated to one of three treatments (n = 18): rabbits fed the basal diet (control), rabbits supplemented with either 300 or 600 mg of Nigella sativa seed (NSS)/kg diet. At 12 weeks of age, NSS supplementation significantly improved final body weight, weight gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and performance index with significantly reduced feed consumption. Addition of 300 and 600 mg NSS/kg diet resulted in a significant increase in the number of RBCs and WBCs as compared to basal diet group. Compared to controls, NSS supplementation significantly stimulated the IgG and IgM immune responses of rabbits, significantly reduced serum total lipids, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein, and significantly increased the high-density lipoprotein concentration. All NSS treatments significantly increased the observed blood total antioxidant capacity and significantly decreased the malondialdehyde values, compared to the basal diet group. In conclusion, the results displayed that addition of NSS in rabbit diets improved productive performance, blood lipid profile, , and antioxidant status, and supplementation with 600 mg/kg NSS was more effective than 300 mg/kg NSS seed supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685621>Immunological ignorance is an enabling feature of the oligo-clonal T cell response to melanoma neoantigens.</a></h1><p>The impact of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and the resultant neoantigen landscape on T cell  are poorly understood. ITH is a widely recognized feature of solid tumors and poses distinct challenges related to the development of effective therapeutic strategies, including cancer neoantigen vaccines. Here, we performed deep targeted DNA sequencing of multiple metastases from melanoma patients and observed ubiquitous sharing of clonal and subclonal single nucleotide variants (SNVs) encoding putative HLA class I-restricted neoantigen epitopes. However, spontaneous antitumor CD8+ T cell  in peripheral blood and tumors was restricted to a few clonal neoantigens featuring an oligo-/monoclonal T cell-receptor (TCR) repertoire. Moreover, in various tumors of the 4 patients examined, no neoantigen-specific TCR clonotypes were identified despite clonal neoantigen expression. Mature dendritic cell (mDC) vaccination with tumor-encoded amino acid-substituted (AAS) peptides revealed diverse neoantigen-specific CD8+ T responses, each composed of multiple TCR clonotypes. Isolation of T cell clones by limiting dilution from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) permitted functional validation regarding neoantigen specificity. Gene transfer of TCRαβ heterodimers specific for clonal neoantigens confirmed correct TCR clonotype assignments based on high-throughput TCRBV CDR3 sequencing. Our findings implicate immunological ignorance of clonal neoantigens as the basis for ineffective T cell  to melanoma and support the concept that therapeutic vaccination, as an adjunct to checkpoint inhibitor treatment, is required to increase the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682833>Telomere and Subtelomere R-loops and Antigenic Variation in Trypanosomes.</a></h1><p>Trypanosoma brucei is a kinetoplastid parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis, which is fatal if left untreated. T. brucei regularly switches its major surface antigen, VSG, to evade the host immune responses. VSGs are exclusively expressed from subtelomeric expression sites (ESs) where VSG genes are flanked by upstream 70 bp repeats and downstream telomeric repeats. The telomere downstream of the active VSG is transcribed into a long-noncoding RNA (TERRA), which forms RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) with the telomeric DNA. At an elevated level, telomere R-loops cause more telomeric and subtelomeric Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) and increase VSG switching rate. In addition, stabilized R-loops are observed at the 70 bp repeats and immediately downstream of ES-linked VSGs in RNase H-defective cells, which also have an increased amount of subtelomeric DSBs and more frequent VSG switching. Although subtelomere plasticity is expected to be beneficial to antigenic variation, severe defects in subtelomere integrity and stability increase cell lethality. Therefore, regulation of the telomere and 70 bp repeat R-loop levels is important for the balance between antigenic variation and cell fitness in T. brucei. Additionally, the high level of the active ES transcription favors accumulation of R-loops at the telomere and 70 bp repeats, providing an intrinsic mechanism for local DSB formation, which is a strong inducer of VSG switching.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper summarises the current state of knowledge and recent discoveries in the cellular and physiological mechanisms leading to the development of liver cancer, especially HCC, and liver metastases. After reviewing normal hepatic cytoarchitecture and immunological characteristics, the paper addresses the pathophysiological factors that cause liver damage and predispose to neoplasia.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) comprise populations of immature myeloid cells in tumor-bearing hosts with a highly immunosuppressive capacity. We could previously identify RIG-I-like helicases (RLH) as targets for the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and type I interferons (IFN) as key mediators linking innate with adaptive .Mice with orthotopically implanted Kras p53 Ptf1a-Cre (KPC) pancreatic tumors were treated intravenously with the RLH ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), and the immune cell environment in tumor and spleen was characterized. A comprehensive analysis of the suppressive capacity as well as the whole transcriptomic profile of isolated MDSC subsets was performed. Antigen presentation capability of MDSC from mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumors was investigated in T cell proliferation assays. The role of IFN in MDSC function was investigated in Ifnar1 mice.MDSC were strongly induced in orthotopic KPC-derived pancreatic cancer, and frequencies of MDSC subsets correlated with tumor weight and G-CSF serum levels, whereas other immune cell populations decreased. Administration of the RLH-ligand induced a IFN-driven immune response, with increased activation of T cells and dendritic cells (DC), and a reduced suppressive capacity of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC and monocytic (M)-MDSC fractions. Whole transcriptomic analysis confirmed an IFN-driven gene signature of MDSC, a switch from a M2/G2- towards a M1/G1-polarized phenotype, and the induction of genes involved in the antigen presentation machinery. Nevertheless, MDSC failed to present tumor antigen to T cells. Interestingly, we found MDSC with reduced suppressive function in Ifnar1-deficient hosts; however, there was a common flaw in immune cell activation, which was reflected by defective immune cell activation and tumor control.We provide evidence that the treatment with immunostimulatory RNA reprograms the TME of pancreatic cancer by reducing the suppressive activity of MDSC, polarizing myeloid cells into a M1-like state and recruiting DC. We postulate that tumor cell-targeting combination strategies may benefit from RLH-based TME remodeling. In addition, we provide novel insights into the dual role of IFN signaling in MDSC's suppressive function and provide evidence that host-intrinsic IFN signaling may be critical for MDSC to gain suppressive function during tumor development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693860>HDAC3 Regulates Gingival Fibroblast Inflammatory Responses in Periodontitis.</a></h1><p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important regulators of gene expression that are aberrantly regulated in several inflammatory and infectious diseases. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) suppress inflammatory activation of various cell types through epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms, and ameliorate pathology in a mouse model of periodontitis. Activation of gingival fibroblasts (GFs) significantly contributes to the development of periodontitis and the anaerobic bacterium  plays a key role in driving chronic inflammation. Here, we analyzed the role of HDACs in inflammatory responses of GFs. Pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and/or ITF2357 (givinostat) significantly reduced TNFα- and -inducible expression and/or production of a cluster of inflammatory mediators in healthy donor GFs (, and ) without affecting cell viability. Selective inhibition of HDAC3/6, but not specific HDAC1, HDAC6, or HDAC8 inhibition, reproduced the suppressive effects of pan-HDACi on the inflammatory gene expression profile induced by TNFα and , suggesting a critical role for HDAC3 in GF inflammatory activation. Consistently, silencing of HDAC3 expression with siRNA largely recapitulated the effects of HDAC3/6i on mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators in -infected GFs. In contrast,  internalization and intracellular survival in GFs remained unaffected by HDACi. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and NFκB signaling was unaffected by global or HDAC3/6-selective HDACi, and new protein synthesis was not required for gene suppression by HDACi. Finally, pan-HDACi and HDAC3/6i suppressed -induced expression of , and  in GFs from patients with periodontitis. Our results identify HDAC3 as an important regulator of inflammatory gene expression in GFs and suggest that therapeutic targeting of HDAC activity, in particular HDAC3, may be clinically beneficial in suppressing inflammation in periodontal disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694666>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) antibodies in animal sera - occurrence in goat flocks in Germany, longevity and ability to recall immunological information after more than six years.</a></h1><p>TBE is an important tick-borne viral zoonosis in Europe and some parts of Asia. Humans can become infected by tick bite and in some cases also by consumption of nonpasteurized raw milk and raw milk products from ruminants. Serological investigations of milking flocks can help to assess the risk of TBEV infection for humans. 735 blood samples from 50 goat flocks from four federal states of Germany were tested by TBEV-VNT to assess a potential risk for TBEV infection. There are some gaps in the knowledge about  in animals, for example with regard to the longevity of TBEV . Two goats and two sheep were immunized and TBEV antibody titers could be detected for up to 7 years. Furthermore, nothing is known about a possible long-lasting immunological memory that could quickly be reactivated by an additional contact to TBEV. Seven years after the first immunization two goats and two sheep as well as two naïve goats and two sheep were boostered and TBEV antibody titers followed.Only one sample in each of the three states was TBEV-antibody positive (VNT), albeit with low titers. However, in Baden-Württemberg seven samples were positive, among them four goats of the same flock. TBEV-antibody positive titers were detected in goats for up to 6 years and 10 months, in sheep for up to 4 years and 7 months. Seven years after immunization a clear immunological recall occurred in response to administration of one dose of vaccine in two goats and two sheep.It can be concluded that in the tested flocks the risk of an alimentary TBEV infection was low. However, in one single flock a considerably higher risk must be assumed. Antibody titers in goats and sheep can last very long after contact to TBEV, albeit at a low level. This should be taken into consideration in cases where the risk of an alimentary infection is assessed in a flock by serological investigations. The immunological recall gives rise to the suspicion that the immunological memory after a first contact to TBEV lasts for many years, probably lifelong.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683642>Improved Anti-Tumour Adaptive  Can Overcome the Melanoma Immunosuppressive Tumour Microenvironment.</a></h1><p>Clinical benefits obtained from checkpoint blockade regimens demonstrate the importance of overcoming the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) in cancer immunotherapy. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of B16 melanoma cells (H-2K) leads to lethal disseminated pulmonary metastasis in Balb/c recipients (H-2K). This lack of immune control is related to low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on B16 cells which is associated with delayed and decreased anti-tumour adaptive immune responses (e.g., alloantibody formation) as: (i) other tumour types with normal H-2K expression are rejected with concomitant antibody production; (ii) preincubation of B16 with IFN-gamma to upregulate H-2K expression resulted in improved antibody production and anti-tumour activity. The delayed/decreased anti-tumour adaptive immune responses induced by B16 inoculation is not able to interrupt progression of primary metastases, while it is able to effectively eliminate secondary inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) B16 cells from progression. This is due to the presence of an immunosuppressive TME within the primary metastases characterized by increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and an increased T helper cells (Th) 2/1 profile. These tumour-induced immunosuppressive T cell populations are counteracted by improved adaptive  via active and passive immunization, resulting in effective elimination of the TME, destruction of the metastatic tumour and a reversal of Th2/1 profile in a time-sensitive manner. Thus, we here demonstrate that the TME is not irreversible and adaptive  is able to eradicate established solid tumour and its immunosuppressive TME. This study will help design treatments to overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and improve efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692767>[Erysipelas associated with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the labium majus after radiochemotherapy].</a></h1><p>The erysipelas is a bacterial infection most frequently due to (85% of cases) streptococcus β-hemolytic of group A (SGA), resulting in non-necrotizing dermo-hypodermitis. Many factors may play a role in its occurrence such as general factors: diabetes, immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiotherapy as well as locoregional ports of entry such as leg ulcer, an insect bite, intertrigo. The occurrence of erysipelas associated with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma after radiochemotherapy is exceptional, requiring early treatment of dermo-hypodermitis as well as suitable and multidisciplinary management of the carcinoma. The mechanism of the occurrence of erysipelas after radiotherapy coincides with its pathophysiology. Indeed, this therapeutic component, which is very used to treat squamous cell carcinoma, alters lymphatic drainage resulting, very gradually, in lymph fibrosis thus weakening the defense mechanism. Its association with alteration of cellular , also favored by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can cause the occurrence of erysipelas in these patients. We report the case of a 50-year old female patient with a 1-year history of squamous cell carcinoma of the right labium majus treatment with radiochemotherapy with remission. Eight months later, the patient had recurrence. Evolution was marked by the appearance of a painful hot erythematous plaque on the right thigh suggesting erysipelas, confirmed by laboratory tests which showed an infection. The patient was put on antibiotic therapy with good improvement and then referred to the Department of Oncology for recurrence management.© Younes Barbach et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689421>rM-CSF efficiently replaces L929 in generating mouse and rat bone marrow-derived macrophages for in vitro functional studies of  to intracellular bacteria.</a></h1><p>Methods used to prepare bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) may influence the outcomes of immunological assays in which they are used. Supernatant conditioned by growth of L929 cells has often been used to generate mouse macrophages from bone marrow in vitro but is subject to lot-to-lot variability. To reduce experimental variability and to standardize techniques across laboratories, we investigated recombinant M-CSF (rM-CSF) as an alternative supplement for BMDM maturation in the context of macrophage infection, using the intracellular bacterium Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) of Francisella tularensis as a prototype. We compared rM-CSF with L929 supernatant in terms of their effects on mouse and rat macrophage growth, maturation patterns, surface marker expression, and the expression of selected genes. Further, we compared macrophage infectivity and bacterial replication using LVS. Finally, we compared the in vitro function of BMDMs co-cultured with splenocytes from vaccinated animals in terms of their control of intramacrophage bacterial replication, as well as production of cytokines and nitric oxide. We demonstrated that rM-CSF produced BMDMs with similar, or minimal, phenotypic and gene expression outcomes compared to those generated with media containing L929 supernatant. Most importantly, functional outcomes were similar. Taken together, our data support the use of the rM-CSF in cell culture media as an alternative to L929-supplemented media for functional bioassays that use C57BL/6J mouse or Fischer 344 rat BMDMs to study intracellular infections. This comparison therefore facilitates future protocol standardization.Copyright © 2018.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce chitooligosaccharides (COs) and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), that promote symbiosis signalling with resultant oscillations in nuclear-associated calcium. The activation of symbiosis signalling must be balanced with activation of  signalling, which in fungal interactions is promoted by COs resulting from the chitinaceous fungal cell wall. Here we demonstrate that COs ranging from CO4-CO8 can induce symbiosis signalling in Medicago truncatula. CO perception is a function of the receptor-like kinases MtCERK1 and LYR4, that activate both  and symbiosis signalling. A combination of LCOs and COs act synergistically to enhance symbiosis signalling and suppress  signalling and receptors involved in both CO and LCO perception are necessary for mycorrhizal establishment. We conclude that LCOs, when present in a mix with COs, drive a symbiotic outcome and this mix of signals is essential for arbuscular mycorrhizal establishment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692955>Myeloid Tribbles 1 induces early atherosclerosis via enhanced foam cell expansion.</a></h1><p>Macrophages drive atherosclerotic plaque progression and rupture; hence, attenuating their atherosclerosis-inducing properties holds promise for reducing coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that Tribbles 1 (Trib1) regulates macrophage phenotype and shows that  deficiency increases plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, suggesting that reduced  expression mediates the strong genetic association between the  locus and increased CHD risk in man. However, we report here that myeloid-specific  (m) deficiency reduces early atheroma formation and that m transgene expression increases atherogenesis. Mechanistically, m increased macrophage lipid accumulation and the expression of a critical receptor (OLR1), promoting oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake and the formation of lipid-laden foam cells. As  and  RNA levels were also strongly correlated in human macrophages, we suggest that a conserved, TRIB1-mediated mechanism drives foam cell formation in atherosclerotic plaque and that inhibiting mTRIB1 could be used therapeutically to reduce CHD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

It is one of blood infections caused by malaria plasmodia. The disease is transmitted to a human by a bite of a female mosquito of Anopheles genus. Local malaria transmission in Ukraine has not been registered since 1956, however, every year some imported cases occur. In 2017, 45 cases of malaria were imported to Ukraine: 80% of them were caused by P. falciparum. The aim of the research is to present a case of imported tropical malaria in a pregnant woman with the development of malaria coma. An unusual course of the illness made diagnoses difficult due to partial  of the patient caused by multiple previous invasions of malaria plasmodia. The diagnosis was confirmed by blood microscopy. A literature on epidemiology, clinical findings and current tropical malaria course has been scanned as well. In the presence of an appropriate epidemiological anamnesis, the patients with fever of unknown genesis should first of all be examined for malaria, the most socially significant tropical disease. It is necessary to define the type of malarial plasmodium by repeated blood parasitoscopy by a thick-blood film and blood smear coloured by Gimza-Romanovsky method. Doctors' vigilance against malaria allows preventing complicated forms and late relapses of this malignant invasion. The countries free of malaria can also face this problem and therefore they should be ready to diagnose and treat this disease effectively. The infectious diseases hospitals of Ukraine should be supplied with antimalarial drugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687974>Immune exclusion by naturally-acquired secretory IgA to the pneumococcal pilus-1.</a></h1><p>Successful infection by mucosal pathogens requires overcoming the mucus barrier. To better understand this key step, we performed a survey of the interactions between human respiratory mucus and the human pathogen S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal adherence to adult human nasal fluid was seen only by isolates expressing pilus-1. Robust binding was independent of pilus-1 adhesive properties but required Fab-dependent recognition of RrgB, the pilus shaft protein, by naturally-acquired secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Pilus-1 binding by specific sIgA led to bacterial agglutination, but adherence required interaction of agglutinated pneumococci and entrapment in mucus particles. To test the effect of these interactions in vivo, pneumococci were preincubated with human sIgA prior to intranasal challenge in a mouse model of colonization. sIgA-treatment resulted in rapid immune exclusion of pilus-expressing pneumococci. Our findings predict that immune exclusion would select for non-piliated isolates in individuals who acquired RrgB-specific sIgA from prior episodes of colonization with piliated strains. Accordingly, genomic data comparing isolates carried by mothers and their children showed that mothers are less likely to be colonized with pilus-expressing strains. Our study provides a specific example of immune exclusion involving naturally-acquired antibody in the human host, a major factor driving pneumococcal adaptation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684058>Simultaneous Immunization with Multivalent Norovirus VLPs Induces Better Protective Immune Responses to Norovirus Than Sequential Immunization.</a></h1><p>Human noroviruses (NoVs) are a genetically diverse, constantly evolving group of viruses. Here, we studied the effect of NoV pre-existing  on the success of NoV vaccinations with genetically close and distant genotypes. A sequential immunization as an alternative approach to multivalent NoV virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccine was investigated. Mice were immunized with NoV GI.3, GII.4-1999, GII.17, and GII.4 Sydney as monovalent VLPs or as a single tetravalent mixture combined with rotavirus VP6-protein. Sequentially immunized mice were primed with a trivalent vaccine candidate (GI.3 + GII.4-1999 + VP6) and boosted, first with GII.17 and then with GII.4 Sydney VLPs. NoV serum antibodies were analyzed. Similar NoV genotype-specific immune responses were induced with the monovalent and multivalent mixture immunizations, and no immunological interference was observed. Multivalent immunization with simultaneous mix was found to be superior to sequential immunization, as sequential boost induced strong blocking antibody response against the distant genotype (GII.17), but not against GII.4 Sydney, closely related to GII.4-1999, contained in the priming vaccine. Genetically close antigens may interfere with the immune response generation and thereby immune responses may be differently formed depending on the degree of NoV VLP genotype identity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690788>Characterization of local and circulating bovine γδ T cell responses to respiratory BCG vaccination.</a></h1><p>The Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is administered parenterally to infants and young children to prevent tuberculosis (TB) infection. However, the protection induced by BCG is highly variable and the vaccine does not prevent pulmonary TB, the most common form of the illness. Until improved TB vaccines are available, it is crucial to use BCG in a manner which ensures optimal vaccine performance. Immunization directly to the respiratory mucosa has been shown to promote greater protection from TB in animal models. γδ T cells play a major role in host defense at mucosal sites and are known to respond robustly to mycobacterial infection. Their positioning in the respiratory mucosa ensures their engagement in the response to aerosolized TB vaccination. However, our understanding of the effect of respiratory BCG vaccination on γδ T cell responses in the lung is unknown. In this study, we used a calf model to investigate the immunogenicity of aerosol BCG vaccination, and the phenotypic profile of peripheral and mucosal γδ T cells responding to vaccination. We observed robust local and systemic M. bovis-specific IFN-γ and IL-17 production by both γδ and CD4 T cells. Importantly, BCG vaccination induced effector and memory cell differentiation of γδ T cells in both the lower airways and peripheral blood, with accumulation of a large proportion of effector memory γδ T cells in both compartments. Our results demonstrate the potential of the neonatal calf model to evaluate TB vaccine candidates that are to be administered via the respiratory tract, and suggest that aerosol immunization is a promising strategy for engaging γδ T cells in vaccine-induced  against TB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690954>Predominance of M2 macrophages in gliomas leads to the suppression of local and systemic .</a></h1><p>Glioblastoma is a highly prevalent and aggressive form of primary brain tumor. It represents approximately 56% of all the newly diagnosed gliomas. Macrophages are one of the major constituents of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the human gliomas. The role of immunosuppressive macrophages is very well documented in correlation with the poor prognosis of patients suffering from breast, prostate, bladder and cervical cancers. The current study highlights the correlation between the tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes and glioma progression. We observed an increase in the pool of M2 macrophages in high-grade gliomas, as confirmed by their CD68 and CD163 double-positive phenotype. In contrast, less M1 macrophages were noticed in high-grade gliomas, as evidenced by the down-regulation in the expression of CCL3 marker. In addition, we observed that higher gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 is associated with glioma progression. The Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicate that glioma patients with lower expression of M2c marker (CD163), and higher expression of M1 marker (CCL3) had better survival. Furthermore, we examined the systemic immune response in the peripheral blood and noted a predominance of M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and PD-1 CD4 T cells in glioma patients. Thus, the study indicates a high gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 in high-grade gliomas as compared to low-grade gliomas and significantly elevated frequency of M2 macrophages and PD-1 CD4 T cells in the blood of tumor patients. These parameters could be used as an indicator of the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690029>A Marker-Free  / Double Deleted Mutant Confers Protection Against Lethal Challenge.</a></h1><p> is a leading cause of swine respiratory disorders which depict a great threat to well-flourished porcine industry.

TB incidence among migrants might be influenced by patterns of migration, but this is not well understood.AimTo investigate differences in TB risk across migrant groups according to migrant status and region of origin.MethodsThis prospective cohort study included migrants ≥ 18 years of age who obtained residency in Denmark between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2015, matched 1:6 to Danish-born individuals. Migrants were grouped according to legal status of residency and region of origin. Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated by Poisson regression.ResultsThe cohort included 142,314 migrants. Migrants had significantly higher TB incidence (IR: 120/100,000 person-years (PY); 95% confidence interval (CI): 115-126) than Danish-born individuals (IR: 4/100,000 PY; 95% CI: 3-4). The IRR was significantly higher in all migrant groups compared with Danish-born (p < 0.01). A particularly higher risk was seen among family-reunified to refugees (IRR: 61.8; 95% CI: 52.7-72.4), quota refugees (IRR: 46.0; 95% CI: 36.6-57.6) and former asylum seekers (IRR: 45.3; 95% CI: 40.2-51.1), whereas lower risk was seen among family-reunified to Danish/Nordic citizens (IRR 15.8; 95% CI: 13.6-18.4) and family-reunified to immigrants (IRR: 16.9; 95% CI: 13.5-21.3).DiscussionAll migrants had higher TB risk compared with the Danish-born population. While screening programmes focus mostly on asylum seekers, other migrant groups with high risk of TB are missed. Awareness of TB risk in all high-risk groups should be strengthened and screening programmes should be optimised.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696060>Epstein-Barr Virus BART Long Non-coding RNAs Function as Epigenetic Modulators in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes lifelong latent infection in humans and is associated with several lymphoid and epithelial cancers. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), EBV expresses few viral proteins but elevated levels of HI A rightward transcripts (BARTs) RNA, which includes viral microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). BART lncRNAs localize within the nucleus of EBV-infected cells and knockdown of BART lncRNAs significantly affects the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion, oxidoreductase activity, inflammation, and . Notably, downregulation of  family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos), which plays a role in lymphocyte development and cell attachment, occurred in NPC C666-1 cells following BART lncRNA-knockdown. Since Aiolos expression is normally restricted to lymphoid cells and rarely observed in epithelial cells, induction of Aiolos by BART lncRNA was confirmed by expressing the major BART lncRNA isoform, , in EBV-positive and -negative cells. BART lncRNA associated with the CBP/p300 complex and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the nucleus, suggesting that BART lncRNAs may mediate epigenetic regulation of gene expression through interaction with the chromatin remodeling machinery. This contention is further supported by evidence that BART lncRNA appears to stall Pol II at the promoter region and may regulate  and  expression by inhibiting transcription by Pol II in NPC. We hypothesize that EBV BART lncRNA expression modulates host gene expression and maintains EBV latency by interfering with histone methylation and acetylation processes. Aberrant expression of affected host genes mediated by BART lncRNA may lead to immune evasion, progression, and metastasis of NPC.Copyright © 2019 Verhoeven, Tong, Mok, Liu, He, Zong, Chen, Tsao, Lung and Chen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685545>The nature of anti-bacterial adaptive immune responses against  is dependent on the growth phase and extracellular peptidoglycan.</a></h1><p> have evolved different strategies to evade the immune response which play an important role in their pathogenesis.

The gastrointestinal tract is very important for the maintenance of homeostasis; it is the largest shelter for the billions of microorganisms in the body and CLRs play a crucial regulatory role in this system. This study focuses on several CLRs, including Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Dectin-3 and Mincle. We summarize the roles of CLRs in maintaining gastrointestinal immune-system homeostasis, especially their functions in mediating immune recognition and responses in the gut, discuss their relationships to some diseases, highlight the significance of CLR-mediated sensing of microbial and non-microbial compounds in the gut immune system and identify new therapeutic targets.© The Author(s) 2019.

This activation requires phosphorylation of key transcription factors regulating interferon (IFN) production and signaling, including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 1 (STAT1). The mechanisms regulating these STAT1 and IRF3 phosphorylation events remain unclear. Herein, using human and mouse cell lines, along with gene microarrays, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), viral infection and plaque assays, and reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that a bilaterian conserved microRNA (miRNA) cluster conserved among bilaterian animals, encoding miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183, regulates IFN signaling. In particular, we observed that the miR-183 cluster promotes IFN production and signaling, mediated through enhancing IRF3 and STAT1 phosphorylation. We also found that the miR-183 cluster activates the IFN pathway and inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection through direct targeting of several negative regulators of IRF3 and STAT1 activities, including protein phosphatase 2A (PPP2CA) and tripartite motif containing 27 (TRIM27).

Very recently, a new group of insect-specific viruses, the Mesoniviridae family, was discovered in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia. Here we report the first detection and isolation of a new virus belonging to Mesonivirus genus in Senegal, West Africa. The so-called Dianke virus was detected in 21 species of arthropods trapped in the eastern part of the country. Male individuals were also infected, supporting vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses. As described for other mesoniviruses, no viral replication was observed after inoculation of mammalian cells. Viral replication in mosquito cells was blocked at a temperature of 37 °C, highlighting the importance of thermal conditions in Mesonivirus host restriction. Similar to our study, where a diverse range of arthropod vectors were found infected by the new virus, several studies have detected mesonivirus infection in mosquitoes with concerns for human health. It has been shown that dual infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity. Due to their extensive geographic distribution and host range, as well as their use as potential disease control agents in vector populations, more studies should be done for a better knowledge of arthropod-restricted viruses prevalence and diversity.Copyright © 2019.

In addition, investigation of individual-level factors affecting mycobacterial-specific immune responses could provide insight into confounders of vaccine efficacy in clinical trials. Mycobacterial growth inhibition assays (MGIA) have been developed to assess vaccine immunogenicity ex vivo and provide a measure of immune function against live mycobacteria. In this study, we assessed the impact of immune cell phenotype, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific response and sex on ex vivo growth inhibition following historical BCG vaccination in a cohort of healthy individuals (n = 100). A higher frequency of cytokine-producing NK cells in peripheral blood was associated with enhanced ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition following historical BCG vaccination. A CMV-specific response was associated with T-cell activation, a risk factor for TB disease and we also observed an association between T-cell activation and ex vivo mycobacterial growth. Interestingly, BCG-vaccinated females in our cohort controlled mycobacterial growth better than males. In summary, our present study has shown that individual-level factors influence capacity to control mycobacterial growth following BCG vaccination and the MGIA could be used as a tool to assess how vaccine candidates may perform in different populations.Crown Copyright © 2019.

This is due in part to the emergence of high-throughput detection methods as well as the burst of discoveries showing biological function of select chemical marks. RNA modifications have been shown to affect RNA structure, localization, and functions such as alternative splicing, stabilizing transcripts, nuclear export, cap-dependent and cap-independent translation, microRNA biogenesis and binding, RNA degradation, and immune regulation.

The full-length cDNA of PcLGBP isoform1 was 1308 bp containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1113 bp encoding a protein of 370 amino acids. The full-length cDNA of PcLGBP isoform2 was 1440 bp containing an ORF of 1245 bp encoding a protein of 414 amino acids. Predicted PcLGBP isoform1 and PcLGBP isoform 2 proteins contained a signal peptide, a glycoside hydrolase domain, and a low-complexity region. The difference between the two LGBP isoforms was that PcLGBP isoform2 had 44 more amino acids behind the signal peptide than the PcLGBP isoform1. The PcLGBP isoform1 and PcLGBP isoform2 transcripts mainly expressed in the hepatopancreas in female and male crayfish. Moreover, the expression levels of the two genes in the hepatopancreas were higher in male than that in female crayfish. Upon being challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus or LPS, the expression levels of PcLGBP isoform1 and PcLGBP isoform2 in the hepatopancreas of female and male crayfish were most significantly up-regulated at different time points. The transcripts of anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALF5, ALF6, ALF8, and ALF9) and crustins (CRU1, CRU2, CRU3, and CRU4) were evidently down-regulated in the hepatopancreas of V. parahaemolyticus-challenged total PcLGBP (including PcLGBP isoform1 and PcLGBP isoform2)-silenced male crayfish. In addition, the phenoloxidase (PO) activity in the hepatopancreas of male crayfish was evidently higher than that of female crayfish. PcLGBP knock down could significantly decrease the PO activity in the hepatopancreas lysate (HLS) in male crayfish. The PO activity of male crayfish HLS was significantly increased when incubated with a mixture of recombinant LGBP protein and LPS or β-1, 3 glucan. We conclude that LGBP isoforms from P. clarkii function as a pattern recognition protein for recognizing and binding LPS and β-1, 3 glucan, and thus regulate the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and activate the prophenoloxidase system.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we demonstrate that hepatocytes can modulate T cell populations through engulfment of live CD4 lymphocytes. We term this phenomenon enclysis to reflect the specific enclosure of CD4 T cells in hepatocytes. Enclysis is selective for CD4 but not CD8 cells, independent of antigen-specific activation, and occurs in human hepatocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) facilitates T cell early adhesion and internalization, whereas hepatocytes form membrane lamellipodia or blebs to mediate engulfment. T cell internalization is unaffected by wortmannin and Rho kinase inhibition. Hepatocytes engulf Treg cells more efficiently than non-Treg cells, but Treg cell-containing vesicles preferentially acidify overnight.

Nevertheless, existing commercial vaccines face serious limitations such as availability during epidemic outbreaks and their efficacy. Existing seasonal influenza vaccines mostly induce antibody responses to the surface proteins of influenza viruses, which frequently change due to antigenic shift and or drift, thus allowing influenza viruses to avoid neutralizing antibodies. Hence, influenza vaccines need a yearly formulation to protect against new seasonal viruses. A broadly protective or universal influenza vaccine must induce effective humoral as well as cellular  against conserved influenza antigens, offer good protection against influenza pandemics, be safe, and have a fast production platform. Nanotechnology has great potential to improve vaccine delivery, immunogenicity, and host immune responses. As new strains of human epidemic influenza virus strains could originate from poultry and swine viruses, development of a new universal influenza vaccine will require the immune responses to be directed against viruses from different hosts.

Although multifactorial in nature, stroke-induced immunosuppression plays a key role in the development of SAP. Previous studies using a murine model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) have shown that focal ischemic stroke induction results in functional defects of lymphocytes in the spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood, leading to spontaneous bacterial infection in the lungs without inoculation. However, how ischemic stroke alters immune cell niche and the expression of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs has not been fully characterized.Ischemic stroke was induced in mice by tMCAO. Immune cell profiles in the brain and the lungs at 24- and 72-hour time points were compared by flow cytometric analysis. Cytokine and chemokine expression in the lungs were determined by multiplex bead arrays. Tissue damage and bacterial burden in the lungs following tMCAO were evaluated.Ischemic stroke increases the percentage of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and CD11b dendritic cells, but reduces the percentage of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and eosinophils in the lungs. The alteration of immune cell niche in the lungs coincides with a significant reduction in the levels of multiple chemokines in the lungs, including CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CXCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10.

YF disease is controlled by a live attenuated vaccine, 17D, which was generated empirically through serial passage of the wild-type (WT) strain Asibi in chicken tissue. The vaccine, which has been used for over 80 years, is considered to be one of the safest and most effective live attenuated vaccines. It has been shown that the humoral immune response is essential to a positive disease outcome during infection. As such, the neutralizing antibody response and its correlation to long-term protection are a critical measure of 17D efficacy. The primary target of these antibodies is the envelope (E) protein, which is the major component of the virion. Monoclonal antibodies can distinguish WT strain Asibi and vaccine strain 17D by many different measures, including physical binding, hemagglutination inhibition, neutralization, and passive protection.

After reporting a zebrafish hepatic lectin (Zhl), we identified a novel hepatic lectin (zebrafish hepatic lectin-like, Zhl-l) in zebrafish. The zhl-l was mainly expressed in liver in a tissue specific manner. And challenge with LPS/LTA induced a significant change of zhl-l expression. What's more, recombinant C-type lectin domain (rCTLD) of Zhl-l had the activity of agglutinating and binding to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It promoted the phagocytosis of bacteria by carp macrophages. Moreover, rCTLD could bind to insoluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) independent of Ca, which was inhibited by galactose. Interestingly, Zhl-l was located in the membrane, and its overexpression could upregulate the production of pre-inflammatory cytokines.

In particular, recent studies have shown that nanosize biological and inorganic particles (e.g., respiratory viruses and pollutants) are able to spread hematogenously across the placenta from mother to offspring and interfere with lung development during critical "windows of opportunity". Furthermore, the nutritional balance of maternal diet during pregnancy can affect postnatal lung structure and function. Adverse prenatal environmental conditions can predispose to increased airway reactivity by inducing aberrant cholinergic innervation of the respiratory tract, enhanced contractility of the airway smooth muscle, and impaired innate . Such changes can persist long after birth and might provide a plausible explanation to the development of chronic airway dysfunction in children, even in the absence of atopic predisposition. Insight into maternal-fetal interactions will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of highly prevalent diseases like bronchiolitis and asthma, and may lead to more precise preventative and therapeutic strategies, or new indications for existing ones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692883>The elusive "hunger protein": an appetite-stimulatory factor that is overabundant in human obesity.</a></h1><p>Paradoxically, most if not all previously known appetite-stimulatory hormones are downregulated in human obesity, reflecting failing homeostatic circuitries. Recently, we discovered that acyl-coenzyme-A binding protein/diazepam-binding inhibitor (ACBP/DBI) acts as a lipogenic and appetite stimulator, when systemically injected into mice. ACBP/DBI plasma levels are also elevated in obese subjects, supporting the notion that it may represent the elusive "hunger protein" that explains overeating in human obesity.© 2019 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, clinical trials aiming to detect predictive factors of disease, in individuals with a high risk of T1DM, reported negative results. Hence, actually there are no tools or strategies to prevent T1DM onset. The importance of the gut microbiome in autoimmune diseases is increasingly recognized and recent data suggest that intestinal dysbiosis has a pathogenic role in T1DM by affecting both intestinal immunostasis and the permeability of the gut barrier. An improved understanding of the mechanisms whereby dysbiosis in the gut favors T1DM development may help develop new intervention strategies to reduce both the incidence and burden of T1DM. This review summarizes available data on the associations between gut microbiota and T1DM in both experimental animals and humans and discusses future perspectives in this novel and exciting area of research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682919>Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA and mRNA profiles in PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages.</a></h1><p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), is one of the most globally devastating swine diseases. It is essential to develop new strategy to control PRRS via an understanding of mechanisms that PRRSV utilizes to interfere with the host's innate . In this study, we deeply sequenced and analyzed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression profiles of the porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) after PRRSV infection. 126 lncRNAs and 753 mRNAs were differentially expressed between PRRSV-infected and control PAMs. The co-expressed genes of down-regulated lncRNAs were significantly enriched within NF-kappa B and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Co-expression network analysis indicated that part of the dysregulated lncRNAs associated with the interferon-induced genes. These dysregulated lncRNAs may play an important role in the host's innate immune responses to PRRSV infection. However, further research is required to characterize the function of these lncRNAs.Copyright © 2019.

The roles of these cells in the bovine species are poorly defined, because the characterization of bovine Th17 cells lags behind for want of straightforward cultivation and isolation procedures. We have developed procedures to differentiate, expand, and isolate bovine Th17 cells from circulating CD4+ T cells of adult cows. Using polyclonal stimulation with antibodies to CD3 and CD28, we expanded IL-17A-positive CD4+ T cells in a serum-free cell culture medium supplemented with TGF-β1, IL-6 and IL-2. Populations of CD4+ T cells producing IL-17A or IFN-γ or both cytokines were obtained. Isolation of IL-17A-secreting CD4+ T cells was performed by labelling surface IL-17A, followed by flow cytometry cell sorting. The sorted Th17 cells were restimulated and could be expanded for several weeks. These cells were further characterized by cytokine profiling at transcriptomic and protein levels. They produced high amounts of IL-17A and IL-17F, and moderate amounts of IL-22 and IFN-γ. The techniques developed will be useful to characterize the phenotypic and functional properties of bovine Th17 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686028>Staphylococcus aureus small colony variants impair host  by activating host cell glycolysis and inducing necroptosis.</a></h1><p>Staphylococcus aureus small colony variants (SCVs) are frequently associated with chronic infection, yet they lack expression of many virulence determinants associated with the pathogenicity of wild-type strains. We found that both wild-type S. aureus and a ΔhemB SCV prototype potently activate glycolysis in host cells. Glycolysis and the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were sufficient to induce necroptosis, a caspase-independent mechanism of host cell death that failed to eradicate S. aureus and instead promoted ΔhemB SCV pathogenicity. To support ongoing glycolytic activity, the ΔhemB SCV induced over a 100-fold increase in the expression of fumC, which encodes an enzyme that catalyses the degradatin of fumarate, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Consistent with fumC-dependent depletion of local fumarate, the ΔhemB SCV failed to elicit trained  and protection from a secondary infectious challenge in the skin. The reliance of the S. aureus SCV population on glycolysis accounts for much of its role in the pathogenesis of S. aureus skin infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682273>Fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693395>What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Weaker.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686798>Contributions of cardiovascular risk and smoking to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related changes in brain structure and function.</a></h1><p>Brain damage and cardiovascular disease are extra-pulmonary manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cardiovascular risk factors and smoking are contributors to neurodegeneration. This study investigates whether there is a specific, COPD-related deterioration in brain structure and function independent of cardiovascular risk factors and smoking.Neuroimaging and clinical markers of brain structure (micro- and macro-) and function (cognitive function and mood) were compared between 27 stable COPD patients (age: 63.0±9.1 years, 59.3% male, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV]: 58.1±18.0% pred.) and 23 non-COPD controls with >10 pack years smoking (age: 66.6±7.5 years, 52.2% male, FEV: 100.6±19.1% pred.). Clinical relationships and group interactions with brain structure were also tested. All statistical analyses included correction for cardiovascular risk factors, smoking, and aortic stiffness.COPD patients had significantly worse cognitive function (0.011), lower mood (0.046), and greater gray matter atrophy (=0.020). In COPD patients, lower mood was associated with markers of white matter (WM) microstructural damage (<0.001), and lower lung function (FEV/forced vital capacity and FEV) with markers of both WM macro (=0.047) and microstructural damage (=0.028).COPD is associated with both structural (gray matter atrophy) and functional (worse cognitive function and mood) brain changes that cannot be explained by measures of cardiovascular risk, aortic stiffness, or smoking history alone. These results have important implications to guide the development of new interventions to prevent or delay progression of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in COPD. Relationships found between mood and microstructural abnormalities suggest that in COPD, anxiety, and depression may occur secondary to WM damage. This could be used to better understand disabling symptoms such as breathlessness, improve health status, and reduce hospital admissions.© 2019 Spilling et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691025>Aging results in accumulation of M1 and M2 hepatic macrophages and a differential response to gadolinium chloride.</a></h1><p>Macrophages have vital roles in innate  by modulating the inflammatory response via their ability to alter their phenotype from pro-inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2). Aging increases activation of the innate immune system, and macrophage numbers increase in the aged liver. Since macrophages also produce free radical molecules, they are a potential source of age-related oxidative injury in the liver. This study evaluated macrophage phenotype in the aged liver and whether the increase in the number of macrophages with aging is associated with enhanced hepatic oxidative stress. Hepatic macrophage phenotype and oxidative stress were evaluated 2 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of saline or gadolinium chloride (GdCl, 10 mg/kg) in young (6 months) and aged (24 months) Fischer 344 rats. GdCl has been shown to decrease the expression of macrophage-specific markers and impair macrophage phagocytosis in the liver. Saline-treated aged rats demonstrated greater numbers of both M1 (HO-1/iNOS) and M2 (HO-1/CD163) macrophages, without evidence of a phenotypic shift. GdCl did not alter levels of dihydroethidium fluorescence or malondialdehyde, suggesting that macrophages are not a major contributor to steady-state levels of oxidative stress. However, GdCl decreased M1 and M2 macrophage markers in both age groups, an effect that was attenuated in aged rats. In old animals, GdCl decreased iNOS expression to a greater extent than HO-1 or CD163. These results suggest a novel effect of aging on macrophage biology and that GdCl shifts hepatic macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype in aged animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691970>Effect of gingival phenotype on the maintenance of periodontal health: an american academy of periodontology best evidence review.</a></h1><p>Gingival thickness, keratinized tissue width and bone morphotype are three important parameters used to categorize periodontal phenotypes. These elements all play an important role in the maintenance of periodontal health. The aim of this review was to explore the importance of converting thin phenotype into a thick phenotype for periodontal health maintenance.Three clinically relevant focus questions were defined to understand the role of gingival phenotype around teeth. 1) What are the factors affecting gingival phenotype (Ex. age, gender, dental arch, race, crown forms, etc.)? 2) Is there difference between thin versus thick gingival phenotype in terms of gingival health? 3) Does the conversion of gingivae from a thin to thick gingival phenotype in sites without mucogingival defects helps with periodontal health maintenance?Extensive electronic and manual literature search identified a total of 1,129 citations. After title, abstract and full-text screenings, 30 articles were included in the present review. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and provided data for focus question 1. It was found that periodontal phenotype varies among different individuals and different areas of the mouth within the same individual. Asian individuals tend to have thinner gingival phenotype compared to Caucasian subjects. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for the focus question 2. Prevalence and severity of gingival recession was higher at the sites with thin gingiva compared to the sites with thicker gingiva. No studies provided data for the focus question 3.Available evidence indicates that subjects with thin and narrow gingiva tend to have more gingival recession compared to those with thick and wide gingiva. Currently, there is no published evidence to support conversion of thin to thick gingival phenotype in sites without gingival recession or mucogingival deformity.

X chromosome-dosage increases susceptibility to SLE and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Chromosome X open reading frame 21  escapes X-inactivation and is an SLE risk gene of previously unknown function. We undertook the present study to delineate the function of CXorf21 in the immune system as well as investigate a potential role in the sex bias of SLE and pSS.  Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, as well as  CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments were employed to delineate the role of CXorf21 in relevant immunocytes.  Expressed in monocytes and B cells,  basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found  mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and  knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased  mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of -deficient female monocytes.  CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, sexually dimorphic expression of CXorf21 skews cellular immune responses in manner consistent with expected properties of a mediator of the X chromosome dose risk in SLE and pSS.Copyright © 2019 Harris, Koelsch, Kurien, Harley, Wren, Harley and Scofield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684953>Beyond defense: regulation of neuronal morphogenesis and brain functions via Toll-like receptors.</a></h1><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are well known as critical pattern recognition receptors that trigger innate immune responses. In addition, TLRs are expressed in neurons and may act as the gears in the neuronal detection/alarm system for making good connections. As neuronal differentiation and circuit formation take place along with programmed cell death, neurons face the challenge of connecting with appropriate targets while avoiding dying or dead neurons. Activation of neuronal TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 with nucleic acids negatively modulates neurite outgrowth and alters synapse formation in a cell-autonomous manner. It consequently influences neural connectivity and brain function and leads to deficits related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, neuronal TLR activation does not simply duplicate the downstream signal pathways and effectors of classical innate immune responses. The differences in spatial and temporal expression of TLRs and their ligands likely account for the diverse signaling pathways of neuronal TLRs. In conclusion, the accumulated evidence strengthens the idea that the innate immune system of neurons serves as an alarm system that responds to exogenous pathogens as well as intrinsic danger signals and fine-tune developmental processes of neurons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684006>SIRT1-Mediated Protective Effect of  (Miq.)

Seem (AS) is widely been for treating many diseases, enhancing energy, and boosting ; however, its protective effects against high-glucose (HG)-triggered endothelial dysfunction and the potential underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, we determined the effect of AS on senescence in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and elucidated the mechanisms underlying its anti-aging effects. The senescence model of endothelial cells (ECs) was established by culturing HUVECs in media containing HG (30 mM). We found that the proportion of senescent (senescence-associated β-galactosidase+) cells in the HG group was significantly higher than that in the control group; however, this increase was suppressed by AS treatment. Moreover, cell cycle analysis revealed that AS (20 μg/mL) significantly recovered HG-induced cell cycle arrest in ECs, and Western blot revealed that AS prevented HG-induced decreases in silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) level and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation. These results show that AS delayed HG-induced senescence in ECs by modulation of the SIRT1/5' AMP-activated protein kinase and AKT/eNOS pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689522>Immunobiology and Application of Toll-like Receptor 4 Agonists to Augment Host Resistance to Infection.</a></h1><p>Infectious diseases remain a threat to critically ill patients, particularly with the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Septic shock carries a mortality of up to ∼40% with no compelling evidence of promising therapy to reduce morbidity or mortality. Septic shock survivors are also prone to nosocomial infections. Treatment with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists have demonstrated significant protection against common nosocomial pathogens in various clinically relevant models of infection and septic shock. TLR4 agonists are derived from a bacteria cell wall or synthesized de novo, and more recently novel small molecule TLR4 agonists have also been developed. TLR4 agonists augment innate immune functions including expansion and recruitment of innate leukocytes to the site of infection. Recent studies demonstrate TLR4-induced leukocyte metabolic reprogramming of cellular metabolism to improve antimicrobial function. Metabolic changes include sustained augmentation of macrophage glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. These findings set the stage for the use of TLR4 agonists as standalone therapeutic agents or antimicrobial adjuncts in patient populations vulnerable to nosocomial infections.Copyright © 2019.

Their common ligand is growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6). The GAS6/TAM signaling pathway regulates many important cell processes and plays an essential role in , hemostasis, and erythropoiesis. In cancer, AXL overexpression and activation has been associated with cell proliferation, chemotherapy resistance, tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis; and has been correlated with a poor prognosis. In hematological malignancies, the expression and function of AXL is highly diverse, not only between the different tumor types but also in the surrounding tumor microenvironment. Most research and clinical evidence has been provided for AXL inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia. However, recent studies also revealed an important role of AXL in lymphoid leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In this review, we summarize the basic functions of AXL in various cell types and the role of AXL in different hematological cancers, with a focus on AXL in the dormancy of multiple myeloma. In addition, we provide an update on the most promising AXL inhibitors currently in preclinical/clinical evaluation and discuss future perspectives in this emerging field.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689085>Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy of a Surface-Engineered Antigenic Microparticle Vaccine by Synergistically Modulating Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h1><p>Efficient cancer vaccines not only require the co-delivery of potent antigens and highly immunostimulatory adjuvants to initiate robust tumor-specific host immune response but also solve the spatiotemporal consistency of host  and tumor microenvironment (TME) immunomodulation. Here, we designed a biomaterials-based strategy for converting tumor-derived antigenic microparticles (T-MPs) into a cancer vaccine to meet this conundrum and demonstrated its therapeutic potential in multiple murine tumor models. The internal cavity of T-MPs was employed to store nano-FeO (FeO/T-MPs), and then dense adjuvant CpG-loaded liposome arrays (CpG/Lipo) were tethered on the surface of FeO/T-MP through mild surface engineering to get a vaccine (FeO/T-MPs-CpG/Lipo), demonstrating that co-delivery of FeO/T-MPs and CpG/Lipo to antigen presenting cells (APCs) could elicit strong tumor antigen-specific host immune response. Meanwhile, vaccines distributed in the TME could reverse infiltrated tumor-associated macrophages into a tumor-suppressive M1 phenotype by nano-FeO, amazingly induce abundant infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and transform a "cold" tumor into a "hot" tumor. Furthermore, amplified antitumor  was realized by the combination of an FeO/T-MPs-CpG/Lipo vaccine and immune checkpoint PD-L1 blockade, specifically inhibiting ∼83% of the progression of B16F10-bearing mice and extending the median survival time to 3 months. Overall, this study synergistically modulates the tumor immunosuppressive network and host antitumor  in a spatiotemporal manner, which suggests a general cell-engineering strategy tailored to a personalized vaccine from autologous cancer cell materials of each individual patient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687902>Immune Evasion Strategies Used by Zika Virus to Infect the Fetal Eye and Brain.</a></h1><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that caused a public health emergency in the Americas when an outbreak in Brazil became linked to congenital microcephaly. Understanding how ZIKV could evade the innate immune defenses of the mother, placenta, and fetus has become central to determining how the virus can traffic into the fetal brain. ZIKV, like other flaviviruses, evades host innate immune responses by leveraging viral proteins and other processes that occur during viral replication to allow spread to the placenta. Within the placenta, there are diverse cell types with coreceptors for ZIKV entry, creating an opportunity for the virus to establish a reservoir for replication and infect the fetus. The fetal brain is vulnerable to ZIKV, particularly during the first trimester, when it is beginning a dynamic process, to form highly complex and specialized regions orchestrated by neuroprogenitor cells. In this review, we provide a conceptual framework to understand the different routes for viral trafficking into the fetal brain and the eye, which are most likely to occur early and later in pregnancy. Based on the injury profile in human and nonhuman primates, ZIKV entry into the fetal brain likely occurs across both the blood/cerebrospinal fluid barrier in the choroid plexus and the blood/brain barrier. ZIKV can also enter the eye by trafficking across the blood/retinal barrier. Ultimately, the efficient escape of innate immune defenses by ZIKV is a key factor leading to viral infection. However, the host immune response against ZIKV can lead to injury and perturbations in developmental programs that drive cellular division, migration, and brain growth. The combined effect of innate immune evasion to facilitate viral propagation and the maternal/placental/fetal immune response to control the infection will determine the extent to which ZIKV can injure the fetal brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687043>Simultaneous production of DHA and squalene from  sp. grown on forest biomass hydrolysates.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence points to the nutritional importance of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the human diet. Thraustochytrids are heterotrophic marine oleaginous microorganisms capable of synthesizing high amounts of DHA, as well as other nutraceutical compounds such as squalene, in their cellular compartment. Squalene is a natural triterpene and an important biosynthetic precursor to all human steroids. It has a wide range of applications in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, with benefits that include boosting  and antioxidant activity. Apart from its nutritional quality, it can also be utilized for high-grade bio-jet fuel by catalytic conversion.In the present study, the potential of thraustochytrid strain  sp. T66 to produce DHA and squalene was evaluated. When the strain was cultivated on organosolv-pretreated birch hydrolysate (30 g/L glucose) in flask, it resulted in 10.39 g/L of cell dry weight and 4.98 g/L of total lipids, of which 25.98% was DHA. In contrast, when the strain was grown in a bioreactor, cell dry weight, total lipid, and DHA increased to 11.24 g/L, 5.90 g/L, and 35.76%, respectively. The maximum squalene yield was 69.31 mg/g (0.72 g/L) when the strain was cultivated in flask, but it increased to 88.47 mg/g (1.0 g/L), when cultivation shifted to a bioreactor.This is the first report demonstrating the utilization of low cost non-edible lignocellulosic feedstock to cultivate the marine oleaginous microorganism  sp. for the production of nutraceutical vital compounds.

Many investigations have found morbid proliferation and/or activation of Tfh cells in systemic autoimmune and allergic diseases. It is also known that Tfh cells are regulated by regulatory B (Breg) cells in the deteriorating such diseases. Recently, CXCL13, a ligand of CXCR5, has been reported to increase in the peripheral blood and lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to investigate the involvement of Tfh cells and Breg cells in IPF.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 18 patients with IPF. We isolated heparinized peripheral blood mononuclear cells and investigated the proportions of Breg cells, Tfh cells, PD-1ICOS Tfh cells (activated form of Tfh cells), and the Tfh-cell subsets by flow cytometry. These cell profiles were compared with those of 21 healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated the correlations between profiles of lymphocytes and lung physiology.The median proportions of Tfh cells per total CD4 T cells and of PD-1ICOS proportion of Tfh cells per total Tfh cells was significantly more in the IPF patients (20.4 and 5.2%, respectively) compared with healthy controls (15.4 and 2.1%, respectively; p = 0.042 and p = 0.004, respectively). The proportion of Tfh2 cells per total Tfh cells was significantly higher and the proportion of Tfh17 was smaller in the IPF patients than healthy controls. The percentage of Breg cells to total B cells was significantly decreased in the IPF patients (median, 8.5%) compared with that in the controls (median, 19.7%; p < 0.001). The proportion of Breg cells was positively correlated with the annual relative change in diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide in the IPF patients (r = 0.583, p = 0.018).Proliferation and activation of Tfh cells and a decrease in Breg cells were observed in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF. The profile of the Tfh-cell subset also changed.

Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling pathways modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, metabolism, KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related pathways such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696946>Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.</a></h1><p>Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining , the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular , and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The USA Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus, live zoster vaccine (LZV), for clinical use amongst older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), has also been approved. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last updated in 2016.To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.For this 2019 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, January 2019), MEDLINE (1948 to January 2019), Embase (2010 to January 2019), CINAHL (1981 to January 2019), LILACS (1982 to January 2019), WHO ICTRP (on 31 January 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov (on 31 January 2019).We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine (any dose and potency) versus any other type of intervention (e.g. varicella vaccine, antiviral medication), placebo, or no intervention (no vaccine). Outcomes were incidence of herpes zoster, adverse events (death, serious adverse events, systemic reactions, or local reaction occurring at any time after vaccination), and dropouts.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.We included 11 new studies involving 18,615 participants in this update. The review now includes a total of 24 studies involving 88,531 participants. Only three studies assessed the incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan. Fifteen studies used LZV. Nine studies tested an RZV. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Most data for the primary outcome (incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-quality evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6) of mild to moderate intensity (moderate-quality evidence). These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or over. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-quality evidence). There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that there symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All of the other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV and RZV are effective in preventing herpes zoster disease for up to three years (the main studies did not follow participants for more than three years). To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity.Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are in development, most of which target the transmission stage (i.e., gametocyte) antigens Pfs230 and Pfs48/45. For these interventions to be implemented, there is a need to understand the naturally acquired  to gametocytes. Several studies have measured the prevalence of immune responses to Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 in populations in malaria-endemic areas.  We conducted a systematic review of studies carried out in African populations that measured the prevalence of immune responses to the gametocyte antigens Pfs230 and Pfs48/45. We assessed seroprevalence of antibody responses to the two antigens and investigated the effects of covariates such as age, transmission intensity/endemicity, season, and parasite prevalence on the prevalence of these antibody responses by meta-regression.  We identified 12 studies covering 23 sites for inclusion in the analysis. We found that the range of reported seroprevalence to Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 varied widely across studies, from 0 to 64% for Pfs48/45 and from 6 to 72% for Pfs230. We also found a modest association between increased age and increased seroprevalence to Pfs230: adults were associated with higher seroprevalence estimates in comparison to children (β coefficient 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05-0.38,  = 0.042). Methodological factors were the most significant contributors to heterogeneity between studies which prevented calculation of pooled prevalence estimates.  Naturally acquired sexual stage , as detected by antibodies to Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, was present in most studies analyzed. Significant between-study heterogeneity was seen, and methodological factors were a major contributor to this, and prevented further analysis of epidemiological and biological factors. This demonstrates a need for standardized protocols for conducting and reporting seroepidemiological analyses.Copyright © 2019 Muthui, Kamau, Bousema, Blagborough, Bejon and Kapulu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689241>NKp46-expressing human gut-resident intraepithelial Vδ1 T cell subpopulation exhibits high anti-tumor activity against colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>γδ T cells account for a large fraction of human intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) endowed with potent anti-tumor activities. However, little is known about their origin, phenotype and clinical relevance in colorectal cancer (CRC). To determine γδ IEL gut-specificity, homing and functions, γδ T cells were purified from human healthy blood, lymph nodes, liver, skin, intestine either disease-free or affected by CRC or generated from thymic precursors. The constitutive expression of NKp46 specifically identifies a new subset of cytotoxic Vδ1 T cells representing the largest fraction of gut-resident IELs. The ontogeny and gut-tropism of NKp46pos/Vδ1 IELs depends both on distinctive features of Vδ1 thymic precursors and gut-environmental factors. Either the constitutive presence of NKp46 on tissue-resident Vδ1 intestinal IELs or its induced-expression on IL-2/IL-15 activated Vδ1 thymocytes are associated with anti-tumor functions. Higher frequencies of NKp46pos/Vδ1 IELs in tumor-free specimens from CRC patients correlate with a lower risk of developing metastatic III/IV disease stages. Additionally, our in vitro settings reproducing CRC tumor-microenvironment inhibited the expansion of NKp46pos/Vδ1 cells from activated thymic precursors. These results parallel the very low frequencies of NKp46pos/Vδ1 IELs able to infiltrate CRC, thus providing new insights to either follow-up cancer progression or develop novel adoptive cellular therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682923>In vitro production of synthetic viral RNAs and their delivery into mammalian cells and the application of viral RNAs in the study of innate interferon responses.</a></h1><p>Mammalian cells express different types of RNA molecules that can be classified as protein coding RNAs (mRNA) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) the latter of which have housekeeping and regulatory functions in cells. Cellular RNAs are not recognized by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and innate  is not activated. RNA viruses encode and express RNA molecules that usually differ from cell-specific RNAs and they include for instance 5'capped and 5'mono- and triphosphorylated RNAs, small viral RNAs and viral RNA-protein complexes called vRNPs. These molecules are recognized by certain members of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) families leading to activation of innate immune responses and the production of antiviral cytokines, such as type I and type III interferons (IFNs). Virus-specific ssRNA and dsRNA molecules that mimic the viral genomic RNAs or their replication intermediates can efficiently be produced by bacteriophage T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and bacteriophage phi6 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. These molecules can then be delivered into mammalian cells and the mechanisms of activation of innate immune responses can be studied. In addition, synthetic viral dsRNAs can be processed to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by a Dicer enzyme to produce a swarm of antiviral siRNAs. Here we describe the biology of RNAs, their in vitro production and delivery into mammalian cells as well as how these molecules can be used to inhibit virus replication and to study the mechanisms of activation of the innate immune system.Copyright © 2019.

Exosomes are endocytic-derived vesicles released by cells, representing an important mode of intercellular communication. In exosomes, specific molecules of proteins, lipids, and mRNAs or miRNAs have been detected, some of which are capable of transferring biologically active molecules to recipient cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the only antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that activate the initial immune response. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the exosomal miRNA profile of DC2.4 cells infected with  for 28 h, compared with those of uninfected DC2.4 cells. Differential exosomal miRNAs (DEmiRs) from these two cell groups were analyzed. Through high-throughput sequencing, 3434 DEmiRs were obtained, and 12 stably enriched DEmiRNAs were verified by Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and selected for further analysis. The target genes of these 12 miRNAs were predicted with online analysis software and subjected to bioinformatics analyses including protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, key driver analysis (KDA), gene ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.

Previous studies showed that LCNEC with different genomic characteristics might respond differently to different chemotherapy regimens. In this study, we sought to investigate genomic subtyping using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis in advanced LCNEC and assess its potential prognostic and predictive value.Tumor DNA and cfDNA from 63 patients with LCNEC were analyzed by target-captured sequencing. Survival and response analyses were applied to 54 patients with advanced-stage incurable disease who received first line chemotherapy.The mutation landscape of frequently mutated cancer genes in LCNEC from cfDNA closely resembled that from tumor DNA, which led to a 90% concordance in genomic subtyping. The 63 LCNEC patients were classified into small cell lung cancer (SCLC)-like and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-like LCNEC based on corresponding genomic features derived from tumor DNA and/or cfDNA. Overall, patients with SCLC-like LCNEC had a shorter overall survival (OS) than those with NSCLC-like LCNEC despite higher response rate (RR) to chemotherapy. Furthermore, treatment with etoposide-platinum was associated with superior response and survival in SCLC-like LCNEC compared to pemetrexed-platinum and gemcitabine/taxane-platinum doublets, while treatment with gemcitabine/taxane-platinum led to a shorter survival compared to etoposide-platinum or pemetrexed-platinum in NSCLC-like LCNEC patients.Genomic subtyping has potentials in prognostication and therapeutic decision-making for patients with LCNEC and cfDNA analysis may be a reliable alternative for genomic profiling of LCNEC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697335>Antibiotic appropriateness and guideline adherence in hospitalized children: results of a nationwide study.</a></h1><p>Information on the nature and appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for children in hospitals is important, but scarce.To analyse antimicrobial prescribing and appropriateness, and guideline adherence, in hospitalized children across Australia.We analysed data from the National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (NAPS) from 2014 to 2017. Surveys were performed in hospital facilities of all types (public and private; major city, regional and remote). Participants were admitted children <18 years old. Risk factors associated with inappropriate prescribing were explored using logistic regression models.Among 6219 prescriptions for 3715 children in 253 facilities, 19.6% of prescriptions were deemed inappropriate. Risk factors for inappropriate prescribing included non-tertiary paediatric hospital admission [OR 1.37 (95% CI 1.20-1.55)] and non-major city hospital location [OR 1.52 (95% CI 1.30-1.77)]. Prescriptions for neonates, immunocompromised children and those admitted to an ICU were less frequently inappropriate. If a restricted antimicrobial was prescribed and not approved, the prescription was more likely to be inappropriate [OR 12.9 (95% CI 8.4-19.8)]. Surgical prophylaxis was inappropriate in 59% of prescriptions.Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing in children was linked to specific risk factors identified here, presenting opportunities for targeted interventions to improve prescribing. This information, using a NAPS dataset, allows for analysis of antimicrobial prescribing among different groups of hospitalized children. Further exploration of barriers to appropriate prescribing and facilitators of best practice in this population is recommended.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the currently available ICD inducers are still very limited and photosensitizer-based ones can hardly induce sufficient ICD to achieve satisfactory cancer immunotherapy by themselves. Herein, an organic photosensitizer (named TPE-DPA-TCyP) with a twisted molecular structure, strong aggregation-induced emission activity, and specific ability is reported for effectively inducing focused mitochondrial oxidative stress of cancer cells, which can serve as a much superior ICD inducer to the popularly used ones, including chlorin e6 (Ce6), pheophorbide A, and oxaliplatin. Furthermore, more effective in vivo ICD immunogenicity of TPE-DPA-TCyP than Ce6 is also demonstrated using a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. The underlying mechanism of the effectiveness and robustness of TPE-DPA-TCyP in inducing antitumor  and immune-memory effect in vivo is verified by immune cell analyses. This study thus reveals that inducing focused mitochondrial oxidative stress is a highly effective strategy to evoke abundant and large-scale ICD.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Since 2007, fatigue has been included as one of the core outcome measures in RA. Clinical trials of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) have included fatigue as a secondary endpoint. A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that the bDMARDs have a moderate effect on improving fatigue in RA. More recent clinical trials of the new biologic agent sarilumab and the Janus kinase inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib showed similar benefits. It remains unclear whether the effect of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs on fatigue is mediated by direct effects or through a reduction in inflammation. As fatigue was a secondary endpoint, many analyses did not adjust for potential confounding factors, including pain, mood and anaemia, which is a significant limitation.© The Author(s) 2019.

The acronym 'CRISPR-Cas' stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated genes. This genetic organization exists in prokaryotic organisms and aids in the development of adaptive  since a protein called Cas9 nuclease cleaves specific target nucleic acid sequences from foreign invaders and destroys them. This mode of action has gained interest of the researchers to understand the insights of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Here, we review that CRISPR-Cas organization is restricted to two classes and possesses different protein effectors. We also review the architecture of CRISPR loci, mechanism involved in genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 technology and pathways of repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated during the process of genome editing. This review also presents the strategies to increase the Cas9 specificity and reduce off-target activity to achieve accurate genome editing. Further, this review provides information on CRISPR tools used for genome editing, databases that are required for storing data on loci, strategies for delivering CRISPR-Cas9 to cells under study and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 to various fields. Safety measures are implemented on this technology to avoid misuse or ethical issues.

Protozoal infections comprise a group of diseases that together affect billions of people worldwide and, according to the World Health Organization, are responsible for more than 500000 deaths annually. They include African and American trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, toxoplasmosis, and amoebiasis. Mechanisms underlying invasion of the brain parenchyma by protozoa are not well understood and may depend on parasite nature: a vascular invasion route is most common. Immunosuppression favors parasite invasion into the CNS and therefore the host immune response plays a pivotal role in the development of a neuropathology in these infectious diseases. In the brain, microglia are the resident immune cells active in defense against pathogens that target the CNS. Beside their direct role in innate , they also play a principal role in coordinating the trafficking and recruitment of other immune cells from the periphery to the CNS. Despite their evident involvement in the neuropathology of protozoan infections, little attention has given to microglia-parasite interactions. This review describes the most prominent features of microglial cells and protozoan parasites and summarizes the most recent information regarding the reaction of microglial cells to parasitic infections. We highlight the involvement of the periphery-brain axis and emphasize possible scenarios for microglia-parasite interactions.© 2019 The Authors.

Previously, we demonstrated that TRIM6 is involved in IFN-I induction and signaling. In the absence of TRIM6, optimal IFN-I signaling is reduced, allowing increased replication of interferon-sensitive viruses. Despite having evolved numerous mechanisms to restrict the vertebrate host's IFN-I response, West Nile virus (WNV) replication is sensitive to pre-treatment with IFN-I. However, the regulators and products of the IFN-I pathway that are important in regulating WNV replication are incompletely defined. Consistent with WNV's sensitivity to IFN-I, we found that in TRIM6 knockout (TRIM6-KO) A549 cells WNV replication is significantly increased and IFN-I induction and signaling is impaired compared to wild-type (wt) cells. IFNβ pre-treatment was more effective in protecting against subsequent WNV infection in wt cells as compared to TRIM6-KO, indicating that TRIM6 contributes to the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral response against WNV. Using next generation sequencing, we identified VAMP8 as a potential factor involved in this TRIM6-mediated antiviral response. VAMP8 knockdown resulted in reduced Jak1 and STAT1 phosphorylation and impaired induction of several ISGs following WNV infection or IFNβ treatment. Furthermore, VAMP8-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation required the presence of TRIM6. Therefore, the VAMP8 protein is a novel regulator of IFN-I signaling, and its expression and function is dependent on TRIM6 activity. Overall, these results provide evidence that TRIM6 contributes to the antiviral response against WNV and identified VAMP8 as a novel regulator of the IFN-I system. WNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses threat to human health across large discontinuous areas throughout the world. Infection with WNV results in febrile illness, which can progress to severe neurological disease. Currently, there are no approved treatment options to control WNV infection. Understanding the cellular immune responses that regulate viral replication is important in diversifying the resources available to control WNV. Here we show that the elimination of TRIM6 in human cells results in an increase in WNV replication and alters the expression and function of other components of the IFN-I pathway through VAMP8. Dissecting the interactions between WNV and host defenses both informs basic molecular virology and promotes the development of host- and viral-targeted antiviral strategies.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689903>Emerging Highly Virulent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus: Molecular Mechanisms of Attenuation and Rational Design of Live Attenuated Vaccines.</a></h1><p>The highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged in China in 2010. It infects pigs of all ages, and causes severe diarrhea and high mortality rates in newborn pigs, leading to devastating economic losses in the pork industry worldwide.

Today, the pathogenesis of BD remains mostly unknown. It is also suggested that the disease is probably related to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and innate  damages were perceived as key in its pathologic process. Only 5% of BD patients have neurological involvement, and it usually occurs in 4-6 years after the initial symptoms. Early onset of neurological impairment makes it difficult to diagnose and treat definitely.  A 38-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with numbness and weakness of the left extremities. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed focal infarction in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Skin pathology suggested small vessel vasculitis, and high-resolution MRI revealed intracranial arteritis. The patient had a negative skin pathery test and then developed a scar at the venous puncture site at the early stage of disease. Laboratory examination showed that interleukin 8 (IL-8) increased. The patient was treated with an immunosuppressive agent including mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine. All symptoms were alleviated after half a year's treatment. There was neither stroke nor recurrence of oral ulcer thereafter.  This case demonstrates that neurological involvement might be an early symptom of BD. IL-8 could act as a novel target for the treatment of BD theoretically and probably play a key role in disease recovery.Copyright © 2019 Yin, Song, Zheng, Han and Tang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695696>Gene- and Disease-Based Expansion of the Knowledge on Inborn Errors of .</a></h1><p>The recent report of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) has provided the categorized list of 354 inborn errors of .

Adaptive  is principally founded on T-cell and B-cell populations, but also includes the host microbiome. The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with a great organism diversity and refined genomic structure that resides in the intestinal tract and has a central position in human health and disease.5 Neuroimmune dysregulation, relying of the highly sensitive and fine-tuned equilibrium between microbiome and adaptive , can tip the scales towards neuroinflammation and disruption of higher-order brain networks.4,6,7 During the last decade, the human microbiome and the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB)-axis have become a novel epicentre in mental health research as a potentially vital new determinant in the field of neuroimmunoregulation, brain development, emotions, cognition and behaviour.7 The MGB-axis represents a bidirectional, key communication pathway between the immune system and the brain, thus partly also mediating the regulation of cognitive and emotional processing. An imbalanced human microbiome might greatly influence proper neuroimmune reactions and neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects and could thus play a pivotal role in the susceptibility and aetiology of psychiatric illness. Recent research offers first evidence that patients with SCZ show marked disturbances of gut bacterial taxa composition with a decreased microbiome diversity index, party associated with specific SCZ phenotype, symptom severity and treatment response.8,9 As the elegant education of the adaptive immune compartment depends on the colonization niche, antigen type and metabolic property of different gut microbes, T-cell differentiation as well as a continuous diversification of B-cell repertoire is expressed through microbiome-related, antigen-specific receptors that define a unique clonotype.10 However, there is only sparse evidence on the precise role of the microbiome on the programming of T- and B-cells in the underlying neurobiological pathways of SCZ and even less findings on the association of molecular T- and B-cell receptor repertoire signature and microbiome clonal landscape with specific phenotypical features of the disease.11 The latest conceptual advances in immunology urge an integrative re-evaluation of previous immunological findings in SCZ through modern approaches. High-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a powerful singlecell transcriptomic tool to profile the whole clonal landscape of T and B cells and human microbiome. NGS thus offers a unique opportunity for in-depth characterization of cellular and molecular signatures of adaptive immune receptor repertoires and microbiome taxonomy in SCZ and investigation of their intersection as a relevant pathway of disease progression and phenotype differentiation. SCZ patients are likely to show a diverging host-microbiome immune homeostasis with disease-specific clonotypes of adaptive immune receptor repertoires associated with altered microbiome taxonomy and molecular signature differences, which, in turn, may be related to distinct symptomatic phenotypes and neurocognitive patterns. Such sophisticated immuno-bioinformatic analyses may transform our understanding of SCZ by identification of novel neuroimmune pathways, offering us clinically accessible symptomatic and diagnostic biomarkers important for personalized medicine implications.12 An increased understanding and better characterization of immuno-phenotypes in SCZ will better guide the development of novel immune-based treatments in this severe disease and pave the way for possible prevention options through implementation of antibody engineering, vaccine design, and cellular immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684202>Porcine Circovirus Type 2 Induces Single Immunoglobulin Interleukin-1 Related Receptor (SIGIRR) Downregulation to Promote Interleukin-1β Upregulation in Porcine Alveolar Macrophage.</a></h1><p>Multisystemic inflammation in pigs affected by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) indicates the disordered expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the PCV2-induced expression profile of inflammation cytokines and its regulating mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, inflammatory cytokines and receptors in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) after PCV2 infection were profiled in vitro by an RT Profiler PCR array assay. The regulatory mechanism of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression was investigated. Results showed that 49 of 84 inflammation cytokines and receptors were differentially expressed ( < 0.05, absolute fold change ≥2) in PAMs at different stages post-PCV2 infection. Moreover, the overexpression of single-immunoglobulin interleukin-1 related receptor (SIGIRR) or the blocking of NF-κB activation by its inhibitor markedly decreased IL-1β secretion. This finding suggested that PCV2-induced overexpression of IL-1β was associated with the downregulation of SIGIRR and the activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, the excessive activity of NF-κB in SIGIRR-knockout PAMs cell line, indicating that SIGIRR negatively regulated IL-1β production by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB. Overall, PCV2-induced downregulation of SIGIRR induction of NF-κB activation is a critical process in enhancing IL-1β production in PAMs. This study may provide insights into the underlying inflammatory response that occurs in pigs following PCV2 infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683196>TRIM59 inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-2 replication in vitro.</a></h1><p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), has ranked among the major economically significant pathogen in the global swine industry. The PRRSV nonstructural protein (nsp)11 possesses nidovirus endoribonuclease (NendoU) activity, which is important for virus replication and suppression of the host innate  system. Recent proteomic study found that TRIM59 (tripartite motif-containing 59) interacted with the nsp11, albeit the exact role it plays in PRRSV infection remains enigmatic. Herein, we first confirmed the interaction between nsp11 and TRIM59 in co-transfected HEK293T cells and PRRSV-infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). The interacting domains between TRIM59 and nsp11 were further determined to be the N-terminal RING domain in TRIM59 and the C-terminal NendoU domain in nsp11, respectively. Moreover, we reported that overexpression of TRIM59 inhibited PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells. Conversely, small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of TRIM59 resulted in enhanced production of PRRSV in PAMs. Together, these data add TRIM59 as a crucial antiviral component against PRRSV and provide new insights for development of new compounds to reduce PRRSV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Higher serum vitamin D is associated with thinner primary melanoma and better outcome, although a causal mechanism has not been established. As melanoma patients commonly avoid sun exposure, and consequent vitamin D deficiency might worsen outcomes, we interrogated 703 primary melanoma transcriptomes to understand the role of vitamin D-VDR signalling and replicated the findings in TCGA metastases. VDR expression was independently protective for melanoma death in both primary and metastatic disease. High tumor VDR expression was associated with upregulation of pathways mediating anti-tumor  and correspondingly with higher imputed immune cell scores and histologically detected tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). High VDR expressing tumors had downregulation of proliferative pathways, notably Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Deleterious low VDR levels resulted from promoter methylation and gene deletion in metastases. Vitamin D deficiency (< 25 nmol/l ~ 10 ng/ml) shortened survival in primary melanoma in a VDR-dependent manner. In vitro functional validation studies showed that elevated vitamin D-VDR signaling inhibited Wnt/beta-catenin signaling genes. Murine melanoma cells overexpressing VDR produced fewer pulmonary metastases than controls in tail vein metastasis assays. In summary, vitamin D-VDR signaling contributes to controlling pro-proliferative/immunosuppresive Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in melanoma and this is associated with less metastatic disease and stronger host immune responses. This is evidence of the causal relationship between vitamin D-VDR signaling and melanoma survival which should be explored as a therapeutic target in primary resistance to checkpoint blockade.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685524>Maternal Priming of Offspring Immune System in Drosophila.</a></h1><p>Immune priming occurs when a past infection experience leads to a more effective immune response upon a secondary exposure to the infection or pathogen. In some instances, parents are able to transmit immune priming to their offspring, creating a subsequent generation with a superior immune capability, through processes that are not yet fully understood. Using a parasitoid wasp, which infects larval stages of , we describe an example of an intergenerational inheritance of immune priming. This phenomenon is anticipatory in nature and does not rely on parental infection, but rather, when adult fruit flies are cohabitated with a parasitic wasp, they produce offspring that are more capable of mounting a successful immune response against a parasitic macro-infection. This increase in offspring survival correlates with a more rapid induction of lamellocytes, a specialized immune cell. RNA-sequencing of the female germline identifies several differentially expressed genes following wasp exposure, including the eptiodolycan ecognition rotein- (PGRP-LB). We find that genetic manipulation of maternal PGRP-LB identifies this gene as a key element in this intergenerational phenotype.Copyright © 2019, G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683168>Alterations in composition of immune cells and impairment of anti-tumor immune response in aged oral cancer-bearing mice.</a></h1><p>Aging has been suggested to be associated with immune dysregulation. An understanding of alterations in the host  with advancing age is, therefore, important for designing immune therapy for elderly cancer patients. In this context, not much is known about age-associated alterations in the immune system in oral cancer.To evaluate age-associated alterations in the immune system, which might affect anti-tumor immune responses in oral cancer, we performed a comparative analysis of the proportion of different immune cells, the proliferative capacity of T cell compartment, and the response against immune therapies targeting immune check point molecules between young and aged oral cancer-bearing mice.The proportion of immune regulatory cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, was significantly increased in aged mice compared to that in young mice. Moreover, the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on both CD4 and CD8 T cells was elevated in aged mice compared to that in young mice, and the proliferative abilities of CD4 and CD8 T cells derived from aged mice were significantly reduced following stimulation of T-cell receptors. Moreover, tumor growth was significantly enhanced in aged mice compared to that in young mice. However, immunotherapies targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, and PD-L1 resulted in faster tumor regression in aged mice than in young mice.Together, our results indicate that age-associated alterations in the immune system are directly associated with the impairment of anti-tumor  in aged mice bearing oral cancer, and might facilitate the progression of the tumor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Such disturbances not only affect cellular energy metabolism, but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death pathways and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate , all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD. We also discuss the applicability and potential therapeutic value of recently proposed strategies for the restoration of mitochondrial function in the treatment of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694951>Intact Viral Particle Counts Measured by Flow Virometry Provides Insight into the Infectivity and Genome Packaging Efficiency of the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus.</a></h1><p>Murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) have long been used as a research model to further our understanding of retroviruses. These simple gammaretroviruses have been studied extensively in various facets of science for nearly half a century, yet we have surprisingly little quantitative information about some of the basic features of these viral particles. These include parameters such as the genome packaging efficiency and the number of particles required for a productive infection. The reason for this knowledge gap relies primarily on the technical challenge of accurately measuring intact viral particles from infected cell supernatants. Virus infected cells are well known to release soluble viral proteins, defective viruses and extracellular vesicles (EVs) harboring viral proteins that may mimic viruses, all of which can skew virus titer quantifications. Flow virometry, also known as nanoscale flow cytometry or simply small particle flow cytometry, is an emerging analytical method enabling high throughput single-virus phenotypic characterizations. By utilizing the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and monodisperse light scattering characteristics as discerning parameters of intact virus particles, here we analyzed the basic properties of Moloney MLV (M-MLV). We show that less than 24% of total p30 capsid protein measured in infected cell supernatants is associated with intact viruses. We calculate that about one in five M-MLV particles contain a viral RNA genome pair and that individual intact particle infectivity is about 0.4%. These findings provide new insights into the characteristics of an extensively studied prototypical retrovirus, while highlighting the benefits of flow virometry for the field of virology. Gammaretroviruses, or more specifically murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), have been a longstanding model for studying retroviruses. Although being extensively analysed and dissected for decades, several facets of MLV biology are still poorly understood. One of the primary challenges has been enumerating total intact virus particles in a sample. While several analytical methods can precisely measure virus protein amounts, MLVs are known to induce the secretion of soluble and vesicle-associated viral proteins that can skew these measurements. With recent technological advances in flow cytometry, it is now possible to analyze viruses down to 90nm in diameter with an approach called flow virometry. The technique has the added benefit of being able to discriminate viruses from extracellular vesicles and free viral proteins in order to confidently provide an intact viral particle count. Here we used flow virometry to provide new insights into the basic characteristics of Moloney MLV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689243>CD47 blockade augmentation of Trastuzumab antitumor efficacy dependent upon antibody-dependent-cellular-phagocytosis.</a></h1><p>The HER2-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), Trastuzumab, has been the mainstay of therapy for HER2+ breast cancers (BC) for ~20 years. However, its therapeutic mechanism of action (MOA) remains unclear, with antitumor responses to Trastuzumab remaining heterologous and metastatic HER2+ BC remaining incurable. Consequently, understanding its MOA could enable rational strategies to enhance its efficacy. Using both novel murine and human versions of Trastuzumab, we found its antitumor activity dependent on Fcγ-Receptor stimulation of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAM) and Antibody-Dependent-Cellular-Phagocytosis (ADCP), but not cytotoxicity (ADCC). Trastuzumab also stimulated TAM activation and expansion, but did not require adaptive , natural killer cells, and/or neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of the innate immune ADCP checkpoint, CD47, significantly enhanced Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP, TAM expansion and activation, resulting in the emergence of a unique hyper-phagocytic macrophage population, improved antitumor responses and prolonged survival. In addition, we found tumor-associated CD47 expression was inversely associated with survival in HER2+ BC patients and that human HER2+ BC xenografts treated with Trastuzumab+CD47 inhibition underwent complete tumor regression. Collectively, our study identifies Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP as a significant antitumor MOA that may be clinically enabled by CD47 blockade to augment therapeutic efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690060>Maintenance of Type 2 Response by CXCR6-Deficient ILC2 in Papain-Induced Lung Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are important players of early immune defenses in situations like lymphoid organogenesis or in case of immune response to inflammation, infection and cancer. Th1 and Th2 antagonism is crucial for the regulation of immune responses, however mechanisms are still unclear for ILC functions. ILC2 and NK cells were reported to be both involved in allergic airway diseases and were shown to be able to interplay in the regulation of the immune response. CXCR6 is a common chemokine receptor expressed by all ILC, and its deficiency affects ILC2 and ILC1/NK cell numbers and functions in lungs in both steady-state and inflammatory conditions. We determined that the absence of a specific ILC2 KLRG1ST2 subset in CXCR6-deficient mice is probably dependent on CXCR6 for its recruitment to the lung under inflammation. We show that despite their decreased numbers, lung CXCR6-deficient ILC2 are even more activated cells producing large amount of type 2 cytokines that could drive eosinophilia. This is strongly associated to the decrease of the lung Th1 response in CXCR6-deficient mice.</p></html>
