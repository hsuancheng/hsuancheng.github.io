The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of these polymorphisms on adiposity, leptin (sLeptin), and leptin-receptor (sLeptin-receptor) serum concentrations as well as inflammation markers. We included 382 adults originally from Western Mexico. They were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Obese individuals showed higher sLeptin (58.2 ± 31.35 ng/mL) but lower sLeptin-receptor (12.6 ± 3.74 ng/mL) levels than normal weight ones (17.6 ± 14.62 ng/mL, 17.4 ± 4.62 ng/mL, resp.), P < 0.001. Obese subjects carriers of / genotype had more (P = 0.016) sLeptin-receptor (14.7 ± 4.96 ng/mL) and less (P = 0.004) sLeptin (44.0 ± 28.12 ng/mL) levels than / genotype (11.0 ± 2.92 ng/mL, 80.3 ± 33.24 ng/mL, resp.). Body fat mass was lower (P from 0.003 to 0.045) for A/A (36.5% ± 6.80) or / (36.8% ± 6.82) genotypes with respect to G/G (41.3% ± 5.52) and G/A (41.6% ± 5.61) or / (43.7% ± 4.74) and / (41.0% ± 5.52) genotypes carriers. Our results suggest that LEP -2548A and LEPR 223Arg could be genetic markers of less body fat mass accumulation in obese subjects from Western Mexico.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475696>Association of two well-defined polymorphisms in leptin and leptin receptor genes with hypertension and circulating leptin: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>The genes encoding adipose-derived hormone leptin and its receptor (LEPR) are increasingly deemed as hypertension-susceptibility genes. In this meta-analysis, we summarized the association of the II/I polymorphism in leptin gene and Gln223Arg polymorphism in LEPR gene with hypertension and circulating leptin.PubMed and Embase were systematically searched. Data extraction and study quality were assessed in duplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out with the STATA software (v. 11.2).A total of 11 articles written in English were eligible. Overall analysis identified a significant association between II/I polymorphism I allele and increased risk of hypertension under allelic (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P: 1.48; 1.06-2.08; 0.022) and homozygous genotypic (2.27; 1.20-4.29; 0.012) models. The magnitude of the association for II/I polymorphism I allele with hypertension was substantiated in Asians and for essential hypertension under both genetic models. Overall and subgroup analyses failed to reveal any significance for the association between the Gln223Arg polymorphism and hypertension risk. Carriers of Gln223Arg polymorphism / genotype had significantly higher circulating leptin than the / genotype carriers (weighted mean difference; 95% confidence interval; P: 1.61 ng/mL; 0.02-3.20; 0.047), and this significance persisted in essential hypertension subgroup (1.69 ng/mL; 0.02-3.35; 0.047). There were low probabilities of publication bias for the above comparisons.Our findings support the contributory role of the II/I polymorphism in leptin gene in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and this role was more evident in Asians and for essential hypertension.Copyright © 2015 IMSS.

The aim of this study was to investigate an extensively studied LEPR polymorphism Gln223  in a Pakistani study group and its association patterns with different serum biochemical parameters.The study included 250 obese and 225 nonobese subjects. Gln223  polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment-length polymorphism. Anthropometric parameters and plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, leptin, and insulin were measured.The Gln223  polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and weight only in obese subjects, and with all lipid parameters in both obese and nonobese subjects when / or / genotypes were compared with / genotype.The LEPR Gln223 is associated with , lipid parameters, and plasma glucose in all subjects, with weight, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure only in obese subjects, but showed no association with leptin, insulin, and HOMA-IR in a Pakistani study group.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
