<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841205> fate of cardiac glycosides and flavonoids upon fermentation of aqueous sea squill (Drimia maritima L.) extracts.</a></h2><p>Sea squill (Drimia maritima L.) extracts have been used for centuries for the medical treatment of heart diseases. A procedure for the preparation of Drimia extracts applied for such purposes comprising a fermentation step is described in the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP). However, little is known about the secondary metabolite profile of such extracts and the fate of these components upon processing and storage. Thus, in the present study sea squill extracts were monitored during fermentation and storage by HPLC-DAD-MS(n) and GC-MS to characterise and quantitate individual cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds. For this purpose, a previously established HPLC method for the separation and quantitation of pharmacologically relevant cardiac glycosides (bufadienolides) was validated. Within 12 months of storage, total  contents decreased by about 50%, which was attributed to microbial and plant enzyme activities. The metabolisation and degradation rates of individual  glycosides significantly differed, which was attributed to differing structures of the aglycones. Further degradation of  aglycones was also observed. Besides reactions well known from human  studies, dehydration of individual compounds was monitored. Quantitatively predominating flavonoids were also metabolised throughout the fermentation process. The present study provides valuable information about the profile and stability of individual cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds in fermented Drimia extracts prepared for medical applications, and expands the knowledge of cardiac glycoside conversion upon microbial fermentation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among four  compounds, a dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in these cancer cells after treatment with gamabufotalin and arenobufagin. The IC50 values of the two compounds were 3-5 times higher in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than these values for both cancer cell lines. However, similar phenomena were not observed for two other  compounds, telocinobufagin and bufalin. These results thus suggest that gamabufotalin and arenobufagin possess selective cytotoxic activity against tumor cells rather than normal cells. Moreover, a clear dose-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, a well-known hallmark of necrosis, was observed in both cancer cells treated with gamabufotalin, suggesting that gamabufotalin-mediated cell death is predominantly associated with a necrosis-like phenotype. Of most importance, treatment with as little as 8 ng/ml of gamabufotalin, even an almost non-toxic concentration to PBMCs, efficiently downregulated the percentages of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulator T (Treg) cells in mitogen-activated PBMCs. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in tumor immunotolerance by suppressing antitumor , these results suggest that gamabufotalin may serve as a promising candidate, as an adjuvant therapeutic agent by manipulating Treg cells to enhance the efficacy of conventional anticancer drugs and lessen their side-effects. These findings provide insights into the clinical application of gamabufotalin for cancer patients with glioblastoma/pancreatic cancer based on its cytocidal effect against tumor cells as well as its depletion of Treg cells.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8621199>Pulse pressure correlates in humans with a proscillaridin A immunoreactive compound.</a></h2><p>Endogenous digitalis-like factors in humans are presumably cardenolides and bufadienolides. To test whether -like substances may circulate in human blood, we used antibodies from rabbits against the  proscillaridin A to measure the concentration of cross-reacting material in human plasma with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgG had an apparent affinity of 2 x 10(-9) mol/L for proscillaridin A. It was specific for bufadienolides and did not cross-react with cardenolides or several steroid hormones. Extraction of human plasma with ethanol and fractionation of this extract over a high-performance liquid chromatographic reverse-phase C18 column with a propanol/isopropanol gradient resulted in the separation of three peaks of increasing hydrophobicity (ED1, ED2, ED3) that inhibited the sodium pump of human red blood cells and cross-reacted with proscillaridin A antibodies. The concentration of the proscillaridin A immunoreactivity ED1 in normotensive subjects had a geometric mean of 0.1 nmol/L, with a dispersion factor of 8.77. ED1 correlated positively in a group of 60 normotensive subjects, 22 patients with hypertension, and 19 patients with chronic renal failure with mean arterial blood pressure (log ED1 [nmol/L] = 0.013 x mm Hg-2.17, r = .25, P < .05), systolic pressure (log ED1 [nmol/L] = 0.010 x mm Hg-2.23, r = .32, P < .01), and pulse pressure (log ED1 [nmol/L] = 0.019 x mm Hg-1.80, r = .38, P < .0001). There was no correlation with other parameters of the donors. We conclude that several substances cross-reacting with proscillaridin A antibodies and inhibiting the sodium pump of human red blood cells circulate in human blood. The level of one of these substances (ED1) correlates with mean arterial and pulse pressures.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26132852>Quantification of Bufadienolides in Bryophyllum pinnatum Leaves and Manufactured Products by UHPLC-ESIMS/MS.</a></h2><p>A quantitative assay for determination of the main bufadienolides bersaldegenin-1-acetate (1), bersaldegenin-3-acetate (2), bryophyllin A (3), and bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate (4) in Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves and manufactured products was developed and validated. The assay involved extraction by pressurised liquid extraction, followed by quantification by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. The ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method was applied to various batches of leaves harvested on several dates from plants grown at two locations (Brazil and Germany). In addition, press juices prepared from plants cultivated in Germany and Brazil were analysed. The total  content ranged from 16.28 to 40.50 mg/100 g dry weight in leaves from plants grown in Brazil. The total content of these four bufadienolides was significantly lower in plants cultivated in Germany (3.78-12.49 mg/100 g dry weight, resp.).

Here, we reported that arenobufagin blocked the transition from G2 to M phase of cell cycle through inhibiting the activation of CDK1-Cyclin B1 complex; The tumor suppressor p53 contributed to sustaining arrest at the G2 phase of the cell cycle in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Moreover, arenobufagin caused double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and triggered the DNA damage response (DDR), partly via the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-Cdc25C signaling pathway. Importantly, we used a synthetic biotinylated arenobufagin-conjugated chemical probe in live cells to show that arenobufagin accumulated mainly in the nucleus. The microscopic thermodynamic parameters measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) also demonstrated that arenobufagin directly bound to DNA in vitro. The hypochromicity in the UV-visible absorption spectrum, the significant changes in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of DNA, and the distinct quenching in the fluorescence intensity of the ethidium bromide (EB)-DNA system before and after arenobufagin treatment indicated that arenobufagin bound to DNA in vitro by intercalation. Molecular modeling suggested arenobufagin intercalated with DNA via hydrogen bonds between arenobufagin and GT base pairs. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into arenobufagin-induced cell cycle disruption that are valuable for the further discussion and investigation of the use of arenobufagin in clinical anticancer chemotherapy.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22378033>Monoclonal antibody against marinobufagenin reverses cardiac fibrosis in rats with chronic renal failure.</a></h2><p>Cardiotonic steroids (CTS) are implicated in pathophysiology of uremic cardiomyopathy. In the present study, we tested whether a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the  CTS, marinobufagenin (MBG), alleviates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in partially nephrectomized (PNx) rats.In PNx rats, we compared the effects of 3E9 anti-MBG mAb and of Digibind, an affinity-purified digoxin antibody, on blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis following 4 weeks after the surgery.In PNx rats, a fourfold elevation in plasma MBG levels was associated with hypertension, increased cardiac levels of carbonylated protein, cardiac hypertrophy, a reduction in cardiac expression of a nuclear transcription factor which is a negative regulator of collagen synthesis, Friend leukemia integration-1 (Fli-1), and an increase in the levels of collagen-1. A single intraperitoneal administration of 3E9 mAb to PNx rats reduced blood pressure by 59 mm Hg for 7 days and produced a significant reduction in cardiac  and cardiac levels of oxidative stress, an increase in the expression of Fli-1, and a reduction in cardiac fibrosis.

Recent discoveries, which include the specific identification of endogenous cardenolide (endogenous ouabain) and  (marinobufagenin) CTS in humans along with the delineation of an alternative mechanism by which CTS can signal through the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, have increased the interest in this field substantially. Although CTS were first considered important in the regulation of renal sodium transport and arterial pressure, more recent work implicates these hormones in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and fibrosis, the modulation of immunity and of carbohydrate metabolism, and the control of various central nervous functions and even behavior. This review focuses on the physiological interactions between CTS and other regulatory systems that may be important in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, preeclampsia, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and .

Previous data from our groups and from others point to the sodium/potassium pump (the Na+/K+-ATPase, i.e., NaK) with its highly specific ligands (i.e., cardiotonic steroids) as a new target for combating cancers associated with dismal prognoses, including gliomas, melanomas, non-small cell lung cancers, renal cell carcinomas, and  cancers. Cardiotonic steroid-mediated Na+/K+-ATPase targeting could circumvent various resistance pathways. The most probable pathways include the involvement of Na+/K+-ATPase β subunits in invasion features and Na+/K+-ATPase α subunits in chemosensitisation by specific cardiotonic steroid-mediated apoptosis and anoïkis-sensitisation; the regulation of the expression of multidrug resistant-related genes; post-translational regulation, including glycosylation and ubiquitinylation of multidrug resistant-related proteins; c-Myc downregulation; hypoxia-inducible factor downregulation; NF-κB downregulation and deactivation; the inhibition of the glycolytic pathway with a reduction of intra-cellular ATP levels and an induction of non-apoptotic cell death.

Toad venom extract containing bufadienolides, which belong to cardiac steroids, has actually long been used as traditional Chinese medicine in clinic for cancer therapy in China. The cytotoxicity of arenobufagin, a  isolated from toad venom, on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells was checked. And, the protein expression profile of control HeLa cells and HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin for 48 h was analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis, respectively. Differently expressed proteins in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin were identified and the pathways related to these proteins were mapped from KEGG database. Computational molecular docking was performed to verify the binding of arenobufagin and Na, K-ATPase. The effects of arenobufagin on Na, K-ATPase activity and proteasome activity of HeLa cells were checked. The protein-protein interaction network between Na, K-ATPase and proteasome was constructed and the expression of possible intermediate proteins ataxin-1 and translationally-controlled tumor protein in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin was then checked. Arenobufagin induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells. The cytotoxic effect of arenobufagin was associated with 25 differently expressed proteins including proteasome-related proteins, calcium ion binding-related proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins, metabolism-related enzymes and others. The results of computational molecular docking revealed that arenobufagin was bound in the cavity formed by the transmembrane alpha subunits of Na, K-ATPase, which blocked the pathway of extracellular Na+/K+ cation exchange and inhibited the function of ion exchange. Arenobufagin inhibited the activity of Na, K-ATPase and proteasome, decreased the expression of Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits and increased the expression of WEE1 in HeLa cells. Antibodies against Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits alone or combinated with arenobufagin also inhibited the activity of proteasome. Furthermore, the expression of the possible intermediate proteins ataxin-1 and translationally-controlled tumor protein was increased in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin by flow cytometry analysis, respectively. These results indicated that arenobufagin might directly bind with Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits and the inhibitive effect of arenobufagin on proteasomal activity of HeLa cells might be related to its binding with Na, K-ATPase.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905927>Mutations to the cardiotonic steroid binding site of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase are associated with high level of resistance to gamabufotalin in a natricine snake.</a></h2><p>Although toads are defended by  toxins, some snakes have evolved resistance to bufadienolides and feed heavily on toads.

These toxins exert their lethal effects by binding to and disabling the Na/K-ATPases of cell membranes. Many species of snakes exhibit resistance to the effects of bufadienolides due to target-site insensitivity of the Na/K-ATPase.

We have found that this mutant gene is expressed at a significantly elevated level in heart tissue compared to gut, kidney, and liver of the -resistant snake, Thamnophis elegans. Furthermore, we found that exposure to bufadienolides elicits a significant increase in the expression levels of ATP1a3 in the heart, but not in the kidneys, liver, or gut 1h after exposure.

Liver metastasis was observed by injection of MC38 cells beneath the splenic capsule of mice. Protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot.Consolidated in vitro results indicate that resibufogenin has anti-proliferative activity on CRC cells. PI staining and transmission electron microscope imaging suggest that the cell death induced by resibufogenin are mainly through necrosis, which is further confirmed by the ineffectiveness of z-VAD, a pan-caspase general inhibitor. In particular, resibufogenin induced necrosis is substantially abrogated in receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts. The RIP3-dependent necrosis has been classified as necroptosis. Resibufogenin triggeres necroptosis through upregulating RIP3 and phosphorylating mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein at Ser358. Resibufogenin also activates the expression of PYGL, GLUD1 and GLUL in a RIP3-dependent manner.

Hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate S-2251 (H-D-Valyl-l-leucyl-l-lysine-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride) by plasmin revealed that the -rich fraction had a diverse effect on this enzyme, dependently on the concentration range. While the lower concentrations of the examined fraction (0.05-2.5 μg/ml) significantly enhanced the amidolytic activity of plasmin, at 25-50 μg/ml concentrations, the enzyme was evidently inhibited (by about 60%). The Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated on an uncompetitive inhibition of plasmin. Inhibitory effects (up to 80%) were also found in the streptokinase-induced plasminogen activation to plasmin.

Two mono-hydroxylated products of GB and AB were detected in the incubation mixtures, and they were accurately identified as 1- and 5-hydroxylated bufadienolides by NMR and HPLC-MS techniques.

Neovascularization is a surprisingly early event during the multistage progression of cancer. Cinobufagin, an important  originating from Chan Su, has been clinically used to treat cancer in China since the Tang dynasty. Here, we show that cinobufagin suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in vivo by downregulating angiogenesis. The hierarchized neovasculature is significantly decreased and the vascular network formation is disrupted in HUVEC by cinobufagin in a dose-dependent way. Endothelial apoptosis is observed by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction which can be neutralized by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is reduced and phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 and Akt at Ser473 is downregulated in HUVEC. Endothelial apoptosis is triggered by cinobufagin by stimulation of Bax and cascade activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Increased endothelial apoptosis rate and alterations in the HIF-1α/mTOR pathway are recapitulated in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Further, the anti-angiogenesis function of cinobufagin is consolidated based on its pro-apoptotic effects on an EOMA-derived hemangioendothelioma model. In conclusion, cinobufagin suppresses tumor neovascularization by disrupting the endothelial mTOR/HIF-1α pathway to trigger ROS-mediated vascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Cinobufagin is a promising natural anti-angiogenetic drug that has clinical translation potential and practical application value.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to character the  pathway(s) of BFT and to identify the key drug metabolizing enzyme(s) responsible for hepatic  of BFT in human, as well as to explore the related molecular mechanism of enzymatic selectivity. The major metabolite of BFT in human liver microsomes (HLMs) was fully identified as 5β-hydroxylbufotalin by LC-MS/MS and NMR techniques. Reaction phenotyping and chemical inhibition assays showed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were key enzymes responsible for BFT 5β-hydroxylation. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that BFT 5β-hydroxylation in both HLMs and human CYP3A4 followed the biphasic kinetics, while BFT 5β-hydroxylation in CYP3A5 followed substrate inhibition kinetics. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations showed that BFT could bind on two different ligand-binding sites on both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which partially explained the different kinetic behaviors of BFT in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. These findings are very helpful for elucidating the phase I  of BFT in human and for deeper understanding the key interactions between CYP3A enzymes and bufadienolides, as well as for the development of -type drugs with improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9632685>A specific binding protein for cardiac glycosides exists in bovine serum.</a></h2><p>Searching for a binding protein in blood, which may be involved in the specific transport of cardiac glycosides to their receptor sites on the sodium pump, we isolated a cardiac glycoside-binding protein (CGBG) of 26 kDa from the globulin fraction of bovine serum by affinity chromatography and on a ouabain-Sepharose 4B column by a purification factor of 5000. The cardiac glycoside-binding globulin was labeled specifically and covalently by the protein-reactive digoxigenin derivative HDMA (N-hydroxysuccimidyldigoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-epsilon-+ ++aminocapro ate). Even very high concentrations of other steroids, such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, and cortisone, did not prevent HDMA-labeling (at 5 and 100 nM) of CGBG, but the cardenolides ouabain and digoxin or the  proscillaridin A did so. CGBG is a homodimer of two 26-kDa subunits forming disulfide bonds, since HDMA labeling of a protein of 53 kDa was observed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when beta-mercaptoethanol was absent during SDS denaturation. The N-terminal amino acid sequence K-D-V-Y-R-A-P-D-G-T-Q-S-A showed no sequence similarity with proteins recorded in gene and protein sequence data banks. A 90-kDa cytosolic CGBG exists in bovine kidneys and reacts with antibodies against CGBG. Binding of ouabain to the cardiac glycoside-binding globulin was monitored by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Such studies reveal two negatively cooperative ouabain binding sites with Kd' of 1.52 nM and Kd' = 75 nM and with an interaction factor of 50 using a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model. The demonstration of a cardiac glycoside-binding globulin in plasma is consistent with the recent finding of endogenous cardiac glycosides in mammals.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151076>Analysis of proprietary Chinese medicines for the presence of toxic ingredients by LC/MS/MS.</a></h2><p>This paper presents an LC/MS/MS approach for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of proprietary Chinese medicine products for the presence of toxic ingredient compounds.

Following the recent discovery that oxidative damage possibly be an important cause of the cardiac toxicity of cardenolides, a strategy fusing the antitumor agent arenobufagin with a benzoisoselenazol fragment, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, has been developed. Six novel hybrids were synthesized and their ROS scavenging activities as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, an adriamycin-resistant subline HepG2/ADM, and the human myocardial cell line AC16 were evaluated. The results indicate that the hybrids exhibit various degrees of in vitro ROS scavenging activities, and weaker cytotoxicity than that of arenobufagin against the myocardial cell line AC16. These findings suggest the feasibility of a strategy in which the cardiotoxicity of the potential antitumor agent arenobufagin is reduced.Copyright © 2018.

Marinobufagenin binding to Na/K-ATPase initiates profibrotic cell signaling, and heightened marinobufagenin levels are implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, preeclampsia, and chronic kidney disease. Steroids are derived from cholesterol through the traditional steroidogenesis pathway initiated by enzyme CYP11A1, and via the acidic bile acid pathway, which is controlled by enzyme CYP27A1. The mechanism of marinobufagenin biosynthesis in mammals, however, remains unknown.Here, we show that post-transcriptional silencing of the CYP27A1 gene in human trophoblast and rat adrenocortical cells reduced the expression of CYP27A1 mRNA by 70%, reduced total bile acids 2-fold, and marinobufagenin levels by 67% when compared with nontreated cells or cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA. In contrast, silencing of the CYP11A1 gene did not affect marinobufagenin production in either cell culture, but suppressed production of progesterone 2-fold in human trophoblast cells and of corticosterone by 90% in rat adrenocortical cells when compared with cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA. In vivo, in a high-salt administration experiment, male and female Dahl salt-sensitive rats became hypertensive after 4 weeks on a high-NaCl diet, their plasma marinobufagenin levels doubled, and adrenocortical CYP27A1 mRNA and protein increased 1.6-fold and 2.0-fold.Therefore, the endogenous steroidal Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, marinobufagenin, is synthesized in mammalian placenta and adrenal cortex from cholesterol through the novel acidic bile acid pathway.

The aim of this study is to investigate the anticancer activity of cinobufotalin, a  isolated from toad venom, in cultured HCC cells, and to study the underlying mechanisms. We found that cinobufotalin (at nmol/L) significantly inhibited HCC cell growth and survival while inducing considerable cell apoptosis. Further, cinobufotalin inhibited sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) activity and induced pro-apoptotic ceramide production. Ceramide synthase-1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-depletion inhibited cinobufotalin-induced ceramide production and HCC cell apoptosis. On the other hand, the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) facilitated cinobufotalin-induced ceramide production and cell apoptosis. SphK1 inhibitor II (SKI-II), similar to cinobufotalin, increased cellular ceramide level and promoted HCC cell apoptosis. Finally, we observed that cinobufotalin inactivated Akt-S6K1 signaling in HepG2 cells, which was again inhibited by ceramide synthase-1 shRNA-depletion. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that cinobufotalin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in cultured HCC cells through ceramide production.

We identified three bufadienolides-the steroid-like compounds arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin-from the boreal toad, Anaxyrus boreas, through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Compounds were detected both after inducing skin gland secretions and in constitutive mucosal rinses from toads. We described the antimicrobial properties of each  against Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian fungal pathogen linked with boreal toad population declines. All three bufadienolides were found to inhibit Bd growth at similar levels. The maximum Bd inhibition produced by arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin were approximately 50%, in contrast to the complete Bd inhibition shown by antimicrobial skin peptides produced by some amphibian species. In addition, skin mucus samples significantly reduced Bd viability, and bufadienolides were detected in 15 of 62 samples. Bufadienolides also appeared to enhance growth of the anti-Bd bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum, and thus may be involved in regulation of the skin microbiome. Here, we localized skin bacteria within the mucus layer and granular glands of toads with fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, our results suggest that bufadienolides can function in antifungal defense on amphibian skin and their production is a potentially convergent trait similar to antimicrobial peptide defenses found on the skin of other species.

Resistance to the acute effects of bufadienolides in snakes that prey on toads is conferred by target-site insensitivity of the toxin's target enzyme, the Na/K-ATPase. Previous studies have focused largely on the molecular mechanisms of resistance but have not investigated the physiological mechanisms or consequences of exposure to the toxins. Adrenal enlargement in snakes often is associated with specialization on a diet of toads. These endocrine glands are partly composed of interrenal tissue, which produces the corticosteroids corticosterone and aldosterone. Corticosterone is the main hormone released in response to stress in reptiles, and aldosterone plays an important role in maintaining ion balance through upregulation of Na/K-ATPase. We tested the endocrine response of select species of snakes to acute cardiotonic steroid exposure by measuring circulating aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations. We found that Rhabdophis tigrinus, which specializes on a diet of toads, responds with lower corticosterone and higher aldosterone compared to other species that exhibit target-site resistance to the toxins but do not specialize on toads. We also found differences between sexes in R. tigrinus, with males generally responding with higher corticosterone and aldosterone than females. This study provides evidence of physiological adaptations, beyond target-site resistance, associated with tolerance of bufadienolides in a specialized toad-eating snake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), Chansu and Chanpi, with their broad-spectrum of therapeutic applications, have long been applied to detoxification, anti-, analgesia, etc. OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE: We critically analyzed the current evidence for the traditional uses, chemical profiles, pharmacological activity, toxicity and quality control of BGC (Bufonidae family) to provide a scientific basis for future in-depth studies and perspectives for the discovery of potential drug candidates.All of the available information on active constituents and TCMs derived from BGC was obtained using the keywords "Bufo gargarizans", "Chansu", "Chanpi", "Huachansu", or "Cinobufacini" through different electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Wanfang Database, and Pharmacopoeia of China. In addition, Chinese medicine books from different times were used to elucidate the traditional uses of BGC. Electronic databases, including the "IUCN Red List of Threatened Species", "American Museum of Natural History" and "AmphibiaWeb Species Lists", were used to validate the scientific name of BGC.To date, about 118  monomers and 11 indole alkaloids have been identified from BGC in total. The extracts and isolated compounds exhibit a wide range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects. The literature search demonstrated that the ethnomedicinal uses of BGC, such as detoxification, anti- and the ability to reduce swelling and pain associated with infections, are correlated with its modern pharmacological activities, including antitumor, immunomodulation and attenuation of cancer-derived pain. Bufadienolides and indole alkaloids have been regarded as the main active substances in BGC, among which bufadienolides have significant antitumor activity. Furthermore, the cardiotoxicity of bufadienolides was discussed, and the main molecular mechanism involves in the inhibition of Na/K-ATPase. Besides, with the development of modern analytical techniques, the quality control methods of BGC-derived TCMs are being improved constantly.An increasing number of reports suggest that BGC can be regarded as an excellent source for exploring the potential antitumor constituents. However, the future antitumor research of BGC needs to follow the standard pharmacology guidelines, so as to provide comprehensive pharmacological information and aid the reproducibility of the data.

Recently we demonstrated that, in addition to endogenous ouabain (EO), mammalian tissues contain another NKA inhibitor, a  marinobufagenin (MBG). In vitro MBG, a natriuretic and a vasoconstrictor, acts as a selective inhibitor of alpha-1 NKA, the main isoform of the sodium pump in renal tubules and vascular smooth muscle. To determine whether digitalis-like NKA inhibitors are linked to NKA dysregulation in DM, we studied changes in renal excretion and plasma levels of MBG and EO and the activity of erythrocyte NKA in male Wistar rats with type 1 DM and type 2 DM. Rats with type 1 DM were studied four weeks following a single intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ)(n = 12), and rats with type 2 DM were studied 10 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of STZ during the neonatal period (n = 12). Renal excretion and plasma levels of EO did not change in rats with both types of DM as compared to that in the control groups. Renal excretion (57.5 +/- 9.4 pmol/kg/ 3 hours vs. 12.6 +/- 2.1 pmol/kg/ 3 hours; P less than 0.01) and plasma levels (2.23 +/- 0.82 nmol/L vs. 0.29 +/- 0.07 nmol/L; P less than 0.01) of MBG increased, and NKA activity in erythrocytes was inhibited by 50% in rats with type 1 DM as compared to controls. In rats with type 2 DM, plasma levels (1.48 +/- 0.09 nmol/L vs. 0.46 +/- 0.02 nmol/L; P less than 0.01) and renal excretion (21.3 +/- 3.2 pmol/kg/ 3 hours vs. 13.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/kg/ 3 hours) of MBG also became elevated, but less than in the animals with type 1 DM. Accordingly, activity of NKA in erythrocytes from rats with type 2 DM was inhibited by 35%. In vitro treatment of erythrocytes from rats with type 1 and type 2 DM with anti-MBG antibody reversed the DM induced inhibition of the NKA.

Peritoneal fluid was collected and used for counting cells by optical microscopy and proinflammatory cytokine quantification (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-) by immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA). Zymosan stimulation, as expected, induced increased cell migration and proinflammatory cytokine levels in the peritoneum. Marinobufagenin treatment reduced polymorphonuclear cell migration and IL-1 and IL-6 levels in the peritoneal cavity, without interfering in TNF- levels.

In addition to dietary alkaloids, -like compounds and indolealkylamines have been identified in certain species of Melanophryniscus. Our study reports, for the first time, the co-occurrence of large quantities of both alkaloids sequestered from the diet and an endogenously biosynthesized indolalkylamine in skin secretions from individual specimens of Melanophryniscus moreirae from Brazil. GC/MS analysis of 55 individuals of M. moreirae revealed 37 dietary alkaloids and the biosynthesized indolealkylamine bufotenine. On average, pumiliotoxin 267C, bufotenine, and allopumilitoxin 323B collectively represent ca. 90 % of the defensive chemicals present in an individual. The quantity of defensive chemicals differed between sexes, with males possessing significantly less dietary alkaloid and bufotenine than females. Most of the dietary alkaloids have structures with branched-chains, indicating they are likely derived from oribatid mites. The ratio of bufotenine:alkaloid quantity decreased with increasing quantities of dietary alkaloids, suggesting that M. moreirae might regulate bufotenine synthesis in relation to sequestration of dietary alkaloids.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137582>High Resolution Mass Profile of Bufadienolides and Peptides Combing with Anti-Tumor Cell Screening and Multivariate Analysis for the Quality Evaluation of Bufonis Venenum.</a></h2><p>In order to evaluate the quality of Bufonis Venenum commercial herbs, a three-step qualitative and quantitative research study was performed. Firstly, we tried to identify small molecules and peptides in Bufonis Venenum using pre-fractionation chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The database search of the small molecules and peptides of Bufonis Venenum revealed that the dried venom consisted of free/conjugated-type bufadienolides and peptides with a mass range of 0.4-2 kDa. Secondly, we used partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical analysis to screen bufadienolides markers (VIP > 1.5) responsible for the anti-tumor cell activity of Bufonis Venenum, including 21 identified bufadienolides and 7 unknown compounds. It is noticeable that these  markers could not be recognized by traditional HPLC-UV based spectrum-effect relationship analysis (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.24 to 0.40). Finally, we proposed a  coefficient-based corrected total contents of 9 bufadienolides as a quality evaluation indicator, which had good correlation with inhibitory effects on tumor cells of commercial Bufonis Venenum. The correlation coefficient increased from 0.4 to 0.6. Thus, our pre-fractionation chromatography and mass spectrometry strategy had significant advancement over the traditional spectrum-effect relationship method for chemical marker identification. These results could be crucial and helpful in the development of a quality evaluation method that could reflect the pharmacological activity of Bufonis Venenum.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29853035>Revealing of endogenous Marinobufagin by an ultra-specific and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay in pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Marinobufagenin (MBG) is a  cardiac inotrope implicated in volume expansion-mediated hypertensive states including essential hypertension and preeclampsia (PE). Endogenous MBG is an inhibitor of the α1-isoform of Na,K-ATPase with vasoconstrictive and cardiotonic properties, causing hypertension and natriuresis. Elevated endogenous MBG-like material levels have been described by immunoassays in salt-sensitive pregnant and preeclamptic rats as well as in preeclamptic human patients. The rise of endogenous MBG-like material appears prior the development of the main symptoms of PE, leading us to consider MBG as one of the potential biomarkers for PE. The weak specificity and the high variability of the published immunoassays gives no certification about endogenous MBG existence. This led us to set-up a highly specific and sensitive analytical method to detect MBG in plasma at low levels relying on liquid chromatography combined to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with recording of 7 highly specific MRM transitions for MBG. Pure MBG standard used in the method development was obtained by purification from the Bufo marinus toad venom. d-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was used as internal standard. An increasing organic gradient with mobile phase A and B composed of 97:3 (v/v) HO: MeOH and 50:45:5 (v/v/v) MeOH:IPA:HO at pH 4.5 respectively was used on a Pursuit 3 PFP column (100 mm × 3 mm; 3 µm) to allow elution and separation of the plasmatic compounds. Chromatographic analyses of plasma samples were preceded by a precipitation of proteins pretreatment. The developed UHPLC-MS/MS assay has been applied to early-pregnant women plasma samples allowing us to investigate MBG plasma levels. Thanks to the high specificity of the assay we were able to authenticate and certify the presence of endogenous MBG in early-pregnant women plasma with the use of the 7 selected specific mass transitions. These pioneering preliminary results are giving a promising perspective for early preeclampsia risk assessment in pregnant women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Several minor constituents are reported for the first time. The preparation sold as made from the toad did not contained bufadienolides or compounds that can be associated with the toad but plant compounds, mainly phenolics and flavonoids. The venom showed activity on human breast cancer cells and modified the cell cycle proliferation. The antiprotozoal effect was higher for the R. schneideri venom and can be related to the composition and relative ratio of constituents compared with R. ornata and R. scitula.The preparation sold in the capital city of Paraguay as containing the toad venom, used popularly to treat cancer did not contain the toad venom constituents. Consistent with this, this preparation was inactive on proliferation of human breast cancer cells. In contrast, the toad venoms of Rhinella species altered the cell cycle progression, affecting the proliferation of malignant cells. The findings suggest that care should be taken with the providers of the preparation and that the crude drug present a strong activity towards human breast cancer cell lines. The antiprotozoal effect of the R. schneideri venom was moderate while the venom of R. ornata was devoid of activity and that of R. scitula was active at very high concentration.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study we examined how immersion into norepinephrine solution inducing the release of stored toxins, administration of mild stress mimicking predator attack or simple handling during experimental procedure affected the quantity and number of toxin compounds present in common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles as compared to undisturbed control individuals, and investigated how fast toxin reserves were restored. We found that total  quantity (TBQ) significantly decreased only in the norepinephrine treatment group immediately after treatment compared to the control, but this difference disappeared after 12 h; there were no consistent differences in TBQ between treatments at later samplings. Interestingly, in the norepinephrine treatment approximately half of the compounds characterized by >700 m/z values showed the same changes in time as TBQ, but several bufadienolides characterized by <600 m/z values showed the opposite pattern: they were present in higher quantities immediately after treatment. The number of  compounds was not affected by any treatments, but was positively related to TBQ.

CS-6 treatment inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC in a nanomolar range. And CS-6 could induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 cells. However, its molecular mechanism in antitumor activity remains poorly understood. We employed a quantitative proteomics approach to identify the potential cellular targets of CS-6, and found 38 possible target-related proteins. Among them, 31 proteins were closely related in the protein-protein interaction network. One of the regulatory nodes in key pathways was occupied by Hsp90. Molecular docking revealed that CS-6 interacted with the ATP-binding sites of Hsp90. In addition, CS-6 inhibited the chaperone function of Hsp90 and reduced expression of Hsp90-dependent client proteins. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein level of Hsp90 in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice. Taken together, our results suggest that CS-6 might be a novel inhibitor of Hsp90, and the possible network associated with CS-6 target-related proteins was constructed, which provided experimental evidence for the preclinical value of using CS-6 as an effective antitumor agent in treatment of NSCLC.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28595013>Fibroblast Activation Protein α Activated Tripeptide  Antitumor Prodrug with Reduced Cardiotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Bufadienolides are the major pharmacologic constituents of traditional Chinese medicine Chan'su, which is frequently used clinically for cancer treatment in China.

To provide a novel insight into therapeutic strategies against glioblastoma, the cytotoxicity of arenobufagin and hellebrigenin was investigated in the human glioblastoma cell line, U-87. Similar dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in the cells, whereas no detectable toxicity was confirmed in mouse primary astrocytes. Treatment with each drug downregulated the expression levels of Cdc25C, Cyclin B1 and survivin, which occurred in parallel with G2/M phase arrest. Necrotic-like cell death was only observed in the cells treated with a relatively high concentration (>100 ng/ml). These results indicate that the two drugs exhibited distinct cytotoxicity against cancerous glial cells with high potency and selectivity, suggesting that growth inhibition associated with G2/M phase arrest and/or necrosis were attributed to their toxicities. Activation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was also observed in treated cells. Notably, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, itself caused a significant decrease in cell viability, and further enhanced the cytotoxicity of the two drugs, suggesting an important pro-survival role for p38 MAPK. Given that p38 MAPK serves an essential role in promoting glioblastoma cell survival, developing a novel combination regimen of arenobufagin/hellebrigenin plus a p38 MAPK inhibitor may improve the efficacy of the two drugs, and may provide more therapeutic benefits to patients with glioblastoma.

In human ICU patients, urinary samples were examined for levels of MBG, and the values were compared to those obtained from other ICU patients admitted with diagnoses other than ARDS.(1) Exposure of rats to hyperoxia produced a histologic picture which resembled that of human ARDS.

The cross-reactive material did not reflect the number of sodium pumps per g of wet  tissue as measured by [3H]ouabain binding.

These serious factors might be improved by increasing the drug/albumin-binding ratio. This study therefore investigated the relationship between the structural properties of nine bufadienolides and their affinities for human serum albumin (HSA) by a fluorescence spectroscopy-based analysis and molecular docking. Fluorescence quenching data showed that the interaction of each  with HSA formed a non-fluorescent complex, while thermodynamic parameters revealed negative ΔS and ΔH values, corresponding to changes in enthalpy and entropy, respectively. The structural differences between the various bufadienolides markedly influenced their binding affinity for HSA. With the exception of a C = O bond at the C12 position that decreased the binding affinity for HSA, other polar groups tended to increase the affinity, especially a hydroxyl (OH) group at assorted  sites. The rank order of binding affinities for drugs with tri-hydroxyl groups was as follows: 11-OH > 5-OH > 16-OH; in addition, 16-acetoxy (OAc), 10-aldehyde and 14-epoxy constituents notably enhanced the binding affinity. Among these groups, 11-OH and 16-acetyl were especially important for a seamless interaction between the bufadienolides and HSA. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed that either an 11-OH or a 16-OAc group spatially close to a five-membered lactone ring significantly facilitated the anchoring of these compounds within site I of the HSA pocket via hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) with Tyr150 or Lys199, respectively. In summary,  structure strongly affects binding with HSA, and 11-OH or 16-OAc groups improve the drug association with key amino acid residues.

Many clinical cases showed that Chan su has severe side-effects on the CNS, causing shortness of breath, breathlessness, seizure, coma and cardiac arrhythmia. We used whole-cell recordings from brain slices to determine the effects of bufadienolides on excitability of a principal neuron in main olfactory bulb (MOB), mitral cells (MCs), and the cellular mechanism underlying the excitation. At higher concentrations, cinobufagin and resibufogenin induced irreversible over-excitation of MCs indicating a toxic effect. At lower concentrations, they concentration-dependently increased spontaneous firing rate, depolarized the membrane potential of MCs, and elicited inward currents. The excitatory effects were due to a direct action on MCs rather than an indirect phasic action. Bufadienolides and ouabain had similar effects on firing of MCs which suggested that bufadienolides activated neuron through a ouabain-like effect, most likely by inhibiting Na+/K+-ATPase.

A new angle in chemotherapeutics against these  types associated with dismal prognoses would be the targeting of specific ion channels and pumps over expressed by  cells as compared to normal cells. Several reports suggest that the alpha subunits of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (referred as sodium pump from now on) could be such targets, using cardiotonic steroids (CS) including cardenolides and bufadienolides. A significant proportion of non-small-cell-lung cancers (NSCLCs), glioblastomas (GBMs), melanomas and kidney cancers overexpresses the alpha-1 subunit of the sodium pump as compared to corresponding normal tissues, while  cancers overexpress the alpha-3 subunit. Thus, a deeper knowledge of the structure-activity relationship (SAR), in terms of CS-mediated anticancer effects, to the sodium pump alpha subunits might enable the identification of potent anticancer agents with limited cardiotoxicity. The current review provides an in depth SAR analysis with respect to cardenolide- versus -mediated anticancer effects. Moreover, pharmacological data from in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as pre-clinical and clinical trials regarding cardenolides to combat cancers associated with dismal prognoses are presented.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27616454>Antiproliferative activity and chemical composition of the venom from the Amazonian toad Rhinella marina (Anura: Bufonidae).</a></h2><p>Little is known on the composition of Peruvian Amazon toad venoms. The large toad Rhinella marina is common in the cleared tropical forests of the Iquitos region and is regarded as poisonous. The venom from two different populations of R. marina was collected in the Departamento de Loreto, Perú. The samples were assessed for antiproliferative effect and composition. Some 29 compounds were identified or tentatively identified from the venom by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. The main free  was marinobufagin 7 while marinobufotoxin 15 and bufalitoxin 9 were the main  argininyl diacid derivatives. The alkaloids dehydrobufotenin 28 and bufotenidin 29 were present in both venoms. The main difference in the venoms was the relative ratio of argininyl diacids from bufadienolides to free bufadienolides. The argininyl diacids included derivatives from bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinobufagin, hellebrigenin, resibufogenin and bufotalinin. Four compounds, including undecadienoyl aginine 6 and three argininyl diacids from bufadienolides were tentatively identified for the first time in the samples. The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (0.063-0.247 μg/mL), AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (0.076-0.272 μg/mL), SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells (0.154-0.296 μg/mL), J82 human bladder carcinoma cells (0.169-0.212 μg/mL), and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (0.071-0.283 μg/mL). The antiproliferative effect is mediated by ROS production and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). This is the first report on the composition of R. marina venom from the Peruvian Amazon pointing out the need to include different venom samples to get a better picture from the activity and composition of South American toad defense substances.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
