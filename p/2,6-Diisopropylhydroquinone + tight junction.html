We also found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway resulted in MMP-9 overexpression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in mice treated with 1,-DCE. In this study, we further hypothesized that inflammatory reactions mediated by the p38 MAPK/ NF-κB signaling pathway might be involved in MMP-9 overexpression, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and edema formation in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice. Our results revealed that subacute poisoning by 1,-DCE upregulates protein levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p-p65 in mouse brains. Pretreatment with an inhibitor against p38 MAPK attenuates these changes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor against NF-κB attenuates alterations in brain water content, pathological indications notable in brain edema, as well as mRNA and protein expression on levels of MMP-9, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, iNOS, and IL-1β,  proteins (TJs), GFAP and Iba-1 in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with an inhibitor against MMP-9 obstructs the decrease of TJs in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice. Lastly, pretreatment with an antagonist against the IL-1β receptor also attenuates changes in protein levels of p-p38 MAPK, p-p65, p-IκB, VCAM -1, ICAM-1, IL-1β, and Iba-1 in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated-mice. Taken together, findings from the current study indicate that the p38 MAPK/ NF-κB signaling pathway might be involved in the activation of glial cells, and the overproduction of proinflammatory factors, which might induce inflammatory reactions in the brain of 1,-DCE-intoxicated mice that leads to brain edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636641>β-Defensin 129 Attenuates Bacterial Endotoxin-Induced Inflammation and Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Defensins have attracted considerable research interest worldwide because of their potential to serve as a substitute for antibiotics. In this study, we characterized a novel porcine β-defensin (pBD129) and explored its role in alleviating bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation and intestinal epithelium atrophy. The  gene was cloned and expressed in . A recombinant pBD129 protein was also purified. To explore its role in alleviating the endotoxin-induced inflammation, mice, with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were treated by pBD129 at different doses. The recombinant pBD129 showed significant antimicrobial activities against the  and  with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 32 μg/mL. Hemolytic assays showed that the pBD129 had no detrimental impact on cell viabilities. Interestingly, we found that pBD129 attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by decreasing serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α ( < 0.05). Moreover, pBD129 elevated the intestinal villus height ( < 0.05) and enhanced the expression and localization of the major -associated protein ZO-1 in LPS-challenged mice. Additionally, pDB129 at a high dose significantly decreased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) concentration ( < 0.05) and reduced intestinal epithelium cell apoptosis ( < 0.05) in LPS-challenged mice. Importantly, pBD129 elevated the expression level of Bcl--associated death promoter (Bcl-), but down-regulated the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes such as the B-cell lymphoma--associated X protein (Bax), BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and caspase-9 in the intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05). These results suggested a novel function of the mammalian defensins, and the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of pBD129 may allow it a potential substitute for conventionally used antibiotics or drugs.Copyright © 2019 Xie, Xie, Su, Chen, Yu, Mao, Huang, Yu, Luo, Zheng, Luo and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434788>Claudin-9 structures reveal mechanism for toxin-induced gut barrier breakdown.</a></h2><p>The human pathogenic bacterium  secretes an enterotoxin (CpE) that targets claudins through its C-terminal receptor-binding domain (cCpE). Isoform-specific binding by CpE causes dissociation of claudins and  (TJs), resulting in cytotoxicity and breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier. Here, we present crystal structures of human claudin-9 (hCLDN-9) in complex with cCpE at 3. and 3.3 Å. We show that hCLDN-9 is a high-affinity CpE receptor and that hCLDN-9-expressing cells undergo cell death when treated with CpE but not cCpE, which lacks its cytotoxic domain. Structures reveal cCpE-induced alterations to  epitopes known to enable claudin self-assembly and expose high-affinity interactions between hCLDN-9 and cCpE that explain isoform-specific recognition. These findings elucidate the molecular bases for hCLDN-9 selective ion permeability and binding by CpE, and provide mechanisms for how CpE disrupts gut homeostasis by dissociating claudins and TJs to affect epithelial adhesion and intercellular transport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405019>Cooked Red Lentils Dose-Dependently Modulate the Colonic Microenvironment in Healthy C57Bl/6 Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Dietary pulses, including lentils, are protein-rich plant foods that are enriched in intestinal health-promoting bioactives, such as non-digestible carbohydrates and phenolic compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial barrier integrity and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; () abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and /adherens  proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356632>Internalin AB-expressing recombinant Lactobacillus casei protects Caco- cells from Listeria monocytogenes-induced damages under simulated intestinal conditions.</a></h2><p>Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular foodborne pathogen that employs a number of strategies to survive challenging gastrointestinal conditions. It proliferates in the gut and subsequently causes listeriosis in high-risk individuals. Therefore, inhibition of its adherence to the intestinal receptors is crucial in controlling its infection. In this study, the effect of our previously developed recombinant Lactobacillus casei strain expressing invasion protein, Internalin AB of L. monocytogenes (LbcInlAB) on epithelial infection processes of the latter under simulated intestinal conditions was investigated.The confluent Caco- cell monolayer was pre-exposed to different L. casei strains at a multiplicity of exposure (MOE) of 10 for various periods before infection with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 under simulated intestinal conditions. Subsequently, L. monocytogenes adhesion, invasion, and translocation, cytotoxicity and impact on  integrity of the Caco- cells were analyzed.Under the simulated gastrointestinal condition, LbcInlAB showed a significant increase (p<0.0001) in adherence to, invasion and translocation through the Caco- cells when compared with the wild type strain. Although LbcInlAB strain exhibited enhanced inhibition of L. monocytogenes, it was not able to displace L. monocytogenes cells already attached to the monolayer. Additionally, pre-exposure to LbcInlAB reduced L. monocytogenes-mediated cytotoxicity and protected the  barrier function.The recombinant L. casei expressing InlAB shows potential for use as a prophylactic intervention strategy for targeted control of L. monocytogenes during the intestinal phase of infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363892>Laparoscopic anti-reflux procedures with hepatic shoulder technique in the surgical management of large hiatal hernias and paraesophageal hernias: a follow-up study.</a></h2><p>Numerous techniques have been historically proposed in the management of gastroesophageal reflux and paraesophageal hernias (PEH). A follow-up study (Quilici et al. in Surg Endosc 23(11):2620-2623, 2009) to a novel laparoscopic approach introduced in 2009 and performed in 49 patients is presented.All procedures were performed via laparoscopy. Thirty-two patients underwent a Nissen Fundoplication, eleven a reduction of the PEH with a Nissen fundoplication, two without a fundoplication, and four with a Collis-Nissen fundoplication. In all patients, the left hepatic lobe was freed, repositioned, and anchored under and inferior to the gastroesophageal , propping the gastroesophageal  anteriorly. This maneuver entirely covers and closes the diaphragmatic defect.At the time of laparoscopy, several patients were found not to be suitable candidates for this procedure (morphology of the left hepatic lobe). Forty-nine procedures were completed. One patient was re-explored on POD  for a  hiatus post-Collis fundoplication. Post-operatively, all other patients did well without notable, unusual complaints. The average length of stay was . days. Although not statistically significant, 43 patients had no recurrence of symptoms with the longest follow-up at 10 years, two patients were lost to follow-up, one patient had a recurrence of the PEH and three patients stated they were experiencing some form of gastroesophageal reflux requiring medical management.In selected patients, patients with an "at-risk" crural closure during a laparoscopic anti-reflux procedure or PEH can safely be managed via a laparoscopic anti-reflux procedure with the hepatic shoulder technique. This technique has shown good early post-operative results and could be used as an alternative to a laparoscopic mesh-reinforced fundoplication in difficult crural closures or in the management of large paraesophageal hernias.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389456>Nomilin protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion induced neurological deficits and blood-brain barrier disruption via the Nrf2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The nuclear transcription factor erythroid--related factor  (Nrf2)/NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1) pathway has been considered as a potential target for neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Nomilin (NOM) is a limonoid compound obtained from the extracts of citrus fruits. The purpose of our study was to determine whether NOM could exert beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats. Firstly, NOM treatment significantly mitigated cell death and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which was almost abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. Secondly, NOM improved infarct area, brain edema and neurological deficits in an experimental stroke rat model via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Furthermore, NOM attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in MCAO rats, which might be associated with alleviating the loss of  proteins, including ZO-1 and occludin-5. Further results revealed that NOM treatment effectively mitigated oxidative stress and facilitated the expressions of Nrf2 and NQO1, which might confirm that the loss of  proteins in the microvasculature was likely mediated by oxidative stress. In conclusion, our study provided evidence that the protective effects of NOM in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats were related to the Nrf2/NQO1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351968>Berberine induces ZIP14 expression and modulates zinc redistribution to protect intestinal mucosal barrier during polymicrobial sepsis.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated if berberine might induce Zrt-Irt-like protein 14 (ZIP14) and affect zinc redistribution to protect intestinal barrier in sepsis.Rodent model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Plasma endotoxin was assayed by LAL test and plasma zinc was measured by flame atomic spectrophotometer. Gut mucosal permeability was determined by plasma FITC-dextran. Zinc content and ZIP14 mRNA in gut mucosa were assayed by spectrophotometer and qRT-PCR, respectively.  integrity of Caco- was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).  (TJ) protein expression was detected by Western blotting.Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment to CLP rats improved survival rate, reduced plasma endotoxin level, alleviated hypozincemia, increased zinc accumulation and ZIP14 mRNA expression in the intestinal mucosa. Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment decreased CLP-elicited intestinal hyperpermeability to FITC-dextran. These effects of berberine in vivo were abolished by AG1024. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) repressed zinc transfer into Caco- cells exposed to zinc gluconate. Berberine and IGF-I treatment increased ZIP14 protein expression and promoted zinc transfer into Caco- cells exposed to zinc gluconate plus LPS. Berberine treatment induced TJ protein (claudin-1 and occludin) and raised TEER in LPS-treated Caco- cells. These effects of berberine in vitro were partially inhibited by ZIP14 siRNA.The present study reveals that berberine induces ZIP14 expression and affects zinc re- distribution to protect intestinal barrier in sepsis, which is partially linked with the activation of IGF-I signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is difficult for most therapeutic agents to penetrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exhibit their antineoplastic activity in the brain. In this manuscript, a biomimetic in vitro BBB model was created by a composite process, this model can provide a significant foundation for the research of drug transport, tumor treatment, tumor microenvironment and other fields. A series of tests and comparative experiments were performed to evaluate this model. The tests showed that the model enabled preliminary simulation of the structure and function of the BBB. Experimental results demonstrated: 1) the new technology enabled controlled release of growth factors and successfully induced endothelial progenitor cells into endothelial cells. Compared with the traditional gold standard, the Transwell model, the expression of four specific proteins that are related to the BBB characteristics was significantly increased (alkaline phosphatase(ALP) by 89.82%, γ-GT by 88.86%, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by 57.40%, and Claudin-5 by 102.32%) in this model; ) Astrocytes had a promoting effect on the microvascular endothelial cells to form  (ZO-1 increased by 249.35%, Claudin-5 increased by 184.99%), and there was a great difference between whether these two types of cells were contact cultured or not; 3) The gelatinous cell U118 had a destructive effect on the  of BBB (ZO-1 decreased by 55.86%, Claudin-5 decreased by 37.84%).© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554875>CFH exerts anti-oxidant effects on retinal pigment epithelial cells independently from protecting against membrane attack complex.</a></h2><p>Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the first cause of social blindness in people aged over 65 leading to atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), photoreceptors and choroids, eventually associated with choroidal neovascularization. Accumulation of undigested cellular debris within RPE cells or under the RPE (Drusen), oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators contribute to the RPE cell death. The major risk to develop AMD is the Y402H polymorphism of complement factor H (CFH). CFH interacting with oxidized phospholipids on the RPE membrane modulates the functions of these cells, but the exact role of CFH in RPE cell death and survival remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the potential protective mechanism of CFH on RPE cells submitted to oxidative stress. Upon exposure to oxidized lipids 4-HNE (4-hydroxy--nonenal) derived from photoreceptors, both the human RPE cell line ARPE-19 and RPE cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were protected from death only in the presence of the full length human recombinant CFH in the culture medium. This protective effect was independent from the membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. CFH maintained RPE cells ' structure and regulated the caspase dependent apoptosis process. These results demonstrated the CFH anti-oxidative stress functions independently of its capacity to inhibit MAC formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399484>Vinculin is critical for the robustness of the epithelial cell sheet paracellular barrier for ions.</a></h2><p>The paracellular barrier function of  (TJs) in epithelial cell sheets is robustly maintained against mechanical fluctuations, by molecular mechanisms that are poorly understood. Vinculin is an adaptor of a mechanosensory complex at the adherens . Here, we generated vinculin KO Eph4 epithelial cells and analyzed their confluent cell-sheet properties. We found that vinculin is dispensable for the basic TJ structural integrity and the paracellular barrier function for larger solutes. However, vinculin is indispensable for the paracellular barrier function for ions. In addition, TJs stochastically showed dynamically distorted patterns in vinculin KO cell sheets. These KO phenotypes were rescued by transfecting full-length vinculin and by relaxing the actomyosin tension with blebbistatin, a myosin II ATPase activity inhibitor. Our findings indicate that vinculin resists mechanical fluctuations to maintain the TJ paracellular barrier function for ions in epithelial cell sheets.© 2019 Konishi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536982>Lubiprostone Induces Claudin-1 and Protects Intestinal Barrier Function.</a></h2><p>Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, is said to reduce epithelial permeability. However, whether lubiprostone has a direct effect on the epithelial barrier function and how it modulates the intestinal barrier function remain unknown. Therefore, the effects of lubiprostone on intestinal barrier function were evaluated in vitro.Caco- cells were used to assess the intestinal barrier function. To examine the expression of claudins, immunoblotting was performed with specific antibodies. The effects of lubiprostone on cytokines (IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-1β) and aspirin-induced epithelial barrier disruption were assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability.IFNγ, IL-6, IL-1β, and aspirin significantly decreased TEER and increased epithelial permeability. Lubiprostone significantly improved the IFNγ-induced decrease in TEER in a dose-dependent manner. Lubiprostone significantly reduced the IFNγ-induced increase in FITC labeled-dextran permeability. The changes induced by IL-6, IL-1β, and aspirin were not affected by lubiprostone. The expression of claudin-1, but not claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and ZO-1 was significantly increased by lubiprostone.Lubiprostone significantly improved the IFNγ-induced decrease in TEER and increase in FITC labeled-dextran permeability.

However, current monolayer systems are cost- and/or time-intensive, hampering progress. This study evaluates two separate methods to reduce resource input: FB Essence as a fetal bovine serum (FBS) alternative and a new, 3-day Caco- system deemed "thrifty, rapid intestinal monolayers" (TRIM).Caco- cells were cultured with FB Essence and compared to cells in 10% FBS for proliferation and monolayer formation. TRIM were compared to commonly-used 21-day and Corning® HTS monolayer systems, as well as mouse intestines, for permeability behavior, epithelial gene expression, and  arrangement.No amount of FB Essence maintained Caco- cells beyond 10 passages. In contrast, TRIM compared favorably in permeability and gene expression to intestinal tissues. Furthermore, TRIM cost $109 and required 1.3 h of time per 24-well plate, compared to $164 and 3.7 h for 21-day monolayers, and $340 plus 1.0 h for the HTS system.TRIM offer a new approach to generating Caco- monolayers that resemble the intestinal epithelium.

The aim of this study was to analyze the role of EMT-like changes in acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cells of the mesenchymal or epithelial phenotype. Therefore, chemoresistant BxPC-3, Capan-, Panc-1, and MiaPaca- cells were selected by chronic exposure to increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. We show that gemcitabine-resistant Panc-1 and MiaPaca- cells of mesenchymal-like phenotype undergo further EMT-like molecular changes mediated by ERK-ZEB-1 pathway, and that inhibition of ERK1/ phosphorylation or ZEB-1 expression resulted in a decrease in chemoresistance. Conversely, gemcitabine-resistant BxPC-3 and Capan- cells of epithelial-like phenotype did not show such typical EMT-like molecular changes although the expression of the  marker occludin could be found decreased. In pancreatic cancer patients, high ZEB-1 expression was associated with tumor invasion and tumor budding. In addition, tumor budding was essentially observed in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These findings support the notion that gemcitabine treatment induces EMT-like changes that sustain invasion and chemoresistance in PC cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273276>Rescue of  junctional localization of a claudin-16 mutant D97S by antimalarial medicine primaquine in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.</a></h2><p>Magnesium ion (Mg) is paracellularly reabsorbed through claudin-16 (CLDN16) in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop in the kidney. Genetic disorders of CLDN16 cause mislocalization of CLDN16, resulting in hypomagnesemia. There is no effective treatment for hypomagnesemia except for magnesium administration. Here, we searched for a novel drug to restore  junctional localization of a CLDN16 mutant. A D97S mutant, which has a mutation in the first extracellular loop (ECL) of CLDN16, was mainly colocalized with endosome marker, whereas wild-type (WT) CLDN16 was colocalized with ZO-1, an adaptor protein of . The protein stability of the D97S mutant was lower than that of WT. The expression level of the D97S mutant was increased by lactacystin, a proteasomal inhibitor. Endocytosis inhibitors increased the  junctional localization of the D97S mutant. We found that primaquine, an antimalarial agent, increased the protein stability and cell surface localization of the D97S mutant, but the localization of other mutants, which have mutations in the cytosolic domain or second ECL, was not affected. Transepithelial Mg flux was increased by primaquine in D97S mutant-expressing cells. The expression of chaperon proteins, proteasome activity, and lactate dehydrogenase release were decreased by primaquine, and the proportion of viable cells increased. In contrast, these effects were not observed in WT CLDN16-expressing cells. These results suggested that primaquine increases the  junctional localization of the D97S mutant, resulting in a reduction in ER stress and cellular injury.

This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and barrier function in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability,  proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of  proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05).

However, little is understood regarding the underlying mechanism of resistance. The present study aimed to identify the underlying crucial genes and regulatory networks associated with docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer using bioinformatics analyses. For this purpose, one expression profile dataset (GSE33455), which included two docetaxel-sensitive and two docetaxel-resistant cell lines, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and analyses of differential gene expression and function enrichment were performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the associated hub genes were investigated using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins and Cytoscape software. A total of 756 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified, including 509 downregulated and 247 upregulated genes. Enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were associated with the interferon-γ-mediated signaling pathway, protein binding, bicellular  and cancer pathways. Two modules were screened from the PPI network, and the corresponding genes were identified to be largely enriched in the interferon-γ-mediated signaling pathway and the negative regulators of the DExD/H-Box helicase 58/interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 signaling pathway, and enriched in cell-cell adhesion and the Rap1 signaling pathway. Among the ten hub genes, epidermal growth factor receptor, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), interleukin (IL)6, CXC motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), cyclin dependent kinase 1 and CD44 molecule (CD44) were significantly differentially expressed in prostate cancer tissues compared with healthy tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data. The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database revealed that ICAM1 was positively associated with IL6 and CXCL8, and epidermal growth factor receptor was positively associated with CD44 and SYK. Additionally, ten hub genes, which were identified to be associated with the drug resistance of docetaxel in prostatic carcinoma in the present study, were predominantly associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis performed on docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that certain hub genes, including CDK1, '-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 3, CXCL8 and CDH1, were highly expressed in the docetaxel-resistant cell lines, which confirmed the bioinformatics results. In conclusion, the present study identified a number of important genes that are associated with the molecular mechanism of docetaxel resistance by integrated bioinformatical analysis, and these genes and regulatory networks may assist with identifying potential gene therapy targets for CRPC. Further functional analyses are required to validate the current findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387268>Transepithelial Transport Characteristics of the Cholesterol- Lowing Soybean Peptide, WGAPSL, in Caco- Cell Monolayers.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that soybean protein and its peptides have cholesterol-lowering activities. However, it is not clear whether these peptides could overcome physiological barriers, such as phase II metabolism in gastrointestinal tract and poor permeability, to reach the blood stream in its intact form. Therefore, the transepithelial transport characteristics of soybean peptide Trp-Gly-Ala-Pro-Ser-Leu (WGAPSL) with cholesterol- lowering activity were investigated in Caco- cells. In this study; the transepithelial absorption of WGAPSL was studied using human intestinal Caco- cell monolayers.

During the apical (AP) side to basolateral (BL) side transport, WGAPSL was absorbed intact through Caco- cell monolayers with apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values of 4.4 × 10 to 1. × 10 cm/s. Cytochalasin D loosened the  of Caco- cell monolayers and significantly ( < 0.05) improved the transport process.

The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal diseases; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced colitis manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa B, P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced colitis in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular  (TJs). Furthermore, CS can be beneficial as an add-on drug with the conventional treatments of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450555>ZO- Is a Master Regulator of Gene Expression, Cell Proliferation, Cytoarchitecture, and Cell Size.</a></h2><p>ZO- is a cytoplasmic protein of  (TJs). Here, we describe ZO- involvement in the formation of the apical junctional complex during early development and in TJ biogenesis in epithelial cultured cells. ZO- acts as a scaffold for the polymerization of claudins at TJs and plays a unique role in the blood-testis barrier, as well as at TJs of the human liver and the inner ear. ZO- movement between the cytoplasm and nucleus is regulated by nuclear localization and exportation signals and post-translation modifications, while ZO- arrival at the cell border is triggered by activation of calcium sensing receptors and corresponding downstream signaling. Depending on its location, ZO- associates with junctional proteins and the actomyosin cytoskeleton or a variety of nuclear proteins, playing a role as a transcriptional repressor that leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. ZO- regulates cell architecture through modulation of Rho proteins and its absence induces hypertrophy due to inactivation of the Hippo pathway and activation of mTOR and S6K. The interaction of ZO- with viral oncoproteins and kinases and its silencing in diverse carcinomas reinforce the view of ZO- as a tumor regulator protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255847>Developmental exposure to BDE-99 hinders cerebrovascular growth and disturbs vascular barrier formation in zebrafish larvae.</a></h2><p>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are distributed throughout the environment. Despite a moratorium on their use, concentrations of PBDEs in the atmosphere and in residential environments remain high due to their persistence. The environmental health risks remain concerning and one of the major adverse effects is neurodevelopmental toxicity. However, the early response and effects of PBDEs exposure on the developing brain remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of ,',4,4',5-pentabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-99) on vascular growth and vascular barrier function with an emphasis on cerebral blood vessels, in the early life stages, using a zebrafish model. No general toxicity was observed in exposing zebrafish larvae to 0-0.5 μM BDE-99 at 72 hpf. BDE-99 exposure resulted in neither general toxicity nor pronounced developmental impairment in somatic blood vessels, including intersegmental vessels (ISV) and common cardinal veins (CCV). Meanwhile, both 0.05 μM and 0.5 μM of BDE-99 reduced cerebrovascular density as well as down-regulation of VEGFA and VEGFR2 in the head. In addition, BDE-99 exposure increased vascular leakage, both in cerebral and truncal vasculature at 72 hpf. The accentuated vascular permeability was observed in the head. The mRNA levels of genes encoding  molecules decreased in the BDE-99-exposed larvae, and more robust reductions in Cldn5, Zo1 and Jam were detected in the head than in the trunk. Moreover, proinflammatory factors including TNF-α, IL-1β and ICAM-1 were induced, and the expression of neurodevelopment-related genes was suppressed in the head following BDE-99 exposure. Taken together, these results reveal that developmental exposure to BDE-99 impedes cerebrovascular growth and disturbs vascular barrier formation. The cerebral vasculature in developing zebrafish, a more sensitive target for BDE-99, may be a promising tool for the assessment of the early neurodevelopmental effects due to PBDEs exposure.Copyright © 2019.

However, to our knowledge, no study has specifically addressed the potential protective effects of AST against bovine endometritis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether treatment with AST could protect endometrial epithelial cells against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury. Treatment of bovine endometrial epithelial cell line (BEND) with AST reduced LPS-induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), increased the cellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), decreased the proportion of apoptotic cells, and promoted the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and epithelial growth factor (EGF). The effects of AST were mediated through the downregulation of Bcl- associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), and cleaved caspase-3 and through the upregulation of B-cell lymphoma  (Bcl-). Moreover, AST significantly increased the expression of the  proteins claudin, cadherin-1 (CDH1), and  protein 1 (TJP1), which play an essential role in the maintenance of host endometrial defense barrier against pathogen infection. Collectively, these results demonstrated that treatment with AST protected against oxidative stress, prevented cell apoptosis, promoted BEND cells viability, and increased the production of growth factors, in addition to activating the endometrial defense barrier. Therefore, AST is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of endometritis. This finding is of utmost importance in the present times when the excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.© The Author(s) 2019.

We hypothesized that feed restriction after day 5 following muscle satellite cell development would allow the full growth of the breast meat. To accomplish this goal, 300 1-day-old ducklings (Maple Leaf Farms Inc.) were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups (n = 4 pens, 25 ducks per pen): (1) Control group fed to ad libitum; () 85% daily feed intake from days 1 to 14 (FR 85% 1-14); 85% daily feed intake from days 5 to 14 (FR 85% 5-14). All ducks were vaccinated with inactivated Salmonella enteritidis on day 14 and boosted on day 26. The FR 85% 5-14 did show similar production standards to controls, and improved gait characteristics (P < 0.05). To determine if the partial feed restriction would have an impact on intestinal epithelial  integrity, we treated ducks on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 with 8.32 mg/kg FITC-d in water per os and blood samples were obtained via the tibial vein 1 h later. Serum samples were analyzed for presence and quantification of FITC-d. Feed restriction elicited a significant increase in FITC-d permeability at all points of evaluation. Anti-S. enteritidis specific IgY responses were assessed by ELISA from serum collected at 14 D, 28 D, and 35 D. Although all ducks showed an increase humoral immune response to the S. enteritidis, both feed restricted groups showed reduced IgY production compared to ad lib controls. Our data suggest that although the FR 5-14 feed restriction paradigm may reduce gait abnormalities without affecting production rates, some challenges exist due to increased gut leakiness or decreased acquired immune activity. Future studies will look at altering the feed restriction milieu to ameliorate these challenges.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454490>Astrocyte-derived fatty acid-binding protein 7 protects blood-brain barrier integrity through a caveolin-1/MMP signaling pathway following traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>The astrocyte-endothelial cell interaction is crucial for normal brain homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in pathological conditions. However, the mechanism by which astrocytes control BBB integrity, especially after traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that astrocyte-derived fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), a differentiation- and migration-associated molecule, may function as a modulator of BBB permeability in a rat weight-drop model of TBI. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBI induced increased expression of FABP7 in astrocytes, accompanied by caveolin-1 (Cav-1) upregulation in endothelial cells. Administration of recombinant FABP7 significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB permeability, concomitant with upregulation of endothelial Cav-1 and  protein expression, while FABP7 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with daidzein, a specific inhibitor of Cav-1, reversed the inhibitory effects of recombinant FABP7 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-/9 expression and abolished its BBB protection after TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived FABP7 upregulation may represent an endogenous protective response to BBB disruption partly mediated through a Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway following TBI.Copyright © 2019.

Understanding the exact molecular mechanisms by which their absorption behavior is regulated could greatly improve treatment strategies for stimulating intestinal absorption in diseases with Mg and/or Ca deficiency. However, such studies are hampered by the lack of in vitro intestinal cell models mimicking the mechanical and physiological properties of the gut. In this study we develop an in vitro gut model based on porous micropatterned membranes with villi-like surface topography and mechanical properties closely mimicking that of intestinal tissue. These membranes are prepared via phase separation micromolding using poly-ε-caprolactone/poly-lactic-glycolic acid (PCL/PLGA) polymer blend and can facilitate cellular differentiation of Caco- cells similar to native enterocytes. In fact, cells cultured on these micropatterned membranes form a brush border of microvilli with spatial differences in morphology and  formation along the villous-base axis. Moreover, cells cultured on our membranes show a -fold increased alkaline phosphatase activity at the end of differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that cells cultured on our micropatterned membranes have a 4- and 1.5-fold increased uptake of Mg and Ca, respectively, compared to non-patterned membranes. These results indicate that the new membranes can mimic the intestinal environment and therefore can have a great impact on mineral uptake in vitro. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents the development of an in vitro gut model consisting of villi-like PCL/PLGA micropatterned membranes. These membranes are prepared via phase separation micromolding (PSμM), a technique which allows tailoring of the membrane surface topography combined with membrane porosity and interconnectivity which are important parameters for membranes used for in vitro transport studies. The culture of Caco- cells on these micropatterned membranes shows that they facilitate cellular differentiation similar to gut enterocytes. Our data indicate that mimicking the 3D geometry of the gut is very important for improving the physiological relevance of in vitro gut models. In the future, our micropatterned membranes with segment-specific geometries, in combination with isotopic measurements, would be applied to perform detailed ion uptake and transport studies.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

The human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco- was also analyzed in vitro for the effects of ethanol on the barrier function (transepithelial electrical resistance), occludin localization (immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting), and endocytosis pathways (double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy with selective pathway inhibitors).The ethanol-fed mice developed steatohepatitis and displayed intestinal barrier dysfunction, the disruption of intestinal TJ, and enhanced intestinal endocytosis of occluding compared with the control mice. In the Caco- monolayers, ethanol treatment decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, disrupted TJ formation, and enhanced occludin endocytosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These deleterious events were reversed by pretreating the Caco- cells with a selective pharmacological inhibitor of macropinocytosis, but not with the inhibitors of clathrin or caveolin-mediated endocytic pathways.Chronic ethanol exposure may increase intestinal permeability by inducing the micropinocytosis of occludin, resulting in the disruption of intestinal TJ.© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354386>Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 Protects Intestinal Barrier Function by Inhibiting NF-B-Mediated Activation of the MLCK-P-MLC Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a kind of probiotic, has been reported to have a protective effect on the intestinal barrier function and can ameliorate certain gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, the potential protective effect of EcN on the intestinal barrier function in a septic mouse model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation was investigated. FITC-Dextran 4,000 Da (FD-4) flux and the expression levels of  (TJ) proteins were measured to evaluate the protective effect of EcN on the intestinal barrier function. Then, Caco- monolayers were utilized to further investigate the protective effect of the EcN supernatant (EcN) on the barrier dysfunction induced by TNF- and IFN- in vitro; the plasma level of both the cytokines increased significantly during sepsis. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FD-4 transmembrane flux were measured, and the localization of ZO-1 and Occludin was investigated by immunofluorescence. The expression of MLCK and the phosphorylation of MLC were detected by western blot. The activation of NF-B was explored by immunofluorescence, and CHIP assays were performed to investigate the conjunction of NF-B with the promoter of MLCK.

STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial  integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial  dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial  integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626040>Overexpression of BCL- in the Intestinal Epithelium Prevents Sepsis-Induced Gut Barrier Function Via Altering  Protein Expression.</a></h2><p>Sepsis induces both intestinal hyperpermeability and epithelial apoptosis. While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut barrier dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl- mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal  were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl- mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl- mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl- mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl- mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins , 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all  mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl- mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via  alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl- overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288831>Glibenclamide in aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (GASH): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Recent findings on the benefits of glibenclamide as a neuroprotective drug have started a new era for prospective studies on sulfonylureas. The effect of glibenclamide blocking the Sur1-Trpm4 channel was examined in models of subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke, with findings of significantly reduced  abnormalities, resulting in less edema formation and considerably reduced transsynaptic apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and significantly ameliorated impairments in spatial learning. Based on these data, we plan a clinical trial to establish evidence of glibenclamide as an adjunct treatment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.An estimated 80 patients meeting the inclusion criteria of radiological confirmatory evidence of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, age 18-70 years, and presentation of less than 96 h from the ictus will be allocated randomly into two groups, one receiving 5 mg daily oral intake of glibenclamide for 21 days and another control group receiving a placebo. The study's primary outcome is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) after 6 months, as favorable (mRS 0-) or unfavorable (mRS 3-6). The secondary outcomes will be late cognitive status, assessed after 6 months by psychological tests (the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment), as well as death at 6 months, delayed cerebral ischemia and occurrence of serious adverse events due to study medication.There is a growing interest in the scientific community regarding glibenclamide in brain edema and traumatic brain injury, but with very little of this interest targeting spontaneous brain hemorrhage, especially aneurism rupture.

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic during naturally occurring NE. On day of hatch, 1080 Cobb 500 male broilers were randomly allocated to three groups (12 replicate pens/treatment, 30 birds/pen) including 1) negative control (NC): corn-soybean meal diet; ) positive control (PC): NC + 20 mg virginiamycin/kg diet (0.450 kg Stafac20/ton); and 3) NC + PrimaLac (1.36 and 0.91 kg/ton from 1-21 and 22-42 days, respectively). One day (d) post placement, all birds were challenged by a commercial live oocyst coccidia vaccine as a predisposing factor to NE. Body weight and feed intake were measured at the onset of NE (d 8) and end of each feeding phase. On d 8, small intestines of two birds/pen were examined for NE lesions, and jejunum samples from one bird were collected for mRNA gene expression analysis of  proteins, cytokines, and nutrient transporters. Data were analyzed using the Jump (JMP) software and significance between treatments identified by LSD ( < 0.05). Compared to NC, supplementation of probiotic reduced d 1-42 mortality; however, PC was the only group with significantly lower mortality. Despite significantly improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) in PC and probiotic groups during d 1-42, average daily gain was only higher in PC (77.69 g/bird) compared with NC (74.99 g/bird). Furthermore, probiotic and PC groups had significantly reduced lesion scores in the duodenum and jejunum compared to NC. Expression of claudin-3 was higher, while expression of zonula occluden- tended (  0.06) to be higher in probiotic-supplemented birds compared to NC. Moreover, birds fed the probiotic diet had significantly higher expression of IL-10, IL-17, AMPK-α1, and SGLT1 mRNA compared to NC birds. The expression of PepT1 was higher for the probiotic-supplemented group compared to PC. IFN-γ expression was lower in PC compared to NC, while there was no difference between probiotic and NC. There were no differences in gene expression of sIgA, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-22 among treatments. Collectively, these data indicate that in a naturally occurring NE model, supplementation of a probiotic helps to improve FCR and reduce lesions, potentially due to the improvements in mRNA expression of , cytokines, and nutrient transporters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614141>Trans-10-hydroxy--decenoic acid alleviates LPS-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction by activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that trans-10-hydroxy--decenoic acid (10-HDA), the exclusive lipid component of royal jelly (RJ), alleviates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro. However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of  proteins (occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL- and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP- and MMP-9) and increased the expression of  proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of  proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is challenging to use light to manipulate protein activity in living systems without genetic modification. Here, we report a technique to optically switch off protein activity in living cells with high spatiotemporal resolution, referred to as molecular hyperthermia (MH). MH is based on the nanoscale-confined heating of plasmonic gold nanoparticles by short laser pulses to unfold and photoinactivate targeted proteins of interest. First, we show that protease-activated receptor  (PAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor and an important pathway that leads to pain sensitization, can be photoinactivated  by MH without compromising cell proliferation. PAR2 activity can be switched off in laser-targeted cells without affecting surrounding cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular specificity of MH by inactivating PAR2 while leaving other receptors intact. Second, we demonstrate that the photoinactivation of a  protein in brain endothelial monolayers leads to a reversible blood-brain barrier opening . Lastly, the protein inactivation by MH is below the nanobubble generation threshold and thus is predominantly due to the nanoscale heating. MH is distinct from traditional hyperthermia (that induces global tissue heating) in both its time and length scales: nanoseconds  seconds, nanometers  millimeters. Our results demonstrate that MH enables selective and remote manipulation of protein activity and cellular behavior without genetic modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498510>Effects of glucagon-like peptides 1 and  and epidermal growth factor on the epithelial barrier of the rumen of adult sheep.</a></h2><p>Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and glucagon-like peptides (GLP) modulate the  (TJ) of the intestinal epithelial barrier (EB) of monogastric animals. This work tried to elucidate whether GLP-1, GLP- and EGF can affect the EB of the rumen. Ovine ruminal epithelia were incubated in Ussing chambers for 7 hr with 25 or 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP- on the serosal side, with .5 nM of EGF on the serosal side or with 0.25 or .5 nM EGF on the mucosal side. No treatment affected tissue conductance. Short-circuit current (I ) was affected by time and treatment and their interactions. Only 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP- decreased I in certain periods compared with 25 nM GLP-1 or 0.25 nM mucosally applied EGF; however, not when compared to control epithelia. Fluorescein flux rates (J ) of ruminal epithelia were affected by treatment, time and time × treatment interaction. The time × treatment interaction was based on an increase in J between the first and last hour in epithelia incubated with 25 nM GLP-1 or GLP- and in epithelia incubated with EGF. After 7 hr incubation, claudin-7 mRNA expression was downregulated in all treatments. Claudin-1 mRNA was upregulated after incubation with .5 nM EGF on the serosal side, claudin-4 mRNA was downregulated by .5 nM EGF on the mucosal side, and occludin mRNA was increased after incubation with 250 nM GLP-. The protein abundance of all tested TJ proteins was not influenced by treatment. We conclude that GLP-1, GLP-, and EGF have no obvious acute effects on the EB of ruminal epithelia under simulated physiological conditions ex vivo. However, by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-7 and partly affecting other TJ proteins, they may modulate EB in the longer term or under certain conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplementing a novel specific low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) dietary fiber in preventing T1D development. Female NOD mice were weaned onto control or 5% (wt/wt) LMP supplemented diets for up to 40 weeks of age, overt diabetes incidence and blood glucose were monitored. Then broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) treatment per os for 7 days followed by gut microbiota transfer was performed to demonstrate gut microbiota-dependent effects. Next-generation sequencing was used for analyzing the composition of microbiota in caecum. Concentration of short chain fatty acids were determined by GC-MS. The barrier reinforcing  proteins zonula occludens- (ZO-), claudin-1 and NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation were determined by Western blot. The proportion of CD25Foxp3CD4 regulatory T cell (Foxp3 Treg) in the pancreas, pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that LMP supplementation ameliorated T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as evidenced by decreasing diabetes incidence and fasting glucose levels in LMP fed NOD mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that LMP supplementation prevented T1D-associated caecal dysbiosis and selectively enriched caecal bacterial species to produce more SCFAs. The LMP-mediated microbial balance further enhanced caecal barrier function and shaped gut-pancreatic immune environment, as characterized by higher expression of  proteins claudin-1, ZO- in caecum, increased Foxp3 Treg population and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas. The microbiota-dependent beneficial effect of LMP on T1D was further proven by the fact that aberration of caecal microbiota by ABX treatment worsened T1D autoimmunity and could be restored with transfer of feces of LMP-fed NOD mice. These data demonstrate that this novel LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment. This finding opens a realistic option for gut microbiota manipulation and prevention of T1D in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288834>The effects of human immunoglobulin G on enhancing tissue protection and neurobehavioral recovery after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury are mediated through the neurovascular unit.</a></h2><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a condition with few effective treatment options.

Physical trauma to the spinal cord disrupts the barrier, which leads to neuroinflammation by facilitating immune cell migration to the damaged site in a process involving immune cell adhesion. Immunosuppressive strategies, including methylprednisolone (MPSS), have been investigated to treat SCI. However, despite some success, MPSS has the potential to increase a patient's susceptibility to wound infection and impaired wound healing. Hence, immunomodulation may be a more attractive approach than immunosuppression. Approved for modulating neuroinflammation in certain disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) has shown promise in the setting of experimental SCI, though the optimal dose and mechanism of action remain undetermined.Female adult Wistar rats were subjected to moderate-severe clip compression injury (35 g) at the C7-T1 level and randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV) bolus of hIgG (0.02, 0., 0.4, 1,  g/kg), MPSS (0.03 g/kg), or control buffer at 15 min post-SCI. At 24 h and 6 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological, and neurobehavioral effects of hIgG were analyzed.At 24 h post-injury, human immunoglobulin G co-localized with spinal cord pericytes, astrocytes, and vessels. hIgG ( g/kg) protected the spinal cord neurovasculature after SCI by increasing  protein expression and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in vascular integrity were associated with changes in spinal cord inflammation. Interestingly, hIgG ( g/kg) increased serum expression of inflammatory cytokines and co-localized (without decreasing protein expression) with spinal cord vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a protein used by immune cells to enter into inflamed tissue. Acute molecular benefits of hIgG ( g/kg) led to greater tissue preservation, functional blood flow, and neurobehavioral recovery at 6 weeks post-SCI. Importantly, the effects of hIgG ( g/kg) were superior to control buffer and hIgG (0.4 g/kg), and comparable with MPSS (0.03 g/kg).hIgG ( g/kg) is a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate secondary pathology in SCI through antagonizing immune cell infiltration at the level of the neurovascular unit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325803>The microstructure of laminin-111 compensates for dystroglycan loss in mammary epithelial cells in downstream expression of milk proteins.</a></h2><p>Laminin-111 (Ln-1), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein found in the basement membrane of mammary gland epithelia, is essential for lactation. In mammary epithelial cells (MECs), dystroglycan (Dg) is believed to be necessary for polymerization of laminin-111 into networks., thus we asked whether correct polymerization could compensate for Dg loss. Artificially polymerized laminin-111 and the laminin-glycoprotein mix Matrigel, both formed branching, spread networks with fractal dimensions from 1.7 to 1.8, whereas laminin-111 in neutral buffers formed small aggregates without fractal properties (a fractal dimension of ). In Dg knockout cells, either polymerized laminin-111 or Matrigel readily attached to the cell surface, whereas aggregated laminin-111 did not. In contrast, polymerized and aggregated laminin-111 bound similarly to Dg knock-ins. Both polymerized laminin-111 and Matrigel promoted cell rounding, clustering, formation of , and expression of milk proteins, whereas aggregated Ln-1 did not attach to cells or promote functional differentiation. These findings support that the microstructure of Ln-1 networks in the basement membrane regulates mammary epithelial cell function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although probiotic Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) has been reported to possess immune-regulatory characteristics and can prevent diarrhea in pigs, very little information exists in relation to the specific regulatory impact of E. faecium NCIMB 11181 on NE-induced intestinal barrier injury of broiler chickens. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 11181 on NE-induced intestinal barrier injury in broiler chickens. The study also aimed to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin these protective effects. One hundred and eighty Arbor Acres (AA) broiler chicks (one day old) were randomly assigned using a  ×  factorial arrangement into two groups fed different levels of dietary E. faecium NCIMB 11181 (0 or  × 10 CFU/kg of diet) and two disease-challenge groups (control or NE challenged). The results showed that NE induced body weight loss, intestinal lesions, and histopathological inflammation, as well as intestinal-cell apoptosis. These symptoms were alleviated following the administration of probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 11181. Pretreatment with probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 11181 significantly upregulated the expression of the Claudin-1 gene encoding a  protein. Claudin-1 and HSP70 protein expression were also increased in the jejunum regardless of NE infection. Furthermore, NE-infected birds fed with E. faecium displayed notable increases in MyD88, NF-κB, iNOS, PI3K, GLP-, IL-1β, IL-4, and HSP70 mRNA expression. E. faecium NCIMB 11181 administration also significantly improved the animals' intestinal microbial composition regardless of NE treatment. These findings indicated that addition of E. faecium NCIMB 11181 to poultry feed is effective in mitigating NE-induced gut injury, possibly by strengthening intestinal mucosal barrier function, as well as modulating gut microflora and intestinal mucosal immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346356>A Protective Role of the NRF2-Keap1 Pathway in Maintaining Intestinal Barrier Function.</a></h2><p>Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor ) is a master regulator of cellular oxidative levels against environmental stresses. Nrf2 induces the expression of metabolic detoxification and antioxidant enzymes to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The gastrointestinal tract is a key source of ROS. Intestinal barrier is critical to maintain the healthy steady state of the human gastrointestinal tract. Nrf2 has been shown to play important roles in maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier. Here, we made a systematic review on the roles of Nrf2 in maintaining intestinal barrier, including the following: (1) NRF2 reduced intestinal mucosal injury by suppressing oxidative stress; () NRF2 decreased intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the inflammatory pathway; (3) NRF2 affected intestinal  proteins and apoptosis of cells to regulate intestinal permeability; (4) NRF2 affected T cell differentiation and functions; (5) the crossregulation between the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway and autophagy controlled intestinal oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578801>Chronic sleep loss disrupts blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers, and reduces male fertility.</a></h2><p>Sleep loss increases blood-brain barrier permeability. As the blood-brain barrier and the blood-tissue barriers in the reproductive tract (blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers) share common characteristics, we hypothesized that sleep restriction may also modify their barrier function. Previous reports showed that sleep loss decreased sperm viability and progressive fast mobility, which may be a consequence of altered blood-testis and blood-epididymis barrier. Therefore, we quantified changes in blood-testis and blood-epididymis barrier after sleep loss and related them to male fertility. Adult male Wistar rats were sleep restricted using the multiple-platform technique in a protocol of 20 hr daily sleep deprivation plus 4 hr of sleep recovery in the home-cage. At the 10th day, barrier permeability assays were performed with Na-fluorescein, 10 kDa Cascade blue-dextrans and Evans blue, and the expression of  proteins, actin and androgen receptor was quantified. At the 10th day of sleep restriction and after sleep recovery days 1-7, males were placed with sexually receptive females, sexual behaviour was tested, and the percentage of pregnancies was calculated. Sleep restriction increased the barrier permeability to low- and high-molecular-weight tracers, and decreased the expression of  proteins, actin and androgen receptor. Concomitantly, sleep restriction reduced the percentage of ejaculating males and the number of pregnancies. Sleep recovery for -3 days progressively re-established fertility, as indicated by a higher percentage of ejaculating males and impregnated females. In conclusion, chronic sleep loss alters fertility concomitantly with the disruption of the blood-tissue barriers at the reproductive tract, the mechanism involves androgen signalling.© 2019 European Sleep Research Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313790>Inorganic arsenic causes intestinal barrier disruption.</a></h2><p>Inorganic arsenic (As) is the most toxic form of As found in food and water. Gastrointestinal disorders have been reported in populations chronically exposed to this arsenical form or to one of its metabolites; however, studies to determine the mechanisms of inorganic As toxicity at the intestinal level are scarce. The aim of this study is to determine the mechanisms of toxicity of inorganic As [As(iii) and As(v)] on intestinal epithelial cells. For this purpose, two human intestinal cell models were used: non-transformed colon epithelial cells (NCM460) and epithelial cells from a colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-). Exposure to As(iii) and As(v) generates an increase in the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 (57-1135%) and an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (130-340%) in both cell lines. This pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant response may be responsible for the structural and functional modifications demonstrated in the monolayers formed by both cell types. Treatments with As(iii) and As(v) produce a redistribution of zonula occludens 1 and a reduction in the expression of claudin 1,  proteins that participate in maintaining the structure of the epithelium. All these toxic effects are finally translated into a loss of the barrier function of intestinal monolayers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276135>Cinnamon subcritical water extract attenuates intestinal inflammation and enhances intestinal  in a Caco- and RAW264.7 co-culture model.</a></h2><p>Cinnamon is known to have several physiological effects; the effects of Cinnamomum japonicum Sieb. on anti-inflammation and  were investigated in the cellular intestinal inflammation model. Cinnamon subcritical water extract (CSWE) significantly down-regulated the protein and expression levels of nitrite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, and the phosphorylation of the factors of the NF-κB pathway. It also significantly decreased the permeability but increased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value and the protein and expression levels of  proteins (i.e., zonula occludens (ZO)-1, occludin, and claudin-1). Furthermore, cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde, the major components of C. japonicum, inhibited the phosphorylation of the NF-κB pathway and increased the  protein expression.

During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by  (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs -B and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, -5 and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO- in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia. Finally, ZIKV added to the basolateral surface of a trophoblast cell line reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance. These results suggest that ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438773>Differential gene expression and gene-set enrichment analysis in Caco- monolayers during a 30-day timeline with Dexamethasone exposure.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoid hormones affect gene expression via activation of glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, causing modulation of inflammation and autoimmune activation. The glucocorticoid Dexamethasone is an important pharmaceutical for the treatment of colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases. While suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on activated immune cells is significant, their effects upon epithelial cells are less well studied. Previous research shows that the effects of Dexamethasone treatment on polarized Caco- cell layer permeability is delayed for >10 treatment days (as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance).  intestinal epithelial cells turn over every 3-5 days; we therefore hypothesized that culture age may produce marked effects on gene expression, potentially acting as a confounding variable. To investigate this issue, we cultured polarized Caco- monolayers during a 30-day timecourse with ~15 days of continuous Dexamethasone exposure. We collected samples during the timecourse and tested differential expression using a 250-plex gene expression panel and Nanostring nCounter® system. Our custom panel was selectively enriched for KEGG annotations for , actin cytoskeleton regulation, and colorectal cancer-associated genes, allowing for focused gene ontology-based pathway enrichment analyses. To test for confounding effects of time and Dexamethasone variables, we used the Nanostring nSolver differential expression data model which includes a mixturenegative binomial modelwith optimization. We identified a time-associated "EMT-like" signature with differential expression seen in important actomyosin cytoskeleton, , integrin, and cell cycle pathway genes. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a subtle yet significant counter-signal showing suppression of actomyosin genes and differential expression of various growth factor receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557363>Fumonisin B damages the barrier functions of porcine intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>Fumonisins (Fums) are mycotoxins widely distributed in crops and feed, and ingestion of Fums-contaminated crops is harmful to animal health. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Fum B (FB ) on barrier functions of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, IPEC-J2, to clarify the intestinal toxicity of Fums in pigs. The results showed that the persistent treatment of FB significantly decreased the viability of IPEC-J2. Moreover, the expressions of Claudin 1, Occludin, Zonula Occluden-1 (ZO-1) on the messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein levels and MUC1 on the mRNA level were significantly inhibited after FB treatment, while the mRNA relative expression level of MUC2 was clearly increased. FB also enhanced the monolayer cell permeability of IPEC-J2. Importantly, FB promoted the expression of phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (p-ERK ). These data suggest that long-term treatment of FB can suppress IPEC-J2 proliferation, damage  of IPEC-J2, and regulate expression of mucins to induce the damage of barrier functions of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, which may be associated with the ERK phosphorylation pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340691> Impairs Oral Epithelial Barrier through Targeting GRHL2.</a></h2><p>Oral mucosa provides the first line of defense against a diverse array of environmental and microbial irritants by forming the barrier of epithelial cells interconnected by multiprotein  (TJ), adherens , desmosomes, and gap  complexes. Grainyhead-like  (GRHL2), an epithelial-specific transcription factor, may play a role in the formation of the mucosal epithelial barrier, as it regulates the expression of the  proteins. The current study investigated the role of GRHL2 in the  ()-induced impairment of epithelial barrier functions. Exposure of human oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B and OKF6 cells) to  or derived lipopolysaccharides ( LPSs) led to rapid loss of endogenous GRHL2 and the  proteins (e.g., zonula occludens, E-cadherin, claudins, and occludin). GRHL2 directly regulated the expression levels of the  proteins and the epithelial permeability for small molecules (e.g., dextrans and  bacteria). To explore the functional role of GRHL2 in oral mucosal barrier, we used a  conditional knockout (KO) mouse model, which allows for epithelial tissue-specific  KO in an inducible manner.  KO impaired the expression of the  proteins at the junctional epithelium and increased the alveolar bone loss in the ligature-induced periodontitis model. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed increased epithelial penetration of oral bacteria in  KO mice compared with the wild-type mice. Also, blood loadings of oral bacteria (e.g., , β-, and ) were significantly elevated in  KO mice compared to the wild-type littermates. These data indicate that  bacteria may enhance paracellular penetration through oral mucosa in part by targeting the expression of GRHL2 in the oral epithelial cells, which then impairs the epithelial barrier by inhibition of  protein expression, resulting in increased alveolar tissue destruction and systemic bacteremia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677553>(-)-Epicatechin and NADPH oxidase inhibitors prevent bile acid-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization through ERK1/ modulation.</a></h2><p>Secondary bile acids promote gastrointestinal (GI) tract permeabilization both in vivo and in vitro. Consumption of high fat diets increases bile acid levels in the GI tract which can contribute to intestinal permeabilization and consequent local and systemic inflammation. This work investigated the mechanisms involved in bile acid (deoxycholic acid (DCA))-induced intestinal epithelial cell monolayer permeabilization and the preventive capacity of (-)-epicatechin (EC). While EC prevented high fat diet-induced intestinal permeabilization in mice, it did not mitigate the associated increase in fecal/cecal total and individual bile acids. In vitro, using differentiated Caco- cells as a model of epithelial barrier, EC and other NADPH oxidase inhibitors (VAS-2870 and apocynin) mitigated DCA-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization. While EC inhibited DCA-mediated increase in cell oxidants, it did not prevent DCA-induced mitochondrial oxidant production. Prevention of DCA-induced ERK1/ activation with EC, VAS-2870, apocynin and the MEK inhibitor U0126, also prevented monolayer permeabilization, stressing the key involvement of ERK1/ in this process and its redox regulation. Downstream, DCA promoted myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation which was related to MLC phosphatase (MLCP) inhibition by ERK1/. DCA also decreased the levels of the  proteins ZO-1 and occludin, which can be related to MMP- activation and consequent ZO-1 and occludin degradation. Both events were prevented by EC, NADPH oxidase and ERK1/ inhibitors. Thus, DCA-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization occurs mainly secondary to a redox-regulated ERK1/ activation and downstream disruption of TJ structure and dynamic. EC's capacity to mitigate in vivo the gastrointestinal permeabilization caused by consumption of high-fat diets can be in part related to its capacity to inhibit bile-induced NADPH oxidase and ERK1/ activation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Endothelial cells were visualized by  masked observers before and after preservation. Endothelial cell density (ECD) and the number of iatrogenic folds were counted manually. Alizarin red staining and  protein (Zonula Occludens-1) were used to assess cell morphology (hexagonality and polymorphism). Intraobserver and interobserver cell counts were recorded and analyzed. Wilcoxon and one-way analysis of variance tests were used, where P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significantly different.Significant amount of iatrogenic folds were observed in the tissues supplemented with FBS compared with rHSA postpreservation (P = 0.0007). Approximately 69% and 71% hexagonal cells (P = 0.0303) and 29% and 26% polymorphic cells (P = 0.0234) were observed in the FBS and rHSA groups, respectively. Postpreservation, operator 1 counted 1766 cells/mm in FBS and 1864 cells/mm in rHSA. Operator  counted 1702 cells/mm in FBS and 1858 cells/mm in rHSA.

However, significance was not observed in the ECD counts (interoperator) from the rHSA-preserved tissues (P = 0.8738).rHSA-supplemented media allow better visualization of the corneal endothelial cells. This reduces the rate of discard observed due to counting errors.

In case this could also be operative in biliary epithelial cells, this may have implication for the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We here evaluated the transport of PC across polarized cholangiocytes. Therefore, the biliary tumor cell line Mz-ChA-1 was grown to confluency. In transwell culture systems the translocation of PC to the apical compartment was analyzed. After 21 days in culture, polarized Mz-ChA-1 cells revealed a predominant apical translocation of choline containing phospholipids including PC with minimal intracellular accumulation. Transport was suppressed by TJ destruction employing chemical inhibitors and pretreatment with siRNA to TJ forming proteins as well as the apical transmembrane mucin 3 as PC acceptor. Apical translocation was dependent on a negative apical electrical potential created by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the anion exchange protein  (AE2). It was stimulated by apical application of secretory mucins. The results indicated the existence of a paracellular PC passage across apical/lateral TJ of the polarized biliary epithelial tumor cell line Mz-ChA-1.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grape peel powder (GPP) and its bioactive rich-fractions on the barrier function and colonic injury in a model of colitis induced by ,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after colitis induction. NEP-F has decreased the extension of colonic lesion but the other grape peel bioactive fractions did not protect against macroscopic or microscopic colonic damage, EP diet increased macroscopic colonic damage. GPP, EP, and NEP-F reduced claudin- mRNA expression, whereas GPP and F fraction increased occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression. All experimental diets reduced the colitis-triggered increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression. Colitis reduced by 30% the production of cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). GPP and NEP-F completely protected against this effect, whereas F fraction was ineffective. Only GPP and NEP-F were able to decrease the upregulation of GRP94 mRNA triggered by colitis. Dietary fiber seems to reestablish the intestinal barrier function, whereas fiber-bound phenolics were able to restore cecal metabolism to produce beneficial metabolites like SCFA and to reduce the activation of the unfolded protein response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the effect of GPR55 activation on rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVEC), an essential component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). GPR55 was detected in RBMVEC by western blot and immunocytochemistry. Treatment of RBMVEC with LPI increased cytosolic Ca concentration, [Ca], in a concentration-dependent manner; the effect was abolished by the GPR55 antagonist, ML-193. Repetitive application of LPI induced tachyphylaxis. LPI-induced increase in [Ca] was not sensitive to U-73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, but was abolished by the blockade of voltage-gated Ca channels or in Ca-free saline, indicating that Ca influx was involved in this response. LPI induced a biphasic change in RBMVEC membrane potential: a fast depolarization followed by a long-lasting hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarization phase was prevented by apamin and charibdotoxin, inhibitors of small- and intermediate-conductance Ca-activated K channels (K). Immunofluorescence studies indicate that LPI produced transient changes in  and adherens  proteins and F-actin stress fibers. LPI decreased the electrical resistance of RBMVEC monolayer assessed with Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo studies indicate that systemic administration of LPI increased the permeability of the BBB, assessed with Evans Blue method. Taken together, our results indicate that GPR55 activation modulates the function of endothelial cells of brain microvessels, produces a transient reduction in endothelial barrier function and increases BBB permeability.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

The elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is highly associated with lesions, such as the increased vascular permeability of diabetic retinas. We have previously reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases EC permeability through the downregulation of  protein expression. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) has an anti-permeability function, but the effect of Ang1 on vascular permeability induced by inflammatory cytokines is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Ang1 on IL-6-induced EC permeability and its underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that Ang1 inhibited the IL-6-induced increase in EC permeability by inhibiting the reductions in the levels of  protein ZO-1 and occludin, which was related to the decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion through the inhibition of STAT3 activation by Ang1. Mechanistically, Ang1 induced the dissociation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 from the Tie2 receptor and increased the binding of SHP-1 to JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3, which are IL-6 downstream signaling proteins. We conclude that SHP-1 plays an important role in the Ang1-induced inhibition of JAK/STAT3 signaling. These results provide evidence for a potential beneficial role of Ang1 in suppressing the vascular permeability induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in diabetic retinopathy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Alizarin red staining ( = 3) was performed to check the morphology of cells in the center and periphery. Descemet's membrane-endothelial complex was peeled from the center (8.25 mm) and the periphery (.75 mm) and plated in two different wells of an 8-well chamber slide with media refreshed every alternate day. The confluence rate was monitored by microscopy. Live/dead analysis was performed ( = 3) at confluence. Tag-2A12 as a monoclonal antibody against peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx-6) ( = 4), ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) as a  protein ( = 4), and Ki-67 as a proliferative cell marker ( = 4) were used to characterize the cells at confluence.At confluence, 8.25% average increase in the number of cells was observed from the central zone compared with 16.5% from the peripheral zone. Proliferation rate, hexagonality, Ki-67 positivity, and the cell area did not significantly differ between the groups ( > 0.05). All the proteins corresponding to the biomarkers tested were expressed in both the groups.Although there are significantly fewer amounts of peripheral cells available after graft preparation for keratoplasty, these cells can still be used for endothelial cell culture due to their proliferative capability. The peripheral cells that are discarded after graft preparation can thus be utilized to increase the donor endothelial cell pool for regenerative treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514177>Topological and transport properties of graphene-based nanojunctions subjected to a magnetic field.</a></h2><p>We study the topological properties of finite-size S-shaped graphene  with distinctive edge features subjected to the perpendicular magnetic field, using the -binding model.

Gene expression of selected  proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment , Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although precise causes are far from being identified, allergy or other forms of hypersensitivity to dietary ingredients have been implicated in triggering or worsening of behavioral and emotional symptoms, especially in patients suffering from depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and/or autism. Among such ingredients, cow's milk, along with wheat gluten, is commonly suspected. However, the contributory role of cow's milk in these disorders has not been elucidated due to insufficient pathophysiological evidence. In the present study, we therefore investigated neuroinflammatory changes that are associated with behavioral abnormality using a non-anaphylactic mouse model of cow's milk allergy (CMA). Male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 5-week oral sensitization procedure without or with a major milk allergen, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). All mice were then later challenged with BLG, and their anxiety- and depression-associated behaviors were subsequently assessed during the 6th and 7th weeks. We found that BLG-sensitized male mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior, although they did not display anaphylactic reactions when challenged with BLG. Female behavior was not noticeably affected by BLG sensitization. Upon examination of the small intestines, reduced immunoreactivity to occludin was detected in the ileal mucosa of BLG-sensitized mice although the transcriptional expression of this  protein was not significantly altered when measured by quantitative RT-PCR. On the other hand, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the ileal mucosa was significantly elevated in BLG-sensitized mice, suggesting the sensitization had resulted in intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory responses were also detected in the brain of BLG-sensitized mice, determined by the hypertrophic morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes were particularly evident near the blood vessels in the midbrain region, resembling the perivascular barrier previously reported by others in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse models. Interestingly, increased levels of COX- and TNFα were also found in this region. Taken together, our results demonstrated that BLG sensitization elicits inflammatory responses in the intestine and brain without overt anaphylactic signs of milk allergy, signifying food allergy as a potential pathogenic factor of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310598>Atorvastatin Attenuates Cold-Induced Hypertension by Preventing Gut Barrier Injury.</a></h2><p>Chronic exposure to cold causes arterial hypertension [cold-induce hypertension (CIH)]. Emerging data have indicated that gut barrier dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In this study, we explored the effect of gut barrier dysfunction on vascular inflammation induced by cold exposure and the therapeutic effect of atorvastatin in a CIH rat model. The CIH was established by cold exposure for  weeks. Two groups of Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to moderate cold (4 ± 1°C), whereas the control group was maintained at room temperature (23 ± 1°C) (10 rats/group). The  groups received atorvastatin or vehicle at the beginning of cold exposure, respectively, for  weeks. Cold exposure increased mean arterial pressure compared with room temperature group, indicating that animals developed arterial hypertension. Cold exposure induced vascular dysfunction due to decreasing phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression in aorta, and these were blunted by atorvastatin. Cold exposure increased the levels of gut-derived inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 production in aorta and resulted in vascular inflammation, whereas atorvastatin prevented these effects. Cold exposure also increased gut permeability, inhibited  protein expression in proximal colon, and resulted in gut barrier dysfunction. Interestingly, atorvastatin eliminated increasing gut permeability, decreasing  protein expression, and gut pathology and reversed gut barrier dysfunction. Atorvastatin attenuated CIH and improved gut barrier function; the beneficial effects might be via inhibiting gut-derived inflammatory cytokines and reversing cold-induced vascular inflammation, suggesting that gut barrier dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of CIH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419730>Aucubin, a natural iridoid glucoside, attenuates oxidative stress-induced testis injury by inhibiting JNK and CHOP activation via Nrf2 up-regulation.</a></h2><p>Eucommia ulmoides has been used for many years as a successful strategy to treat male infertility. Aucubin (AU) is the active ingredient extracted from Eucommia ulmoides. However, its protective action and exact mechanism on testicular injury is not yet known.Here, the protective effect and the mechanism of action of AU on testis damage under oxidative stress was investigated in vivo and in vitro.As regard the in vivo experiment, male mice were divided into five groups and testicular injury model was established by Triptolide (TP) (120 μg/kg) intraperitoneal injection for two weeks. Animals in the treatment group were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of AU at different doses (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) for 1 h and subsequently treated with TP (120 μg/kg). At the end of the experimental period, the testis was collected for biochemical and histological examination. As regard the in vitro experiment, Sertoli cells (SCs) were used to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of action of AU against disruption of the blood-testis-barrier (BTB) and apoptosis induced by TP via apoptosis detection, western blot, immunofluorescence analysis, and siRNA transient transfection.TP-treated animals showed testicular atrophy, BTB disruption, increased ROS levels and spermatogenic dysfunction. Pre-administration of AU resulted in a significant protection on keeping a normal testicular weight, sperm morphology, BTB integrity, and a normal level of oxidative stress markers and antioxidants. Furthermore, AU prevented apoptosis through an effective inhibition of PERK/CHOP and JNK dependent apoptosis pathway, as well as protected the integrity of BTB by up-regulating the expression of  proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-11) and gap  protein (Cx43). The mechanistic study revealed that AU significantly triggered Nrf2 translocation, thus increasing nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and then induced antioxidant enzymes expression in the testis and SCs. Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing unsuccessfully reversed the increased CHOP and p-JNK expression induced by TP, abolishing the protective effect of AU.These results indicate that AU might be considered as a potential protective agent against testicular injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal barrier function remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in  protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor 5 was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial barrier function impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of  protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal barrier impairment. In conclusion, CDCA protected against the LPS-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function via the FXR-MLCK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578523>The RIPK4-IRF6 signalling axis safeguards epidermal differentiation and barrier function.</a></h2><p>The integrity of the mammalian epidermis depends on a balance of proliferation and differentiation in the resident population of stem cells. The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of . Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal barrier. Collectively, our results explain how RIPK4 and IRF6 function to ensure the integrity of the epidermis and provide mechanistic insights into why developmental syndromes that are characterized by orofacial, skin and genital abnormalities result when this axis goes awry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562747>Claudin 4 in pancreatic β cells is involved in regulating the functional state of adult islets.</a></h2><p>The functional state of adult pancreatic islets is regulated by a large array of regulatory molecules including numerous transcription factors. Whether any islet structural molecules play such a role has not been well understood. Here, multiple technologies including bioinformatics analyses were used to explore such molecules. The  family molecule claudin 4 (Cldn4) was the highest enriched amongst over 140 structural genes analysed. Cldn4 expression was ~75-fold higher in adult islets than in exocrine tissues and was mostly up-regulated during functional maturation of developing islet cells. Cldn4 was progressively down-regulated in functionally compromised, dedifferentiating insulin-secreting β cells and in db/db type- diabetic islets. Furthermore, the genetic deletion of Cldn4 impaired significantly the functional state without apparently affecting pancreas morphology, islet architectural structure and cellular distribution, and secretion of enteroendocrine hormones. Thus, we suggest a previously unidentified role for Cldn4 in regulating the functional state of islets, with implications in translational research for better diabetes therapies.© 2019 The Authors.

There is no consensus about the mechanistic bases for this physiological phenomenon. The surface area of the small intestine is a key determinant of the absorptive capacity by both the transcellular and the paracellular pathways; thus, information about intestinal surface area and micro-anatomical structure can help explain differences among species in absorptive capacity. In order to elucidate a possible mechanism for the high paracellular nutrient absorption in bats, we performed a comparative analysis of intestinal villi architecture and enterocyte size and number in microchiropterans and rodents. We collected data from intestines of six bat species and five rodent species using hematoxylin and eosin staining and histological measurements. For the analysis we added measurements from published studies employing similar methodology, making in total a comparison of nine species each of rodents and bats. Bats presented shorter intestines than rodents. After correction for body size differences, bats had ~41% less nominal surface area (NSA) than rodents. Villous enhancement of surface area (SEF) was ~64% greater in bats than in rodents, mainly because of longer villi and a greater density of villi in bat intestines. Both taxa exhibited similar enterocyte diameter. Bats exceeded rodents by ~103% in enterocyte density per cm NSA, but they do not significantly differ in total number of enterocytes per whole animal. In addition, there is a correlation between SEF and clearance per cm NSA of L-arabinose, a nonactively transported paracellular probe. We infer that an increased enterocyte density per cm NSA corresponds to increased density of  per cm NSA, which provides a partial mechanistic explanation for understanding the high paracellular absorption observed in bats compared to nonflying mammals.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467165>Claudins and JAM-A coordinately regulate  formation and epithelial polarity.</a></h2><p> (TJs) establish the epithelial barrier and are thought to form a membrane fence to regulate epithelial polarity, although the roles of TJs in epithelial polarity remain controversial. Claudins constitute TJ strands in conjunction with the cytoplasmic scaffolds ZO-1 and ZO- and play pivotal roles in epithelial barrier formation. However, how claudins and other TJ membrane proteins cooperate to organize TJs remains unclear. Here, we systematically knocked out TJ components by genome editing and show that while ZO-1/ZO--deficient cells lacked TJ structures and epithelial barriers, claudin-deficient cells lacked TJ strands and an electrolyte permeability barrier but formed membrane appositions and a macromolecule permeability barrier. Moreover, epithelial polarity was disorganized in ZO-1/ZO--deficient cells, but not in claudin-deficient cells. Simultaneous deletion of claudins and a TJ membrane protein JAM-A resulted in a loss of membrane appositions and a macromolecule permeability barrier and in sporadic epithelial polarity defects. These results demonstrate that claudins and JAM-A coordinately regulate TJ formation and epithelial polarity.© 2019 Otani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417535>Pretreatment With  Preserves Against D-Galactosamine-Induced Liver Injury in a Rat Model.</a></h2><p> () functions as a probiotic in animals, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

The aim of this study was to reveal the in vitro gastrointestinal protective effects of BP against IBD using molecular and metabolic methods. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) challenged Caco- cell monolayers were applied to mimic intestinal epithelial cell dysfunctions and metabolic disorders. The pretreatment with BP extract rich in polyphenols ameliorated DSS-induced cell viability losses. It also exerted protective effects against intestinal barrier impairment by strengthening epithelial integrity and  losses induced by DSS. BP up-regulated anti-oxidant (NQO1, Txnrd1, Nrf2) and down-regulated inflammatory (TNF-α and IL-6) mRNA expressions, in accompany with MAPK signaling inhibition. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS revealed that BP, and DSS treated Caco- cells have different metabolomic profiles, with significant changes on key metabolites involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Our results showed that BP has great therapeutic potential throughout the early stages of DSS-induced colitis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

In this study, we asked whether LCN2 may play a protective role in cerebral endothelium. After focal cerebral ischemia in rats, plasma levels of LCN2 were significantly elevated at 6, 12, and 24 hrs, and persisted until 3 days post-stroke. To assess the vascular mechanisms of LCN2, we used brain endothelial cell cultures to investigate its effects on neutrophil adhesion and endothelial barrier integrity. LCN2 did not affect neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells either under normal conditions or after TNFα stimulation. TNFα significantly increased endothelial permeability, and LCN2 rescued endothelial permeability. Concomitantly, LCN2 restored the membrane distribution of the  protein ZO-1 and the adherens  protein VE-cadherin. Our findings suggest that elevated LCN2 in the blood after ischemic stroke might affect endothelial function, in part by reducing damage to endothelial junctional proteins and maintain blood-brain barrier integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328776>Candidate genes of the transcellular and paracellular calcium absorption pathways in the small intestine of laying hens.</a></h2><p>To meet the high calcium (Ca) demand during eggshell biomineralization ( g of Ca per egg), laying hens develop specific metabolic regulations to maintain Ca homeostasis. The intake of Ca, its solubilization, and absorption capacity are enhanced at sexual maturity (SM). A better knowledge of the intestinal Ca transporters involved in their variations at this stage could indicate new nutritional strategies to enhance Ca digestive utilization. Transcellular Ca absorption pathway and its major player calbindin-D 28 K (CALB1) mediate a saturable transport, which has been extensively described in this model. Conversely, a contribution by the paracellular pathway involving non-saturable Ca transport through intercellular  has also been suggested. The aim of the present study was to identify candidate genes of these two pathways and their patterns of expression, in immature pullets (12, 15, and 17 wk old) and mature laying hens (23 wk old) in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Using RT-qPCR, this study identifies 3 new candidate genes for transcellular, and 9 for paracellular Ca transport. A total of 5 candidates of the transcellular pathway, transient receptor potential cation channels subfamily C member 1 (TRPC1) and M member 7 (TRPM7); CALB1 and ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 1 (ATP2B1) and ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting  (ATP2B2) were enhanced with age or after SM in the duodenum, the jejunum or all 3 segments. A total of 4 candidates of the paracellular pathway Claudin  (CLDN2) and  proteins 1, , and 3 (TJP1, TJP2 and TJP3) increased in the small intestine after SM. Additionally, CALB1, ATP2B2, and CLDN2 were overexpressed in the duodenum or the jejunum or both segments after SM. The enhanced expression of candidate genes of the paracellular Ca pathway after SM, supports that the non-saturable transport could be a mechanism of great importance when high concentrations of soluble Ca are observed in the intestinal content during eggshell formation. Both pathways may work cooperatively in the duodenum and jejunum, the main sites of Ca absorption in laying hens.© The Author(s) 2019.

Fish were exposed to zinc (0, 1 mg/L) and arsenic trioxide (0, .83 mg/L) in individual or combination for a month. Inflammatory infiltration and TJ structure changes were displayed by H&E staining and transmission electron microscope. To further explore these changes, biochemical indicator (SOD), gene or protein expressions of inflammatory responses (NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) and TJ proteins (Occludin, Claudins and ZOs) were determined. In the anterior intestine, arsenic decreased activity of SOD, mRNA levels of Occludin, Claudins and ZOs, increased mRNA levels of ILs. However, unlike the anterior intestine, arsenic has an upregulation effects of Occludin and Claudin-4 in the mid intestine. These anomalies induced by arsenic, except IL-8, were completely or partially recovered by zinc co-administration. Furthermore, transcription factor (NF-κB) nuclear translocation paralleled with its downstream genes in both intestinal regions. In conclusion, our results unambiguously suggested that under arsenic stress, zinc can partly relieve intestinal inflammation and disruption of  segment-dependently.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to alleviate porcine jejunal epithelia cell (IPEC-J2) injury induced by DON in this study. The results indicated that cell viability and proliferation rates were significantly decreased when DON concentrations were increased from 0 to 64 µM after 24 h incubation (p < 0.05). The longer incubation time and higher DON concentrations would cause more serious effects on cell viability. S. cerevisiae could significantly degrade DON and decrease lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the cells induced by DON (p < 0.05). DON (4 µM) could increase necrotic and apoptotic cell rates as well as decrease viable cell rates, compared with the control group (p < 0.05). However, S. cerevisiae addition in the DON group could decrease necrotic, late apoptotic and early apoptotic cell rates by 38.05%, 46.37% and 44.78% respectively, increase viable cell rates by .35%, compared with the single DON group (p < 0.05). In addition, S. cerevisiae addition could up-regulate mRNA abundances of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in IPEC-J2 cells (p < 0.05), but down-regulate mRNA abundances of  proteins (TJP-1) and occludin by 36.13% and 50.18% at 1 µM of DON (p < 0.05).

Vanillin (Van), a natural phenolic compound with neuroprotective properties, exerts neuroprotection on a gerbil model of global ischemia by inhibiting oxidative damage. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective roles of Van in neonatal rats suffering from hypoxic-ischemic (HI). An HI model of 7-day-old SD rats was induced by left carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen (balanced with nitrogen) for .5 h at 37 °C. At 48 h after intraperitoneal injection with Van (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) or saline, neurobehavioral function, cerebral infract volume, brain water content, and histomorphological changes were performed to evaluate brain injury. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining were conducted to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The levels of oxidative stress and  proteins, as well as the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were also determined in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Results showed that Van post-treatment significantly ameliorated early neurobehavioral deficits, decreased infarct volume and brain edema, as well as attenuated histopathologic injury and IgG extravasation. Furthermore, Van markedly increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, the activation of MMP- and MMP-9 induced by HI was partially blocked by Van. Finally, Van obviously increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5 compared with the HI group. Collectively, Van can provide neuroprotective effects against neonatal HIBD possibly by attenuating oxidative damage and preserving BBB integrity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, rhesus macaque IL-17A (rhIL-17A) and IL-17F (rhIL-17F) were cloned and expressed, and their biological activities and in vivo distribution were examined. The resulting data showed that both the rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F genes were consisted of three exons and two introns. RhIL-17A and rhIL-17F shared 96.8% and 93.9% amino acid sequence identity with human IL-17A (huIL-17A) and IL-17F (huIL-17F) respectively and the sequences also shared one N-glycosylation site and six conserved cysteine residues with huIL-17A and huIL-17F. IL-17A and IL-17F transcripts were highly expressed in lymphoid tissues and the intestinal tract of rhesus macaques. Functionally, recombinant rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F showed similar effect on Act1 levels and NF-κB phosphorylation compared with that of commercial human IL-17A and IL-17F. Moreover, the antibacterial proteins (such as β-defensin , S100A8, S100A9, RegIIIα and Muc1) and the  associated genes (including CLDN1, CLDN4, OCLN, and ZO1) expressed by Caco- cells were largely enhanced after treatment with rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F.

P-glycoprotein function at the BBB was reduced at  weeks. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, neurofilament, which is important for neuronal function, was decreased in HFD mice at  weeks, but recovered at 10 weeks.Our results suggest that changes in the status of insulin resistance influence expression of BBB transporters, which in turn may alter the expression of cognitive function-related proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes  Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco- Cells.</a></h2><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell . The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of  in intestinal epithelial Caco- cells. We generated Caco- cells invalidated for AMPK α1/α (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of  following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the integrity of the epithelial barrier by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in  reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of , improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial barrier function following injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542690>Graphene quantum dots modified flower like BiWO for enhanced photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</a></h2><p>Graphene quantum dots modified BiWO (GQD/BiWO) composites is applied to photocatalytic N fixation. The as-prepared GQD/BiWO samples showed considerable increase in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation compared to the pure BiWO and GQD. The results revealed that GQD uniformly placed on the surface of BiWO and  between the two samples helped to boost the photocatalytic activity. The PL, photocurrent and EIS analyses further demonstrated that the composite had the low recombination rate of photo-generated charges. Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation test indicated that GQD/BiWO with 10 wt% GQDs exhibited the highest ammonia synthesis rate in the presence of visible light, which is 8.88-fold and 33.8-fold higher than pure BiWO and GQD.

Monocyte chemotactic protein 1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) is a newly identified zinc-finger protein that negatively regulates inflammatory signaling pathways. We aimed to evaluate the impact of genetic MCPIP1 deletion on BBB breakdown and expression of BBB-related matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and  proteins after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) using MCPIP1-deficient (MCPIP1) mice. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in the MCPIP1 mice and their wild-type littermates for  h followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The degree of BBB breakdown was evaluated by injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to compare the expression of MMPs and claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). MCPIP1 deficiency in mice resulted in enhanced leakage of FITC-dextran, increased expression of MMP-9/3, and reduced expression of claudin-5 and ZO-1 in the brain compared to that seen in their wild-type littermates subjected to cerebral I/R. These results demonstrate that absence of MCPIP1 exacerbates cerebral I/R-induced BBB disruption by enhancing the expression of MMP-9/3 and the degradation of claudin-5 and ZO-1, providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying BBB breakdown after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569788>Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Koreanaside A, a Lignan Isolated from the Flower of , against LPS-Induced Macrophage Activation and DSS-Induced Colitis Mice: The Crucial Role of AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT Signaling.</a></h2><p>The current treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- (COX-), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/ (JAK1/) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration, restoring  (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced inflammatory responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318316>Activation of the Ca sensing receptor and the PKC/WNK4 downstream signaling cascade induces incorporation of ZO- to  and its separation from 14-3-3.</a></h2><p>Zonula occludens- (ZO-) is a  (TJ) cytoplasmic protein, whose localization varies according to cell density and Ca in the media. In cells cultured in low calcium (LC), ZO- displays a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, but activation of the Ca sensing receptor (CaSR) with Gd triggers the appearance of ZO- at the cell borders. CaSR downstream signaling involves activation of protein kinase C, which phosphorylates and activates with no lysine kinase-4 that phosphorylates ZO- inducing its concentration at TJs. In LC, ZO- is protected from degradation by association to 14-3-3 proteins. When monolayers are transferred to normal calcium, the complexes ZO-/14-3-3ζ and ZO-/14-3-3σ move to the cell borders and dissociate. The 14-3-3 proteins are then degraded in proteosomes, whereas ZO- integrates to TJs. From the plasma membrane residual ZO- is endocyted and degradaded in lysosomes. The unique region  of ZO-, and S261 located within a nuclear localization signal, are critical for the interaction with 14-3-3 ζ and σ and for the efficient nuclear importation of ZO-. These results explain the molecular mechanism through which extracellular Ca triggers the appearance of ZO- at TJs in epithelial cells and reveal the novel interaction between ZO- and 14-3-3 proteins, which is critical for ZO- protection and intracellular traffic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591580>Engineering of human brain organoids with a functional vascular-like system.</a></h2><p>Human cortical organoids (hCOs), derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provide a platform to study human brain development and diseases in complex three-dimensional tissue. However, current hCOs lack microvasculature, resulting in limited oxygen and nutrient delivery to the inner-most parts of hCOs. We engineered hESCs to ectopically express human ETS variant  (ETV2). ETV2-expressing cells in hCOs contributed to forming a complex vascular-like network in hCOs. Importantly, the presence of vasculature-like structures resulted in enhanced functional maturation of organoids. We found that vascularized hCOs (vhCOs) acquired several blood-brain barrier characteristics, including an increase in the expression of , nutrient transporters and trans-endothelial electrical resistance. Finally, ETV2-induced endothelium supported the formation of perfused blood vessels in vivo. These vhCOs form vasculature-like structures that resemble the vasculature in early prenatal brain, and they present a robust model to study brain disease in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260736>Dietary sodium butyrate (Butirex C4) supplementation modulates intestinal transcriptomic responses and augments disease resistance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Intestine in fish is a complex multifunctional organ, not only plays roles in digestion and absorption of nutrient, but also has critical role in immunity. The present study evaluated the effects of different levels of dietary sodium butyrate [Butirex C4 (Butirex)] on intestinal immune-,antioxidant-and -related gene expression injuvenile rainbow trout(Oncorhynchusmykiss). 240 healthy rainbow trout were dispensed in 12 fiberglass tanks appointed to four treatments [0 (control), 1.5 (B1.5), .5 (B2.5) and 5 (B5)g Butirex per kg diet]. After a 45-day feeding trial, the fish fed with the Butirex-supplemented diets showed higher intestinal lysozyme (LYZ), complement(ACH50) and bactericidal activities; the elevations in ACH50 and bactericidal activities depended on Butirex levels (P < 0.05). The Butirex-supplemented groups, particularly the B2.5 group, had significantly higher LYZ gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Butirex at .5 and 5 g/kg levels led to significantly higher IL-1β gene expression. B2.5 and B5 had significantly lower and higher TNF-α gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2.5 group had significantly higher TGF-B, and significantly lower IL-8 compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B1.5 and B2.5 group had significantly higher IL-10 gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2.5 and B5 groups had significantly higher SOD gene expression compared to the other groups; the highest expression was related to the B2.5 group (P < 0.05). Dietary Butirex supplementation significantly up-regulated CAT and GPx genes expression compared to the control group; the highest expression as related to the B2.5 and B5 groups (P < 0.05). The B2.5 group had significantly lower CLD12 gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2.5 and B5 groups had significantly higher CLD3, OCLD and ZO-1 gene expression compared to the control. The highest CLD3, ZO-1 gene expressions was related to the B2.5, and B5 groups respectively (P < 0.05). After challenge with Streptococcus iniae, B2.5 and B5 had significantly higher survival compared to the control group (55.6 ± 7.70 and 68.9 ± 10. vs. 33.3 ± 6.67). In conclusion, Butirex is efficient immune stimulant and health booster in rainbow trout, which augments the fish resistance to disease. Modulation of immune components, cytokines, antioxidant system and intestinal integrity might involve in improving disease resistance in Butirex-treated fish. Although most of the examined genes were modulated by .5 g/kg Butirex under normal conditions, 5 g/kg level is recommended under pathogenic state to mitigate mortality.Copyright © 2019.

In addition, the RPE limits posterior elimination of intravitreally injected drugs to circulation. Thus, permeation in the RPE has a significant effect on ocular pharmacokinetics. The RPE is also a potentially important drug target in age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, the cell models of the RPE are important tools in ocular drug development, but poor availability and problems in reproducibility limit the use of primary RPE cell cultures. Furthermore, the best and widely used human cell line ARPE19 requires specialized culture conditions and a long time for cellular differentiation. In this paper, we describe a cell population arisen from the ARPE19 culture, with fast differentiation and improved barrier properties. This cell line, LEPI, forms clear microvilli and rapidly displays RPE-like cobblestone morphology after subculture in simple culture conditions. The LEPI cells show RPE-specific functions and expression of RPE65, ezrin, and BEST1 proteins. On filter, the LEPI cells develop tighter barrier than the ex vivo bovine RPE-choroid: permeability coefficients of beta-blockers (atenolol, nadolol, timolol, pindolol, metoprolol, betaxolol) ranged from 0.4 × 10 cm/sec to .3 × 10 cm/sec depending on the drug lipophilicity. This rapidly differentiating cell line will be an asset in ocular studies since it is easily maintained, it grows and differentiates quickly and does not require specialized culture conditions for differentiation. Thus, this cell line is suitable for both small scale assays and high throughput screening in drug discovery and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576468>DPP4 inhibitor reinforces cell  proteins in mouse model of short bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Bacterial overgrowth commonly occurs and favors bacterial translocation in short bowel syndrome (SBS). Glucagon-like peptide- (GLP-) is effective for treating SBS, but is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4). DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4I) is known to be effective for treating SBS. Here, we investigated cell  protein function following DPP4I administration in a mouse model of SBS.Mice were divided into four groups: naïve (n = 5), naïve + DPP4I (n = 6), control (n = 6), and DPP4I (n = 5). All control and DPP4I mice had 50% of their proximal small bowel resected. DPP4I or normal saline was administered orally twice daily from days 1-7 postoperatively. The functions of cell  proteins were assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Body weights and blood glucose levels were recorded.E-Cadherin was significantly higher in the DPP4I group than in the control group. E-Cadherin, occludin, and claudin-4 were significantly higher in the naïve group than in the control group. Positive staining for E-cadherin and occludin varied widely between the control and DPP4I groups.Up-regulation of E-cadherin and occludin by DPP4I may be correlated with the anti-inflammatory action of DPP4I. Therefore, DPP4I may reduce bacterial translocation in SBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612340>Protective effects of vitamin D against injury in intestinal epithelium.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D deficiency is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction, which contributes to pathogenesis of acute intestinal injury in children. We aim to investigate the effects of vitamin D on intestinal injury in intestinal epithelial cells and organoids.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) and organoids, and the effect of vitamin D was assessed. Cell viability was measured and inflammation cytokines TNFα and IL-8 were quantified. FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability was measured using Transwell while  markers were assessed by immunofluorescence staining in IEC-18 and intestinal organoids. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.IEC-18 viability was decreased by LPS treatment, but was prevented by vitamin D. The upregulation of inflammation was inhibited by vitamin D, which also decreased epithelium permeability. Vitamin D restored  ZO-1 and claudin . In addition, vitamin D decreased TNFα expression and prevented the disruption of ZO-1 in injured organoids.Vitamin D rescued epithelial barrier function by improving permeability and restoring , leading to decrease inflammation. This study confirms the protective effects of vitamin D, which could be used as a treatment strategy for infants at risk of developing intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454420>Prothymosin alpha and its mimetic hexapeptide improve delayed tissue plasminogen activator-induced brain damage following cerebral ischemia.</a></h2><p>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration beyond 4.5 h of stroke symptoms is beneficial for patients but has an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Thus, increasing the therapeutic window of tPA is important for stroke recovery. We previously showed that prothymosin alpha (ProTα) or its mimetic hexapeptide (P6Q) has anti-ischemic activity. Here, we examined the beneficial effects of ProTα or P6Q against delayed tPA-induced brain damage following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or photochemically induced thrombosis in mice. Brain hemorrhage was observed by tPA administration during reperfusion at 4.5 and 6 h after MCAO. Co-administration of ProTα with tPA at 4.5 h inhibited hemorrhage and motor dysfunction -4 days, but not 7 days after MCAO. ProTα administration at  and 4.5 h after MCAO significantly inhibited tPA (4.5 h)-induced motor dysfunction and death more than 7 days. Administration of tPA caused the loss of  proteins, zona occulden-1 and occludin, and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-/9, in a ProTα-reversible manner. P6Q administration abolished tPA (4.5 h)-induced hemorrhage and reversed tPA (6 h)-induced vascular damage and matrix metalloproteinase- and 9 up-regulation. Twice administrations of P6Q at  h alone and 6 h with tPA significantly improved motor dysfunction more than 7 days. In photochemically induced thrombosis ischemia, similar vascular leakage and neuronal damage (infarction and motor dysfunction) by late tPA (4.5 or 6 h) were also inhibited by P6Q. Thus, these studies suggest that co-administration with ProTα or P6Q would be beneficial to inhibit delayed tPA-induced hemorrhagic mechanisms in acute ischemic stroke.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536448>Effects of Bread Yeast Cell Wall Beta-Glucans on Mice with Loperamide-Induced Constipation.</a></h2><p>Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by changes in intestinal habits. Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of irritant laxatives causes serious side effects. Meanwhile, more than 50% of patients are dissatisfied with sense of use of non-prescriptional laxatives. -glucans are natural polysaccharides widely found in yeast, fungus, and plants, which have been reported to exhibit various pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of -glucans extracted from the bread yeast cell wall on loperamide-induced constipation mice. Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with .5, 5, and 10 mg/kg -glucan. We assessed the defecation frequency, intestinal transit function of mice, as well as used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiota composition and functional biological profiles data. Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (5-HT) and expression of  protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin- in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. -glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that -glucans can influence the intestinal microbiota and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical barrier. We suggested that -glucans could be used as an active nutritional supplement to protect the damaged intestinal barrier and help patients who have constipation complications and dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533081>Dietary Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts supplementation improved immunity and intestinal morphology, antioxidant ability and  proteins mRNA expression of hybrid groupers (Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂ × Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀) fed high lipid diets.</a></h2><p>For many years, Ginkgo biloba has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects.

Basal diets supplemented with GBLE at 0, 0.50, 1.00, .00, 4.00 and 10.00 g/kg were fed to hybrid grouper for 8 weeks. The study showed that dietary GBLE supplementation significantly improved immune ability by increasing plasma complement 3, complement 4 and Immunoglobulin M content. Dietary supplementation of 0.50-.00 g/kg GBLE improved intestinal morphology and increased the expression of zonula occludens 1, zonula occludens , zonula occludens 3, occludin and claudin 3a. Dietary supplementation of 0.50-.00 g/kg GBLE improved antioxidant ability by increasing activities and expressions of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase, suppressed inflammatory by increasing expression of interleukin 10, transforming growth factor β1 and target of rapamycin, and decreased apoptotic responses by reducing the expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 in the intestine of hybrid grouper fed high lipid diets.

In light of emerging studies on the potential role of gut microbiota in neurological disorders, we sought to understand the causal association between CUD and gut dysbiosis. Using a comprehensive approach, we confirmed that cocaine administration in mice resulted in alterations of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, cocaine-mediated gut dysbiosis was associated with upregulation of proinflammatory mediators including NF-κB and IL-1β. In vivo and in vitro analyses confirmed that cocaine altered gut-barrier composition of the  proteins while also impairing epithelial permeability by potentially involving the MAPK/ERK1/ signaling.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity, the specific function of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells.  scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO- localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and function. Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO- are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens  complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular function of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate  and endothelial barrier integrity, which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540325>Succinate Modulates Intestinal Barrier Function and Inflammation Response in Pigs.</a></h2><p>Succinate is a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in all aerobic organisms, and is also a vital microbial metabolite in the gut. Although succinate is known to regulate intestinal metabolism and immune function, its role in the protection of the intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology. We confirmed in vitro that 5 mM succinate treatment modulated intestinal epithelial permeability by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC)-J2 cells. Furthermore, succinate treatment increased the abundance of  proteins claudin-1, zona occluden (ZO)-1, and ZO- in the jejunum in vivo and in vitro. In addition, dietary succinate supplementation promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-25, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-18 in the jejunum.

Currently, there are several established cell lines of human origin available as in vitro models of proximal tubule. However, these cells appeared to be limited in their biological relevance, because essential characteristics of the original tissue are lost once the cells are cultured. As a consequence of these limitations, primary human proximal tubule cells constitute a suitable and a biologically more relevant in vitro model to study this specific segment of the nephron and therefore, these cells can play an important role in renal regenerative medicine applications. Here, we describe a protocol to isolate proximal tubule cells from human nephrectomies. We explain the steps performed for an in-depth characterization of the cells, including the study of markers from others segments of the nephron, with the goal to determine the purity of the culture and the stability of proteins, enzymes, and transporters along time. The human proximal tubule cells isolated and used throughout this study showed many proximal tubule characteristics, including monolayer organization, cell polarization with the expression of  and primary cilia, expression of proximal tubule-specific proteins, such as megalin and sodium/glucose cotransporter , among others. The cells also expressed enzymatic activity for dipeptidyl peptidase IV, as well as for gamma glutamyl transferase 1, and expressed transporter activity for organic anion transporter 1, P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein. In conclusion, characterization of our cells confirmed presence of putative proximal tubule markers and the functional expression of multiple endogenous organic ion transporters mimicking renal reabsorption and excretion.

The molecular mechanisms of how TMAO induces atherosclerosis and CVDs' progression are still unclear. In this regard, high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), an inflammatory mediator, has been reported to disrupt cell-cell , resulting in vascular endothelial hyper permeability leading to endothelial dysfunction. The present study tested whether TMAO associated endothelial dysfunction results via HMGB1 activation. Biochemical and RT-PCR analysis showed that TMAO increased the HMGB1 expression in a dose-dependent manner in endothelial cells. However, prior treatment with glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 binder, abolished the TMAO-induced HMGB1 production in endothelial cells. Furthermore, Western blot and immunofluorescent analysis showed significant decrease in the expression of cell-cell  proteins ZO-, Occludin, and VE-cadherin in TMAO treated endothelial cells compared with control cells. However, prior treatment with glycyrrhizin attenuated the TMAO-induced cell-cell  proteins' disruption. TMAO increased toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in endothelial cells. Inhibition of TLR4 expression by TLR4 siRNA protected the endothelial cells from TMAO associated  protein disruption via HMGB1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that HMGB1 is one of the important mediators of TMAO-induced endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461659>Dietary daidzein improved intestinal health of juvenile turbot in terms of intestinal mucosal barrier function and intestinal microbiota.</a></h2><p>A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary daidzein on the intestinal mucosal barrier function and the intestinal microbiota profile of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain 0 (FM), 40 (D.40) and 400 (D.400) mg kg daidzein, respectively. Fish fed D.400 had significantly lower growth performance than fish fed D.40. Dietary daidzein significantly increased the feed efficiency, while significantly decreased the feed intake. Daidzein supplementation increased the activity of total anti-oxidative capacity and the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β1, Mucin- and  proteins (Tricellulin, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant 1, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant  and Claudin-like and Occludin), and down-regulated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the intestine of turbot. Dietary daidzein increased intestinal microbial diversities, the abundance of several short chain fatty acids producers, and decreased the abundance of some potential pathogenic bacteria. However, D.400 had dual effects on lactic acid bacteria and increased the abundance of potential harmful bacterium Prevotella copri. Collectively, dietary daidzein at the levels of 40 and 400 mg kg could enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function and alter the intestinal microbiota of turbot.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal barrier function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco- cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco- cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are  markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor  (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal barrier function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of inhibiting CLDN4 in pancreatic ductal carcinomas (PDC). We first examined 91 cases of human PDC by immunohistochemistry and found that CLDN4 expression was correlated with tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis. Anti-CLDN4 extracellular domain antibody, previously established by us (4D3), inhibited the proliferation of MIA-PaCa- PDC cells and increased intracellular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) concentration with lowering transepithelial electrical resistance. Concurrent treatment of 5-FU and 4D3 resulted in synergistic inhibition of growth of MIA-PaCa- cells in nude mice. In addition, MIA-PaCa- cell tumors treated with full-dose folfirinox (FFX) decreased tumor diameters to 50%; however, 60% of mice were dead from adverse effects. In contrast, half-dose FFX concomitant with 4D3 treatment decreased tumors equivalent to full-dose FFX, but without the adverse effects. These findings suggest that targeting CLDN4 might increase the effectiveness and safety of anticancer drug therapy in PDC.© 2019 The Authors.

Shear stress in the retinal circulation is altered in patients with retinal vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of laminar shear stress on barrier properties and on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC). HRMEC were cultured in Ibidi flow chambers and exposed to laminar shear stress (0-50 dyn/cm) for 24-48 h.  distribution (ZO-1 and claudin-5) and cytokine production were determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. The chemotactic effect of conditioned media exposed to shear stress was determined by measuring lymphocyte transmigration in Transwells. We found that cells exposed to moderately low shear stress (1.5 and 5 dyn/cm) showed enhanced distribution of membrane ZO-1 and claudin-5 and decreased production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8, CCL2, and IL-6 compared to static conditions and high shear stress values. Moreover, conditioned media from cells exposed to low shear stress, had the lowest chemotactic effect to recruit lymphocytes compared to conditioned media from cells exposed to static and high shear stress conditions. In conclusion, high shear stress and static flow, associated to impaired retinal circulation, may compromise the inner blood retinal barrier phenotype and barrier function in HRMEC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Its effect on the immune response in intestinal epithelial cells and on the intestinal mucosal barrier are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated Caco- cells, a monolayer model of intestinal epithelial cells, with or without treatment with C. albicans SC5314 (CA) or heat-inactivated CA (CA-inact). RNA sequencing was conducted, and the mRNA and protein levels of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) or NLRP6/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome signaling pathway components, inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-18 [IL-18] and IL-1β), anti-microbial peptides (AMPs; β-defensin- [BD-], BD-3, and LL-37), and  proteins (occludin and zona occludens-1 [ZO-1]) were examined by real-time PCR, western blotting, and/or immunofluorescence microscopy. Lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the Caco- cell supernatant were measured by enzyme kinetics analysis. Our results showed that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway participates in the CA- and CA-inact-infected Caco- cells, as shown by microarray analysis of total mRNA expression. The expression of NLRP3, NLRP6, ASC, BD-, BD-3, occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly decreased in Caco- cells infected with CA and CA-inact compared to that in the untreated control. IL-1β expression was decreased in the Caco- cells in both the CA- and CA-inact-infected groups compared to that in the control. Caspase-1 and IL-18 levels were not markedly affected by CA or CA-inact in Caco- cells. Our findings indicate that CA can inhibit the NLRP3 and NLRP6 pathways and dampen human intestinal mucosal barrier activity by decreasing the production of AMPs and  proteins, independent of CA activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore speculated that fibrosis and portal hypertension (PHT) would be attenuated in a mouse model of limited intestinal colonization with altered Schaedler flora (ASF) compared to a more complex colonization with specific pathogen-free (SPF) flora. We induced liver fibrosis in ASF and SPF mice by common bile duct ligation (BDL) or by carbon tetrachloride (CCl) treatment. We then measured portal pressure (PP), portosystemic shunts (PSSs), and harvested tissues for further analyses. There were no differences in PP between sham-treated ASF or SPF mice. After BDL or CCl treatment, PP, PSSs, and hepatic collagen deposition increased in both groups. However, the increase in PP and the degree of fibrosis was significantly higher in ASF than SPF mice. Expression of fibrotic markers α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β were significantly higher in ASF than SPF mice. This was associated with higher activation of hepatic immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils) and decreased expression of the intestinal epithelial  proteins (claudin-1, occludin-1). In  models of advanced CLD, SPF mice presented significantly attenuated liver injury, fibrosis, and PHT compared to ASF mice. In contrast to our hypothesis, these findings suggest that a complex intestinal microbiota may play a "hepato-protective" role.-Moghadamrad, S., Hassan, M., McCoy, K.

Here, we explore its function and clinical relevance in human HCC.Stable transfection of the hepatocyte line HL7702 with CLDN9 was confirmed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The impact of CLDN9 on the cell invasion and migration was assessed in vitro by a transwell assay and wound-healing experiment. Western blotting was used to determine the activation state of the Tyk2 (tyrosine kinase )/Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway. Moreover, we used a Tyk2-RNAi assay to silence the expression of Tyk2 in CLDN9 expressing hepatocytes; subsequently, the impact of the Tyk2/Stat3 signaling pathway on the cell invasion and migration in vitro was assessed by a transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Furthermore, an immunohistochemistry method was utilized to explore the expression levels of CLDN9 and p-Stat3 in the HCC tissues and histologically non-neoplastic hepatic tissues.We confirmed that the expression of CLDN9 significantly enhanced the metastatic ability of hepatocytes in vitro, and the activation of the Stat3 pathway by Tyk2 was an important mechanism by which CLDN9 promoted hepatocyte aggressiveness in HCC.As an HCC proto-oncogene, CLDN9 affected the Stat3 signaling pathway via Tyk2 and ultimately enhanced the metastatic ability of hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433692>Effective glucose metabolism maintains low intracellular glucose in airway epithelial cells after exposure to hyperglycaemia.</a></h2><p>The airway epithelium maintains differential glucose concentrations between the airway surface liquid (ASL, ~0.4mM) and the blood/interstitium (5-6mM) which is important for defence against infection. Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the ASL via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the . However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normo- and hyperglycaemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human epithelial cells HBEC) exposed to 5mM glucose (normoglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the mM range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transport (GLUT) with Cytochalasin B reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15mM glucose (hyperglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases 1,  and 3. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by ~25% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration but levels remained in the mM range. Exposure to hyperglycaemia increased glycolysis, glycogen and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via GLUT transporters and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose this prevents transcellular transport, aids the removal of glucose from the ASL and that the main route of entry for glucose into the ASL is via the paracellular pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438472>Antagonistic Effects of IL-4 on IL-17A-Mediated Enhancement of Epidermal  Function.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease. AD is typically characterized by skewed T helper (Th)  inflammation, yet other inflammatory profiles (Th1, Th17, Th22) have been observed in human patients. How cytokines from these different Th subsets impact barrier function in this disease is not well understood. As such, we investigated the impact of the canonical Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, on barrier function and protein composition in primary human keratinocytes and human skin explants. These studies demonstrated that IL-17A enhanced  formation and function in both systems, with a dependence on STAT3 signaling. Importantly, the Th2 cytokine, IL-4 inhibited the barrier-enhancing effect of IL-17A treatment. These observations propose that IL-17A helps to restore skin barrier function, but this action is antagonized by Th2 cytokines. This suggests that restoration of IL-17/IL-4 ratio in the skin of AD patients may improve barrier function and in so doing improve disease severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608051>Acute Respiratory Barrier Disruption by Ozone Exposure in Mice.</a></h2><p>Ozone exposure causes irritation, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), inflammation of the airways, and destruction of alveoli (emphysema), the gas exchange area of the lung in human and mice. This review focuses on the acute disruption of the respiratory epithelial barrier in mice. A single high dose ozone exposure (1 ppm for 1 h) causes first a break of the bronchiolar epithelium within  h with leak of serum proteins in the broncho-alveolar space, disruption of epithelial  and cell death, which is followed at 6 h by ROS activation, AHR, myeloid cell recruitment, and remodeling. High ROS levels activate a novel PGAM5 phosphatase dependent cell-death pathway, called oxeiptosis. Bronchiolar cell wall damage and inflammation upon a single ozone exposure are reversible. However, chronic ozone exposure leads to progressive and irreversible loss of alveolar epithelial cells and alveoli with reduced gas exchange space known as emphysema. It is further associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the lung, resembling other environmental pollutants and cigarette smoke in pathogenesis of asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we review recent data on the mechanisms of ozone induced injury on the different cell types and pathways with a focus on the role of the IL-1 family cytokines and the related IL-33. The relation of chronic ozone exposure induced lung disease with asthma and COPD and the fact that ozone exacerbates asthma and COPD is emphasized.Copyright © 2019 Sokolowska, Quesniaux, Akdis, Chung, Ryffel and Togbe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262043>IL-13 Impairs  in Airway Epithelia.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-13 (IL-13) drives symptoms in asthma with high levels of T-helper type  cells (T-cells). Since  (TJ) constitute the epithelial diffusion barrier, we investigated the effect of IL-13 on TJ in human tracheal epithelial cells. We observed that IL-13 increases paracellular permeability, changes claudin expression pattern and induces intracellular aggregation of the TJ proteins zonlua occludens protein 1, as well as claudins. Furthermore, IL-13 treatment increases expression of ubiquitin conjugating E2 enzyme UBE2Z. Co-localization and proximity ligation assays further showed that ubiquitin and the proteasomal marker PSMA5 co-localize with TJ proteins in IL-13 treated cells, showing that TJ proteins are ubiquitinated following IL-13 exposure. UBE2Z upregulation occurs within the first day after IL-13 exposure. Proteasomal aggregation of ubiquitinated TJ proteins starts three days after IL-13 exposure and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decrease follows the time course of TJ-protein aggregation. Inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling abolishes IL-13 induced effects. Our data suggest that that IL-13 induces ubiquitination and proteasomal aggregation of TJ proteins via JAK/STAT dependent expression of UBE2Z, resulting in opening of TJs. This may contribute to barrier disturbances in pulmonary epithelia and lung damage of patients with inflammatory lung diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622690>Chitosan coating of zein-carboxymethylated short-chain amylose nanocomposites improves oral bioavailability of insulin in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive means of insulin administration circumvent some of the inconveniences of injections. Oral administration in particular is convenient, pain-free, and allows favorable glucose homeostasis, but is subject to chemical instability, enzymatic degradation, and poor gastrointestinal absorption. Natural polymeric nanoparticles have emerged as a promising oral delivery system for peptide therapeutics due their safety, biocompatibility, and stability. In this study, self-assembled nanocomposites from chitosan (CS) and insulin-loaded, zein-carboxymethylated short-chain amylose (IN-Z-CSA) nanocomposites were synthesized to improve oral bioavailability of insulin. The optimized IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites exhibited an average size of 311.32±6.98 nm, a low polydispersity index (0.227±0.01), a negative zeta potential (43.77±1.36 mV), an encapsulation efficiency of 89.6±0.9%, and a loading capacity of 6.8±0.4%. The IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites were stable in storage conditions. The transepithelial permeability of the N-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites was 12-fold higher than that of insulin. Cellular uptake studies revealed that the IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites were internalized into Caco- cells by both endocytosis and a paracellular route. Additionally, in pharmacological studies, orally administered IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites had a stronger hypoglycemic effect with a relative bioavailability of 15.19% compared with that of IN-Z-CSA nanocomposites. Furthermore, cell toxicity and in vivo tests revealed that the IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites were biocompatible. Overall, these results indicate that the IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites can improve oral bioavailability of insulin and are a promising delivery system for insulin or other peptide/protein drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Oral administration of NK46 (1 × 10 CFU/mouse/day for 1 and  months in aged and Tg mice, respectively) shifted gut microbiota composition, particularly Proteobacteria, reduced fecal and blood LPS levels, suppressed NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression, and increased  protein expression in the colon of 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice. NK46 treatment also alleviated cognitive decline in 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice. Furthermore, NK46 treatment suppressed amyloid-β, β/γ-secretases, and caspase-3 expression and amyloid-β accumulation in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-Tg mice. NK46 treatment also reduced Iba1, LPS/CD11b, and caspase-3/NeuN cell populations and suppressed NF-κB activation in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice, while BDNF expression was increased. These findings suggest that the suppression of gut dysbiosis and LPS production by NK46 can mitigate cognitive decline through the regulation of microbiota LPS-mediated NF-κB activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243719>Neurovascular Drug Biotransformation Machinery in Focal Human Epilepsies: Brain CYP3A4 Correlates with Seizure Frequency and Antiepileptic Drug Therapy.</a></h2><p>Pharmacoresistance is a major clinical challenge for approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy. Previous studies indicate nuclear receptors (NRs), drug efflux transporters, and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) control drug passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in drug-resistant epilepsy. Here, we (1) evaluate BBB changes, neurovascular nuclear receptors, and drug transporters in lesional/epileptic (EPI) and non-lesional/non-epileptic (NON-EPI) regions of the same brain, () examine regional CYP expression and activity, and (3) investigate the association among CYP brain expression, seizure frequency, duration of epilepsy, and antiepileptic drug (AED) combination. We used surgically resected brain specimens from patients with medically intractable epilepsy (n = 22) where the epileptogenic loci were well-characterized by invasive and non-invasive methods; histology confirmed distinction of small NON-EPI regions from EPI tissues. NRs, transporters, CYPs, and  proteins were assessed by western blots/immunohistochemistry, and CYP metabolic activity was determined and compared. The relationship of CYP expression with seizure frequency, duration of epilepsy, and prescribed AEDs was evaluated. Decreased BBB  proteins accompanied IgG leakage in EPI regions and correlated with upregulated NR and efflux transporter levels. CYP expression and activity significantly increased in EPI compared to NON-EPI tissues. Change in EPI and NON-EPI CYP3A4 expression increased in patients taking AEDs that were CYP substrates, was downregulated when CYP- and non-CYP-substrate AEDs were given together, and correlated with seizure frequency. Our studies suggest focal neurovascular CYP-NR-transporter alterations, as demonstrated by the relationship of seizure frequency and AED combination to brain CYP3A4, might together impact biotransformation machinery of human pharmacoresistant epilepsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601044>Effects of Claudin-1 on the Action of  Enterotoxin in Caco- Cells.</a></h2><p> enterotoxin (CPE) contributes to diarrhea and an often-lethal enterotoxemia. CPE action starts when it binds to claudin receptors, forming a small complex (90 kDa). Six small complexes then oligomerize to create prepores, followed by insertion of beta-hairpins from CPE to form beta-barrel pores named CH-1 or CH-. Of the ~27 members of the human claudin protein family, only some bind CPE. However, both receptor claudins and the nonreceptor claudin-1 (CLDN-1) are associated with the small and CH-1/CH- CPE complexes. Therefore, this study evaluated whether claudin-1 affects CPE action by generating a CLDN-1 null mutant in Caco- cells using CRISPR-Cas9. Compared to wild-type Caco- cells, paracellular permeability of the CLDN-1 mutant was significantly enhanced, suggesting that claudin-1 may reduce CPE absorption during enterotoxemia. The CLDN-1 mutant was also markedly more sensitive than wild-type Caco- cells to apically-applied CPE. The mechanism behind this increased sensitivity involved higher CPE binding by the CLDN-1 mutant vs. wild-type Caco- cells, which led to more CH-1/CH- complex formation. However, the CH-1/CH- complexes formed by the CLDN-1 mutant were less stable or trypsin resistant than those of wild-type cells. These results indicate that, although a nonreceptor, CLDN-1 positively and negatively influences CPE action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576512>L-Arginine alleviates heat stress-induced intestinal epithelial barrier damage by promoting expression of  proteins via the AMPK pathway.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) and secondary restricted blood flow to the intestines cause dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier.  (TJs) are essential to maintain intestinal integrity. L-Arginine has beneficial effects on gut functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine regulates the TJ network by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which in turn improves intestinal barrier functions under HS. IEC-6 cells and rat small intestines were used as experiment models of heat stress. AICAR and dorsomorphin were used to activate and inhibit the AMPK pathway, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, differential gene expression and KEGG pathway analysis, intestinal paracellular permeability, intestinal morphology, and expression of HSP and TJ proteins, and p-AMPK were determined. L-Arginine promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis after heat exposure at an optimal concentration of 5 mmol. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes associated with the HSP family and TJs were elevated by L-arginine. According to KEGG pathway analysis, L-arginine activated the AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo, intestinal damage resulted in obvious morphological changes as well as apoptosis with TUNEL and caspase-3 staining under HS and dorsomorphin treatments. Furthermore, HS and dorsomorphin increased the serum D-lactate concentration, diamine oxidase activity, and mRNA expression level of MLCK (P < 0.05). In contrast, L-arginine and AICAR treatments reduced intestinal injury, maintained intestinal permeability, and increased the villus/crypt ratio under hyperthermia. L-Arginine had the same effect as AICAR both in vitro and in vivo, namely increasing p-AMPK protein expression. L-Arginine and AICAR also upregulated the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP90, and downregulated mRNA expression of MLCK (P < 0.05). The protein expression levels of TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 were suppressed by heat stroke and dorsomorphin, but enhanced by L-arginine and AICAR. Our findings indicate that activation of AMPK signaling by L-arginine is associated with improved intestinal mucosal barrier functions by enhancing the expression of TJs in rat small intestines and IEC-6 cells during HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499514>Hyaluronan 35 kDa enhances epithelial barrier function and protects against the development of murine necrotizing enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Disruption of  (TJs) predisposes to bacterial translocation, intestinal inflammation, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Previously, studies showed that hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan in human milk, maintains intestinal permeability, enhances intestinal immunity, and reduces intestinal infections. In this study, we investigated the effects of HA 35 kDa on a NEC-like murine model.Pups were divided into Sham, NEC, NEC+HA 35, and HA 35. Severity of intestinal injury was compared using a modified macroscopic gut scoring and histologic injury grading. The effect of HA 35 on intestinal permeability was determined by measuring FITC dextran and bacterial translocation. RNA and protein expression of TJ proteins (claudin-, -3, -4, occludin, and ZO-1) were compared between the groups.Pups in the NEC+HA 35 group had increased survival and lower intestinal injury compared to untreated NEC. In addition, HA 35 reduced intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and proinflammatory cytokine release. Ileal expression of claudin-, -3, -4, occludin, and ZO-1 was upregulated in NEC+HA 35 and HA 35 compared to untreated NEC and shams.These findings suggest that HA 35 protects against NEC partly by upregulating intestinal TJs and enhancing intestinal barrier function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31320686>Identification of a missense variant in CLDN2 in obstructive azoospermia.</a></h2><p>Obstructive azoospermia (OA), defined as an obstruction in any region of the male genital tract, accounts for 40% of all azoospermia cases. Of all OA cases, ~30% are thought to have a genetic origin, however, hitherto, the underlying genetic etiology of the majority of these cases remain unknown. To address this, we took a family-based whole-exome sequencing approach to identify causal variants of OA in a multiplex family with epidydimal obstruction. A novel gain-of-function missense variant in CLDN2 (c.481G>C; p.Gly161Arg) was found to co-segregate with the phenotype, consistent with the X-linked inheritance pattern observed in the pedigree. To assess the pathogenicity of this variant, the wild and mutant protein structures were modeled and their potential for strand formation in multimeric form was assessed and compared. The results showed that dimeric and tetrameric arrangements of Claudin- were not only reduced, but were also significantly altered by this single residue change. We, therefore, envisage that this amino acid change likely forms a polymeric discontinuous strand, which may lead to the disruption of  among epithelial cells. This missense variant is thus likely to be responsible for the disruption of the blood-epididymis barrier, causing dislodged epithelial cells to clog the genital tract, hence causing OA. This study not only sheds light on the underlying pathobiology of OA, but also provides a basis for more efficient diagnosis in the clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267532>Toll-like receptor  stimulation augments esophageal barrier integrity.</a></h2><p>Germline-encoded innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRR) are expressed at epithelial surfaces and modulate epithelial defenses. Evidence suggests that stimulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of PRR may regulate epithelial barrier integrity by upregulating  (TJ) complex protein expression, but it is not known whether this mechanism is utilized in esophageal epithelial cells. TJ complex proteins maintain intact barrier function and are dysregulated in atopic disorders including eosinophilic esophagitis.Pattern recognition receptors expression was assessed in EoE and control primary esophageal epithelial cells, demonstrating robust expression of TLR2 and TLR3. The three-dimensional air-liquid interface culture (ALI) model was used to test whether TLR2 or TLR3 stimulation alters epithelial barrier function using an in vitro model of human epithelium. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FITC-Dextran permeability were evaluated to assess membrane permeability. ALI cultures were evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).TLR3 stimulation did not change TEER in the ALI model. TLR2 stimulation increased TEER (1.28- to 1.31-fold) and decreased paracellular permeability to FITC-Dextran, and this effect was abolished by treatment with anti-TLR2 blocking antibody. TJ complex proteins claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 were upregulated following TLR2 stimulation, and ChIP assay demonstrated altered histone 4 acetyl binding at the TJP1 enhancer and CLDN1 enhancer and promoter following zymosan treatment, implying the occurrence of durable chromatin changes.Our findings implicate the TLR2 pathway as a potential regulator of esophageal epithelial barrier function and suggest that downstream chromatin modifications are associated with this effect.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

IL-22 promotes S. aureus and S. pneumoniae host defense in the lung through epithelial integrity and induction of antimicrobial peptides and is inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). Little is known about the effect of the IL-22/IL-22BP regulatory pathway on lung infection, and it has not been studied in the setting of super-infection. We exposed wild-type and IL-22BP mice to influenza A/PR/8/34 for 6 days prior to infection with S. aureus (USA300) S. pneumoniae. Super-infected IL-22BP mice had decreased bacterial burden and improved survival compared to controls. IL-22BP mice exhibited decreased inflammation, increased lipocalin  expression, and deletion of IL-22BP was associated with preserved epithelial barrier function with evidence of improved  stability. Human bronchial epithelial cells treated with IL-22Fc showed evidence of improved  compared to untreated cells.

Functional pathway analysis showed the 158 IS-SM-regulated genes were associated with T-cell receptor, cytokine-cytokine receptor, chemokine, adipocytokine, , Jak-STAT, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and adherens  signaling. IS-SM showed more altered genes and functional networks than C-SM.We propose some of the 10 genes that are elevated in both IS-SM and C-SM (GRP15, LRRN3, CLDND1, ICOS, GCNT4, VPS13A, DAP3, SNORA54, HIST1H1D, and SCARNA6) might contribute to increased risk of stroke in current smokers, and some genes expressed by blood leukocytes and platelets after stroke in smokers might contribute to worse stroke outcomes that occur in smokers.© 2019 The Authors.

NMDA receptors (NMDARs) trigger NRG2 ectodomain shedding from these sites followed by activation of ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases, and ErbB4 signaling cell-autonomously downregulates intrinsic excitability of GABAergic interneurons by reducing voltage-gated sodium channel currents. NMDARs also promote dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters from ER-PM  and cause a hyperpolarizing shift in its voltage-dependent channel activation, suggesting that NRG2/ErbB4 and Kv2.1 work together to regulate intrinsic interneuron excitability in an activity-dependent manner. Here we explored the cellular processes underlying NMDAR-dependent NRG2 shedding in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We report that NMDARs control shedding by two separate but converging mechanisms. First, NMDA treatment disrupts binding of pro-NRG2 to ER-PM  by post-translationally modifying conserved Ser/Thr residues in its intracellular domain. Second, using a mutant NRG2 protein that cannot be modified at these residues and that fails to accumulate at ER-PM , we demonstrate that NMDARs also directly promote NRG2 shedding by ADAM-type metalloproteinases. Using pharmacological and shRNA-mediated knockdown, and metalloproteinase overexpression, we unexpectedly find that ADAM10, but not ADAM17/TACE, is the major NRG2 sheddase acting downstream of NMDAR activation. Together, these findings reveal how NMDARs exert  control over the NRG2/ErbB4 signaling pathway, and suggest that NRG2 and Kv2.1 are co-regulated components of a shared pathway that responds to elevated extracellular glutamate levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353906>3,3'-Diindolylmethane Improves Intestinal Permeability Dysfunction in Cultured Human Intestinal Cells and the Model Animal .</a></h2><p>3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a digestive metabolite originating from cruciferous vegetables, has dietary potential for the treatment of various human intestinal diseases. Although intestinal permeability dysfunction is closely related to the initiation and progression of human intestinal inflammatory diseases (IBDs), the effect of DIM on intestinal permeability is unclear. We evaluated the effect of DIM on the intestinal permeability of human intestinal cell monolayers and the animal model  which were treated with IL-1β and , respectively, to mimic IBD conditions. DIM substantially restored the intestinal permeability of differentiated Caco- cells by enhancing the expression of  proteins (including occludin and ZO-1). Compared to the IL-1β single treatment (551.0 ± 49.0 Ω·cm), DIM (10 μM) significantly increased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco- cell monolayers (919.0 ± 66.4 Ω·cm,  < 0.001). DIM also ameliorated the impaired intestinal permeability and extended the lifespan of  fed . The mean lifespan of DIM-treated worms (10.8 ± 1.3 days) was higher than that of control-treated worms (9.7 ± 1.1 days,  < 0.01). Thus, DIM is a potential nutraceutical candidate for the treatment of leaky gut syndrome by improving intestinal permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435172>Beneficial effects of nutritional supplements on intestinal epithelial barrier functions in experimental colitis models .</a></h2><p>Acute and chronic colitis affect a huge proportion of the population world-wide. The etiology of colitis cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of colitis. While many forms of acute colitis are easily treatable, chronic forms of colitis such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (summarized as inflammatory bowel diseases) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. There is no cure and therapies aim at reducing inflammation and restoring intestinal barrier function. Unfortunately, most drugs can have severe side effects. Changes in diet and inclusion of nutritional supplements have been extensively studied in cell culture and animal models, and some supplements have shown promising results in clinical studies. Most of these nutritional supplements including vitamins, fatty acids and phytochemicals reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and have shown beneficial effects during experimental colitis in rodents induced by dextran sulphate sodium or ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, which remain the gold standard in pre-clinical colitis research. Here, we summarize the mechanisms through which such nutritional supplements contribute to epithelial barrier stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365278>Erianin alleviates diabetic retinopathy by reducing retinal inflammation initiated by microglial cells  inhibiting hyperglycemia-mediated ERK1/-NF-κB signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is a typical event in the early stage of diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study aims to elucidate the protection of erianin, a natural compound isolated from  Lindl, against DR development. Erianin alleviated BRB breakdown and rescued the reduced claudin1 and occludin expression in retinas from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Erianin reduced microglial activation, ERK1/ phosphorylation, NF-κB transcriptional activation, and the elevated TNF-α expression both  and . ERK1/ inhibitor U0126 abrogated NF-κB activation in d-glucose-treated BV2 cells. Erianin reduced cellular glucose uptake, and molecular docking analysis indicated the potential interaction of erianin with glucose transporter (GLUT)1. GLUT1 inhibitor (STF31) reduced the activation of the ERK1/-NF-κB signaling pathway. Coculture with d-glucose-stimulated microglial BV2 cells and with TNF-α stimulation both induced inner BRB and outer BRB damage in human retinal endothelial cells and APRE19 cells, but erianin improved all these damages. In summary, erianin attenuated BRB breakdown during DR development by inhibiting microglia-triggered retinal inflammation  reducing cellular glucose uptake and abrogating the subsequent activation of the downstream ERK1/-NF-κB pathway. Moreover, erianin also alleviated BRB damage induced by TNF-α released from the activated microglia.-Zhang, T., Ouyang, H., Mei, X., Lu, B., Yu, Z., Chen, K., Wang, Z., Ji, L.

Improved characterized models of PDAC are needed for drug screening.We grew 4 established pancreatic cancer cell lines in hanging drop cultures to produce spheroids. We also grew organoids from explanted xenografted PDAC and surgically resected primary PDAC. We performed transmission and scanning electron microscopy and compared findings with those of the normal pancreatic duct. We also performed single-cell cloning to determine the potential options for differentiation.Spheroids contained  and desmosomes but lacked zymogen granules, as expected. The former features were present in normal pancreatic duct but absent from PDAC cell lines grown in standard -dimensional culture. Spheroids functionally excluded macromolecules in whole mounts. Cells on the surface of PDAC spheroids were carpeted by microvilli except for rare cells with prominent stereocilia. Carpets of microvilli were also seen in low passage organoids produced from xenografts and surgically resected human PDAC, in addition to normal human pancreatic duct.

Gut microbes represent the initial site for toxicant processing following dietary exposures to environmental contaminants. The diet is the primary route of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are absorbed via the gut, and subsequently interfere with neurodevelopment and behavior. Developmental exposures to PCBs have been linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which are also associated with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) distress and intestinal dysbiosis. We hypothesized that developmental PCB exposure impacts colonization of the gut microbiota, resulting in GI pathophysiology, in a genetically susceptible host. Mouse dams expressing two heritable human mutations (double mutants [DM]) that result in abnormal Ca dynamics and produce behavioral deficits (gain of function mutation in the ryanodine receptor 1 [T4826I-RYR1] and a human CGG repeat expansion [170-200 CGG repeats] in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 [FMR1 premutation]). DM and congenic wild type (WT) controls were exposed to PCBs (0-6 mg/kg/d) in the diet starting  weeks before gestation and continuing through postnatal day 21 (P21). Intestinal physiology (Ussing chambers), inflammation (qPCR) and gut microbiome (16S sequencing) studies were performed in offspring mice (P28-P30). Developmental exposure to PCBs in the maternal diet caused significant mucosal barrier defects in ileum and colon (increased secretory state and  permeability) of juvenile DM mice. Furthermore, PCB exposure increased the intestinal inflammatory profile (Il6, Il1β, and Il22), and resulted in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, including altered β-diversity, in juvenile DM mice developmentally exposed to 1 mg/kg/d PCBs when compared to WT controls. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a novel interaction between PCB exposure and the gut microbiota in a genetically susceptible host that provide novel insight into environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of Sb on intestinal mucosal barrier and intestinal flora in a colitis mouse model.Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control group (A), pathologic control group (B), Sb treatment group (C), mesalazine treatment group (D), and Sb combined with mesalazine treatment group (E). Colitis was induced by the addition of .5% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water ad libitum for 7 days. The general condition, weight change, stool property, and bloody stool level of mice were observed to evaluate the disease activity index. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in intestinal tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular  were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The feces and intestinal contents were collected sterilely, and intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Compared with group B, Sb reduced the disease activity index and histological score of group C (disease activity index: group B .708 ± 0.628, group C 1.542 ± 0.616, PBC = 0.005; histological score: group B 9.875 ± 3.271, group C 4.750 ± 1.832, PBC = 0.005) in DSS-induced colitis in mice. Sb exerted a protect effect on the expression of ZO-1 (group B .075 ± 1.176, group C 4.225 ± 1.316, PBC = 0.019) and occludin (group B .200 ± 0.968, group C 3.525 ± 1.047, PBC = 0.023). Compared with group B, Sb decreased the level of TNF-α and IL-8 of group C (TNF-α: group B 716.323 ± 44.691 ng/L, group C 521.740 ± 90.121 ng/L, PBC = 0.001; IL-8: group B 128.992 ± 11.475 pg/mL, group C 106.283 ± 15.906 pg/mL, PBC = 0.012). Treatment with Sb preserved the  and ameliorated microvilli and inter-cellular space. Treatment with Sb also showed its own characteristics: a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes and a lower percentage of Firmicutes, with significant differences or a significant trend. The proportion of the S24-7 family was increased significantly in the Sb treatment group.Sb shows an anti-inflammatory effect and has a protective effect on the intestinal mucosal mechanical barrier.

Gut microbiota appears to play a significant role in the induction of peripheral and central inflammation. Ethanol (EtOH) exposure alters gut permeability, but its effects on Trp metabolism and the involvement of gut microbiota have not been studied. We analyzed several parameters of gut-barrier and of peripheral and central Trp metabolism following  different EtOH consumption patterns in mice, the binge model, drinking in the dark (DID), and the chronic intermittent (CI) consumption paradigm. Antibiotic treatment was used to evaluate gut microbiota involvement in the CI model. Mice exposed to CI EtOH intake, but not DID, show bacterial translocation and increased plasma LPS immediately after EtOH removal. Gut-barrier permeability to FITC-dextran is increased by CI, and, furthermore, intestinal epithelial  (TJ) disruption is observed (decreased expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin) associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity and iNOS expression. CI EtOH, but not DID, increases kynurenine (Kyn) levels in plasma and limbic forebrain. Intestinal bacterial decontamination prevents the LPS increase but not the permeability to FITC-dextran, TJ disruption, or the increase in MMP-9 activity and iNOS expression. Although plasma Kyn levels are not affected by antibiotic treatment, the elevation of Kyn in brain is prevented, pointing to an involvement of microbiota in CI EtOH-induced changes in brain Trp metabolism. Additionally, CI EtOH produces depressive-like symptoms of anhedonia, which are prevented by the antibiotic treatment thus pointing to an association between anhedonia and the increase in brain Kyn and to the involvement of gut microbiota.-Giménez-Gómez, P., Pérez-Hernández, M., O'Shea, E., Caso, J.

We previously observed that supplementation with anthocyanins (AC) (particularly glycosides of cyanidin and delphinidin) mitigated high fat diet (HFD)-induced development of obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and steatosis in C57BL/6J mice. This paper investigated whether these beneficial effects could be related to AC capacity to sustain intestinal monolayer integrity, prevent endotoxemia, and HFD-associated dysbiosis. The involvement of redox-related mechanisms were further investigated in Caco- cell monolayers. Consumption of a HFD for 14 weeks caused intestinal permeabilization and endotoxemia, which were associated with a decreased ileum expression of  (TJ) proteins (occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1), increased expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX1 and NOX4) and NOS2 and oxidative stress, and activation of redox sensitive signals (NF-κB and ERK1/) that regulate TJ dynamics. AC supplementation mitigated all these events and increased GLP- levels, the intestinal hormone that upregulates TJ protein expression. AC also prevented, in vitro, tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization, NOX1/4 upregulation, oxidative stress, and NF-κB and ERK activation. HFD-induced obesity in mice caused dysbiosis and affected the levels and secretion of MUC2, a mucin that participates in intestinal cell barrier protection and immune response. AC supplementation restored microbiota composition and MUC2 levels and distribution in HFD-fed mice. Thus, AC, particularly delphinidin and cyanidin, can preserve GI physiology in HFD-induced obesity in part through redox-regulated mechanisms. This can in part explain AC capacity to mitigate pathologies, i.e. insulin resistance and steatosis, associated with HFD-associated obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Auditory brainstem response was tested before and 48 h after treatments. Distribution of pericytes, PVMs and capillaries was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and BLB permeability was estimated by FITC-dextran leakage assay. Ultrastructure of stria vascularis was examined by transmission electron microscope. Protein and mRNA level of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), interleukin-33 (IL-33) and its receptor suppression of tumorigenicity  (ST2) was measured by IHC and qRT-PCR.Unlike pericytes that surround one capillary, PVMs branched to connect with more than one capillary. LPS caused hearing loss in mice. Following LPS challenge, cochleae showed vascular leakage in stria vascularis, and PVMs presented morphological changes including reduced contact with capillaries. TEM revealed a reduced number of  contact points between endothelial cells and a wider space between PVMs, pericytes and endothelial cells. The mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9 and ST2 in stria vascularis were up-regulated, while ZO-1 were down-regulated after exposure to LPS.Our results suggest that PVMs may play a more significant role than pericytes in maintaining the integrity of BLB. Our findings also reveal a possible mechanism contributing to LPS-induced activation of PVMs, breakdown of BLB and hearing loss.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Resveratrol and curcumin, which can exert many health-protective effects, may have a relationship with mA RNA methylation. We hypothesized that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin could affect growth performance, intestinal mucosal integrity, mA RNA methylation, and gene expression in weaning piglets. One hundred and eighty piglets weaned at 28 ±  days were fed a control diet or supplementary diets (300 mg/kg of antibiotics; 300 mg/kg of each resveratrol and curcumin; 100 mg/kg of each resveratrol and curcumin; 300 mg/kg of resveratrol; 300 mg/kg of curcumin) for 28 days. The results showed that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin improved growth performance and enhanced intestinal mucosal integrity and functions in weaning piglets. Resveratrol and curcumin also increased intestinal antioxidative capacity and mRNA expression of  proteins. Furthermore, resveratrol and curcumin decreased the content of mA and decreased the enrichment of mA on the transcripts of  proteins and on heme oxygenase-1 in the intestine. Our findings indicated that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin increased growth performance, enhanced intestine function, and protected piglet health, which may be associated with changes in mA methylation and gene expression, suggesting that curcumin and resveratrol may be a potential natural alternative to antibiotics.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640184>Gut DNA Virome Diversity and Its Association with Host Bacteria Regulate Inflammatory Phenotype and Neuronal Immunotoxicity in Experimental Gulf War Illness.</a></h2><p>Gulf War illness (GWI) is characterized by the persistence of inflammatory bowel disease, chronic fatigue, neuroinflammation, headache, cognitive impairment, and other medically unexplained conditions. Results using a murine model show that enteric viral populations especially bacteriophages were altered in GWI. The increased viral richness and alpha diversity correlated positively with gut bacterial dysbiosis and proinflammatory cytokines. Altered virome signature in GWI mice also had a concomitant weakening of intestinal epithelial  with a significant increase in Claudin- protein expression and decrease in ZO1 and Occludin mRNA expression.

Surgeons seek to create a competent valve at the gastroesophageal  (GEJ) but are careful to construct a 'floppy' fundoplication that is not too  to minimize side effects. The endoscopic functional luminal-imaging probe (EndoFLIP®) uses impedance planimetry to assess the GEJ intraoperatively. We sought to determine if EndoFLIP variables are associated with symptomatic outcomes following fundoplication.We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data on subjects who underwent primary laparoscopic fundoplication at a single institution between 2014 and 2018. All patients met standard indications for antireflux surgery. Minimum diameter (Dmin), cross-sectional area (CSA), intra-bag pressure, and distensibility index of the GEJ were obtained at 30 mL volumes. GERD Health Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) surveys were administered pre- and postoperatively. Patients were excluded if they underwent fundoplication without EndoFLIP assessment or if they did not complete a postop GERD-HRQL survey. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine if EndoFLIP measurements were correlated with symptomatic outcomes.Forty-three patients met inclusion criteria. The change in Dmin and CSA measures during fundoplication were associated with daily or more frequent heartburn at 6 or more months postop. A decrease in Dmin of 0.15 mm or less (AUC = 0.718, sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 69%) and a decrease in CSA of 1.5 mm or less (AUC = 0.728, sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 70%) were associated with severe heartburn.GEJ opening dynamics attained by EndoFLIP appear to be associated with symptomatic outcomes. When the Dmin and CSA do not decrease by a defined threshold, heartburn is more likely to be severe at 6 or more months postoperatively. This suggests that the fundoplication may not be  enough to prevent persistent or recurrent GERD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252560>Intestinal Preservation Injury: A Comparison Between Rat, Porcine and Human Intestines.</a></h2><p>Advanced preservation injury (PI) after intestinal transplantation has deleterious short- and long-term effects and constitutes a major research topic.

Despite diverging reports, no direct comparison between the development of intestinal PI in rats, pigs, and humans is available. We compared the development of PI in rat, porcine, and human intestines. Intestinal procurement and cold storage (CS) using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution was performed in rats, pigs, and humans. Tissue samples were obtained after 8, 14, and 24 h of CS), and PI was assessed morphologically and at the molecular level (cleaved caspase-3, zonula occludens, claudin-3 and 4, tricellulin, occludin, cytokeratin-8) using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Intestinal PI developed slower in pigs compared to rats and humans. Tissue injury and apoptosis were significantly higher in rats.  proteins showed quantitative and qualitative changes differing between species. Significant interspecies differences exist between rats, pigs, and humans regarding intestinal PI progression at tissue and molecular levels. These differences should be taken into account both with regards to study design and the interpretation of findings when relating them to the clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388052>Hyperosmolar environment and intestinal epithelial cells: impact on mitochondrial oxygen consumption, proliferation, and barrier function in vitro.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the in vitro short-term (-h) and longer-term (24-h) effects of hyperosmolar media (500 and 680 mOsm/L) on intestinal epithelial cells using the human colonocyte Caco- cell line model. We found that a hyperosmolar environment slowed down cell proliferation compared to normal osmolarity (336 mOsm/L) without inducing cell detachment or necrosis. This was associated with a transient reduction of cell mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increase in proton leak, and decrease in intracellular ATP content. The barrier function of Caco- monolayers was also transiently affected since increased paracellular apical-to-basal permeability and modified electrolyte permeability were measured, allowing partial equilibration of the trans-epithelial osmotic difference. In addition, hyperosmotic stress induced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8. By measuring expression of genes involved in energy metabolism,  forming, electrolyte permeability and intracellular signaling, different response patterns to hyperosmotic stress occurred depending on its intensity and duration. These data highlight the potential impact of increased luminal osmolarity on the intestinal epithelium renewal and barrier function and point out some cellular adaptive capacities towards luminal hyperosmolar environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384532>Aspirin alleviates endothelial gap  dysfunction through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-induced vascular injury.</a></h2><p>The loss of endothelial connective integrity and endothelial barrier dysfunction can lead to increased vascular injury, which is related to the activation of endothelial inflammasomes. There are evidences that low concentrations of aspirin can effectively prevent cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin could ameliorate endothelial injury by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and ultimately prevent cardiovascular diseases. Microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( μg/mL) and administrated by 0.1- mmol/L aspirin.

Plasma and heart were harvested for measurement of ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses. We found that aspirin could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation  in dose-dependent manner and has correlation between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the ROS/TXNIP pathway. We also found that low-concentration aspirin could inhibit the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and restore the expression of the endothelial  protein zonula occludens-1/ (ZO1/).

For example, intestine-specific claudin-7 knockout mice spontaneously develop atypical hyperplasia and intestinal adenomas, while claudin-18 knockout mice develop carcinomas in the lung and stomach. Claudin-4, -11, and -15 knockout mice show increased cell proliferation and/or hyperplasia in urothelium, Sertoli cells, and small intestinal crypts, respectively, possibly a precursor to cancer development. Pathways implicated in both cell proliferation and tumorigenesis include Yap/Taz and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)/Akt pathways, among others. Consistent with the tumor suppressive role of claudins shown in mice, in humans, claudin-low breast cancer has been described as a distinct entity with a poor prognosis, and claudin-18-Rho GTPase activating protein 26 (CLDN18-ARHGAP26) fusion protein as a driver gene aberration in diffuse-type gastric cancer due to effects on RhoA. Paradoxically, claudins have also garnered interest as targets for therapy, as they are sometimes aberrantly expressed in cancer cells, which may or may not promote cancer progression. For example, a chimeric monoclonal antibody which targets cells expressing claudin-18. through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity has shown promise in multiple phase II studies. In this review, we focus on new findings supporting a tumor suppressive role for claudins during cancer initiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503404>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-derived microbial anti-inflammatory molecule regulates intestinal integrity in diabetes mellitus mice via modulating  protein expression.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal barrier structure and function have been validated as an important pathogenic process in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Gut dysbiosis is thought to be the critical factor in diabetic intestinal pathogenesis. As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in gut homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal epithelium.16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the gut microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the  pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal barrier function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal barrier structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the  pathway and ZO-1 expression.© 2019 The Authors.

Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), also known as breast regression protein 39 (BRP-39) in mice and human homologue YKL-40, plays important roles in Th2 inflammation and allergen sensitization. CHI3L1 has been implicated in a variety of diseases including asthma characterized by inflammation, apoptosis and tissue remodelling, but its role in AD remains elusive.The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CHI3L1 in the development and progression of AD.We investigated YKL-40 levels in the serum and skin of AD patients by ELISA and immunofluorescence, respectively. Using a murine model of AD induced by ovalbumin (OVA), we investigated Th2 immune responses, M2 macrophage activation and skin barrier gene expression using wild-type (WT) and BRP-39 null mutant (BRP-39 ) mice. YKL-40 level was significantly increased in serum of AD patients. In addition, both mRNA and protein expression levels of BRP-39 were higher in OVA-sensitized WT mice than in control mice. OVA-sensitized BRP-39 mice showed decreased epidermal thickness, lower total serum IgE, Th2 cytokine levels and CD4 effector T cell populations than OVA-sensitized WT mice. Induction of BRP-39 was dominant in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency was found to be involved in M2 macrophage activation. Consistently, the YKL-40 level in the skin of AD patients was higher than in normal subjects and it was expressed in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency attenuated dysregulation of skin barrier and  genes.These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 mediates the development of AD induced by OVA, affecting Th2 inflammation, M2 macrophage activation and skin barrier function.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302421>Herbs-partitioned moxibustion improves intestinal epithelial  by upregulating A20 expression in a mouse model of Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>To investigate effects moxibustion exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial  via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Crohn's disease (CD).C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), mesalazine (MESA) and herbs-partitioned moxibustion (HPM) groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of CD was established using , 4, 6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. MESA and HPM mice were treated with MESA and HPM (at Tianshu (ST25) and Qihai (CV6)), respectively. In HPM group, moxa cones (0.5 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in height) made of refined mugwort floss were placed on herbal cakes (medicinal formula dispensing [radix] Aconiti praeparata, [cortex] Cinnamomi, etc.) at Tianshu (ST25) and Qihai (CV6) and ignited. The moxa cones were ignited, and two moxa cones were used for each treatment once daily for 10 days. In MESA group, mice were fed MESA, which was prepared at a proportion of 1:0.0026, twice daily for 10 days.Intestinal epithelial ultrastructure of WT HPM mice improved more than A20 HPM mice compared to MC mice. WT HPM mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice (P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 and WT HPM mice were all decreased compared to MC mice (P < 0.01). NF-κB p65、MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 HPM mice as compared to WT HPM mice (P < 0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all HPM mice (P  < 0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20  HPM mice (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.01).HPM downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of CD, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial  and repairing the damage CD causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The current study was conducted to investigate if a high concentrate (HC) supplemented with sodium butyrate can alleviate the inflammation and if an epigenetic mechanism is involved in regulating the expression of the key GPR41/43 genes in the cecum. Twelve lactating goats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group fed the HC diet and the treatment group fed the HC diet supplemented with sodium butyrate (HCB). Our results suggested that the supplementation of sodium butyrate significantly increased the pH value in the rumen and cecum, downregulated the expression of GPR41/43 and related inflammatory cytokines, upregulated the expression of  proteins, and reduced the protein expression levels of GPR 41/43, ERK1/, and p38. Moreover, the ratios of DNA methylation and chromatin compaction in the promoter region of the GPR41/43 genes were altered due to the addition of sodium butyrate. In brief, dietary addition of sodium butyrate can reduce the inflammatory injury to the cecal mucosa in lactating goats and can affect the expression of GPR41/43 via epigenetic modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533100>Glutamine Blocks Interleukin-13-Induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function is a hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro.Caco- cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of  proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin- expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not.IL-13 induced barrier integrity impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-.

Injury of human brain endothelial cells can cause disruption of the BBB and severe injury to brain tissue. Signals mediated cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) and their receptors are involved in a variety of pathological conditions. In the current study, our results show that oxygen glucose-deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced the expression of leukotriene receptor type 1 (cysLT1R) in brain endothelial cells. Blockage of cysLT1R by its specific antagonist montelukast suppressed OGD/R-induced altered permeability of the human brain endothelial cell (EC) monolayer. Mechanistically, montelukast treatment reversed OGD/R-induced reduction of the  proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Montelukast also ameliorated OGD/R-induced reduction of inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), such as TIMP-1 and TIMP-. On the other hand, montelukast suppressed the expression and production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines including MMP-, MMP-9, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Using a murine middle cerebral artery occlusion brain injury model, we demonstrated that the administration of montelukast improved the surgery-induced brain injury and protected against disruption of brain endothelial  proteins such as occludin and ZO-1. Collectively, our data suggest that montelukast might confer protective roles against injury in brain endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620112>Selective Disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier by Zika Virus.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) selectively regulates the cellular exchange of macromolecules between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of  (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis,  and  studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at  and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin-5 levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 10 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at  dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin-5 was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB integrity was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Leda, Bertrand, Andras, El-Hage, Nair and Toborek.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393488>Atmospheric nanoparticles affect vascular function using a 3D human vascularized organotypic chip.</a></h2><p>Inhaled atmospheric nanoparticles (ANPs) can migrate into human blood vessels. However, the exact pathogenesis has not yet been well elucidated. In this study, a perfusable 3D human microvessel network was constructed in a microfluidic device. This functional 3D micro-tissue partly mimicked the physiological response of human vessels. Intravascular nanoparticles tend to adsorb proteins to form a protein corona. Based on this pathological response, vessel permeability and vasoconstriction resulting from ANP stimulation might be related to vascular inflammation. It mediated abnormal expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and an influx of intracellular Ca ([Ca]i). This biological behavior disturbed the normal expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The imbalance of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) further resulted in endothelial cell contraction. All these bio-events induced the loss of  (ZO-1) which enhanced vessel permeability. Meanwhile, ANP induced-vascular toxicity was also found in mice. Our observations provide a plausible explanation for how the ANPs affect human vascular function. The vessel-on-chip provides a bridge between in vitro results and human responses. We aimed to use this human 3D functional microvascular model to mimic the physiological responses of human vessels.

Here, we investigate the PF potential anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human Caco- cell monolayers and explore its underlying key molecular mechanism. In this context, PF significantly increased TEER value, decreased intestinal epithelium FITC-dextran flux permeability, and restored the expressions of occludin, ZO-1, and claudin5 in LPS-induced Caco- cell.

Its suppression was recently shown to decrease bile acid (BA) synthesis, thus preventing the development of cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis after bile duct ligation (BDL). To generalize these observations, we suppressed β-catenin in Mdr2 knockout (KO) mice, which develop sclerosing cholangitis due to regurgitation of BA from leaky ducts. When β-catenin was knocked down (KD) in KO for  weeks, hepatic and biliary injury were exacerbated in comparison to KO given placebo, as shown by serum biochemistry, ductular reaction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Simultaneously, KO/KD livers displayed increased oxidative stress and senescence and an impaired regenerative response. Although total liver BA levels were similar between KO/KD and KO, there was significant dysregulation of BA transporters and BA detoxification/synthesis enzymes in KO/KD compared to KO alone. Multiphoton intravital microscopy revealed a mixing of blood and bile in the sinusoids, and validated the presence of increased serum BA in KO/KD mice. Although hepatocyte  were intact, KO/KD livers had significant canalicular defects, which resulted from loss of hepatocyte polarity. Thus, in contrast to the protective effect of β-catenin KD in BDL model, β-catenin KD in Mdr2 KO aggravated rather than alleviated injury by interfering with expression of BA transporters, hepatocyte polarity, canalicular structure, and the regenerative response. The resulting imbalance between ongoing injury and restitution led to worsening of the Mdr2 KO phenotype, suggesting caution in targeting β-catenin globally for all cholestatic conditions.

The increasing incidence from 10% up to 40% is due to more effective treatments of extracerebral sites with improved prognosis and increasing use of MRI in diagnostics. A frequently administered, potent chemotherapeutic group of drugs for BC treatment are taxanes usually used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, which, however, have been suspected to be associated with a higher incidence of BM. The aim of our study was to experimentally analyze the impact of the taxane docetaxel (DTX) on brain metastasis formation, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.A monocentric patient cohort was analyzed to determine the association of taxane treatment and BM formation. To identify the specific impact of DTX, a murine brain metastatic model upon intracardial injection of breast cancer cells was conducted. To approach the functional mechanism, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and electron microscopy of mice as well as in-vitro transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tracer permeability assays using brain endothelial cells (EC) were carried out. PCR-based, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses with additional RNA sequencing of murine and human ECs were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by DTX treatment.Taxane treatment was associated with an increased rate of BM formation in the patient cohort and the murine metastatic model. Functional studies did not show unequivocal alterations of blood-brain barrier properties upon DTX treatment in-vivo, but in-vitro assays revealed a temporary DTX-related barrier disruption. We found disturbance of tubulin structure and upregulation of  marker claudin-5 in ECs. Furthermore, upregulation of several members of the tubulin family and downregulation of tetraspanin- in both, murine and human ECs, was induced.In summary, a higher incidence of BM was associated with prior taxane treatment in both a patient cohort and a murine mouse model. We could identify tubulin family members and tetraspanin- as potential contributors for the destabilization of the blood-brain barrier. Further analyses are needed to decipher the exact role of those alterations on tumor metastatic processes in the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574316>Repetitive magnetic stimulation protects corneal epithelium in a rabbit model of short-term exposure keratopathy.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) on corneal epithelial permeability in a rabbit model of exposure keratopathy.61 female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were treated on one eye with repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) at a frequency of 20 Hz for 15 min.

Many studies have analysed the ability of live probiotics to protect intestinal epithelial cells against  damage caused by bacterial pathogens. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is among the probiotics that positively modulates the intestinal epithelial barrier by regulating expression and distribution of  proteins. We previously reported that regulation of ZO-1, claudin-14 and claudin- is mediated by EcN secreted factors, either free-released or associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Factors secreted by commensal ECOR63 elicited comparable effects in intact epithelial T-84 and Caco- cell monolayers.Here we analyse the ability of OMVs and soluble secreted factors to protect epithelial barrier function in polarized T-84 and Caco- cells infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Transepithelial electrical resistance, paracellular permeability, mRNA levels and subcellular distribution of  proteins were monitored in the absence or presence of EcN and ECOR63 extracellular fractions. EPEC downregulated expression of ZO-1 ZO-, occludin and claudin-14 and altered the subcellular localization of ZO-1, occludin and F-actin cytoskeleton. OMVs and soluble factors secreted by EcN and ECOR63 counteracted EPEC-altered transepithelial resistance and paracellular permeability, preserved occludin and claudin-14 mRNA levels, retained ZO-1 and occludin at  in the cell boundaries and ameliorated F-actin disorganization.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular  (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO- are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332522>Expression of the potential therapeutic target claudin-18. is frequently decreased in gastric cancer: results from a large Caucasian cohort study.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is frequently diagnosed and treated in advanced tumour stages with poor prognosis.

In this study, we aimed to outline the expression of CLDN18. and its correlation with clinico-pathological patient characteristics in a large and well-characterized cohort of GC patients. The expression of CLDN18. was studied in 481 GCs by immunohistochemistry on whole tissue sections. Immunostained GCs were evaluated using the histoscore (H-score) and subsequently divided into two groups: tumours showing any or no expression. CLDN18. expression was investigated for correlation with various clinico-pathological patient characteristics, including survival. CLDN18. expression was found in 203 GCs (42.%). Of these tumours, 71 (14.8%) showed solely weak immunostaining. CLDN18. expression correlated with mucin phenotype, EBV status, the integrin αvβ5, the EpCAM extracellular domain EpEX, and lysozyme. We found no correlation with survival, Laurén phenotype, or any other clinico-pathological patient characteristic. In conclusion, we demonstrate frequently decreased expression of CLDN18. in a GC cohort of appropriate size. Correlating CLDN18. expression with clinico-pathological patient characteristics reveals new linkages to αvβ5, EpEX, and lysozyme, which may pave the way for further investigations regarding the role of  proteins in GC progression.

T1D incidence, gut barrier function, and pancreatic-gut immune responses are analyzed. LMP supplementation significantly dampened the onset of T1D in NOD mice. LMP supplementation induces caecal homeostasis, as indicated by the increasing SCFAs production, higher expression of  proteins claudin 1, zonula occludens- in caecum. Furthermore, LMP-mediated caecal homeostasis impacts gut-pancreatic immunity, as evidenced by increased regulatory T cell population, modulated inflammatory cytokine expression, and suppressed NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas.The data demonstrate that LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment, providing a scientific basis for using LMP as a novel functional supplementation to intervene T1D.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This layer prevents stress‑induced inflammatory responses, thus helping to maintain gut barrier function and gut homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic immobilization stress on the colonic expression of various parameters of homeostasis. A total of two groups of female BALB/c mice (n=6) were included: A stressed group (short‑term immobilization for  h/day for 4 consecutive days) and an unstressed (control) group. Colon samples were obtained to detect neutrophils and goblet cells by optical microscopy, TJ protein expression (occludin, and claudin ‑, ‑4, ‑7, ‑12 and ‑15) by western blotting, mRNA levels of TJ genes and proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, ‑6 and ‑8] by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, fecal lactoferrin by ELISA and the number of colony‑forming units of aerobic bacteria. Compared with goblet cells in control mice, goblet cells were enlarged and reduced in number in stressed mice, whereas neutrophil cellularity was unaltered. Stressed mice exhibited reduced mRNA expression for all evaluated TJ mRNAs, with the exception of claudin‑7, which was upregulated. Protein levels of occludin and all claudins (with the exception of claudin‑12) were decreased in stressed mice. Fecal lactoferrin, proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels and aerobic bacterial counts were all increased in the stressed group. These results indicated that immobilization stress induced proinflammatory and potential remodeling effects in the colon by decreasing TJ protein expression. The present study may be a useful reference for therapies aiming to regulate the effects of stress on intestinal inflammatory dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629525>Short communication: Processed bovine colostrum milk protein concentrate increases epithelial barrier integrity of Caco- cell layers.</a></h2><p>Colostrum plays an important role in initiating the development of the intestinal barrier in newborn mammals. Given its bioactivity, there is much interest in the potential use of bovine colostrum to improve human gastrointestinal health throughout the life span. There is evidence that bovine colostrum is effective at improving small intestinal barrier integrity and some indication that it may alter colonic motility. However, for colostrum to be used as a product to improve intestinal health, it needs to be bioactive after processing. The aim of this study was to determine whether industrial processing of bovine colostrum affects its ability to improve small intestinal barrier integrity or alter distal colon motility. Three colostrum sample types were compared; raw whole colostrum powder (WCP), raw skim colostrum powder (SCP), and industrially produced colostrum milk protein concentrate (CMPC). To determine whether these colostrum powders had different effects on small intestinal barrier integrity, their effects on the transepithelial electrical resistance across an in vitro intestinal epithelial layer (Caco- cells) were measured, both with and without a challenge from the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. These results showed that CMPC enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance across unchallenged epithelial cell layers, whereas the raw colostrum samples, WCP and SCP, did not have an effect. The colostrum samples were also compared to determine how they affect contractility in the distal colon isolated from the rat. Skim colostrum powder was the only sample to act directly on colonic tissue to modulate motility, increasing the amplitude of contractions. The results show that bovine colostrum is able to improve small intestinal barrier integrity and alter colon motility, and they implicate different components. The barrier integrity enhancement was apparent only in the industrial CMPC, which may have been due to the increase in protein concentration or the release of small peptides as a result of processing. The ability to alter colon motility was present in SCP but absent in WCP, again implying that an increase in protein concentration is responsible for the effect. However, this effect was not apparent for the industrially processed CMPC, suggesting denaturation or degradation of the active component. The beneficial effect of colostrum on small intestinal barrier integrity was present after processing, confirming that it is feasible to industrially produce an active product for gut health.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Previous studies have confirmed that Diutina rugosa SD-17 has the potential as a probiotic. We evaluated the probiotic effect of D. rugosa SD-17 on 360 one-day-old Hy-line brown chickens that were divided into  groups, and each group contained 6 replicate pens with 30 birds per pen. The chickens were fed with basal diet supplemented with or without D. rugosa SD-17, and the effects of D. rugosa SD-17 on growth performance, intestine morphology, and immune status were assessed. Body weight was significantly improved from week 3 to 6 (P < 0.05), and the feed conversion ratio was significantly improved in weeks 1 and  (P < 0.001). The length of the duodenum was lengthened significantly in week 3 (P < 0.05), and supplementation of D. rugosa SD-17 significantly increased villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the ileum in week 3 (P < 0.05). Expressions of -related genes of zonula occludens- and occludin in the ileum were significantly increased (P < 0.05). The proliferation capacity of blood lymphocytes stimulated by concanavalin A was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05), and the proportion of helper T (Th) cells increased significantly (P < 0.05). Expressions of Th1 cell markers IL- and interferon (IFN)-γ and immune-related genes of IL-1β, transforming growth factor-β, and IFN-γ in ileum were significantly increased (P < 0.05). These results indicated that D. rugosa SD-17 improved the growth and regulated immunity of chickens, and could be optimized for use as a feed additive for livestock and poultry.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515728>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) Attenuates Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Complement Activation and Cell Death in Brain Endothelial Cells Following OGD/Reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Brain endothelial cells play an important role in maintaining blood flow homeostasis in the brain. Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/ in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362777>Perilesional edema in brain metastases: potential causes and implications for treatment with immune therapy.</a></h2><p>Little is known about tumor-associated vasogenic edema in brain metastasis, yet it causes significant morbidity and mortality. Our purpose was to characterize edema in patients treated with anti-PD-1 and to study potential causes of vessel leakage in humans and in pre-clinical models.We analyzed tumor and edema volume in 18 non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and 18 melanoma patients with untreated brain metastases treated with pembrolizumab on a phase II clinical trial. Melanoma brain metastases were stained with anti-CD34 to assess vessel density and its association with edema. We employed an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier using short-term cultures from melanoma brain and extracranial metastases to determine  resistance as a measure of vessel leakiness.Edema volumes are similar in NSCLC and melanoma brain metastases. While larger tumors tended to have more edema, the correlation was weak (R = 0.30). Patients responding to pembrolizumab had concurrent shrinkage of edema volume and vice versa (R = 0.81). Vessel density was independent of the degree of edema (R = 0.037). Melanoma brain metastasis cells in culture caused loss of  resistance in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model system in some cases, whereas extracerebral cell cultures did not.Edema itself should not preclude using anti-PD-1 with caution, as sensitive tumors have resultant decreases in edema, and anti-PD-1 itself does not exacerbate edema in sensitive tumors. Additional factors aside from tumor mass effect and vessel density cause perilesional edema. Melanoma cells themselves can cause decline in  resistance in a system void of immune cells, suggesting they secrete factors that cause leakiness, which might be harnessed for pharmacologic targeting in patients with significant perilesional edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460449>Growth and Virulence of  Typhimurium Mutants Deficient in Iron Uptake.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the effects of iron, iron chelators, and mutations of  or  genes on the growth and virulence of  Typhimurium Results indicated that organic iron (ferric citrate and ferrous-l-ascorbate) supported better growth of  compared to inorganic iron.

We hypothesized that the regulation of  (TJ) barrier, Th17 cell differentiation, and/or, macrophage activation by cinnamic acid derivatives were involved in the propolis-mediated anti-inflammatory effect. Mice were orally administered % dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in combination with either the feeding control or a diet containing 0.3% ethanol extract of Brazilian propolis for 9 days. DSS administration induced acute colitis in mice, whereas the propolis extract mitigated DSS-induced weight loss; colon shortening; increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; reduced expression of TJ proteins, such as zonula occludens, junctional adhesion molecule-A, occludin, and claudins; and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-17a. Cinnamic acid derivatives, such as artepillin C and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, present in the propolis extract suppressed the IL-17 production from cultured murine splenocytes through decreased retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gT expression. Baccharin, drupanin, and culifolin, which are also present in Brazilian propolis, reduced the TNF-α and/or IL-6 production by suppressing inflammatory signaling in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Taken together, the regulation of Th17 differentiation and macrophage activation by cinnamic acid derivatives, at least in part, contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect mediated by Brazilian propolis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we provide evidence that a missense FHHNC mutation c.908C>G (p.T303R) in the claudin-16 gene interferes with the phosphorylation in the claudin-16 protein. The claudin-16 protein carrying phosphorylation at residue T303 is localized in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) but not in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the mouse kidney. The phosphomimetic claudin-16 protein carrying the T303E mutation but not the wildtype claudin-16 or the T303R mutant protein increases the Trpv5 channel conductance and membrane abundance in human kidney cells. Phosphorylated claudin-16 and Trpv5 are colocalized in the luminal membrane of the mouse DCT tubule; phosphomimetic claudin-16 and Trpv5 interact in the yeast and mammalian cell membranes. Knockdown of claudin-16 gene expression in transgenic mouse kidney delocalizes Trpv5 from the luminal membrane in the DCT. Unlike wildtype claudin-16, phosphomimetic claudin-16 is delocalized from the  but relocated to the apical membrane in renal epithelial cells because of diminished binding affinity to ZO-1. High-Ca diet reduces the phosphorylation of claudin-16 protein at T303 in the DCT of mouse kidney via the PTH signaling cascade. Knockout of the PTH receptor, PTH1R, from the mouse kidney abrogates the claudin-16 phosphorylation at T303. Together, these results suggest a pathogenic mechanism for FHHNC involving transcellular Ca pathway in the DCT and identify a molecular component in renal Ca homeostasis under direct regulation of PTH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440821>Serum nectin- and nectin-4 are diagnostic in lung cancer: which is superior?</a></h2><p>Nectins are immunoglobulin-like molecules that are involved in cell to cell adhesion by forming  and homophilic/heterophilic interactions. This study aimed to analyze serum nectin‑ and nectin‑4 levels in lung cancer patients and to evaluate the prognostic, diagnostic and predictive strengths. Data from 74 lung cancer patients were retrospectively examined and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure serum nectin‑ and nectin‑4 concentrations. A total number of 40 age and sex-adjusted healthy controls were also enrolled in the study. The median serum nectin‑ and nectin‑4 levels of the patients were significantly higher than those of controls (p < 0.001); however, neither biomarker was found to be associated with clinicopathological parameters, (p > 0.05), and furthermore they were found not to be correlated with either overall survival or progression-free survival (p > 0.05). Even though both markers showed high diagnostic values, serum nectin‑ was found superior to both serum nectin‑4 and serum nectin- + nectin‑4 combinations in the diagnosis of lung cancer according to higher sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Serum nectin‑ and nectin‑4 might be used in lung cancer diagnosis but the diagnostic importance of nectin‑ is higher. The prognostic and predictive strengths in cancer are controversial.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and function of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-, a  protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut barrier function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the immunoregulatory and antiviral activities of immunobiotics have not yet been elucidated in detail. The present study was conducted to determine whether selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) modulate toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) induced viral response in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). PolyI:C increased the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in HCT116 cells, and these up-regulations were significantly altered when cells were pre-stimulated with LAB isolated from Korean fermented foods. LAB strains were capable to up-regulate IFN-β but down-regulated IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1β mRNA levels as compared with PolyI: C. HCT-116 cell treatment with LABs beneficially modulated the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10), -5A oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OSA1), myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), TLR3, and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and TLR negative regulators. In addition, LABs increased IFN-β, IFN-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β protein/mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also protected the cells by maintaining  proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). The beneficial effects of these LABs were mediated via modulation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. Overall, the results of this study indicate that immunobiotics have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities that may use as antiviral substitutes for human and animal applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414732>Effect of PI3K/PKB signal pathway inhibitor wortmannin pretreatment on intestinal barrier function in severe acute pancreatitic rats.</a></h2><p>It is well-known that severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) due to infection is mainly caused by intestinal bacterial translocation. The intestinal barrier is tasked with preventing intestinal pathogenic bacteria and toxins from reaching the parenteral tissues through the intestinal wall. Therefore, maintaining intestinal barrier function may be the key to preventing damage from acute pancreatitis (AP). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway (PI3K/PKB) plays a role in AP. However, the exact effect of PI3K/PKB on injury associated with SAP has not yet been found.The present study was aimed at investigating the impact of wortmannin (WT), a PI3K/PKB inhibitor, on intestinal barrier function in SAP rats.The rats were divided into 3 groups: 1) the Sham Surgery group (SS), whose duodenum and pancreas were flipped 3 times (n = 18); ) the pancreatitis group (SAP), who were injected through retrograde pancreatic duct injection with 5% sodium taurocholate (n = 18); and 3) the WSAP intervention group (SAP+WT). Serum alpha-amylase levels, plasma endogenous endotoxin, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, intestinal mucosa electron microscopy, intestinal permeability, and expression of p-PKB (phosphorylated protein kinase B) were measured.In our findings under an electron microscope, the SAP group presented cell edema and mitochondrial vacuolated degeneration, sparsely arranged microvilli,  damage, and widening, while the WSAP group exhibited less change and lower pancreas scores (7.4 ±1.14, 10. ±1.48 and 12.0 ±1.58 for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma endogenous endotoxin levels and Evans blue content of the WSAP group was significantly lower at all timepoints than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that p-PKB expression was lower in the WSAP group than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that WT relieves intestinal permeability changes in SAP rats and may be dose-dependent.The PI3K/PKB signal pathway may involve SAP-related intestinal injuries and WT may relieve SAP intestinal injuries through the PI3K/PKB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600674>A systematic investigation of the effect of the fluid shear stress on Caco- cells towards the optimization of epithelial organ-on-chip models.</a></h2><p>Epithelial cells experience constant mechanical forces, including fluid shear stress (FSS) on their apical surface. These forces alter both structure and function. While precise recapitulation of the complex mechanobiology of organs remains challenging, better understanding of the effect of mechanical stimuli is necessary towards the development of biorelevant in vitro models. This is especially relevant to organs-on-chip models which allow for fine control of the culture environment. In this study, the effects of the FSS on Caco- cell monolayers were systematically determined using a microfluidic device based on Hele-Shaw geometry. This approach allowed for a physiologically relevant range of FSS (from ∼0 to 0.03 dyn/cm) to be applied to the cells within a single device. Exposure to microfluidic FSS induced significant phenotypical and functional changes in Caco- cell monolayers as compared to cells grown in static conditions. The application of FSS significantly altered the production of mucus, expression of , vacuolization, organization of cytoskeleton, formation of microvilli, mitochondrial activity and expression of cytochrome P450. In the context of the intestinal epithelium, this detailed understanding of the effects of the FSS will enable the realization of in vitro organs-on-chip models with well-defined and tailored characteristics to a specific purpose, including for drug and nanoparticle absorption studies. The Hele-Shaw approach used in this study could be readily applied to other cell types and adapted for a wide range of physiologically relevant FSS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased urothelial permeability is thought to contribute to symptom generation in several forms of cystitis by sensitizing bladder afferents. In this report we investigate the physiological mechanisms that mediate bladder afferent hyperexcitability in a rat model of cystitis induced by overexpression in the urothelium of claudin- (Cldn2), a -associated protein upregulated in bladder biopsies from patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Patch-clamp studies showed that overexpression of Cldn2 in the urothelium sensitizes a population of isolectin GS-IB4-negative [IB4(-)] bladder sensory neurons with tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) action potentials. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant increase in mRNA levels of the delayed-rectifier voltage-gated K channel (K). and the accessory subunit K9.1 in this population of bladder sensory neurons. Consistent with this finding, K/K9.1 channel activity was greater in IB4(-) bladder sensory neurons from rats overexpressing Cldn2 in the urothelium than in control counterparts. Likewise, current density of TTX-S voltage-gated Na (Na) channels was greater in sensitized neurons than in control counterparts. Significantly, guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX-1E), a selective blocker of K channels, blunted the repetitive firing of sensitized IB4(-) sensory neurons. In summary, our studies indicate that an increase in the activity of TTX-S Na and K/K9.1 channels mediates repetitive firing of sensitized bladder sensory neurons in rats with increased urothelial permeability. Hyperexcitability of sensitized bladder sensory neurons in a rat model of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) results from increased activity of tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated Na and delayed-rectifier voltage-gated K (K)/K9.1 channels. Of major significance, our studies indicate that K/K9.1 channels play a major role in symptom generation in this model of IC/BPS by maintaining the sustained firing of the sensitized bladder sensory neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425857>Microcontainers for oral insulin delivery - In vitro studies of permeation enhancement.</a></h2><p>Oral delivery of peptides is challenging due to their low uptake through the small intestinal epithelium. , connecting the enterocytes, impede permeability, often necessitating the use of permeation enhancers in the formulation. Loading of peptide and permeation enhancer into micro-scale devices, such as microcontainers, can potentially confine the effective absorptive area through unidirectional release and thereby enhance absorption. This concept is investigated by in vitro permeation studies of insulin across Caco- cell and Caco-/HT29-MTX-E12 co-culture monolayers mimicking the intestinal absorption barrier. The importance of proximity between the microcontainers and the barrier is assessed, by keeping the amounts of insulin and sodium caprate fixed throughout all experiments, while collectively orienting the unidirectional release towards the cell monolayers. Increasing the distance is observed to have a negative effect on insulin permeation matching a one-phase exponential decay function, while no difference in insulin transport is observed between Caco- and co-culture monolayers. Although there are no signs of cytotoxicity caused by the microcontainer material, reversible cell deterioration, as a consequence of high local concentrations of sodium caprate, becomes evident upon qualitative assessment of the cell monolayers. These results both suggest a potential of increasing oral bioavailability of peptides by the use of microcontainers, while simultaneously visualising the ability of regaining monolayer integrity upon local permeation enhancer induced toxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although the previously mentioned molecules reflect the appreciable contributions both adherens  and  are believed to have in endothelial cell intercellular stresses, in doing so they also reveal the obscure relationship that exists between gap  and intercellular stresses. Therefore, to bring clarity to this relationship we disrupted expression of the endothelial gap  connexin 43 (Cx43) by exposing confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to a low (0. μg/mL) and high ( μg/mL) concentration of ,5-dihydroxychalcone (chalcone), a known Cx43 inhibitor. To evaluate the impact Cx43 disruption had on endothelial cell mechanics we utilized traction force microscopy and monolayer stress microscopy to measure cell-substrate tractions and cell-cell intercellular stresses, respectively. HUVEC monolayers exposed to a low concentration of chalcone produced average normal intercellular stresses that were on average 17% higher relative to control, while exposure to a high concentration of chalcone yielded average normal intercellular stresses that were on average 55% lower when compared to control HUVEC monolayers. HUVEC maximum shear intercellular stresses were observed to decrease by 16% (low chalcone concentration) and 66% (high chalcone concentration), while tractions exhibited an almost -fold decrease under high chalcone concentration. In addition, monolayer cell velocities were observed to decrease by 19% and 35% at low chalcone and high chalcone concentrations, respectively. Strain energies were also observed to decrease by 32% and 85% at low and high concentration of chalcone treatment, respectively, when compared to control.

The virus persists in the nasopharynx of cattle and this slows down the process to obtain an FMDV-free status after an outbreak. To study biological mechanisms, or to identify molecules that can be targeted to diagnose or interfere with persistence, we developed a model of persistent FMDV infection in bovine dorsal soft palate (DSP). Primary DSP cells were isolated after commercial slaughter and were cultured in multilayers at the air-liquid interface. After 5 weeks of culture without further passage, the cells were infected with FMDV strain O/FRA/1/2001. Approximately, 20% of cells still had a polygonal morphology and displayed  as in stratified squamous epithelia. Subsets of cells expressed cytokeratin and most or all cells expressed vimentin. In contrast to monolayers in medium, multilayers in air demonstrated only a limited cytopathic effect. Integrin α β expression was observed in mono- but not in multilayers. FMDV antigen, FMDV RNA and live virus were detected from day 1 to 28, with peaks at day 1 and . The proportion of infected cells was highest at 24 hr (3% and 36% of cells at an MOI of 0.01 and 1, respectively). At day 28 after infection, at a time when animals that still harbour FMDV are considered carriers, FMDV antigen was detected in 0.%-.1% of cells, in all layers, and live virus was isolated from supernatants of 6/8 cultures. On the consensus level, the viral genome did not change within the first 24 hr after infection. Only a few minor single nucleotide variants were detected, giving no indication of the presence of a viral quasispecies. The air-liquid interface model of DSP brings new possibilities to investigate FMDV persistence in a controlled manner.© 2019 The Authors.

The focus thus far has been on the carrier-mediated transport of bile acids and other solutes, such as glutathione, which create an osmotic gradient for the transcellular and paracellular flow of water into canaliculi. In addition to the physico-chemical properties of the bile acids, which govern the osmotic gradient, data now exists that the , governing paracellular water flow, and Aquaporin-8 water channels, governing transcellular water flow, are regulated independently. Thus, the rate of water flow into the canaliculus in response to bile acid transport is variable and determines canalicular bile acid concentration, which affects the production and solubilization of cholesterol-lecithin vesicles. These new considerations modify thinking regarding the occurrence of cholestasis and its progression and re-orient the design of experimental studies that can distinguish the different determinants of bile flow. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The paradigm that water flow into the canaliculus is determined only by the rate of carrier-mediated transport has been challenged recently by the changes that occur in hepatic bile composition in the Claudin- knockout mouse and with the cholestatic effect of estradiol 17-D-glucuronide. Thus, respectively, a reduction in paracellular or transcellular canalicular water flow, probably via Aquaporin 8, has no significant effect on bile acid excretion.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal barrier function, and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included  experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is .76 kcal/g. In Exp. , a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin  gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of  proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the barrier function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257297>Anti-RelA siRNA-Encapsulated Flexible Liposome with -Opening Peptide as a Non-invasive Topical Therapeutic for Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proposed as a novel treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) because it suppresses sequence-specific mRNA expression. Indeed siRNA-based therapy achieves an almost complete cure with fewer side effects than currently available treatments. However, the  in the granular layer of the epidermis in the atopic skin are barriers to siRNA delivery. We previously reported the potential clinical utility of AT1002, a peptide that opens . In the present study, we evaluated a topical siRNA-based therapy for AD using AT1002 in combination with a flexible liposome. The 1,-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) liposome was chosen as a carrier for siRNA because of its highly flexible structure and permeability. We prepared siRNA-encapsulated DOPE/CHEMS liposomes and examined their physical properties, safety, uptake into RAW264.7 cells, and topical application in healthy and AD-affected skin. We then assessed the efficacy of anti-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (RelA) siRNA (siRelA)-encapsulated DOPE/CHEMS liposomes with AT1002 in AD model mice. The siRNA-DOPE/CHEMS liposomes were absorbed significantly better than siRNA alone and they enhanced siRNA skin penetration without toxicity. Moreover, siRelA-DOPE/CHEMS liposomes with AT1002 alleviated AD symptoms and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in AD model mice. Therefore, the combination of AT1002 and DOPE/CHEMS liposomes could be a dermally applied RNA interference therapeutic system for effective RNA delivery and AD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395061>Directional entry and release of Zika virus from polarized epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Both vector borne and sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) involve infection of epithelial cells in the initial stages of infection. Epithelial cells are unique in their ability to form polarized monolayers and their barrier function. Cell polarity induces an asymmetry in the epithelial monolayer, which is maintained by  and specialized sorting machinery. This differential localization can have a potential impact of virus infection. Asymmetrical distribution of a viral receptor can restrict virus entry to a particular membrane while polarized sorting can lead to a directional release of virions. The present study examined the impact of cell polarity on ZIKV infection and release.A polarized Caco- cell model we described previously was used to assess ZIKV infection. Transepithelial resistance (TEER) was used to assess epithelial cell polarity, and virus infection was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and qRT-PCR. Cell permeability was measured using a fluorescein leakage assay. Statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA and significance was set at p < 0.05.Using the Caco- cell model for polarized epithelial cells, we report that Zika virus preferentially infects polarized cells from the apical route and is released vectorially through the basolateral route. Our data also indicates that release occurs without disruption of cell permeability.Our results show that ZIKV has directional infection and egress in a polarized cell system. This mechanism of directional infection may be one of the mechanisms that enables the cross the epithelial barrier effectively without a disruption in cell monolayer integrity. Elucidation of entry and release characteristics of Zika virus in polarized epithelial cells can lead to better understanding of virus dissemination in the host, and can help in developing effective therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357693>Effect of Manitoba-Grown Red-Osier Dogwood Extracts on Recovering Caco- Cells from HO-Induced Oxidative Damage.</a></h2><p>Red-osier dogwood, a native species of flowering plant in North America, has been reported to have anti-oxidative properties because of abundant phenolic compounds; this could be promising as a functional food or a feed additive. In the present study, an oxidative damage model using 1.0 mM hydrogen peroxide (HO) in Caco- cells was established to evaluate the antioxidative effects of red-osier dogwood extracts (RDE). The results showed that 1.0 mM HO pre-exposure for 3 h significantly decreased cell viability, and increased interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Caco- cells were treated with 100 µg/mL RDE for 24 h after pre-exposure to HO. It was found that the decreased cell viability caused by HO was significantly restored by a subsequent 100 µg/mL RDE treatment. Furthermore, the IL-8 secretion and ROS level were significantly blocked by RDE, accompanied by the enhanced gene expression of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the enhanced protein expression of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived )-like  (Nrf-). Moreover, RDE improved barrier functions in Caco- cells. Using RDE reduced the diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and increased the transepithelial resistance (TEER) value. The relative mRNA level of  claudin-1, claudin-3, and occludin was elevated by RDE. These extracts also repaired the integrity of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) damaged by HO and increased the protein expressions of ZO-1 and claudin-3 in the HO-pretreated cells. These results illustrated that RDE reduced the ROS level and enhanced the barrier function in oxidative-damaged epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249876>A microfluidic model of human brain (μHuB) for assessment of blood brain barrier.</a></h2><p>Microfluidic cellular models, commonly referred to as "organs-on-chips," continue to advance the field of bioengineering via the development of accurate and higher throughput models, captivating the essence of living human organs. This class of models can mimic key in vivo features, including shear stresses and cellular architectures, in ways that cannot be realized by traditional two-dimensional in vitro models. Despite such progress, current organ-on-a-chip models are often overly complex, require highly specialized setups and equipment, and lack the ability to easily ascertain temporal and spatial differences in the transport kinetics of compounds translocating across cellular barriers. To address this challenge, we report the development of a three-dimensional human blood brain barrier (BBB) microfluidic model (μHuB) using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) and primary human astrocytes within a commercially available microfluidic platform. Within μHuB, hCMEC/D3 monolayers withstood physiologically relevant shear stresses (.73 dyn/cm) over a period of 24 hr and formed a complete inner lumen, resembling in vivo blood capillaries. Monolayers within μHuB expressed phenotypical  markers (Claudin-5 and ZO-1), which increased expression after the presence of hemodynamic-like shear stress. Negligible cell injury was observed when the monolayers were cultured statically, conditioned to shear stress, and subjected to nonfluorescent dextran (70 kDa) transport studies. μHuB experienced size-selective permeability of 10 and 70 kDa dextrans similar to other BBB models. However, with the ability to probe temporal and spatial evolution of solute distribution, μHuBs possess the ability to capture the true variability in permeability across a cellular monolayer over time and allow for evaluation of the full breadth of permeabilities that would otherwise be lost using traditional end-point sampling techniques. Overall, the μHuB platform provides a simplified, easy-to-use model to further investigate the complexities of the human BBB in real-time and can be readily adapted to incorporate additional cell types of the neurovascular unit and beyond.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344598>IL-22 suppresses HSV- replication in human cervical epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Interleukin (IL)-22, a member of the IL-10 family, plays a role in antiviral immune responses to a number of viral infections. However, it is unclear whether IL-22 is involved in the mucosal immunity against herpes simplex virus  (HSV-) infection in the female reproductive tract (FRT). In this study, we studied whether IL-22 could inhibit HSV- infection of human cervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7 cells). We showed that End1/E6E7 cells express the functional IL-22 receptor complex (IL-22R1 and IL-10R2). When treated with IL-22, End1/E6E7 cells expressed the higher levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs: ISG15, ISG56, OAS-1, OAS-, and Mx2) than untreated cells. In addition, IL-22-treated cells produced higher levels of the  proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin) than untreated cells. Mechanistically, IL-22 could activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by inducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. These observations indicate the potential of IL-22 as an anti-HSV- agent in the FRT mucosal innate immunity against HSV- infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Acarbose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor that suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia, however, the cardiovascular protection of acarbose has still remained controversial. NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediated  disruption, a hallmark event of endothelial barrier dysfunction leading to endothelial hyperpermeability in diabetes. Given the anti-inflammatory property of acarbose, it was investigated that acarbose protected against vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in vascular endothelial cells in T2DM rats. The rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were incubated with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) for 24 h in vitro. It was found that HG significantly induced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which was markedly blocked by acarbose treatment. Furthermore, acarbose blocked the Nox4-dependent superoxide (O) generation, which regulated NLRP3 inflammasome in RAECs. Importantly, we found that acarbose remarkably enhanced the  protein expression of ZO-1 and VE-Cadherin and consequently abolished vascular hyperpermeability, which was associated with inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in RAECs. In vivo, acarbose intervention relieved vascular leakage in the heart of diabetic rats injected with Evans blue dye and the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine, which was accompanied with the restoration of ZO-1, VE-Cadherin, Nox4 and NLRP3 inflammasome in the aortal endothelium of diabetic rats. Taken together, our data indicated that acarbose ameliorated endothelial barrier dysfunction by directly inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome which was dependent on inhibiting Nox4 oxidase-dependent O production. These properties might carry a potential significance for acarbose in cardiovascular protection in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have investigated here if (+)-catechin (CAT) and procyanidin B (PB), two main dietary polyphenols, protect the barrier function of intestinal cells undergoing inflammatory stress. The cell model adopted consisted of co-cultured Caco- and HT29-MTX cells, while inflammatory conditions were mimicked through the incubation of epithelial cells with the conditioned medium of activated macrophages (MCM). The epithelial barrier function was monitored through trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and ROS production was assessed with dichlorofluorescein, while the expression of -junctional proteins and signal transduction pathways were evaluated with Western blot. The results indicated that MCM produced significant oxidative stress, the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, a decrease in occludin and ZO-1 expression, and an increase in claudin-7 (CL-7) expression, while TEER was markedly lowered. Neither CAT nor PB prevented oxidative stress, transduction pathways activation, ZO-1 suppression, or TEER decrease. However, PB prevented the decrease in occludin expression and both polyphenols produced a huge increase in CL-7 abundance. It is concluded that, under the conditions adopted, CAT and PB do not prevent inflammation-dependent impairment of the epithelial barrier function of intestinal cell monolayers. However, the two compounds modify the expression of -junctional proteins and, in particular, markedly increase the expression of CL-7. These insights add to a better understanding of the potential biological activity of these major dietary flavan-3-ols at intestinal level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377378>Functional lipid polymeric nanoparticles for oral drug delivery: Rapid mucus penetration and improved cell entry and cellular transport.</a></h2><p>To improve Biopharmaceutics Classification System class IV drug bioavailability, mucus and underlying intestinal epithelial barriers must be overcome. Hydrophilic nanoparticle coatings may hinder cellular uptake and transport. We integrated hydrophilic, detachable poly(N-(-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) with vitamin B12-modified chitosan into lipid polymeric nanoparticles (H/VC-LPNs) to enhance mucus penetration, intracellular uptake, and transepithelial absorption. Multiple particle tracking revealed accelerated mucus diffusion into porcine mucus in vitro. The nanoparticles increased uptake and intracellular distribution in Caco- cells, which may involve intrinsic factor receptor-mediated endocytosis and intercellular . Integration of improved mucus penetration and intracellular absorption was confirmed by in vitro internalization kinetics in HT29-MTX/Caco- co-cultures and in vivo distribution, transport, and mouse Peyer's patch absorption. H/VC-LPNs substantially increased curcumin bioavailability in rats. A nanocarrier with a dissociable shell, receptor-mediated intracellular penetration, and paracellular transport may be promising for oral curcumin delivery.

Previously, we reported that tumor necrosis factor-α time-dependently alters CLDN- expression in tubular epithelial cells. Here, we found a similar expression pattern in a mouse kidney injury model (unilateral ureteral obstruction), consisting of an initial increase followed by a drop in CLDN- protein expression. CLDN- silencing in LLC-PK tubular cells induced activation and phosphorylation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1), leading to Ras homolog family member A (RHOA) activation. Silencing of other claudins had no such effects, and re-expression of an siRNA-resistant CLDN- prevented RHOA activation, indicating specific effects of CLDN- on RHOA. Moreover, kidneys from CLDN- knockout mice had elevated levels of active RHOA. Of note, CLDN- silencing reduced LLC-PK1 cell proliferation and elevated expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P27 (P27KIP1) in a GEF-H1/RHOA-dependent manner. P27KIP1 silencing abrogated the effects of CLDN- depletion on proliferation. CLDN- loss also activated myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), a fibrogenic RHOA effector, and elevated expression of connective tissue growth factor and smooth muscle actin. Finally, CLDN- down-regulation contributed to RHOA activation and smooth muscle actin expression induced by prolonged tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, because they were mitigated by re-expression of CLDN-. Our results indicate that CLDN- suppresses GEF-H1/RHOA. CLDN- down-regulation, for example, by inflammation, can reduce proliferation and promote MRTF activation through RHOA. These findings suggest that the initial CLDN- elevation might aid epithelial regeneration, and CLDN- loss could contribute to fibrotic reprogramming.© 2019 Dan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294568>Superior Penetration and Cytotoxicity of HPMA Copolymer Conjugates of Pirarubicin in Tumor Cell Spheroid.</a></h2><p>-(-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer conjugates of pirarubicin (THP), P-THP, accumulates selectively in solid tumor tissue by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Despite of high accumulation in solid tumors, some macromolecular antitumor agents show poor therapeutic outcome because of poor tissue diffusion into the tumor as well as obstructed tumor blood flow. Here, we confirmed that cellular uptake of P-THP was 25 times less than that of free THP at 1-4 h incubation time . The passage of P-THP through the confluent -monolayer cells  was 12 times higher than free THP, and P-THP penetrated deeper into the tumor cell spheroid (1.3-1.7-fold) than free THP in 4 h. In addition, P-THP showed cytotoxicity comparable to that of free THP to tumor-cells in spheroid form, despite of 7 times lower cytotoxicity of P-THP to the monolayer cells to that of free THP . These results indicate that P-THP administration can exhibit deeper diffusion into the tumor cell spheroid than free THP. As a consequence, P-THP exhibits more efficient antitumor activity than free THP , which is also supported by better pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation of P-THP than free THP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269354>Effects of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection on  protein gene expression and morphology of the intestinal mucosa in pigs.</a></h2><p> proteins are important for the maintenance and repair of the intestinal mucosal barrier. The present study investigated relationships among  protein gene expression, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, and intestinal mucosal morphology in piglets. We compared the expression of six  proteins (ZO-1, ZO-, Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Claudin-5) between seven-day-old piglets infected with PEDV and normal piglets, as well as in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). We also evaluated differences in mucosal morphology between PEDV-infected and normal piglets. The expression of six  protein genes was lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals. The expression of ZO-1, ZO-, Occludin, and Claudin-4 in the intestine tissue was significantly lower (p⟨0.05) in PEDV-infected than in normal piglets. The expression of Claudin-5 in the jejunum was significantly lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals (p⟨0.01). The expression of Claudin-1 and Claudin-5 genes in the ileum was significantly higher in PEDV-infected piglets than in normal piglets (p⟨0.01). Morphologically, the intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets exhibited clear pathological changes, including breakage and shedding of intestinal villi. In PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, the mRNA expression of the six  proteins showed a downward trend; in particular, the expression of the Occludin and Claudin-4 genes was significantly lower (p⟨0.01). These data suggest that the expression of these six  proteins, especially Occludin and Claudin-4, plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368499>,4,6-Tribromophenol Exposure Decreases P-glycoprotein Transport at the Blood-Brain Barrier.</a></h2><p>,4,6-Tribromophenol (TBP, CAS No. 118-79-6) is a brominated chemical used in the production of flame-retardant epoxy resins and as a wood preservative. In marine environments, TBP is incorporated into shellfish and consumed by predatory fish. Food processing and water treatment facilities produce TBP as a byproduct. TBP has been detected in human blood and breast milk. Biologically, TBP interferes with estrogen and thyroid hormone signaling, which regulate important transporters of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a selectively permeable barrier characterized by brain microvessels which are composed of endothelial cells mortared by  proteins. ABC efflux transporters on the luminal membrane facilitate the removal of unwanted endobiotics and xenobiotics from the brain. In this study, we examined the in vivo and ex vivo effects of TBP on two important transporters of the BBB: P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), and Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein  (MRP2, ABCC2), using male and female rats and mice. TBP exposure ex vivo resulted in a time- (1-3 h) and dose- (1-100 nM) dependent decrease in P-gp transport activity. MRP2 transport activity was unchanged under identical conditions. Immunofluorescence and western blotting measured decreases in P-gp expression after TBP treatment. ATPase assays indicate that TBP is not a substrate and does not directly interact with P-gp. In vivo dosing with TBP (0.4 µmol/kg) produced decreases in P-gp transport. Co-treatment with selective Protein Kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prevented the TBP-mediated decreases in P-gp transport activity.Published by Oxford University Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552198>Expression and Localization Profiles of Rhoptry Proteins in  Sporozoites.</a></h2><p>In the  lifecycle two infectious stages of parasites, merozoites, and sporozoites, efficiently infect mammalian host cells, erythrocytes, and hepatocytes, respectively. The apical structure of merozoites and sporozoites contains rhoptry and microneme secretory organelles, which are conserved with other infective forms of apicomplexan parasites. During merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, some rhoptry proteins are secreted to form a  between the parasite and target cell, while others are discharged to maintain subsequent infection inside the parasitophorous vacuole. It has been questioned whether the invasion mechanisms mediated by rhoptry proteins are also involved in sporozoite invasion of two distinct target cells, mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes. Recently we demonstrated that rhoptry neck protein  (RON2), which is crucial for  formation in merozoites, is also important for sporozoite invasion of both target cells. With the aim of comprehensively describing the mechanisms of sporozoite invasion, the expression and localization profiles of rhoptry proteins were investigated in  sporozoites. Of 12 genes representing merozoite rhoptry molecules, nine are transcribed in oocyst-derived sporozoites at a similar or higher level compared to those in blood-stage schizonts. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that eight proteins, namely RON2, RON4, RON5, ASP/RON1, RALP1, RON3, RAP1, and RAMA, localize to rhoptries in sporozoites. It is noteworthy that most rhoptry neck proteins in merozoites are localized throughout rhoptries in sporozoites. This study demonstrates that most rhoptry proteins, except components of the high-molecular mass rhoptry protein complex, are commonly expressed in merozoites and sporozoites in  spp., which suggests that components of the invasion mechanisms are basically conserved between infective forms independently of their target cells. Combined with sporozoite-stage specific gene silencing strategies, the contribution of rhoptry proteins in invasion mechanisms can be described.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504876>Differential expression of cell-cell  proteins in the testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens of domestic turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) with white and yellow semen.</a></h2><p>, adherens, and gap  are involved in the regulation of reproductive tissue function in male mammals. In birds, including domestic turkeys, intercellular interactions performed by junctional networks have not yet been studied. Furthermore, the cellular and molecular basis of yellow semen syndrome (YSS) in the turkey population remains poorly understood. Thus, the aim of the present study was -fold: first, to provide new information on the localization and expression of cell-cell  proteins in the testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens of domestic turkeys and second, to compare expression of junctional protein genes between  turkey population, one that produces white normal semen (WNS) and the other that produces yellow abnormal semen. Expression of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), connexin 43 (Cx43), N- and E-cadherin, and β-catenin genes were investigated using 3 complementary techniques: quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Compared to WNS testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens, YSS tissues exhibited downregulation of occludin and β-catenin mRNA (P < 0.05) and protein (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and upregulation of N- and E-cadherin mRNA (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively) and protein (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, ZO-1 and Cx43 mRNA and protein were upregulated in YSS testis (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) but not in epididymis and ductus deferens; both mRNAs and proteins were downregulated (P < 0.05) compared to the respective WNS epididymis and ductus deferens. Altered staining intensity of immunoreactive proteins in YSS vs. WNS reproductive tissue sections confirmed the gene expression results. The present study is the first to demonstrate altered levels of junctional protein gene expression in reproductive tissues of male YSS turkeys. These findings may suggest that subtle changes in junctional protein expression affect the microenvironment in which spermatozoa develop and mature and thus may have an impact on the appearance of yellow semen in domestic turkeys.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672757>Circulating Plasma Exosomes in Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Reverse-Dipping Blood Pressure.</a></h2><p>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) increases the risk of abnormal non-dipping 24-hour blood pressure profile, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined differential exosomal miRNA expression in untreated OSA patients with normal dipping blood pressure (NDBP) and reverse dipping blood pressure (RDBP; an extreme form of non-dipping) to understand the mechanisms underlying non-dipping blood pressure in OSA.46 patients (RDBP, n=15  NDBP, n=31) matched for OSA severity (respiratory event index, 32.6±22.5 h  32.±18.1 h, p=0.9), age (54.8±12.9  49±9.9 years, p=0.09) and body mass index (36.±6.6 kg·m  34.4±6.8 kg·m, p=0.4) were included. Plasma exosomes were characterised by flow cytometry, and functional  reporter assays were conducted on cultured endothelial cells. Exosome miRNA cargo was profiled with microarrays followed by bioinformatics analyses.Exosomes from RDBP patients increased the permeability of endothelial cell  and adhesion molecule expression. Principal component analyses of miRNA array data showed strict separation and identification of the two groups. A restricted and validated signature of exosomal miRNAs were identified in RDBP  NDBP group. Their predicted target genes involved PI3K-Akt (p=0.004), Ras (p=3.42E-05), Wnt (p=0.003), and HIF-1 signalling (p=0.04), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels (p=0.01), and several cancer-related pathways.Patients with RDBP have altered miRNA cargo in circulating exosomes that invoke  endothelial dysfunction. A selected number of circulating exosomal miRNAs play an important role in abnormal circadian regulation of blood pressure and may provide prognostic biomarkers of CVD risk in OSA.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411504>High-fat diet promotes experimental colitis by inducing oxidative stress in the colon.</a></h2><p>Diets high in animal fats are associated with increased risks of inflammatory bowel disease, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental colitis in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental colitis model induced by ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe colitis compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)  regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture, palmitic acid or palmitic acid and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes colitis by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes colitis in a ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced experimental colitis model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation. These observations provide molecular evidence that diets high in saturated fats are detrimental to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662022>Localization of Tricellular  Molecule LSR at Midbody and Centrosome During Cytokinesis in Human Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial integrity and barrier function are maintained during cytokinesis in vertebrate epithelial tissues. The changes in localization and the roles of tricellular  molecule lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) during cytokinesis are not well known, although new tricellular  form at the flank of the midbody during cytokinesis. In this study, we investigated the changes in localization and the role of LSR at the midbody and centrosome during cytokinesis using human endometrial carcinoma cell line Sawano, comparing the tricellular  molecule tricellulin; bicellular  molecules occludin, claudin-7, zonula occludens-1, and cingulin; and the epithelial polarized related molecules apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein , PAR3, and yes-associated protein. During cytokinesis induced by treatment with taxol, the epithelial barrier was maintained and the tricellular  molecules LSR and tricellulin were concentrated at the flank of the acetylated tubulin-positive midbody and in γ-tubulin-positive centrosomes with the dynein adaptor Hook2, whereas the other molecules were localized there as well. All the molecules disappeared by knockdown using small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, by the knockdown of Hook2, the epithelial barrier was maintained and most of the molecules disappeared from the centrosome. These findings suggest that LSR may play crucial roles not only in barrier function but also in cytokinesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542404>Enhancement of epithelial cell autophagy induced by sinensetin alleviates epithelial barrier dysfunction in colitis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is a key pathology of colitis. Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the  protein claudin-. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin, a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus, on intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of , 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco- cells, respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability, significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy, and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis, and reduced mucosal claudin-. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin. In conclusion, sinensetin significantly alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis by promoting epithelial cell autophagy, and further inhibiting apoptosis and promoting claudin- degradation. The results highlighted novel potential benefits of sinensetin in colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and ) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco- cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco- monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic acid had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Endothelial cell β integrin receptors play a direct role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through regulation of  proteins and infiltrating leukocytes, potentially mediated by β1 integrins. Following tandem transient common carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion on wild-type mice, we administered the integrin a5b1 inhibitor, ATN-161, intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1 mg/kg acutely after reperfusion, on post-stroke day (PSD)1 and PSD2. Systemic changes (heart rate, pulse distension, and body temperature) were determined. Additionally, infarct volume and edema were determined by ,3-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and magnetic resonance imaging, while neurological changes were evaluated using an 11-point Neuroscore. Brain immunohistochemistry was performed for claudin-5, α5β1, IgG, and CD45 + cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-1β, collagen IV, and CXCL12. ATN-161 significantly reduced integrin α5β1 expression in the surrounding peri-infarct region with no systemic changes. Infarct volume, edema, and functional deficit were significantly reduced in ATN-161-treated mice. Furthermore, ATN-161 treatment reduced IgG extravasation into the parenchyma through conserved claudin-5, collagen IV, CXCL12 while reducing MMP-9 transcription. Additionally, IL-1β and CD45 + cells were reduced in the ipsilateral cortex following ATN-161 administration. Collectively, ATN-161 may be a promising novel stroke therapy by reducing post-stroke inflammation and BBB permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624315>A collagen gel-coated, aligned nanofiber membrane for enhanced endothelial barrier function.</a></h2><p>Herein, a collagen gel-coated and aligned nanofiber membrane named Col-ANM is developed, which remarkably improves endothelial barrier function by providing biochemical and topographical cues simultaneously. Col-ANM is fabricated by collagen gel coating process on an aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane, which is obtained by a simple electrospinning process adopting a parallel electrode collector. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Col-ANM exhibit remarkably enhanced endothelial barrier function with high expression levels of intercellular  proteins of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, a high TEER, and a cellular permeability compared with the artificial porous membranes in commercial cell culture well inserts. The enhanced endothelial barrier function is conjectured to be attributed to the synergistic effects of topographical and biochemical cues provided by the aligned PCL nanofibers and collagen gel in the Col-ANM, respectively. Finally, the reactive oxygen species is applied to the HUVEC monolayer formed on the Col-ANM to destroy the  between HUVECs. The destruction of the  is demonstrated by the decreased TEER value over time. Results indicate the potential of Col-ANM in modeling endothelial barrier dysfunction-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318183>Monitoring of Cell Layer Integrity with a Current-Driven Organic Electrochemical Transistor.</a></h2><p>The integrity of CaCo- cell barriers is investigated by organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) in a current-driven configuration. Ion transport through cellular barriers via the paracellular pathway is modulated by  between adjacent cells. Rupturing its integrity by H O is monitored by the change of the output voltage in the transfer characteristics. It is demonstrated that by operating the OECT in a current-driven configuration, the sensitive and temporal resolution for monitoring the cell barrier integrity is strongly enhanced as compared to the OECT transient response measurement. As a result, current-driven OECTs are useful tools to assess dynamic and critical changes in , relevant for clinical applications as drug targeting and screening.© 2019 The Authors.

Destruction of the intestinal barrier is the main underlying cause of NEC. The aim of this study was to determine the role of lactadherin in preventing NEC in a neonatal rat model and investigate the molecular mechanism of lactadherin-mediated protection of the intestinal barrier. Neonatal rats were divided into three groups: dam feeding (DF), NEC (NEC), and NEC supplemented with 10 μg/(g·day) recombinant human lactadherin (NEC+L). Intestinal permeability, tissue damage, and cell  protein expression and localization were evaluated. We found that lactadherin reduced weight loss caused by NEC, reduced the incidence of NEC from 100% to 46.7%, and reduced the mean histological score for tissue damage to 1.40 compared with .53 in the NEC group. Intestinal permeability of lactadherin-treated rats was significantly reduced when compared with that of the NEC group. In addition, the expression levels of JAM-A, claudin 3, and E-calcium in the ileum of NEC group animals increased compared with those in the ileum of DF group animals, and these levels decreased in the NEC+L group. Lactadherin changed the localization of claudin 3, occludin, and E-cadherin in epithelial cells. The mechanism underlying lactadherin-mediated protection of the intestinal barrier might be restoring the correct expression levels and localization of  and adherent  proteins. These findings suggest a new candidate agent for the prevention of NEC in newborns.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470514>Anti-Diabetic Countermeasures Against Tobacco Smoke-Dependent Cerebrovascular Toxicity: Use and Effect of Rosiglitazone.</a></h2><p>Tobacco smoking (TS) is one of the most addictive habit sand a main public health hazards, impacting the vascular endothelium through oxidative stress (OS) stimuli, exposure to nicotine, and smoking-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing evidence also suggested that TS increases glucose intolerance and the risk factor of developing type- diabetes mellitus (2DM), which, along with TS, is connected to blood-brain barrier (BBB) injuries, and heightens the risk of cerebrovascular disorders. Although the exact mechanism of rosiglitazone (RSG) is unknown, our previous in vitro work showed how RSG, an oral anti-diabetic drug belonging to the family of thiazolidinedione class, can protect BBB integrity through enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor (Nrf2) activity. Herein, we have validated the protective role of rosiglitazone against TS-induced BBB impairment in vivo. Our results revealed that RSG as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), activates counteractive mechanisms primarily associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and PPARγ pathways which reduce TS-dependent toxicity at the cerebrovascular level. In line with these findings, our results show that RSG reduces inflammation and protects BBB integrity. In conclusion, RSG offers a novel and promising therapeutic application to reduce TS-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction through activation of the PPARγ-dependent and/or PPARγ-independent Nrf2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288745>Propofol attenuated TNF-α-modulated occludin expression by inhibiting Hif-1α/ VEGF/ VEGFR-/ ERK signaling pathway in hCMEC/D3 cells.</a></h2><p>The levels of  proteins (TJs), especially occludin, correlate with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption caused by inflammation in central nervous system (CNS). It has been reported that propofol, the most commonly used anesthetic, could inhibit inflammation response in CNS. In this study, we investigated the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and propofol on occludin expression in human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line, D3 clone (hCMEC/D3 cells), and explored the underlying mechanisms.The hCMEC/D3 cells were treated with propofol, followed by TNF-α. The expression and phosphorylation of Hif-1α, VEGF, VEGFR-, ERK, p38MAPK and occludin were measured by Western blot analysis. The cell viability of hCMEC/D3 cells was measured by cell counting kit-8.TNF-α (10 ng/ml, 4 h) significantly decreased the expression of occludin, which was attenuated by propofol (25 μM). TNF-α induced Hif-1α/VEGF/VEGFR-/ERK signaling pathway, while propofol could inhibit it. TNF-α induced the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, while propofol had no effect on it. In addition, the inhibitors of Hif-1α, VEGFR-, and ERK could reduce the effect of TNF-α on occludin expression.TNF-α could decrease the expression of occludin via activating Hif-1α/ VEGF/ VEGFR-/ ERK signaling pathway, which was attenuated by propofol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394344>Bisphenol A increases intestinal permeability through disrupting intestinal barrier function in mice.</a></h2><p>That an alteration of the intestinal permeability is associated with gut barrier function has been increasingly evident, which plays an important role in human and animal health. Bisphenol A (BPA), an industrial compound used worldwide, has recently been classified as an environmental pollutant. One of our earlier studies has demonstrated that BPA disrupts the intestinal barrier function by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation in the human colonic epithelial cells line. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary BPA uptake on the colonic barrier function in mice, as well as the intestinal permeability. Dietary BPA uptake was observed to destroy the morphology of the colonic epithelium and increase the pathology score. The levels of endotoxin, diamine peroxidase, D-lactate, and zonulin were found to have been significantly elevated in both plasma and colonic mucosa. A decline in the number of intestinal goblet cells and in mucin  gene expression was observed in the mice belonging to the BPA group. The results of immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of  proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) in colonic epithelium of BPA mice decreased significantly, and their gene abundance was also inhibited. Moreover, dietary BPA uptake was also found to have significantly reduced colonic microbial diversity and altered microbial structural composition. The functional profiles of colonic bacterial community exhibited adverse effects of dietary BPA intake on the endocrine and digestive systems, as well as the transport and catabolism functions. Collectively, our study highlighted that dietary BPA increased the colonic permeability, and this effect was closely related to the disruption of intestinal chemistry and physical and biological barrier functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with a  ×  factorial arrangement consisting of  different SD and  supplemental levels of dietary Trp. A total of 1,140 Ross 308 broiler chickens at 21 d of age were allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 5 replicates. Low SD (9 birds/m2) and high SD (18 birds/m2) were achieved by raising different number of birds per identical floor pen (.0 m × .4 m). The basal diet was formulated with no supplemental Trp in diets to meet or exceed nutrient recommendation of the Ross 308 manual. The calculated concentrations of total Trp and digestible Trp in the basal diet were 0.19 and 0.16%, respectively. The other diet was prepared by adding 0.16% crystalline Trp to the basal diet. Diets were fed to birds for 21 d. At the end of the experiment,  birds per replicate were euthanized to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that there were no interactions between SD and dietary Trp for all measurements. For the main effects, birds raised at a low SD had greater (P < 0.01) body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency than those raised at a high SD. However, supplementation of dietary Trp had no effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, there were no main effects of SD and dietary Trp on intestinal barrier functions. In conclusion, broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with a high SD (18 birds/m2) have decreased growth performance with little changes in intestinal barrier functions. Supplementation of dietary Trp at 0.16% has no positive effect on broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with either a low or high SD.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483932>Erythropoietin protects outer blood-retinal barrier in experimental diabetic retinopathy by up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin.</a></h2><p>To explore the mechanisms of erythropoietin (EPO) in maintaining outer blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in diabetic rats.Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and then followed by intravitreal injection of EPO. Two and four weeks later, the permeability of outer BRB was examined with FITC-dextran leakage assay, following a method to demarcate the inner and outer retina based on retinal blood supply. The glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells, incubated with EPO, soluble EPO receptor (sEPOR), Gö6976, or digoxin, were studied for cell viability and barrier function. The expressions of ZO-1, occludin, VEGFR2, HIF-1α, MAPKs, and AKT were examined with Western blot and immunofluorescence.The major Leakage of FITC-dextran was detected in the outer nuclear layer in both - and 4-week diabetic rats. The leakage was largely ameliorated in EPO-treated diabetic rats. The protein expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in the RPE-Bruch's membrane choriocapillaris complex were significantly decreased, whereas HIF-1α and JNK pathways were activated, in 4-week diabetic rats. These changes were prevented by EPO treatment. The in vitro study with ARPE-19 cells confirmed these changes, and the protective effect of EPO was abolished by sEPOR. Gö6976 and digoxin rescued the  and barrier function in glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells.In early diabetic rats, the outer BRB might be more severely damaged and its breakdown is the major factor for retinal oedema.

Although numerous mechanisms for DILI have been identified, few studies have focused on loss of hepatocyte polarization as a DILI mechanism. The current study investigated the effects of valproate, an antiepileptic drug with DILI risk, on the cellular mechanisms responsible for loss of hepatocyte polarization. Fully polarized collagen sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with valproate (1-20mM) for specified times (3-24hr). Hepatocyte viability was significantly decreased by 10mM and 20mM valproate. Valproate depolarized hepatocytes, even at non-cytotoxic concentrations (=5mM). Depolarization was associated with significantly decreased canalicular levels of multidrug resistance-associated protein  (Mrp2) resulting in reduced canalicular excretion of the Mrp2 substrate carboxydichlorofluorescein. The decreased canalicular Mrp2 was associated with intracellular accumulation of Mrp2 in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes and early endosomes. Mechanistic studies suggested that valproate inhibited canalicular trafficking of Mrp2. This effect of valproate on Mrp2 appeared to be selective in that valproate had less impact on canalicular levels of the bile salt export pump (Bsep) and no detectable effect on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) canalicular levels. Treatment with valproate for 24hr also significantly downregulated levels of -associated protein, zonula occludens  (ZO2), but appeared to have no effect on the levels of  proteins claudin 1, claudin , occludin, ZO1 and ZO3. These findings reveal that two novel mechanisms may contribute to valproate hepatotoxicity: impaired canalicular trafficking of Mrp2 and disruption of ZO2-associated hepatocyte polarization.© The Author(s) 2019.
