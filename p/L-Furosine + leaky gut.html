Calprotectin concentrations were mean ± SEM 140 ± 31.9 mg/kg, 16 patients (73%) presented with concentrations outside normal (>50 mg/kg). Concentrations correlated inversely with serum levels of tryptophan,  and phenylalanine (all p < 0.05). Increased concentrations of fecal calprotectin indicate a disturbed intestinal barrier function in AD patients which could be of relevance for the lowering of essential aromatic amino acids concentrations in the blood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328972>Altered  microbiome in a mouse model of Gulf War Illness causes neuroinflammation and intestinal injury via   and TLR4 activation.</a></h2><p>Many of the symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI) that include neurological abnormalities, neuroinflammation, chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbances have been traced to Gulf War chemical exposure. Though the association and subsequent evidences are strong, the mechanisms that connect exposure to intestinal and neurological abnormalities remain unclear. Using an established rodent model of Gulf War Illness, we show that chemical exposure caused significant dysbiosis in the  that included increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes and Tenericutes, and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes. Several gram negative bacterial genera were enriched in the GWI-model that included Allobaculum sp. Altered microbiome caused significant decrease in tight junction protein Occludin with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2, a signature of a  . Resultant leaching of  caused portal endotoxemia that led to upregulation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in the small intestine and the brain. TLR4 knock out mice and mice that had  decontamination showed significant decrease in  nitration and inflammatory mediators IL1β and MCP-1 in both the small intestine and frontal cortex. These events signified that  dysbiosis with simultaneous   and systemic endotoxemia-induced TLR4 activation contributes to GW chemical-induced neuroinflammation and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p></html>
