The first group (n = 20) received a combined contraceptive pill by the vaginal route, one tablet per week at bedtime for 8 weeks. Each tablet contained 250 microg  plus 30 microg ethinyl estradiol. The second group (n = 20) was given 1 gm of an intravaginal conjugated estrogen cream at bedtime, three times in the first week, twice in the second week, and then once a week for the next 6 weeks (1 gram of conjugated estrogen cream contained 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens). Subjects were questioned about their urogenital symptoms, and vaginal cytologic smears, vaginal bacterial cultures, and urine cultures were performed before treatment and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of therapy.The vaginal pH and the proportion of the fecal type bacteria decreased in both groups, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. The karyopyknotic index and the maturation index were improved during treatment in both groups. An increase in the proportion of lactobacilli were recorded in both groups after therapy, with no significant difference between the two groups. No significant changes were observed in urinary bacteria. The therapy (combined contraceptive pill and estrogen cream) had a marked effect on urogenital symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency), with impressive improvement comparably in both groups.A combined contraceptive tablet administered vaginally once a week can alleviate urogenital symptoms in Thai postmenopausal women as effectively as the vaginal estrogen cream. However, the pills are much less expensive and are easily obtained in developing countries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458551>Short- and long-term influence of the -releasing intrauterine system (Mirena®) on vaginal  and Candida.</a></h2><p>Recurrent vulvovaginal infections are a frequent complaint in young women in need of contraception. However, the influence of the contraceptive method on the course of the disease is not well known.To investigate the influence of the -releasing intrauterine-system (LNG-IUS) on the vaginal microflora.Short-term (3 months) and long-term (1 to 5 years) changes of vaginal  were compared with pre-insertion values in 252 women presenting for LNG-IUS insertion. Detailed microscopy on vaginal fluid was used to define lactobacillary grades (LBGs), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV) and the presence of Candida. Cultures for enteric aerobic bacteria and Candida were used to back up the microscopy findings. Fisher's test was used to compare vaginal microbiome changes pre- and post-insertion.Compared to the pre-insertion period, we found a temporary worsening in LBGs and increased rates of BV and AV after 3 months of LNG-IUS. After 1 and 5 years, however, these changes were reversed, with a complete restoration to pre-insertion levels. Candida increased significantly after long-term carriage of LNG-IUS compared to the period before insertion [OR 2.0 (CL951.1-3.5), P=0.017].Short-term use of LNG-IUS temporarily decreases lactobacillary dominance, and increases LBG, AV and BV, but after 1 to 5 years these characteristics return to pre-insertion levels, reducing the risk of complications to baseline levels. Candida colonization, on the other hand, is twice as high after 1 to 5 years of LNG-IUS use, making it less indicated for long-term use in patients with or at risk for recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913230>Effects of combined oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate and the -releasing intrauterine system on the vaginal microbiome.</a></h2><p>Prior studies suggest that the composition of the vaginal microbiome may positively or negatively affect susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Some female hormonal contraceptive methods also appear to positively or negatively influence STI transmission and BV. Therefore, changes in the vaginal microbiome that are associated with different contraceptive methods may explain, in part, effects on STI transmission and BV.We performed a retrospective study of 16S rRNA gene survey data of vaginal samples from a subset of participants from the Human Vaginal Microbiome Project at Virginia Commonwealth University. The subset included 682 women who reported using a single form of birth control that was condoms, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).Women using COCs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.64] and DMPA (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.89), but not LNG-IUS (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 0.72-3.35), were less likely to be colonized by BV-associated bacteria relative to women who used condoms. Women using COCs (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.25-3.02) were more likely to be colonized by beneficial HO-producing Lactobacillus species compared with women using condoms, while women using DMPA (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63-1.86) and LNG-IUS (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15) were not.Use of COCs is significantly associated with increased vaginal colonization by healthy lactobacilli and reduced BV-associated taxa.COC use may positively influence gynecologic health through an increase in healthy lactobacilli and a decrease in BV-associated bacterial taxa.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Contraception was initiated with an injectable (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [n = 41], norethisterone enanthate [n = 44], or medroxyprogesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol [n = 40]), implant ( [n = 45] or etonogestrel [n = 48]), or copper intrauterine device (n = 48) and repeat vaginal swabs were collected after 30, 90, and 180 days of continuous use. Self-reported condom use was similar across all arms at baseline. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect Lactobacillus crispatus, L jensenii, L gasseri/johnsonii group, L vaginalis, L iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Megasphaera-like bacterium phylotype I from swabs. Modified Poisson regression and mixed effects linear models were used to compare marginal prevalence and mean difference in quantity (expressed as gene copies/swab) prior to and during contraceptive use.Bacterial vaginosis prevalence increased in women initiating copper intrauterine devices from 27% at baseline, 35% at 30 days, 40% at 90 days, and 49% at 180 days (P = .005 compared to marginal prevalence at enrollment). Women initiating hormonal methods had no change in bacterial vaginosis prevalence over 180 days. The mean increase in Nugent score was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.0; P = .001) in women using copper intrauterine devices. Although the frequency and density of beneficial lactobacilli did not change among intrauterine device users over 6 months, there was an increase in the log concentration of G vaginalis (4.7, 5.2, 5.8, 5.9; P = .046) and A vaginae (3.0, 3.8, 4.6, 5.1; P = .002) between baseline and 30, 90, and 180 days after initiation. Among other contraceptive groups, women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had decreased L iners (mean decrease log concentration = 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.5; P = .004) and there were no significant changes in beneficial Lactobacillus species over 180 days regardless of contraceptive method used.Copper intrauterine device use may increase colonization by bacterial vaginosis-associated , resulting in increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis.

We evaluated the effect of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on cervical persistence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in a baboon model. Female olive baboons (Papio anubis) with or without an LNG-IUS received CT or sham inoculations. CT was detected in cervical epithelium with weekly nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and culture. Presence of the LNG-IUS was associated with prolonged persistence of CT. Median time to post-inoculation clearance of CT as detected by NAAT was 10 weeks (range 7-12) for animals with an LNG-IUS and 3 weeks (range 0-12) for non-LNG-IUS animals (P = 0.06). Similarly, median time to post-inoculation clearance of CT by culture was 9 weeks (range 3-12) for LNG-IUS animals and 1.5 weeks (range 0-10) for non-LNG-IUS animals (P = 0.04). We characterized the community structure of the vaginal  with the presence of the LNG-IUS to determine if alterations in CT colonization dynamics were associated with changes in vaginal commensal bacteria. Vaginal swabs were collected weekly for microbiome analysis. Endocervical CT infection was not correlated with alterations in the vaginal . Together, these results suggest that LNG-IUS may facilitate CT endocervical persistence through a mechanism distinct from vaginal microbial alterations.© FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.

Such infections require multidisciplinary management and prompt treatment, but an atypical presentation can delay diagnosis. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department for evaluation. She had acute abdominal pain and fever 18 h after insertion of a  intrauterine device (IUD). She had a normal vaginal delivery 45 days earlier, and no other significant medical background. In a few hours the symptoms worsened, with rapid progression towards multiorgan failure. Differential diagnoses of late ovarian thrombophlebitis and ovarian torsion were considered. Laparoscopic surgery revealed the absence of ovarian torsion. The microbiologic culture of the IUD showed  by GAS. The sudden onset of shock-like symptoms in a postpartum woman with rapid progression towards multiorgan failure should prompt consideration of a diagnosis of GAS infection, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated to avoid the possible fatal consequences of this aggressive infection.</p></html>
