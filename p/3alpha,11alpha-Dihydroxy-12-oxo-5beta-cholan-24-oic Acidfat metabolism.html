Here, we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) mediates  accumulation in the heart. Fatty  (FAs) upregulate GSK-3α, which phosphorylates PPARα at Ser280 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). This modification ligand independently enhances transcription of a subset of PPARα targets, selectively stimulating FA uptake and storage, but not oxidation, thereby promoting  accumulation. Constitutively active GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, was sufficient to drive PPARα signaling, while cardiac-specific knockdown of GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, or replacement of PPARα Ser280 with Ala conferred resistance to lipotoxicity in the heart. Fibrates, PPARα ligands, inhibited phosphorylation of PPARα at Ser280 by inhibiting the interaction of GSK-3α with the LBD of PPARα, thereby reversing lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that GSK-3α promotes  anabolism through PPARα-Ser280 phosphorylation, which underlies the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy in the context of obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we examined the effects of small molecules that interfere with ER stress-GSK3α/β signaling on the progression and regression of atherosclerosis in a mouse model.To examine atherosclerotic progression, low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (Ldlr) mice were placed on a high- diet (HFD) and treated with the chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA, 3.8  g/L drinking water), or the GSK3α/β inhibitor, valproate (VPA, 625 mg VPA/kg diet), for 10 weeks. To examine potential effects on atherosclerotic regression, 4 week old Ldlr mice were placed on a HFD for 16 weeks. Subsets of mice were harvested at this time or switched to a chow (low ) diet, or a chow diet with 4PBA or VPA treatment for 4 weeks.In the progression model, the 4PBA- and VPA-treated mice had significantly reduced lesion and necrotic core size. Treatments had no effect on metabolic parameters, including plasma and hepatic  levels, or plaque composition. In the regression model, mice with 4PBA or VPA treatment showed no alterations in lesion size, but the lesions had significantly smaller necrotic cores, increased vascular smooth muscle cell content, and increased collagen content. These features are consistent with more stable plaques.The pharmacological attenuation of ER stress or inhibition of GSK3α/β impedes the development of atherosclerosis in Ldlr mice and appears to promote the stabilization of existing lesions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Early identification and treatment from birth onward effectively provides a functional cure, but diagnosis is often delayed. We conducted a pilot study using a two-tier test for CTX to screen archived newborn dried bloodspots (DBSs) or samples collected prospectively from a high-risk Israeli newborn population. All DBS samples were analyzed with flow injection analysis (FIA)-MS/MS, and 5% of samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Consecutively collected samples were analyzed to identify CTX-causing founder genetic variants common among Druze and Moroccan Jewish populations. First-tier analysis with FIA-MS/MS provided 100% sensitivity to detect CTX-positive newborn DBSs, with a low false-positive rate (0.1-0.5%). LC-MS/MS, as a second-tier test, provided 100% sensitivity to detect CTX-positive newborn DBSs with a false-positive rate of 0% (100% specificity). In addition, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol-3--β-D-glucuronide was identified as the predominant bile-alcohol disease marker present in CTX-positive newborn DBSs. In newborns identifying as Druze, a 1:30 carriership frequency was determined for the c.355delC  gene variant, providing an estimated disease prevalence of 1:3,600 in this population. These data support the feasibility of two-tier DBS screening for CTX in newborns and set the stage for large-scale prospective pilot studies.Copyright © 2018 DeBarber et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25671385>Oleanane-type triterpenoids of Aceriphyllum rossii and their diacylglycerol acyltransferase-inhibitory activity.</a></h1><p>Six known triterpenoid compounds, 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic  (1), gypsogenic  (2), 3α-hydroxyolean-12-en-27-oic  (3), 3β-hydroxyolean-12-en-27-oic  (4), aceriphyllic  A (5), and oleanolic  (6), were isolated from the roots of Aceriphyllum rossii. Their chemical structures were determined by comparison with available (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR data on known compounds. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for inhibitory activity against human diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2. Most of the isolates exhibited a better inhibitory activity against diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (IC50: 11.6-44.2 µM) than against diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (IC50: 22.7-119.5 µM). In particular, compounds 1 and 5 showed strong inhibition efficacy towards diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2, and appeared to act competitively against oleoyl-CoA in vitro. The results also indicated that both compounds reduced newly synthesized triacylglycerol in HuTu80 and HepG2 cells. Oral administration of compound 1 significantly reduced postprandial triacylglycerol in mice following an oral lipid challenge. In conclusion, the current study indicates that compound 1 suppresses both de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis and resynthesis through the inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity, and therefore may be a useful agent for treating diseases associated with a high triacylglycerol level.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303744>Agonism for the bile  receptor GPBAR1 reverses liver and vascular damage in a mouse model of steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the liver and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile -activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses liver and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses liver and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in  and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed liver injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay. BAR501 reversed this pattern in a Gpbar1-dependent manner, highlighting a potential role for GPBAR1 agonism in treating the liver and vascular component of NASH.-Carino, A., Marchianò, S., Biagioli, M., Bucci, M., Vellecco, V., Brancaleone, V., Fiorucci, C., Zampella, A., Monti, M.

Recent studies have shown that plasma cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (CT) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) could be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of NPC patients. We aimed to know the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers for the diagnosis of NPC compared with other diseases that can potentially lead to oxysterol alterations. We studied 107 controls and 122 patients including 16 with NPC, 3 with lysosomal  lipase (LAL) deficiency, 8 with other lysosomal diseases, 5 with galactosemia, 11 with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), 3 with Smith-Lemli-Opitz, 14 with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, 19 with unspecific hepatic diseases, 13 with familial hypercholesterolemia, and 30 with neurological involvement and no evidence of an inherited  disease. CT and 7-KC were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS as mono-dimethylglycine derivatives. Levels of 7-KC were high in most of the studied diseases, whereas those of CT were only high in NPC, LAL, and CTX patients. Consequently, although CT is a sensitive biomarker of NPC disease, including those cases with doubtful filipin staining, it is not specific. 7-KC is a very unspecific biomarker.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different -to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host , especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different -to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different -to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate  accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27494119>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Steroid  in Women with Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy.</a></h1><p>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a common liver disorder, mostly occurring in the third trimester. ICP is defined as an elevation of serum bile , typically accompanied by pruritus and elevated activities of liver aminotransferases. ICP is caused by impaired biliary  secretion, in which endogenous steroids may play a key role. Although ICP is benign for the pregnant woman, it may be harmful for the fetus. We evaluated the differences between maternal circulating steroids measured by RIA (17-hydroxypregnenolone and its sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and cortisol) and GC-MS (additional steroids), hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin in women with ICP (n = 15, total bile  (TBA) >8 μM) and corresponding controls (n = 17). An age-adjusted linear model, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC), and multivariate regression (a method of orthogonal projections to latent structure, OPLS) were used for data evaluation. While aminotransferases, conjugates of pregnanediols, 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol were higher in ICP patients, 20α-dihydropregnenolone, 16α-hydroxy-steroids, sulfated 17-oxo-C19-steroids, and 5β-reduced steroids were lower. The OPLS model including steroids measured by GC-MS and RIA showed 93.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while the model including steroids measured by GC-MS in a single sample aliquot showed 93.3% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity. A composite index including ratios of sulfated 3α/β-hydroxy-5α/β-androstane-17-ones to conjugated 5α/β-pregnane-3α/β, 20α-diols discriminated with 93.3% specificity and 81.3% sensitivity (ROC analysis). These new data demonstrating altered steroidogenesis in ICP patients offer more detailed pathophysiological insights into the role of steroids in the development of ICP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034873>Induction of a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with autophagic characteristics with steroidal maleic anhydrides and 7β-hydroxycholesterol on glioma cells.</a></h1><p>Steroidal maleic anhydrides were prepared in one step: lithocholic, chenodeoxicholic, deoxicholic, ursocholic, and hyodeoxicholic  derivatives. Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with lithocholic and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death. It is concluded that these compounds trigger a non apoptotic mode of cell death, involving the mitochondria and associated with several characteristics of autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidative stress is a well-known phenomenon associated with Cisplatin toxicity. However, in Cisplatin treated group, abnormal animal behavior, decreased body weight, cellular and sub-cellular changes in the kidney and sperm abnormality were observed. Our investigation revealed that Cisplatin when administered in combination with a natural product derivative (Urs-12-ene-3α,24β-diol, labeled as IN0523) resulted in significant restoration of body weight and protection against the pathological alteration caused by Cisplatin to kidney and testis. Sperm count and motility were significantly restored near to normal. Cisplatin caused depletion of defense system i.e. glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, which were restored close to normal by treatment of IN0523. Reduction in excessive  peroxidation induced by Cisplatin was also found by treatment with IN0523. The result suggests that IN0523 is a potential candidate for ameliorating Cisplatin induced toxicity in the kidney and testes at a dose of 100mg/kg p.o. via inhibiting the oxidative stress/redox status imbalance and may be improving the efflux mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing  deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and  in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy . Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic  was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free fatty  uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the liver were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and  synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and , interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29986394>Comprehensive Metabolomics Analysis of Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet in Blood Stasis Model Rats Using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS.</a></h1><p>Blood stasis syndrome (BSS) is one of the most common Chinese medicine patterns in coronary heart disease. Our previous work proved that Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet (XXT) could treat blood stasis through regulating the expression of F13a1, Car1 and Tbxa2r. In the current study, the effect and mechanism of XXT on BSS was comprehensively and holistically investigated based on a metabolomics approach. Urine and plasma samples of 10 BBS rats treated with XXT (XT), 9 BSS model rats (BM) and 11 normal control (NC) rats were collected and then determined by UPLC-Q/TOP-MS. Multivariate analyses were applied to distinguish differentiate urinary and plasma metabolite patterns between three groups. Results showed that a clear separation of three groups was achieved. XT group was located between BM group and NC group, and showing a tendency of recovering to NC group, which was consistent with the results of hemorheological studies. Some significantly changed metabolites like cortexolone, 3α,21-dihydroxy-5β-pregnane-11,20-dione and 19-hete and leukotriene A4, chiefly involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic   and , were found and identified to explain the mechanism. These potential markers and their corresponding pathways will help explain the mechanism of BSS and XXT treatment.

To explain these effects, different mechanisms are being proposed, including those involving endocannabinoids and related signaling molecules. Many of these compounds belong to the fatty  amides, conjugates of fatty  with biogenic amines. Conjugates of DHA with ethanolamine or serotonin have previously been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and potentially neuroprotective properties. Here, we synthesized another amine conjugate of DHA, N-docosahexaenoyl dopamine (DHDA), and tested its immune-modulatory properties in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells. N-Docosahexaenoyl dopamine significantly suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO), the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the chemokines macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (CCL20) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), whereas its parent compounds, dopamine and DHA, were ineffective. Further exploration of potential effects of DHDA on key inflammatory mediators revealed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA level and production of prostaglandin E (PGE) were concentration-dependently inhibited in macrophages. In activated BV-2 cells, PGE production was also reduced, without changes in COX-2 mRNA levels. In addition, DHDA did not affect NF-kB activity in a reporter cell line. Finally, the immune-modulatory activities of DHDA were compared with those of N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) and similar potencies were found in both cell types. Taken together, our data suggest that DHDA, a potentially endogenous endocannabinoid, may be an additional member of the group of immune-modulating n-3 fatty -derived  mediators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546615>Melatonin decreases muscular oxidative stress and inflammation induced by strenuous exercise and stimulates growth factor synthesis.</a></h1><p>Strenuous exercise is detrimental to athletes because of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Melatonin, a classic antioxidant, has been shown to exhibit beneficial effects regarding intense exercise and tissue repair. In this study, we evaluated the onset and resolution of inflammation in melatonin-treated and nontreated rats subjected to a strenuous exercise session. We also analyzed the formation of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Control and treated rats were subjected to exhaustive exercise after a period of 10 days of melatonin treatment (20 mg/dL). Plasma and muscle levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2-alpha/beta (CINC-2α/β), l-selectin, macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha (MIP-3α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured prior to, immediately after, and 2 hr after exercise. Our data revealed decreases in the muscle concentrations of IL-1β (35%), TNF-α (13%), IL-6 (48%), and TBARS (40%) in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We also observed decreases in the plasma concentrations of IL-1β (17%) in the melatonin-treated group. VEGF-α concentrations and SOD activity increased by 179% and 22%, respectively, in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We concluded that muscle inflammation and oxidative stress resulting from exhaustive exercise were less severe in the muscles of melatonin-treated animals than in the muscles of control animals. Thus, melatonin treatment may reverse exercise-induced skeletal muscle inflammation and stimulate growth factor synthesis.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
