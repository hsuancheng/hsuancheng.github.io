Along with obesity,  and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile  metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty  caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The onset is typically in the 6th or 7th decade of life with slow progression to akinesia, severe tremors, physical disability and death within 10 to 25 years of initial symptoms. Parkinson disease is common and affects approximately 1% of Americans above the age of 60 years. The cause of Parkinson disease is unknown, but is marked by loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brainstem and loss of normal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Therapy of Parkinson disease continues to evolve and has resulted in improved quality of life and survival. The initial agents used for Parkinson disease were anticholinergic agents including trihexyphenidyl (Artane, Trihexy: 1949), benztropine (Cogentin: 1954), and biperiden (Akineton: 1959); their mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is not completely clear. With the increased understanding of the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism, agents that directly or indirectly affect dopaminergic transmission have been developed that have resulted in marked improvements in the management of symptoms of Parkinson disease. Levodopa (L-DOPA: 1970) is a metabolic precursor of dopamine and is the single most effective agent for Parkinson disease. It is usually combined with carbidopa (Sinemet: 1975), which increases the drug levels and half life of levodopa by inhibiting the amino  decarboxylase that metabolizes levodopa peripherally. Dopaminergic receptor agonists are also beneficial in Parkinson disease and are often combined with levodopa/carbidopa. Dopamine receptor agonists currently available include bromocriptine (1978: Parlodel), pergolide (Permax: 1988), apomorphine (Apokyn: 2004) and more selective agonists for the D2 class of dopamine receptors – ropinirole (Requip: 1997), pramipexole (Mirapex: 1997) and rotigotine (Neupro which is formulated in a transdermal patch: 2007). More recently, inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) have been developed that block the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dopamine; these agents include tolcapone (Tasmar: 1998) and entacapone (Comtan: 2003). Dopamine is also metabolized by the monamine oxidases and selegiline (Atapryl: 2006) and rasagiline (Azilect: 2007) which are specific inhibitors of monamine oxidase (MAO) type B, and are used as an adjunctive therapy with levodopa in therapy of Parkinson disease. Amantadine (Symmetrel: 1987) also has activity in Parkinson disease, perhaps through stimulation of release of dopamine in the substantial nigra. It is discussed separately as an anti-influenza agent. Other agents used in the management of Parkinson disease are used to treat specific complications such as psychosis (pimavanserin: Nuplazid, 2016) and postural hypotension (droxidopa: Vectibix, 2014). Most of the drugs used to treat Parkinson disease have little potential for hepatotoxicity and are rare causes of clinically apparent acute liver injury, the exception being tolcapone. The full references on hepatotoxicity and safety of the drugs for Parkinson disease are given in the discussion of the individual agents listed below.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642261>[Metabolomic network analysis of umbilical cord blood of gestational  patients via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry].</a></h2><p>The global increase in the prevalence of gestational (GDM)in recent years has prompted the study of the effect of GDM on the metabolism between mother and fetus.

The pharmacokinetic properties of GABA, however, may be suboptimal for clinical applications. The amino  homotaurine is a type A GABA-R (GABA-R) agonist with good pharmacokinetics and appears safe for human consumption. In this study, we show that homotaurine inhibits in vitro T cell proliferation to a similar degree as GABA but at lower concentrations. In vivo, oral homotaurine treatment had a modest ability to reverse hyperglycemia in newly hyperglycemic NOD mice but was ineffective after the onset of severe hyperglycemia. In severely diabetic NOD mice, the combination of homotaurine and low-dose anti-CD3 treatment significantly increased 1) disease remission, 2) the percentages of splenic CD4and CD8 regulatory T cells compared with anti-CD3 alone, and 3) the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 regulatory T cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes compared with homotaurine monotherapy. Histological examination of their pancreata provided no evidence of the large-scale GABA-R agonist-mediated replenishment of islet β-cells that has been reported by others. However, we did observe a few functional islets in mice that received combined therapy. Thus, GABA-R activation enhanced CD4and CD8 regulatory T cell responses following the depletion of effector T cells, which was associated with the preservation of some functional islets. Finally, we observed that homotaurine treatment enhanced β-cell replication and survival in a human islet xenograft model. Hence, GABA-R agonists, such as homotaurine, are attractive candidates for testing in combination with other therapeutic agents in type 1  clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656017>Diastereomeric Mixture of Calophyllic and Isocalophyllic  Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Memory Impairment in Mice: Involvement of Antioxidant Defense and Cholinergic Systems.</a></h2><p>Dementia of Alzheimer disease type (AD) and type 2  (T2D) are two most common diseases of aging which has reached epidemic proportions. Moreover, there is a shared mechanism of pathogenesis between metabolic disorders and AD. Hence, the need for discivery of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Diastereomeric mixture of calophyllic  and isocalophyllic  (ISO) has been shown to stimulate glucose uptake through GLUT4- translocation. In this study, an attempt was made to investigate the effect of ISO on scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. ISO (5, 25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.) was administered for 3 consecutive days. One hour post-treatment on day 3, scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was given before the animals were subjected to Y-maze, open field, novel object recognition (NOR) or Morris water maze (MWM; 5 consecutive days) paradigms. The mice were sacrificed 45 min after MWM test on day 8. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were rapidly isolated on ice for assay of biochemical markers of oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity. Scopolamine reduced the percentage alternation behaviour in the Y-maze and discrimination index in NOR tests with no significant change in escape latency time in MWM task suggestive of deficit in learning and memory. However, the pretreatment of mice with ISO produced a dose-dependent improvement in learning and memory. Moreover, ISO administration attenuated scopolamine-induced increase in malondialdehyde/nitrite generation and acetylcholinesterase activity and deficit in antioxidant enzyme activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Findings from this study showed that the diastereomeric mixture of calophyllic  and isocalophyllic  possesses anti-amnesic effect through enhancement of antioxidant defense and cholinergic signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645725>Structural basis of species-selective antagonist binding to the succinate receptor.</a></h2><p>The tricarboxylic  cycle intermediate succinate is involved in metabolic processes and plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis,  and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643354>Antineoplastic Agents.</a></h2><p>The antineoplastic agents or anticancer drugs represent a large and diverse class of medications. They generally have limited but important uses, and often have significant hepatotoxicity. The antineoplastic agents are not easily classified. Historically, they are categorized as (1) alkylating agents, (2) antimetabolites, (3) natural products, (4) hormones and antagonists, and (5) miscellaneous. In recent years, however, the miscellaneous group has come to include some of the most important agents. Anticancer agents can also be classified by indication (lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, solid tumor), mechanism of action (such as alkylating agents, antibiotics, biological response modifiers, antiandrogens, topoisomerase inhibitors or protein kinase inhibitors), chemical structure (folic  analog, platinum coordination complex, purine or pyrimidine analog, monoclonal antibody) or as cytotoxic or nonspecific vs noncytotoxic or targeted. The classification used in LiverTox represents a mixture of these systems, which generally follow those given in modern pharmacology textbooks. Almost all antineoplastic agents have some degree of hepatotoxicity, and the liver injury is usually due to direct, intinsic toxicity. The typical manifestation is an elevation in liver enzymes or bilirubin during therapy that reverses rapidly with stopping treatment or dose modification. This type of hepatotoxicity is dose related and generally self-limiting, but can be severe, progressive and even fatal as can occur with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or acute toxic hepatic injury. The antineoplastic agents often have a narrow toxic-therapeutic ratio, although the usual dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression. Nevertheless, liver injury also can be dose limiting, which generally becomes clear in early dose finding studies. For this reason, many antineoplastic agents acquire a reputation for hepatotoxicity based upon premarketing studies, but are later found to be reasonably well tolerated and only rare causes of clinically significant liver injury when given in lower doses. Antineoplastic agents that are well known to cause significant direct hepatotoxicity when given in moderate to high doses (particularly when used in myeloablation before hematopoietic cell transplantation) include busulfan, mephalan, cyclosphosphamide, dacarbazine, cytarabine, fluorouracil, carboplatinin and L-asparaginase. At lower doses, these agents are well tolerated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636052>The Role of Diet in the Prevention of  among Women with Prior Gestational : A Systematic Review of Intervention and Observational Studies.</a></h2><p>Women with prior gestational  (GDM) have an increased lifetime risk of developing type 2  (T2DM). There are no up-to-date systematic reviews analyzing the relationship of diet with risk of developing T2DM following GDM.To systematically review the evidence from intervention and observational studies on effects of dietary interventions and associations of dietary intake with T2DM outcomes in women with a GDM history.Six electronic databases were searched (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central, Proquest, and Scopus) for articles published until May 2019. This review includes intervention and observational studies among women of any age with a history of GDM that reported on the effects of dietary interventions or association of dietary intake (energy, nutrients, foods, dietary patterns) with T2DM, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or prediabetes.The systematic review identified five articles reporting results from four intervention studies, and seven articles reporting results from four observational studies. Findings from intervention studies indicated trends toward beneficial effects of a low-glycemic index diet, a low-carbohydrate diet, and a diet in line with general population dietary guidelines, but studies had unclear or high risk of bias. Findings from two cross-sectional and one prospective study indicated poorer  outcomes for women with higher intakes of branched-chain amino , total and heme iron, and a diet relatively low in carbohydrates and high in animal fat and protein, and better outcomes among those consuming diets rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, fish, and legumes, and low in red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages, after adjustment for confounders, including body mass index.Findings from observational studies support current dietary guidelines for the prevention of T2DM. Further dietary intervention studies are needed to confirm whether or not dietary modification following a GDM pregnancy reduces women's risk of developing T2DM.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty  and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635188>A Fermented Food Product Containing Lactic  Bacteria Protects ZDF Rats from the Development of Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease, which involves a maintained hyperglycemia due to the development of an insulin resistance process. Among multiple risk factors, host intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention in T2D etiology and progression. In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut microbiota population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups. These findings suggest that FFP induced gut microbiota modifications in ZDF rats that improved glucose metabolism and protected from T2D development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643750>Cholestyramine.</a></h2><p>Cholestyramine is a nonabsorbed bile  sequestrant that is used a therapy of hyperlipidemia and for the pruritus of chronic liver disease and biliary obstruction.

Nanomedicines address the shortcomings of conventional therapy, as evidenced by several preclinical and clinical investigations indicating site-specific drug delivery, reduced side effects, and better treatment outcome. The development of suitable and biocompatible drug delivery vehicles is a prerequisite that has been successfully achieved by using simple and functionalized liposomes, nanoparticles, hydrogels, micelles, dendrimers, and mesoporous particles. A variety of drug delivery vehicles have been established for the targeted and controlled delivery of therapeutic agents in a wide range of chronic diseases, such as , cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. After successful outcomes in preclinical and clinical trials, many of these drugs have been marketed for human use, such as Abraxane®, Caelyx®, Mepact®, Myocet®, Emend®, and Rapamune®.

Several studies showed that irisin involves in thermogenesis and increases the expression of browning markers such as uncoupling protein-1 that in turns induces the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown fat. Resveratrol (Res) and all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) can also upregulate the expression of thermogenesis genes. In the present study, the effects of single and combined treatments of Res and ATRA on fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) gene expression was explored.The mouse myoblasts, C2C12 cells, were seeded in 6-well plastic plates and cultured in DMEM media. After differentiation, in a pilot study, C2C12 myotubes were treated with different concentrations of Res and ATRA for 12 h. The best result was obtained by treatment of 1and 25 μM of Res and 1 μM of ATRA. Then the main study was continued by single and combined treatment of these compounds at chosen concentration.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral fat were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic  (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642672>Polyphenol-Rich Extracts from Brown Macroalgae  Attenuate Hyperglycemia and Modulate Gut Microbiota in High-Fat Diet and Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Brown macroalgae are an important source of polyphenols with multiple health functions. In this work, polyphenol extracts from  were purified and investigated for the antidiabetic activity in vitro and in vivo. The purified polyphenol extracts exhibited good antioxidant activities, α-glucosidase and lipase inhibition activities (IC < 0.25 mg/mL). The HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis indicated that the compounds in polyphenol extracts were mainly phlorotannin derivatives, phenolic  derivatives, and gallocatechin derivatives.

The study also identified some bioactive compounds as well as their molecular interaction in the binding pocket of these enzymes. Standard enzyme inhibition and kinetics assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effects of aqueous extract (TCA) and ethanol extract (TCE) of  leaves on -glucosidase and -amylase activities. The phytoconstituents of TCA and TCE were determined using GC-MS. Molecular docking of the phytocompounds was performed using Autodock Vina. TCA and TCE were the most potent inhibitors of -glucosidase (IC = 3.28 ± 0.47 mg/mL) and -amylase (IC = 0.24 ± 0.08 mg/mL), respectively. Both extracts displayed a mixed mode of inhibition on -amylase activity, while mixed and noncompetitive modes of inhibition were demonstrated by TCA and TCE, respectively, on -glucosidase activity. The GC-MS analytic chromatogram revealed the presence of 24 and 22 compounds in TCE and TCA, respectively, which were identified mainly as phenolic compounds, terpenes/terpenoids, fatty , and other phytochemicals. The selected compounds exhibited favourable interactions with the enzymes compared with acarbose. Overall, the inhibitory effect of  on -amylase and -glucosidase may be ascribed to the synergistic action of its rich phenolic and terpene composition giving credence to the hypoglycaemic nature of  leaves.Copyright © 2019 Franklyn Nonso Iheagwam et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630179>Gluco-metabolic effects of pharmacotherapy-induced modulation of bile  physiology.</a></h2><p>The discovery and characterization of the bile  specific receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) have facilitated a wealth of research focusing on the link between bile  physiology and glucose metabolism. Modulation of FXR and TGR5 activation have been demonstrated to impact the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1, insulin and glucagon as well as energy expenditure and gut microbiota composition with potential beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.A search strategy based on literature searches in pubmed.org with various combinations of the key words FXR, TGR5, agonist, apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter (ASBT), bile  sequestrant, metformin and glucose metabolism has been applied to obtain material for the present review. Furthermore, manual searches including scanning of reference lists in relevant papers and conference proceedings have been performed.This review provides an outline of the link between bile  and glucose metabolism, with a special focus on the gluco-metabolic impact of treatment modalities with modulating effects on bile  physiology; including FXR agonists, TGR5 agonists, ASBT inhibitors, bile  sequestrants and metformin.Any potential beneficial gluco-metabolic effects of FXR-agonists remain to be established, whereas the clinical relevance of TGR5-based treatment modalities seems limited due to substantial safety concerns of TGR5 agonists observed in animal models.

The natural histological course of untreated BE is non-dysplastic or benign BE (ND) than low-grade (LGD), and high-grade dysplastic (HGD) BE, with the expected increase in malignancy transfer to oesophagal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The gold standard for BE diagnostics involves high-resolution white-light endoscopy, followed by uniform endoscopy findings description (Prague classification) with biopsy performance according to Seattle protocol. The medical treatment of GERD and BE includes the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) regarding symptoms control. It is noteworthy that long-term use of PPIs increases gastrin level, which can contribute to transfer from BE to EAC, as a result of its effects on proliferation of BE epithelium. Endoscopy treatment includes a wide range of resection and ablative techniques, such as radio-frequency ablation (RFA), often concomitantly used in everyday endoscopy practice (multimodal therapy). RFA promotes mucosal necrosis of treated oesophagal region via high-frequency energy. Laparoscopic surgery, partial or total fundoplication, is reserved for PPIs and endoscopy indolent patients or in those with progressive disease. This review aims to explain distinct effects of PPIs and RFA modalities, illuminate certain aspects of molecular mechanisms involved, as well as the effects of their concomitant use regarding the treatment of BE and prevention of its transfer to EAC.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643431>Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists.</a></h2><p>The thrombopoietin receptor agonists mimic the action of thrombopoietin on its receptor and stimulate the activation, proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes, resulting in an increase in circulating platelet counts. Thrombopoietin itself acts in this manner, but when recombinant thrombopoietins were used clinically, they were found to cause rebound thrombocytopenia, probably due to induction of anti-thrombopoietin antibodies. For this reason, direct administration of thrombopoietin was abandoned as an approach to treating thrombocytopenia and other approaches to activating the thrombopoietin receptor were sought. Several thrombopoietin receptor agonists were subsequently developed and are now in clinical use for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and for raising platelet counts in persons with thrombocytopenia undergoing surgical procedures or other thrombocytopenic conditions. Eltrombopag, lusutrombopag and avatrombopag are peptide-like, small molecular weight agonists of the thrombopoietin receptor. These agents are given by mouth and result in significant increases in platelet counts in normal persons as well as patients with thrombocytopenia due to hematologic and liver diseases. Romiplostim, in contrast, is a recombinant polypeptide that binds to and activates the thrombopoietin receptor despite having no amino  homology to native thrombopoietin. It also increases platelet counts in normal subjects as well as patients with chronic ITP but has not been associated with induction of anti-thrombopoietin antibodies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639404>Conformational analysis and in vitro immunomodulatory and insulinotropic properties of the frog skin host-defense peptide rhinophrynin-27 and selected analogs.</a></h2><p>The study investigates conformational analysis and the in vitro cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory and insulin-releasing activities of rhinophrynin-27 (ELRLPEIARPVPEVLPARLPLPALPRN; RP-27), a proline-arginine-rich peptide first isolated from skin secretions of the Mexican burrowing toad Rhinophrynus dorsalis (Rhinophrynidae). In both water and 50% trifluoroethanol-water, the peptide adopts a polyproline type II helical conformation with a high degree of deviation from the canonical collagen-like folding and a pronounced bend in the molecule at the Glu residue. Incubation of mouse peritoneal cells with RP-27 significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and stimulated production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The peptide significantly (P < 0.01) stimulated release of insulin from BRIN-BD11 rat clonal β-cells at concentrations ≥ 1 nM while maintaining the integrity of the plasma membrane and also stimulated insulin release from isolated mouse islets at a concentration of 10 M. Increasing the cationicity of RP-27 by substituting glutamic  residues in the peptide by arginine and increasing hydrophobicity by substituting alanine residues by tryptophan did not result in analogues with increased activity with respect to cytokine production and insulin release. The combination of immunosuppressive and insulinotropic activities together with very low cytotoxicity suggests that RP-27 may represent a template for the development of an agent for use in anti-inflammatory and Type 2  therapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The specific submitochondrial localization of VWA8 remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific submitochondrial compartment within which VWA8 resides in order to provide more insight into the function of this protein. Bioinformatics analysis showed that VWA8 has a 34 amino  N-terminal Matrix-Targeting Signal (MTS) that is similar to those in proteins known to localize to the mitochondrial matrix. Experiments in C2C12 mouse myoblasts using confocal microscopy showed that deletion of the VWA8 MTS (vMTS) resulted in cytosolic, rather than mitochondrial, localization of VWA8. Biochemical analysis using differential sub-fractionation of mitochondria isolated from rat liver showed that VWA8 localizes to the matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane, similar to the inner mitochondrial membrane protein Electron Transfer Flavoprotein-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase (ETFDH). The results of these experiments show that the vMTS is essential for localization to the mitochondrial matrix and that once there, VWA8 localizes to the matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane.Copyright © 2019.

The underlying condition appears to be an increase in total body uric  stores and is usually marked by hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as serum uric  levels greater than 7.0 mg/dL. Gout is more common in men than women and usually has its onset in 4th or 5th decade of life. Approximately 1% of adult Americans report having gout and 5% have some degree of hyperuricemia. Management of gout can be directed at treatment of acute attacks of gouty arthritis or to long term maintenance therapy directed at preventing attacks or decreasing the risk of uric  nephropathy or nephrolithiasis. Treatment of acute attacks usually rests on use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents such as indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac or celecoxib. Colchicine (1961: Colbenemid and others) is used both during acute episodes and in chronic maintenance therapy. However, the major approach to long term prevention of gout and the complications of uric  nephropathy is the use of uricosuric  such as probenecid (1951: Benuryl) and benzbromarone (not available in the United States) and/or inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, such as the xanthine derivative allopurinol (1966: Aloprim) and the newer nonnucleoside xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as febuxostat (2009: Uloric, Adenuric). Newer approaches to gout include use of lesinurad (Zurampic: 2015), a drug that inhibits the reabsorption of uric  in the distal tubules of the kidney, and use of recombinant enzymes that metabolize uric  such as pegloticase (Kystexxa), which is used in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors ito treat severe gout, and rasburicase (Elitek: 2002) which is used to treat the hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis syndrome induced by cancer chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671732>Advances in Research on  by Human Nutriomics.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of  (DM) have increased rapidly worldwide over the last two decades.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty  uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto  decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino  catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino  transaminase, branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino , thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino  in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino , as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino , alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino  catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino  catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric , increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric  concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of  and how exercise improves .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673045>Hepatic Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency-mediated activation of mTORC1- PGC-1α axis regulates ER stress during high-carbohydrate feeding.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in lipogenesis as it catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty  (MUFAs), mainly oleate (18:1n9) and palmitoleate (16:1n7) from saturated fatty  (SFA), stearate (18:0) and palmitate (16:0), respectively. Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis, liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty  in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665380>Plasma Ceramide Species Are Associated with  Risk in Participants of the Strong Heart Study.</a></h2><p>Few studies have assessed the associations of ceramides and sphingomyelins (SMs) with  in humans.We assessed associations of 15 circulating ceramides and SM species with incident  in 2 studies.The analysis included 435 American-Indian participants from the Strong Heart Study (nested case-control design for analyses; mean age: 57 y; 34% male; median time until  4.3 y for cases) and 1902 participants from the Strong Heart Family Study (prospective design for analyses; mean age: 37 y; 39% male; median 12.5 y of follow-up).

We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic  or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant lipid accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of , when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac metabolic signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

Recent evidence has accumulated for roles of diet and the gut microbiome as environmental factors in blood pressure regulation. However, this is complex because gut microbiomes are a unique feature of each individual reflecting that individual's developmental and environmental history creating caveats for both experimental models and human studies. Here, we describe guidelines for conducting gut microbiome studies in experimental and clinical hypertension. We provide a complete guide for authors on proper design, analyses, and reporting of gut microbiota/microbiome and metabolite studies and checklists that can be used by reviewers and editors to support robust reporting and interpretation. We discuss factors that modulate the gut microbiota in animal (eg, cohort, controls, diet, developmental age, housing, sex, and models used) and human studies (eg, blood pressure measurement and medication, body mass index, demographic characteristics including age, cultural identification, living structure, sex and socioeconomic environment, and exclusion criteria). We also provide best practice advice on sampling, storage of fecal/cecal samples, DNA extraction, sequencing methods (including metagenomics and 16S rRNA), and computational analyses. Finally, we discuss the measurement of short-chain fatty , metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, and interpretation of data.

It is heterogeneous; arising from five circulating glycoproteins with dynamic concentrations: alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), alpha-1- glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin (HP), transferrin (TF), and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT). The contributions of each glycoprotein to the disease and mortality risks predicted by GlycA remain unknown.We trained imputation models for AAT, AGP, HP, and TF from NMR metabolite measurements in 626 adults from a population cohort with matched NMR and immunoassay data. Levels of AAT, AGP, and HP were estimated in 11,861 adults from two population cohorts with eight years of follow-up, then each biomarker was tested for association with all common endpoints. Whole blood gene expression data was used to identify cellular processes associated with elevated AAT.Accurate imputation models were obtained for AAT, AGP, and HP but not for TF. While AGP had the strongest correlation with GlycA, our analysis revealed variation in imputed AAT levels was the most predictive of morbidity and mortality for the widest range of diseases over the eight year follow-up period, including heart failure (meta-analysis hazard ratio = 1.60 per standard deviation increase of AAT, P-value = 1×10-10), influenza and pneumonia (HR = 1.37, P = 6×10-10), and liver diseases (HR = 1.81, P = 1×10-6).

In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty  (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body fat and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA metabolism.

But the association between serum total fatty  (TFAs, free fatty  plus esterified fatty ) and T2D has not been reported.Serum esterified fatty  were hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions, and serum TFAs were extracted after acidizing. Fourteen of serum TFAs in 1,828 serum samples, including 543 controls, 655 prediabetes, and 630 T2D patients, were simultaneously quantified based on the calibration curves of 8 fatty  using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR MS).Correlation analysis revealed strong correlations among serum TFAs and ratios of the TFAs in T2D patients compared with controls or prediabetes both in males and females. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that a panel including fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1c, gamma-glutamyltransferase, triglyceride, C18:1, and C20:3, has an good capability to distinguish prediabetes from T2D, with the sensitivity of 87.0%, the specificity of 91.0%, and the area under curve (AUC) of 0.96.In this study, rapid, absolute, and simultaneous quantification of serum TFAs was performed using MALDI-FTICR MS.

AChIR was measured in vitro in aortic rings, with/without L-NAME, MS-PPOH, HET0016 or indomethacin. mRNA expression of eNOS, iNOS, COX-1, COX-2, thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1), CYP4A1, CYP4A3 and CYP2J3 was assessed by qPCR. Systemic oxidative stress and plasma antioxidative capacity were determined with the thiobarbituric -reactive substances (TBARS) and the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays, respectively. There was no significant difference in AChIR among experimental groups of rats. In CTR and DM group of rats, AChIR was mediated by NO and EETs pathway, while in the CTR+HBO and DM+HBO groups, NO-pathway prevailed. iNOS expression was upregulated in the DM group compared to CTR, while HBO2 upregulated eNOS in CTR group and TBXAS1 in DM group of rats. In both, CTR and DM group of rats, the sensitivity to ACh in the presence of L-NAME or in the presence of MSPPOH was significantly decreased compared to the response to ACh in the absence or presence of indomethacin or HET0016. DM and DM+HBO rats had increased TBARS compared to their respective controls. In conclusion, HBO2 presumably alters vasorelaxation in response to ACh from NO-EETs mediated pathways to solely NO-pathway, without affecting oxidative status of DM rats.Copyright© Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634866>DNA methylation analysis of negative pressure therapy effect in diabetic foot ulcers.</a></h2><p>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been used to treat diabetic foot ulcerations (DFUs). Its action on the molecular level, however, is only partially understood. Some earlier data suggested NPWT may be mediated through modification of local gene expression. As methylation is a key epigenetic regulatory mechanism of gene expression, we assessed the effect of NPWT on its profile in patients with type 2  (T2DM) and neuropathic non-infected DFUs.Of 36 included patients, 23 were assigned to NPWT and 13 to standard therapy. Due to ethical concerns, the assignment was non-randomized and based on wound characteristics. Tissue samples were obtained before and 8±1 days after therapy initiation. DNA methylation patterns were checked by Illumina Methylation EPIC kit.In terms of clinical characteristics, the groups presented typical features of T2DM; however, the NPWT group had significantly greater wound area: 16.8 cm2 vs. 1.4 cm2 (p=0.0003). Initially only one region at chromosome 5 was differentially methylated. After treatment, 57 differentially methylated genes were found, mainly located on chromosomes 6 (chr6p21) and 20 (chr20p13); they were associated with DNA repair and autocrine signaling via retinoic  receptor. We performed differential analyses pre-treatment and post-treatment. The analysis revealed 426 differentially methylated regions in the NPWT group, but none in the control group. The enrichment analysis showed 11 processes significantly associated with NPWT, of which 4 were linked with complement system activation. All but one were hypermethylated after NPWT.The NPWT effect on DFUs may be mediated through epigenetic changes resulting in inhibition of complement system activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653354>Impact of Elevated Serum Uric  Level on Target Lesion Revascularization After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Chronic Total Occlusion.</a></h2><p>Elevated serum uric  (SUA) level is reportedly associated with subsequent cardiovascular events including revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the impact of SUA level on revascularization in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO), one of the highest risk subsets in coronary artery disease, is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of SUA level on target lesion revascularization (TLR) in contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO. A total of 165 patients who underwent successful PCI with new-generation drug-eluting stent for CTO under intravascular ultrasound guidance were included. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the tertiles of SUA level at baseline. Coronary angiography was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, and gray-scale intravascular ultrasound was also analyzed. The primary end point was TLR. The tertiles of SUA level were as follows: low tertile, ≤5.2 mg/dl; intermediate tertile, 5.3 to 6.4 mg/dl; and high tertile, ≥6.5 mg/dl. During a median follow-up of 34 months, TLR was observed in 5 patients (8.8%) in the low tertile, in 5 (9.4%) in the intermediate tertile, and in 14 (25.5%) in the high tertile (p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of TLR in patients with high tertile than the low and intermediate groups. Multivariable analysis showed SUA ≥6.5 mg/dl, , and longer CTO length as independent predictors of TLR. In conclusion, in patients who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent, elevated SUA level was associated with TLR after successful recanalization of CTO.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Insulin resistant adipose tissues contain higher levels of insulin than the physiological level, as well as higher amounts of intracellular tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other cytokines. However, the mechanism of insulin resistance remains poorly understood. To better understand the roles played by insulin and TNF-α in insulin resistance, we performed proteomic analysis of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin (Ins), TNF-α (TNF), and both (Ins + TNF). Out of the 693 proteins identified, the abundances of 78 proteins were significantly different ( < 0.05). Carnitine parmitoyltransferase-2 (CPT2), acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACCAC-1), ethylmalonyl CoA decarboxylase (ECHD1), and methylmalonyl CoA isomerase (MCEE), enzymes required for fatty  β-oxidation and respiratory electron transport, and β-glucuronidase, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, were down-regulated in all the treatment groups, compared to the control group. In contrast, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and glutathione reductase, which are the proteins responsible for cytoskeletal structure, protein folding, degradation, and oxidative stress responses, were up-regulated. This suggests higher oxidative stress in cells treated with Ins, TNF, or both.

It features among the top 10 causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of complications in  and within this, heart failure has been shown to be the leading cause of emergency admissions in the United Kingdom. There are many hypotheses and well-evidenced mechanisms by which diabetic cardiomyopathy as an entity develops. This review aims to give an overview of these mechanisms, with particular emphasis on metabolic inflexibility. T2D is associated with inefficient substrate utilisation, an inability to increase glucose metabolism and dependence on fatty  oxidation within the diabetic heart resulting in mitochondrial uncoupling, glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and initially subclinical cardiac dysfunction and finally in overt heart failure. The review also gives a concise update on developments within clinical imaging, specifically cardiac magnetic resonance studies to characterise and phenotype early cardiac dysfunction in T2D. A better understanding of the pathophysiology involved provides a platform for targeted therapy in  to prevent the development of early heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.©The Author(s) 2019.

From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with  diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic  decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1  (T1DM), latent autoimmune  in adults (LADA) and type 2  (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American  Association, Immunology of  Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese  Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for insulin resistance, the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of , age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher insulin resistance in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634052>Metabolomics-Based Prospective Studies and Prediction of Type 2  Risks.</a></h2><p>The preceding decade has witnessed an intense upsurge in the diabetic population across the world making type 2  (T2DM) more of an epidemic than a lifestyle disease. Metabolic disorders are often latent for a while before becoming clinically evident, thus reinforcing the pursuit of early biomarkers of metabolic alterations. A prospective study along with metabolic profiling is the most appropriate way to detect the early pathophysiological changes in metabolic diseases such as T2DM. The aim of this review was to summarize the different potential biomarkers of T2DM identified in prospective studies, which used tools of metabolomics. The review also demonstrates on how metabolomic profiling-based prospective studies can be used to address a concern like population-specific disease mechanism. We performed a literature search on metabolomics-based prospective studies on T2DM using the key words "metabolomics," "Type 2 ," "", "metabolite profiling," "prospective study," "metabolism," and "biomarker." Additional articles that were obtained from the reference lists of the articles obtained using the above key words were also examined. Articles on dietary intake, type 1 , and gestational  were excluded. The review revealed that many studies showed a direct association of branched-chain amino  and an inverse association of glycine with T2DM. Majority of the prospective studies conducted were targeted metabolomics-based, with Caucasians as their study cohort. The whole disease risk in populations, including Asians, could therefore not be identified.

It is distributed widely in the Central and East Anatolia. This study was carried out for evaluation of the antioxidant activity, enzyme inhibition effect, elemental and phenolic content of A. schischkinii. Briefly, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-glycosidase (α-Gly), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes were strongly inhibited by A. schischkinii. IC values for AChE, BChE, α-Gly, and GST enzymes were found as 19.3 mg/mL, 15.4 mg/mL, 69.3 mg/mL, and 34.7 mg/mL respectively. The antioxidant activity of the sample was evaluated by four different in vitro bioanalytical methods. Besides, the concentrations of twelve elements in A. schischkinii were analyzed by ICP-MS technique. Zn (50.6 ppm), Mn (23.0 ppm), and Cu (12.7 ppm) were found as major elements. Furthermore, catechin (20.8 µg/mg extract), trans-ferulic  (18.3 µg/mg extract), and gallic  (11.2 µg/mg extract) were characterized as major phenolic compounds by using HPLC.

Diuretics in current use (and the year of their approval for use in the United States) include chlorothiazide (1958), hydrochlorothiazide (1959), bendroflumethiazide (1959), spironolactone (1960), chlorthalidone (1960), methychlothiazide (1961), polythiazide (1961), triamterene (1964), furosemide (1966), ethacrynic  (1967), metolazone (1973), bumetanide (1983), indapamide (1983), amiloride (1986), acetazolamide (1986), torsemide (1993), and eplerenone (2002). Diuretics are typically classified as thiazide diuretics (bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, metolazone and polythiazide), loop diuretics (bumetanide, ethacrynic , furosemide, and torsemide), and potassium-sparing agents (amiloride, eplerenone, spironolactone, and triamterene). The carbonic anhydrase blockers acetazolamide (1986) and methazolamide (1959) are also diuretics, but are more commonly used for the therapy of glaucoma. Diuretics are some of the most frequently used medications in medicine and are usually well tolerated. Common side effects are those that are caused by the diuresis and mineral loss such as weakness, dizziness, electrolyte imbalance, low sodium and potassium. Diuretics have not been associated with an appreciable increased rate of serum aminotransferase elevations and have rarely been associated with clinically apparent liver injury. Isolated case reports of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity due to diuretics have been published, but there have been virtually no case series on individual diuretics or even whole class of drugs. The case reports that have been published provide only a very general pattern of injury that has not provided a clear clinical signature or suggestion that hepatotoxicity is a class effect among the thiazides and the loop diuretics. Switching from one diuretic to another has not been reported in any systematic fashion. Most information on hepatotoxicity is available on the commonly used diuretics which include (and the number of prescriptions filled in 2007 for each): hydrochlorothiazide (45 million), furosemide (37 million), triamterene (21 million), spironolactone (8 million), and metolazone, bumetanide, indapamide and torsemide (1 to 2 million each). Diuretics implicated in rare cases of drug induced liver injury include hydrochlorothiazide, acetazolamide, amiloride, spironolactone and triamterene.

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, diagnosed mental illnesses, obesity, , diagnosed bowel conditions, exclusion diets, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, and those lacking dietary autonomy. The primary outcome measure is a between-group difference in alpha diversity in infant stool collected 4 weeks after birth. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in influencing infant and maternal stool microbial composition and short chain fatty  concentrations, epigenetic profile, and markers of inflammation and stress, as well as changes in maternal dietary intake and well-being. The study and intervention feasibility and acceptance will also be evaluated as secondary outcomes.The study results are yet to be written. The first participant was enrolled on July 28, 2016, and the final follow-up assessment was completed on October 11, 2017.Data from this study will provide new insights regarding the ability of interventions targeting the perinatal diet to alter the maternal and infant gut microbiota. If this intervention is proven, our findings will support larger studies aiming to guide the assembly of gut microbiota in early life.Australian Clinical Trials Registration Number ACTRN12616000936426; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370939.DERR1-10.2196/14771.©Samantha L L.

Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic  has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-; however, the effects of this triterpene on liver function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic  (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre- rat model.Pre- was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/liver weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and liver damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre--related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634961>Downregulation of miR-320 Alleviates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Inflammatory Response in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs serve important roles in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs). This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-320 (miR-320) in the development of ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The adipose tissue expression levels of miR-320 and ERs markers (GRP78, GRP94, Derlin-1 and CHOP) and the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-6) in obese patients were evaluated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The correlation of miR-320 with genes involved in ERs and inflammation was analyzed. The effects of miR-320 on ERs and inflammation were explored using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were pretreated with palmitic  (PA).ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were all upregulated in obese patients. Adipose tissue miR-320 expression was also increased in obese patients, and had positive correlations with the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines. After PA treatment, the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were elevated significantly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, miR-320 expression was increased in the cells under ERs status. The upregulation of miR-320 could enhance the expression of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines, but the downregulation of miR-320 resulted in the opposite results.The data of this study indicate that miR-320 expression is upregulated in ERs status, and the downregulation of miR-320 ameliorates ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We consider that the approaches to decrease miR-320 expression may be novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643243>Chenodiol (Chenodeoxycholic ).</a></h2><p>Chenodeoxycholic  (chenodiol) is a primary bile , synthesized in the liver and present in high concentrations in bile that is used therapeutically to dissolve cholesterol gallstones.

Under physiologic conditions, there is a distinct and finely tuned balance between the utilization of these substrates. Using the non-ischemic heart as an example, we discuss that upon stress this substrate balance is upset resulting in an over-reliance on either fatty  or glucose, and that chronic fuel shifts towards a single type of substrate appear to be linked with cardiac dysfunction. These observations suggest that interventions aimed at re-balancing a tilted substrate preference towards an appropriate mix of substrates may result in restoration of cardiac contractile performance. Examples of manipulating cellular substrate uptake as a means to re-balance fuel supply, being associated with mended cardiac function underscore this concept. We also address the molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent need for a fatty -glucose fuel balance. We propose that re-balancing cellular fuel supply, in particular with respect to fatty  and glucose, may be an effective strategy to treat the failing heart.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino  transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

Indeed, several commonly used anticonvulsants (phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine) are consistently ranked in the top causes of clinically apparent drug induced liver injury and are frequently listed in causes of drug induced acute liver failure. Because of the importance of pharmacotherapy of epilepsy, the potential hepatotoxicity of these agents has been considered acceptable. Nevertheless, attempts at developing safer agents of equivalent or superior efficacy continue. Major anticonvulsants include hydantoin derivatives, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, succinimides, valproic , gamma amino butyric  (GABA) precursors and analogues, inhibitors of DMDA receptors and a multitude of miscellaneous recently introduced agents. At least two dozen agents are licensed and approved for use as anticonvulsants in the United States. The anticonvulsants that are available in the United States, the likelihood score for hepatotoxicity, their year of introduction or approval and their major approved indications are shown in the Table which includes links to the individual agents with the full description and discussion of their potential for hepatiotoxicity. Phenobarbital is the oldest antiepileptic medication still in use, having been introduced into clinical medicine in 1916. Phenobarbital is an aromatic anticonvulsant and, like phenytoin and carbamazepine, can cause the aromatic anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, a form of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Questions remain regarding the anticonvulsant efficacy of phenobarbital and it is now rarely used for this indication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637675>High uric , reduced glomerular filtration rate and non-alcoholic fatty liver in young people with obesity.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the association between high uric  (UA), reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in outpatient children and adolescents with overweight (OW) or obesity (OB).Anthropometric, biochemical, hepatic ultrasound and eGFR data were available from 2565 young people with OW/OB (age 5-18 years). eGFR was calculated using the Schwartz's bedside formula and reduced eGFR (ReGFR) was defined by a value < 90 mL/min/1.73 m. High UA was defined as ≥ 75th percentile by sex in children and adolescents.The population was stratified in four categories: (1) normal eGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 1,236); (2) ReGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 155); (3) normal eGFR and presence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 1019); (4) presence of both conditions (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 155). Proportions of youth with high UA across the four categories were 17%, 30%, 33% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Young people with high levels of UA had odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.43-3.11) for ReGFR; 2.82 (2.26-3.45) for NAFLD; and 5.04 (3.45-7.39) for both conditions (P < 0.0001 for all), independently of major confounders.High levels of UA were independently associated with ReGFR, NAFLD and the combination of both conditions in young people with OW/OB.

Severe immunosuppressive treatments are necessary, however, to prevent rejection of the transplanted islets. Novel approaches therefore have focused on encapsulation of the islets in biomaterial implants which can protect the islets and offer an organ-like environment. Vascularization of the device's surface is a prerequisite for the survival and proper functioning of transplanted pancreatic islets. We are pursuing a prevascularization strategy by incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) loaded microspheres in 3D-printed poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based devices prior to their prospective loading with transplanted cells. Microspheres (∼ 50 μm) were based on poly(ε-caprolactone-PEG-ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(L-lactide) multi-block copolymers and were loaded with 10 μg VEGF/mg microspheres, and subsequently dispersed in a hyaluronic  carrier liquid. In vitro release studies at 37°C demonstrated continuous release of fully bioactive VEGF for four weeks. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that incorporation of VEGF-releasing microspheres ensures adequate release of VEGF for a time window of four weeks, which is attractive in view of the vascularization of artificial pancreas implants.Copyright © 2019.

Yet, these relationships are based on studies that relied on estimated GFR (eGFR), estimates of insulin sensitivity, or both. We aimed to verify the relationship between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic function by gold standard methods in adults with T2D.Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value) (glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min) and renal hemodynamic function by urinary inulin (GFR) and para-aminohippuric  (effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) clearances in participants with T2D without overt kidney disease. Filtration fraction (FF) (GFR/ERPF) was calculated. Relationships between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic parameters were examined by multivariable linear regression. Renal hemodynamic parameters were examined across tertiles of M values.We tested 44 adults with T2D, of whom 77% were male, with mean ± SD age 63 ± 7 years, BMI 31.2 ± 4.0 kg/m, and HbA 7.4 ± 0.6%. Average GFR was 110 ± 26 mL/min, with an FF of 22.1 ± 2.8% and median 24-h urinary albumin excretion of 11.3 mg (interquartile range 5.8-17.0). Average M value was 5.6 ± 2.9 mg/kg ⋅ min. Insulin sensitivity inversely correlated with GFR ( = -0.44,  < 0.01) and FF ( = -0.40,  < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after multivariable adjustments for age, sex, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use, and HbA. In addition, GFR, FF, and urinary albumin excretion were highest in the participants in the lowest M value tertile.For the first time, we demonstrate that impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction by gold standard techniques in adults with T2D treated with metformin monotherapy.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673803>Glucocorticoids preserve the t-tubular system in ventricular cardiomyocytes by upregulation of autophagic flux.</a></h2><p>A major contributor to contractile dysfunction in heart failure is remodelling and loss of the cardiomyocyte transverse tubular system (t-system), but underlying mechanisms and signalling pathways remain elusive. It has been shown that dexamethasone promotes t-tubule development in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and that cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout (GRKO) leads to heart failure. Here, we studied if the t-system is altered in GRKO hearts and if GR signalling is required for t-system preservation in adult cardiomyocytes. Confocal and 3D STED microscopy of myocardium from cardiomyocyte-specific GRKO mice revealed decreased t-system density and increased distances between ryanodine receptors (RyR) and L-type Ca channels (LTCC). Because t-system remodelling and heart failure are intertwined, we investigated the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Ventricular cardiomyocytes from failing human and healthy adult rat hearts cultured in the absence of glucocorticoids (CTRL) showed distinctively lower t-system density than cells treated with dexamethasone (EC 1.1 nM) or corticosterone. The GR antagonist mifepristone abrogated the effect of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone improved RyR-LTCC coupling and synchrony of intracellular Ca release, but did not alter expression levels of t-system-associated proteins junctophilin-2 (JPH2), bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) or caveolin-3 (CAV3). Rather, dexamethasone upregulated LC3B and increased autophagic flux. The broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine prevented dexamethasone-induced upregulation of autophagy and t-system preservation, and autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A and chloroquine accelerated t-system loss. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or amino  starvation preserved the t-system. These findings suggest that GR signalling and autophagy are critically involved in t-system preservation and remodelling in the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649547>Mitophagy in Hepatic Insulin Resistance: Therapeutic Potential and Concerns.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by central obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease, type 2 , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic diseases. It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty  accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty  β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669668>Protective efficacy of Tinospora sinensis against streptozotocin induced pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its phytochemical profiles.</a></h2><p>Tinospora sinensis Lour.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2  (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty  and arachidonic  (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins.

A clinical pharmacist and physician independently reviewed the charts, extracted data, and rated the preventability of each adverse drug event. A third reviewer adjudicated all discordant or uncertain cases. We calculated the proportion of adverse drug events that were deemed preventable, performed multivariable logistic regression to explore the characteristics of patients with preventable events, and identified contributing factors.We reviewed the records of 1,356 adverse drug events in 1,234 patients. Raters considered 869 (64.1%) of adverse drug events probably or definitely preventable. Patients with mental health diagnoses (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5) and  (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4) were more likely to present with preventable events. The medications most commonly implicated in preventable events were warfarin (9.4%), hydrochlorothiazide (4.5%), furosemide (4.0%), insulin (3.9%) and acetylsalicylic  (2.7%). Common contributing factors included inadequate patient instructions, monitoring and follow-up, and reassessments after medication changes had been made.Our study suggests that patients with mental health conditions and  require close monitoring.

For this purpose, chitin-based structures from marine sponges are very promising substitutes. Marine sponges from the order Verongiida (class Demospongiae) are typical examples of demosponges with well-developed chitinous skeletons. In particular, species belonging to the family Ianthellidae possess chitinous, flat, fan-like fibrous skeletons with a unique, microporous 3D architecture that makes them particularly interesting for applications. In this work, we focus our attention on the demosponge  (Linnaeus, 1759) for simultaneous extraction of both naturally occurring ("ready-to-use") chitin scaffolds, and biologically active bromotyrosines which are recognized as potential antibiotic, antitumor, and marine antifouling substances. We show that selected bromotyrosines are located within pigmental cells which, however, are localized within chitinous skeletal fibers of . A two-step reaction provides two products: treatment with methanol extracts the bromotyrosine compounds bastadin 25 and araplysillin-I N20 sulfamate, and a subsequent treatment with acetic  and sodium hydroxide exposes the 3D chitinous scaffold. This scaffold is a mesh-like structure, which retains its capillary network, and its use as a potential drug delivery biomaterial was examined for the first time. The results demonstrate that sponge-derived chitin scaffolds, impregnated with decamethoxine, effectively inhibit growth of the human pathogen  in an agar diffusion assay.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666833>Normalization of heart rate variability with taurine and meldonium complex in post-infarction patients with type 2 .</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study is to scrutiny the Dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with PICS with 2nd type DM against the background of Taurine (TN) and meldonium (ME).

An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 cases of active tuberculosis occur yearly in the United States and account for at least 600 deaths annually. Worldwide, tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, ranking among the top five most fatal infectious diseases. The modern era of antituberculosis medications began in 1944 with the development of streptomycin for which Selman Waksman received the Nobel Prize. Subsequently, more potent agents with wider activity and better tolerability were developed including p-aminosalicylic  (PAS) in 1949, isoniazid in 1952, pyrazinamide in 1954, ethambutol in 1962, rifampin in 1963 and cycloserine in 1964. The development of chemotherapy for tuberculosis is one of the great achievements of biomedical research in the 20th Century. Importantly, however, the major first line antituberculosis medications have hepatotoxic potential, including clinically apparent acute liver disease as well as acute liver failure and death or need for emergency liver transplantation. Furthermore, combination therapy which is required for the therapy of active tuberculosis appears to be associated with a higher rate of hepatotoxicity than occurs with the individual agents by themselves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643709>Thiazolidinediones.</a></h2><p>The thiazolidinediones are a relatively new family of agents for type 2  that act by increasing insulin sensitivity through a unique mechanism of engagement of the so-called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR-γ. Attachment of ligand to the PPAR-γ receptor activates a series of genes that are involved in glucose and fatty  metabolism, the overall effect being an increase in insulin effect. The thiazolidinediones reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2  and act additively with other antidiabetic medications. Troglitazone was the first thiazolidinedione that received approval for use in the United States (January 1997). However, within a year of its approval, reports of severe liver injury and deaths from acute liver failure began to appear. Cautionary statements and recommendations for monitoring of ALT levels were made, but after more than two dozen reports of hepatic failure and the introduction of two new thiazolidinediones in 1999, troglitazone was withdrawn from use in 2000. The newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been associated with only rare instances of acute liver injury. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are linked to increased weight gain, heart failure and fracture risk and they are considered second-line agents for type 2  and recommended only after failure of metformin and lifestyle modifications. All references on hepatotoxicity of the thiazolidinediones are given together at the end of this Overview section (updated June 2018).

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic  Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and ), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644099>Sulfasalazine.</a></h2><p>Sulfasalazine is an antiinflammatory agent used extensively in chronic, long term therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.

Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling pathways involved in metabolism, injury responses, adaption, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino  which often makes the protein or enzyme "active". The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) tyrosine, (2) serine-theonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino  specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor. Inhibitors of these kinases are called protein kinase receptor inhibitors. Other kinases are intracellular and take part in cell signaling. These kinases can be targeted by "non-receptor" protein kinases. Finally, some kinase inhibitors have specificity for multiple kinases and are called "multi-kinase inhibitors." Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases. The protein kinases can be categorized based upon the amino  that they phosphorylate: either serine, threonine or tyrosine. The tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors were the initial and are perhaps the best characterized kinase inhibitors. The protein kinase inhibitors are relatively recently developed agents, all having been introduced since 2001. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use in the United States was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) that is created by the specific translocation that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib is a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase. The introduction of this first protein kinase inhibitor was followed by more than a dozen others within the next 10 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of  and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats.

Many of these are mixtures of herbs and the composition can vary considerably despite an identical name. In other instances, the composition of the herbal mixture is totally unknown. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines are widely used in Asian communities throughout the world for a broad array of conditions. Many of these are harmless or have only minor and transient adverse effects. A few can cause hepatic injury when given in high concentrations, and some even when used in recommended doses.When evidence of liver injury arises in a patient taking a traditional herbal medication, the appropriate response is to stop the agent and attempt to identify its nature and components. A major problem is that multiple herbs are often being taken and their exact nature and even name may not be known. The herbal products are often poorly labeled as to their composition and they may be mislabeled or contaminated with toxins, bacteria, metals or even conventional, synthetic or semisynthetic medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, corticosteroids, fibrates, or statins. It is helpful to collect the residual pills or extract as they may be helpful if identification is necessary. Characterization of the clinical phenotype or pattern of hepatic injury is also helpful in identifying the specific agent causing the injury. For instance, comfrey and plant pyrrolizidine alkaloids are typically associated with acute sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, whereas germander, greater celandine, usnic , Jin Bu Huan, Shou Wu Pian and Ma Huang (ephedra) present typically with an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome. Pennyroyal oil and Chi R Yun (Breynia) cause acute hepatic necrosis, often accompanied by signs and symptoms of injury to other organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys or central nervous system. Androgenic steroids cause bland cholestasis, characterized by deep jaundice and pruritus with minimal elevations in serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels. In all situations, other causes of acute liver injury need to be excluded.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile .</a></h2><p>Bile  are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile  act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile  are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile  synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile  are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile , predominantly deoxycholic  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile  are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile  are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile  are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile  by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile  also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile  can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile  (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile  that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile  are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile  can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile  can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile  are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile .

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with , atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO metabolism in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

We aimed to assess the long-term associations in a nationwide cohort. Overall 15,100 Chinese adults, aged ≥20 years, were included from China Health and Nutrition Survey. The cumulative averages of fish and marine omega-3 PUFA intakes were evaluated based on 3-day 24-h records. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of T2D risk. Overall 1017 T2D cases were documented over a median of 14 years of follow-up. Compared with non-fish consumers, low and moderate fish consumption were associated with higher T2D risk whereas high fish consumption was not associated. Multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for low and moderate fish consumption were 1.43 (1.09, 1.86) and 1.42 (1.07, 1.85) respectively in men, and were 1.58 (1.22, 2.02) and 1.39 (1.08, 1.83) respectively in women. In meat substitution analyses, low and moderate fish consumption was related to 55% and 69% higher T2D risk for men, and was associated with 68% and 54% higher T2D risk for women, respectively. Fried but not non-fried fish intake was associated with higher T2D risk. Intake of marine omega-3 PUFAs was dose-dependently associated with higher T2D risk for both men and women (P-trend<0.001). Overall low and moderate intakes of fish, especially fried fish, and marine omega-3 PUFAs were associated with higher T2D risk.

Although associated with side effects when systemically administered, biphosphonates (BPs) play a positive role in diabetic osteoporosis treatment. We hypothesized that local BP therapy would prevent decayed implant osseointegration under T2DM conditions. To assess cell proliferation and determine the optimal BP concentration, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were treated with BPs at various relatively low concentrations (10 mmol/L) for different periods of time. Our in vitro study results demonstrated that BP application reversed the process by which high glucose inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone resorption through osteoclast-specific gene and protein expression (P<0.05). In vivo, fat accumulation and insulin resistance were induced in T2DM rats. We used crosslinked hyaluronic  as the drug delivery vehicle for BPs to ensure that BPs administered at a dose of 30 µg/kg could settle into the prepared hole in rats. Thereafter, implants were inserted into cylindrical holes of a specific size, created parallel to the long axis of the femora. The outcomes of the in vivo study revealed that BPs promoted bone formation, which reversed the reduction in the DM group according to double fluorescence labeling, micro-CT, biomechanical and histomorphometric analyses (P<0.05). Furthermore, intergroup comparisons revealed significant correlation coefficients (P<0.05) between the micro-CT and biomechanical parameters. Therefore, local administration of BPs could stimulation bone remodeling and represent an effective treatment strategy for preventing decayed implant osseointegration under T2DM conditions.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644111>Folic .</a></h2><p>Folic  is a water soluble vitamin found in many foods and particularly in leafy green vegetables that is essential for the critical biosynthetic pathways involving transfer of methyl groups to organic compounds.

The impact of this therapy is limited due to tissue availability and dependence on immunosuppressive drugs that prevent immune rejection of the transplanted cells. These issues can be solved by encapsulating stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells in an immunoprotective device. However, encapsulation exacerbates ischemia, and the lack of vasculature at the implantation site post-transplantation worsens graft survival. Here, an encapsulation device that supplements nutrients to the cells is developed to improve the survival of encapsulated stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells in the poorly vascularized subcutaneous space. An internal compartment in the device is fabricated to provide zero-order release of alanine and glutamine for several weeks. The amino  reservoir sustains viability of insulin-producing cells in nutrient limiting conditions in vitro. Moreover, the reservoir also increases cell survival by 30% after transplanting the graft in the subcutaneous space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650545>Inhibition of glycosidase by ursolic : In vitro, in vivo and in silico study.</a></h2><p>Controlling the blood glucose level is an effective method to reduce type 2  and prevent -related complications. Ursolic  is a plant extract that can reduce postprandial hyperglycemia effectively. This study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect and interaction mechanism of ursolic  against α-amylase and α-glucosidase.In this study, the effect of ursolic  on glycosidase was studied in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ) of ursolic  on α-amylase and α-glucosidase was (0.482 ± 0.12) mg mL and (0.213 ± 0.042) mg mL , respectively. The results of enzymatic kinetics showed that ursolic  inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity in a noncompetitive manner. The fluorescence spectrum showed that the combination of ursolic  and glycosidase caused the intrinsic fluorescence quenching of glycosidase. The observation of starch granules revealed that the activity of α-amylase was inhibited and the hydrolysis of starch granules was prevented in the presence of ursolic . Molecular docking results showed that ursolic  bound to the inactive site of α-amylase and α-glucosidase through the formation of ursolic -glucosidase complex. Ursolic  interacted with α-amylase and α-glucosidase mainly through hydrogen bonding. The postprandial hypoglycemic effect of ursolic  in C57BL/6J mice showed that the high concentration of ursolic  could quickly reduce postprandial blood glucose level.Ursolic  can be considered as a natural ingredient in functional foods to control postprandial blood glucose levels and prevent  by delaying the digestion of starch in foods.

Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and immunity. The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic  and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for psoriasis and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal acetate) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section. The hepatotoxicity of vitamin A is discussed separately in another record.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643464>Clofibrate.</a></h2><p>Clofibrate is a fibric  derivative used in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze differences in plasma miRNAs levels in postmenopausal women and to simultaneously find novel extracellular miRNAs that are associated with variations in physical activities.We measured hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-30d-5p in a cohort of 149 postmenopausal women divided into subgroups based on the amount of physical activity by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Further, the correlation of plasma microRNAs with sit-to-stand performance was examined. DIANA web server was used to find which Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (P < 0.05) were regulated by miRNAs associated with physical activity and sit-to-stand performance.Plasma levels of hsa-miR-30d-5p were significantly (P = 0.015) lower in participants with higher physical activity, and a borderline trend for hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.06) was noticed. Higher plasma levels of hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.01) and hsa-miR-93-5p (P = 0.04) were observed in the group with reduced sit-to-stand performance. The two miRNAs seem to primarily regulate fatty  metabolism-related processes.Our results suggest that levels of selected cell-free miRNAs in postmenopausal women are associated with different physical activity regimes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630688>Dynamic derangement in amino  profile during and after a stroke-like episode in adult-onset mitochondrial disease: a case report.</a></h2><p>Maternally inherited  and deafness, and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes are examples of mitochondrial diseases that are relatively common in the adult population. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes are assumed to be associated with decreases in arginine and citrulline. Biomarkers, such as growth differentiation factor-15, were developed to assist in the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases.A 55-year-old Japanese man, an insulin user, presented after a loss of consciousness. A laboratory test showed diabetic ketoacidosis. He and his mother had severe hearing difficulty. Bilateral lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, the presence of seizure, and an elevated ratio of lactate to pyruvate, altogether suggested a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial DNA in our patient's peripheral blood was positive with a 3243A>G mutation, which is the most frequent cause of maternally inherited  and deafness, and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. As a result, maternally inherited  and deafness/mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes was diagnosed. We measured growth differentiation factor-15 and multiple amino  in his blood, longitudinally during and after the stroke-like episode. Growth differentiation factor-15 was increased to an immeasurably high level on the day of the stroke-like episode. Although his  improved with an increased dose of insulin, the growth differentiation factor-15 level gradually increased, suggesting that his mitochondrial insufficiency did not improve. Multiple amino  species, including arginine, citrulline, and taurine, showed a decreased level on the day of the episode and a sharp increase the next day. In contrast, the level of aspartic  increased to an extremely high level on the day of the episode, and decreased gradually thereafter.Growth differentiation factor-15 can be used not only for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, but as an indicator of its acute exacerbation. A stroke-like episode of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes reflects a drastic derangement of multiple amino . The involvement of aspartic  in the episodes should be explored in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683330>Hyperuricemia Inhibition Protects SD Rats Against Fructose-Induced Obesity Hypertension Via Modulation of Inflammation and Renin-Angiotensin System in Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>The present study was aimed to reveal the relationship between uric  and fructose-induced obesity hypertension and its mechanisms.A rat model with obesity hypertension was induced by a high-fructose diet. In the experiment I, the rats were fed with fructose for 8 wks along with allopurinol or benzbromarone at the beginning. In the experiment II, the rats were fed with fructose for 8 wks firstly. And then, these rats were treated with allopurinol or benzbromarone for additional 6 wks.Fructose-fed rats showed hyperuricemia, abdominal obesity hypertension and an activation in adipose renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Also, fructose-fed rats had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and more macrophages infiltrating in adipose tissue. In the experiment I, allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly reduced serum uric  at 8 wk. Adipose RAS overactivation, adipose inflammatory responses and the development of obesity hypertension were all effectively prevented by hyperuricemia inhibition. In the experiment II, 6-wk treatment with allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly decreased serum uric , downregulated adipose RAS, abolished adipose inflammation and improved obesity hypertension.In conclusion, urate-lowering therapy protects rats against fructose-induced obesity hypertension. The mechanisms appear to be via downregulated adipose RAS and reduced inflammation in adipose tissue.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644082>Betaine.</a></h2><p>Betaine is a modified amino  consisting of glycine with three methyl groups that serves as a methyl donor in several metabolic pathways and is used to treat the rare genetic causes of homocystinuria.

The role of -inositol as a lipotropic factor has been proven, in addition to its involvement as co-factors of enzymes and as messenger molecules in signal transduction. -inositol deficiency leads to intestinal lipodystrophy in animals and "inositol-less death" in some fungi. Of late, diverse uses of -inositol and its derivatives have been discovered in medicinal research. These compounds are used in the treatment of a variety of ailments from  to cancer, and continued research in this direction promises a new future in therapeutics. In different diseases, inositols implement different strategies for therapeutic actions such as tissue specific increase or decrease in inositol products, production of inositol phosphoglycans (IPGs), conversion of -inositol (MI) to D--inositol (DCI), modulation of signal transduction, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, etc. Though inositol pharmacology is a relatively lesser-known field, recent years of research has generated a critical mass of information on the subject.

The nucleoside analogues resemble naturally occurring nucleosides and act by causing termination of the nascent DNA chain. These agents are generally safe and well tolerated as they are used by the viral, but not human polymerases in DNA replication. Actually, nucleoside analogues are a large class of agents that include drugs for cancer (cytarabine, gemcitabine, mercaptopurine), rheumatologic diseases (azathioprine, allpurinol) and even bacterial infections (trimethoprim). The nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV infection are often referred to as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, they have activity against both DNA dependent and RNA dependent DNA polymerases. They are believed to inhibit viral replication by several mechanisms, either by competitive inhibition of the viral polymerase or by DNA chain termination. Many of the antiviral nucleoside analogues are blocked at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleic , which results in failure of elongation of the nascent DNA molecule. Other antiviral nucleoside analogues are negative enantiomers (L-forms: lamivudine, emtricitabine, telbivudine) of the natural (D-form) nucleosides and interfere with replication, partially because of steric hindrance when they are taken up by the viral polymerase or added to the DNA molecule. Nucleoside analogues that are phosphorylated at the 5’ site are often referred to as nucleotide analogues, but this distinction is artificial as these agents (tenofovir, adefovir) are also nucleoside analogues. These features of the structure of nucleoside analogues are important because of the danger that they might be used by human polymerases and incorporated into RNA or DNA, which is the basis of the serious toxicities of the nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues can cause liver injury by several mechanisms. Most characteristic is a mitochondrial type of hepatic injury that is probably caused by the nucleoside analogue becoming incorporated into or blocking mitochondrial DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial gamma polymerase, leading to a depletion of mitochondria or decrease in their function. Mitochondrial injury can affect multiple tissues thereby causing myopathy, neuropathy, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic injury. The hepatic injury is characterized by accumulation of lactic acidosis, microvesicular steatosis and hepatic synthetic failure (LASH). Serum aminotransferase levels may be minimally elevated and jaundice arises late. The most dramatic example of hepatic mitochondrial injury occurred with the drug fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analogue that was withdrawn after several fatalities due to hepatic failure, lactic acidosis and pancreatitis arising 2 to 3 months after initiation of therapy during phase 2 trials in humans. A similar, but rare and less dramatic and partially reversible hepatic mitochondrial injury has been linked to use of didanosine (dideoxyinosine: ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytine: ddC), stavudine (d4T) and less commonly to zidovudine (AZT).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643276>Antilipemic Agents.</a></h2><p>The lipid lowering agents are used to treat hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemias. These agents are some of the most frequently used medications in the United States. They are typically used long term and often in combination. The major effects of the lipid lowering drugs are in the lowering of serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels which are believed to predispose to atherosclerosis and its complications, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular ischemic stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Some of these agents also lower triglyceride levels and others may raise high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels which are believed to be protective against atherosclerosis. The medications for dyslipidemia can be grouped into five categories: fibrates, bile  resins, hydroxymethylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (known collectively as statins), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and miscellaneous agents. The bile  resins or sequestrants are the oldest and safest lipid lowering agents, but are less potent than other classes now available and are not always well tolerated. The bile  sequestrants are highly positively charged and bind to the negatively charged bile  in the intestine, inhibiting their lipid solubilizing activity and thus reducing cholesterol absorption. They also inhibit the reabsorption of bile  (absorption of which is typically 95%) and thus cause a contraction of the bile  pool, which leads to increased bile  synthesis that competes with cholesterol synthesis in the liver; this may also contribute to a lowering of cholesterol. Three bile  sequestrants are available in the United States: cholestyramine (Questran: 1973), colestipol (Colestid: 1977) and colesevelam (Welchol: 2000). These agents are also used for therapy of pruritus for their activity in lowering the “pruritogens” that accumulate in cholestatic forms of liver disease. The bile  resins are not absorbed and have not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Nevertheless, some bile  resins have been found to cause mild serum aminotransferase elevations, usually within the first months of starting therapy and without symptoms or serum bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase elevations. These serum enzyme elevations have been described most frequently after cholestyramine therapy. Fibrates are fibric  derivative agents and are used to lower plasma lipids and particularly triglyceride levels. Their mechanism of action is believed to be via activation of the hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), which regulate gene transcription of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and secretion. Three fibrates have been available and used in the United States: gemfibrozil (Lopid: 1981), fenofibrate (Lifibra, Tricor, Antara, Lipofen, Trigilde: 1993), and clofibrate (Abitrate, Atromid-S: withdrawn 2002). All three have been associated with mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy that are typically transient, asymptomatic and may resolve even with continuation. Clofibrate has been withdrawn from use because of its side effects and lack of long term effect in reducing cardiovascular mortality. Gemfibrozil and fenofibrate remain in wide scale use. Fenofibrate has been most convincingly linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury, which can be severe and prolonged and lead to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644519>Serum uric  and fatal myocardial infarction: detection of prognostic cut-off values: The URRAH (Uric  Right for Heart Health) study.</a></h2><p>The Working Group on Uric  and Cardiovascular Risk of the Italian Society of Hypertension conceived and designed an ad-hoc study aimed at searching for prognostic cut-off values of serum uric  (SUA) in predicting fatal myocardial infaction (MI) in women and men.The URic  Right for heArt Health study is a nationwide, multicentre, observational cohort study involving data on individuals aged 18-95 years recruited on a regional community basis from all the territory of Italy under the patronage of the Italian Society of Hypertension with a mean follow-up period of 122.3 ± 66.9 months.A total of 23 467 individuals were included in the analysis.

In resource limited TB endemic settings, cure is declared through sputum smear examination for  fast bacilli without performing culture. This may lead to erroneous treatment outcomes as viable bacteria may be missed due to the low sensitivity of direct smear method. The aim of this study was to investigate if sterilizing cure is achieved among the new pulmonary TB cases declared cured by sputum smear conversion and to evaluate the impact of addition of ethambutol in the continuation phase in achieving it.New sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients registered at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from November 2013 to March 2014 were followed under standard Directly Observed Treatment Short Course strategy for 6 months. Half of these patients received ethambutol in addition to isoniazid and rifampicin in the continuation phase. Sputum specimens were examined on microscopy at 2 months and at the end of treatment. Sputa of patients with negative direct smear examination at the end of treatment were cultured.Among 5746 TB suspects, 1595 were new sputum smear positive pulmonary TB cases, and 533 were registered at our hospital. Among these, 504 converted sputum negative at 2 months and 348 converted at the end of 6 months of treatment and were declared cured. Sputa of 204/348 patients were cultured, and 12/204 (6%) were culture-positive. Culture positivity at 6 months was not associated with bacterial load, smoking, , presence of cavities, history of contact with TB patients, age, sex, socioeconomic status, or addition of ethambutol in the continuation phase.Viable cultivable bacilli were detected in 6% of cured patients, which would have significant impact on the control of TB. This highlights the need for an inexpensive and accurate surrogate marker for culture as it is not feasible to perform culture in routine for monitoring treatment response in the low-resource settings.

These agents are also used for therapy of pruritus for their activity in lowering the “pruritogens” that accumulate in cholestatic forms of liver disease. The bile  resins are not absorbed and thus have not been linked to clinically apparent drug induced liver injury. They have the potential to bind to vitamins, hormones or medications in the intestine and result in subtherapeutic serum levels. The bile  resins have not been associated with clinically apparent acute liver injury, which is probably because of their lack of absorption. For unexplained reasons, however, therapy with these agents is associated with a low rate of mild (1 to 3 fold) serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase elevations which are self-limited and not associated with symptoms or jaundice and resolve rapidly with stopping therapy.

We examined the effect of GH on the expression of lipolytic regulators in adipose tissue (AT).In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, nine men were examined after injection of 1) a GH bolus and 2) a GH-receptor antagonist (pegvisomant) followed by four AT biopsies. In a second study, eight men were examined in a 2 × 2 factorial design including GH infusion and 36-h fasting with AT biopsies obtained during a basal period and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Expression of GH-signaling intermediates and lipolytic regulators were studied by PCR and western blotting. In addition, mechanistic experiments in mouse models and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were performed.The GH bolus increased circulating free fatty  (p < 0.0001) together with phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) (p < 0.0001) and mRNA expression of the STAT5-dependent genes cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) and IGF-1 in AT. This was accompanied by suppressed mRNA expression of G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) (p = 0.007) and fat specific protein 27 (FSP27) (p = 0.002) and upregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA expression (p = 0.03). Suppression of G0S2 was also observed in humans after GH infusion and fasting, as well as in GH transgene mice, and in vitro studies suggested MEK-PPARγ signaling to be involved.GH-induced lipolysis in human subjects in vivo is linked to downregulation of G0S2 and FSP27 and upregulation of PTEN in AT. Mechanistically, in vitro data suggest that GH acts via MEK to suppress PPARγ-dependent transcription of G0S2. ClinicalTrials.gov and .Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Obesity and overweight are closely related to metabolic diseases and . However, the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of GDM remains to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of vitamin D (VD) levels, VD receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression with GDM in overweight or obese women.One hundred and forty pregnant women with full-term single-birth cesarean-section were selected as the study subjects and grouped (70 GDM women, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group G1] and 35 women with overweight or obesity [group G2]; 70 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group N1] and 35 overweight/obese women [group N2]). The levels of serum VD, blood biochemistry, and adiponectin were compared in these women. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was isolated from the abdominal wall incision. VDR and PPARγ messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels in these adipose tissues were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The differences between the levels of PPARγ protein and phosphorylated PPARγ Ser273 were detected by Western blotting.The serum VD level of GDM women was lower in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (G1 vs. N1: 20.62 ± 7.87 ng/mL vs. 25.85 ± 7.29 ng/mL, G2 vs. N2: 17.06 ± 6.74 ng/mL vs. 21.62 ± 7.18 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and the lowest in overweight/obese GDM women. VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression was higher in the adipose tissues of GDM women in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (VDR mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 210.00 [90.58-311.46] vs. 89.34 [63.74-159.92], G2 vs. N2: 298.67 [170.84-451.25] vs. 198.28 [119.46-261.23], PPARγ mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 100.72 [88.61-123.87] vs. 87.52 [66.37-100.04], G2 vs. N2: 117.33 [100.08-149.00] vs. 89.90 [76.95-109.09], P < 0.05), and their expression was the highest in GDM + overweight/obese women. VDR mRNA levels positively correlated with the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), pre-delivery BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and PPARγ mRNA while it negatively correlated with the VD and the adiponectin levels (r = 0.395, 0.336, 0.240, 0.190, 0.235, -0.350, -0.294, respectively, P < 0.05). The degree of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation increased in obese and GDM pregnant women. PPARγ mRNA levels positively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-delivery BMI, FBG, HOMA-IR, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty , and VDR mRNA, while it negatively correlated with the VD and adiponectin levels (r = 0.276, 0.199, 0.210, 0.230, 0.182, 0.214, 0.270, 0.235, -0.232, -0.199, respectively, P < 0.05).Both GDM and overweight/obese women had decreased serum VD levels and up-regulated VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which was further higher in the overweight or obese women with GDM. VD may regulate the formation and differentiation of adipocytes through the VDR and PPARγ pathways and participate in the occurrence of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643261>Gemfibrozil.</a></h2><p>Gemfibrozil is a fibric  derivative used in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia.

However, it remains unknown whether and how exosomes mediate the release of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome products such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) from endothelial cells. The present study hypothesized that lysosomal  ceramidase (AC) determines the fate of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to control the exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products during hyperglycemia. Using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced  mouse model, we found that endothelium-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1/EC) significantly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in coronary arterial ECs (CECs). These mice also had increased thickening of the coronary arterial wall and reduced expression of tight junction protein compared to wild-type (WT/WT) littermates. We also observed the expression of exosome markers such as CD63 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was augmented in STZ-treated Asah1/EC mice compared to WT/WT mice, which was accompanied by an increased IL-1β release of exosomes. In the primary cultures of CECs, we demonstrated that AC deficiency markedly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, but significantly down-regulated tight junction proteins when these cells were exposed to high levels of glucose. The CECs from Asah1/EC mice had decreased MVB-lysosome interaction and increased IL-1β-containing exosome release in response to high glucose stimulation. Together, these results suggest that AC importantly controls exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products in CECs, which is enhanced by AC deficiency leading to aggravated arterial inflammatory response during hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Human mercaptoalbumin (HMA) and human non-mercaptoalbumin (HNA) are expected to become markers of oxidative stress, but the stability of HMA/HNA has been problematic. We investigated the conditions for stabilizing HMA/HNA and found that HMA/HNA was stable at room temperature for 25 h if whole blood samples were mixed with a citrate buffer so that the citric  concentration after mixing was 70 mM or higher and the pH of the added buffer was less than pH 6.0. Whole blood samples were then collected under the above conditions, and the reference range for HNA was set at 21.8% ± 7.4% (HMA, 78.2% ± 7.4%) based on samples from 65 volunteers (28 males and 37 females; average age, 55.0 ± 13.8 years). The clinical usefulness of HMA/HNA as an oxidative stress marker should be clarified for specific pathological conditions using the previously reported, highly accurate measurement method under the conditions required for HMA/HNA stability.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644052>Hematologic Growth Factors.</a></h2><p>The hematologic growth factors (also called stimulating factors) are polypeptides that interact with cell surface receptors on hematologic progenitor cells causing their activation, proliferation and differentiation into mature circulating cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and platelets. Several recombinant hematologic growth factors or agonists for their receptors have been produced that are useful in treating anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with end stage renal disease or aplastic anemia or who have received cancer chemotherapy or a hematopoietic cell transplant. Most of the hematologic growth factors are recombinant polypeptides and have not been implicated in causing serum aminotransferase elevations or clinically apparent liver injury. A small molecule agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor (eltrombopag), however, has been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy, although not specifically to clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.  include epoetin (e poe’ e tin), which is a recombinant form of erythropoietin, the 165 amino  glycoprotein that induces red blood cell production from progenitors in the bone marrow. Erythropoietin is made in the kidneys and acts on progenitor erythroblasts through the erythropoietin receptor to cause proliferation and maturation into red cells. The major stimulus to erythropoietin synthesis is tissue hypoxia, but other factors modulate the response. Deficiency of erythropoietin is common in end stage renal disease and may also be present in premature infants and in patients with malignancies, chronic inflammation and cancer chemotherapy. Recombinant epoetin became available in the 1980’s and was shown to raise hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, as well as in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and patients with AIDS on drugs that cause anemia. Epoetin alfa was approved for use to treat anemia in patients with renal disease and receiving cancer chemotherapy in 1989 and is now widely used. Indications have broadened to include reduction of allogeneic red cell transfusion in patients undergoing elective surgery and it is used off-label for other forms of anemia associated with relative erythropoietin deficiency. Longer acting formulations are also available including darbepoetin and peginesatide.  increase white blood counts including neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes, and include granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Human G-CSF is a 175 amino  protein that induces the proliferation and maturation of neutrophils and is produced by multiple cell types including monocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages and stromal cells. It acts on specific receptors found on neutrophil progenitors. Human G-CSF is a 127 amino  glycoprotein that acts upon both progenitors of both neutrophils and macrophages or monocytes. Recombinant forms of G-CSF (filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) and GM-CSF (sargramostim) have been developed and are approved for use in patients with malignancies after chemotherapy induced neutropenia and to support patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation.  is a 332 amino  protein that acts on its receptors on megakaryocytes to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation resulting in increases in circulating platelet counts. Recombinant forms of human thrombopoietin were found to be effective in raising platelet counts, but resulted in induction of neutralizing antibody in a proportion of patients which led to severe thrombocytopenia. For this reason, further development of recombinant thrombopoietin as a therapeutic agent was abandoned. Subsequently, a small molecule agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor was identified (eltrombopag) and shown to be effective in raising platelet counts in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), as well as in patients with aplastic anemia and patients with cirrhosis undergoing interferon-based therapy. In addition, a recombinant molecule of 4 copies of a small peptide that binds the thrombopoietin receptor fused to a copy of the human IgG1 heavy chain (romiplostim) was developed that has agonist activity to the receptor, despite lack of homology to thrombopoietin. Administration of romiplostim causes maturation of megakaryocytes and increased synthesis and release of platelets without inducing neutralizing antibody.

Most agents act by inhibition of gastric  production, neutralization of  or protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa from  injury. These agents are used for both prevention and therapy of duodenal and gastric ulcer disease as well as to alleviate  reflux, esophagitis and minor upper intestinal discomforts. The most commonly used antiulcer agents are antacids such as aluminium or magnesium hydroxide (Maalox, Mylanta and many others) and calcium carbonate (Tums, Rolaids and others). Antacids are minimally absorbed and have no known adverse effects on the liver. Antacid use may cause a minor rise in urinary pH and rarely the calcium salts cause hypercalcemia. The major, most potent and effective antiulcer medications are the selective histamine type 2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) and the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Both classes of antiulcer medications block the pathways of  production or secretion, decreasing gastric acidity, improving symptoms and aiding in healing of -peptic diseases. These are some of the most commonly used drugs in medicine and are generally well tolerated and rarely result in serious adverse events. Nevertheless, both of these classes of agents have been linked to rare instances of acute liver injury and are discussed in LiverTox.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643462>Diflunisal.</a></h2><p>Diflunisal is a salicylic  derivative that is used in the therapy of chronic arthritis and mild to moderate acute pain.

The inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) to reduce plasma LDL-cholesterol merges as effective therapeutic strategy to prevent cardiovascular (CV) events. Aim of this study was to verify whether a treatment up to 12 months with the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) anti-PCSK9 influences platelet function in primary HC.In patients affected by primary HC (n = 24), all on background of statin and 17 on acetyl salicylic  (ASA), platelet function parameters were evaluated at baseline up to 12 months of treatment with the mAb anti-PCSK9 alirocumab or evolocumab. From baseline, the treatment with anti-PCSK9 mAbs: i) in ASA HC patients, significantly decreased platelet aggregation detected in platelet-rich plasma by light transmission aggregometry and in whole blood Platelet Function Analyzer-100 assay; ii) in all HC patients, significantly decreased platelet membrane expression of CD62P and plasma levels of the in vivo platelet activation markers soluble CD40 Ligand, Platelet Factor-4, and soluble P-Selectin. Furthermore, CD62P expression, and sP-Selectin, PF-4, sCD40L levels significantly correlated with serum PCSK9.Besides markedly lowering LDL-c levels, our results suggest that HC patients benefit from anti-PCSK9 mAb treatment also for reducing platelet reactivity and increasing platelet sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of aspirin. These effects on platelets could play a role in the reduction of CV event incidence in patients treated with PCSK9 inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The four H2 blockers in current use are available by prescription as well as over-the-counter, and are some of the most widely used drugs in medicine. The H2 blockers are very well tolerated, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury. The H2 receptor blockers act by binding to histamine type 2 receptors on the basolateral (antiluminal) surface of gastric parietal cells, interfering with pathways of gastric  production and secretion. The selectivity of H2 blockers is of key importance, as they have little or no effect on the histamine type 1 receptors, which are blocked by typical antihistamines that are used to treat allergic reactions and have little effect on gastric  production. The selective H2 blockers are less potent in inhibiting  production than the proton pump inhibitors (which block the common, final step in  secretion) but, nevertheless, suppress 24 hour gastric  secretion by about 70%. The effect of H2 blockers is largely on basal and nocturnal  secretion, which is important in peptic ulcer healing. The selective H2 blockers were first developed in the early 1990s by Sir James Black, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize for his work developing selective receptor antagonists for clinical use (including the beta blockers as well as the H2 blockers). The initial H2 blocker approved for use in the United States was cimetidine (1977), which was followed by ranitidine (1983), famotidine (1986), and nizatidine (1988). All four of these agents are available by prescription and as over-the-counter oral formulations. Intravenous and intramuscular forms are available for cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine. The four H2 receptor blockers available in the United States have similar spectra of activity, side effects and clinical indications. These medications are extremely well tolerated and are used by a high proportion of the general population to treat peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, esophagitis, and miscellaneous minor upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Their listed indications are for treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcer and esophageal reflux disease, and to prevent stress ulcers. Side effects are uncommon, usually minor and include diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, drowsiness, headache and muscle aches. The H2 receptor blockers are metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system. Among the four agents, cimetidine is distinctive in its potent inhibition of the P450 system (CYP 1A2, 2C9 and 2D6), which can result in significant drug interactions. All four H2 receptor blockers have been implicated in rare cases of clinically apparent, acute liver injury. The most cases have been linked to ranitidine and cimetidine, but these two agents are also the most commonly used. The four H2 receptor blockers in clinical use are discussed separately, with references given after each.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638601>Hyperuricemia and gout caused by missense mutation in d-lactate dehydrogenase.</a></h2><p>Gout is caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints when plasma uric  levels are chronically elevated beyond the saturation threshold, mostly due to renal underexcretion of uric . Although molecular pathways of this underexcretion have been elucidated, its etiology remains mostly unknown. We demonstrate that gout can be caused by a mutation in LDHD within the putative catalytic site of the encoded d-lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in augmented blood levels of d-lactate, a stereoisomer of l-lactate, which is normally present in human blood in miniscule amounts. Consequent excessive renal secretion of d-lactate in exchange for uric  reabsorption culminated in hyperuricemia and gout. We showed that LDHD expression is enriched in tissues with a high metabolic rate and abundant mitochondria and that d-lactate dehydrogenase resides in the mitochondria of cells overexpressing the human LDHD gene. Notably, the p.R370W mutation had no effect on protein localization. In line with the human phenotype, injection of d-lactate into naive mice resulted in hyperuricemia. Thus, hyperuricemia and gout can result from the accumulation of metabolites whose renal excretion is coupled to uric  reabsorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679688>Autophagic flux defect in diabetic kidney disease results in megamitochondria formation in podocytes.</a></h2><p>Podocyte injury is an important factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.

We then treated cells with a combination of glucose, fatty , and angiotensin II (GFA) to mimic the diabetic milieu. Cultured podocytes exposed to GFA showed megamitochondria formation and decreased autophagosome degradation. We also found that GFA treatment decreased the binding of the autophagosome to the lysosome. Our results suggest that megamitochondria are common in podocytes during diabetic nephropathy and that insufficient autophagy flux may underlie this effect. These findings have expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and identified a potential pharmacological target for treatment.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we establish a key role of FASN during transformation. FASN is required for eliciting the anaplerotic shift of the Krebs cycle observed in cancer cells. However, its main role is to consume acetyl-CoA, which unlocks isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-dependent reductive carboxylation, producing the reductive power necessary to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) originated during the switch from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) growth (a necessary hallmark of cancer). Upregulation of FASN elicits the 2D-to-3D switch; however, FASN's synthetic product palmitate is dispensable for this process since cells satisfy their fatty  requirements from the media. In vivo, genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of FASN before oncogenic activation prevents tumor development and invasive growth. These results render FASN as a potential target for cancer prevention studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644079>Heparins.</a></h2><p>Heparin is a naturally occurring, complex glycosaminoglycan that has anticoagulant activity and has been used for decades as an antithrombotic agent in management of patients at high risk for thromboses. Heparin is synthesized in mast cells as a polymer from glucuronic  and glucosamine residues, 10 to 15 of which are attached to a core protein resulting in a large proteoglycan of 750,000 to 1,000,000 daltons. This complex is then modified extensively and then degraded into glycosaminoglycan chains of 5000 to 30,000 daltons. Heparin for therapeutic use in humans is generally made from extracts of bovine lung or porcine intestinal mucosa and consists of a heterogeneous mixture of glycosaminoglycans of slightly different structures and molecular weights. Commercial preparations of heparin are standardized as USP units/mg. Low molecular weight heparins (1000 to 10,000 daltons) are isolated from standard heparin preparations, which are then partially depolymerized and purified by gel chromatography and alcohol precipitation. Commercial preparations of low molecular weight heparins are standardized in a bioassay based upon inhibition of coagulation factor Xa. Heparin is a large glycosaminoglycan and is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal mucosa and must be given intravenously or by subcutaneous injection. Heparin is used as the initial treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism because of its rapid onset of action, while awaiting the slower onset of activity of oral anticoagulants (such as warfarin). Heparin is also used in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina and in prophylaxis of venous thrombosis during and/or after surgery. In addition, heparin is used to maintain patency of intravenous indwelling catheters (“heparin lock”), usually in low doses (10 to 100 units), and is not meant for therapeutic purposes. Recently, low molecular weight heparins have replaced standard heparin in many situations, their advantage being a more predictable pharmacokinetics which allows for subcutaneous administration and outpatient management. The major side effects of heparin therapy are related to excessive bleeding and anticoagulation. However, heparin (both standard and low molecular weight forms) also has somewhat idiosyncratic side effects which includes hypersensitivity reactions, thrombocytopenia and serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, a large proportion of patients given standard or low molecular weight heparin intravenously develop serum ALT and AST elevations arising after 4 to 8 days of therapy that are usually asymptomatic and self-limited, lasting only 4 to 20 days and resolving sometimes even with continuation of treatment. The cause of these elevations is not known, but they are rarely associated with any symptoms. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated in a small proportion of cases but bilirubin levels are rarely above normal. For obvious reasons, the liver histological changes accompanying the aminotransferase elevations during heparin therapy has not been described.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669935>An abundance of seafood consumption studies presents new opportunities to evaluate effects on neurocognitive development.</a></h2><p>The relationship between seafood eaten during pregnancy and neurocognition in offspring has been the subject of considerable scientific study for over 25 years. Evaluation of this question led two scientific advisory committees to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAC), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations with the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conclude through 2014 that seafood consumed by pregnant women is likely to benefit the neurocognitive development of their children. The evidence they reviewed included between four and ten studies of seafood consumption during pregnancy that reported beneficial associations. In contrast there are now 29 seafood consumption studies available describing over 100,000 mothers-child pairs and 15 studies describing over 25,000 children who ate seafood. A systematic review of these studies using Nutrition Evaluation Systematic Review methodology is warranted to determine whether recent research corroborates, builds on, or significantly alters the previous conclusions. Studies that evaluate the integrated effects of seafood as a complete food more directly and completely evaluate impacts on neurocognition as compared to studies that evaluate individual nutritients or toxicological constituents in isolation. Here we address how the findings could add to our understanding of whether seafood consumed during pregnancy and early childhood affects neurocognition, including whether such effects are clinically meaningful, lasting, related to amounts consumed, and affected by any neurotoxicants that may be present, particularly mercury, which is present at varying levels in essentially all seafood. We provide the history, context and rationale for reexamining these questions in light of currently available data.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668381>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass enhances insulin secretion in type 2  via FXR-mediated TRPA1 expression.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) improves the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in patients with type 2 . How it does so remains unclear. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the nuclear receptor of bile  (BAs), is implicated in bariatric surgery. Moreover, the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and involved in insulin secretion. We aimed to explore the role of BAs/FXR and TRPA1 in improved GSIS in diabetic rats after RYGB.RYGB or sham surgery was conducted in spontaneous diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, or FXR or TRPA1 transgenic mice. Gene and protein expression of islets were assessed by qPCR and western blotting. Electrophysiological properties of single β-cells were studied using patch-clamp technique. Binding of FXR and histone acetyltransferase steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1) to the TRPA1 promoter, acetylated histone H3 (ACH3) levels at the TRPA1 promoter were determined using ChIP assays. GSIS was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT).RYGB increases GSIS, particularly the first-phase of GSIS in both intact islets and GK rats in vivo, and ameliorates hyperglycemia of GK rats. Importantly, the effects of RYGB were attenuated in TRPA1-deficient mice. Moreover, GK β-cells displayed significantly decreased TRPA1 expression and current. Patch-clamp recording revealed that TRPA1 β-cells displayed a marked hyperpolarization and decreased glucose-evoked action potential firing, which was associated with impaired GSIS. RYGB restored TRPA1 expression and current in GK β-cells. This was accompanied by improved glucose-evoked electrical activity and insulin secretion. Additionally, RYGB-induced TRPA1 expression involved BAs/FXR-mediated recruitment of SRC1, promoting ACH3 at the promoter of TRPA1.The BAs/FXR/SRC1 axis-mediated restoration of TRPA1 expression plays a critical role in the enhanced GSIS and remission of  in GK rats after RYGB.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Structural perturbations revealed: the positive feedback of AKT on IRS is responsible for the bistability in anabolic zone (glucose >5.5 mmol); the positive feedback of calcium on cAMP is responsible for ensuring ultrasensitive response in catabolic zone (glucose <4.5 mmol); the crosstalk between AKT and PDE3 is responsible for efficient catabolic response under low glucose condition; the crosstalk between DAG and PKC regulates the span of anabolic bistable region with respect to plasma glucose levels. The macronutrient perturbations revealed: varying plasma amino  and fatty  from normal to high levels gradually shifted the bistable response towards higher glucose range, eventually making the response catabolic or unresponsive to increasing glucose levels. The analysis reveals that certain macronutrient composition may be more conducive to homeostasis than others. The network perturbations that may contribute to disease states such as , obesity and cancer are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643460>Cimetidine.</a></h2><p>Cimetidine is a histamine type 2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) which is widely used for treatment of -peptic disease and heartburn.

The sulfonamides were the first effective antibiotics to be introduced into clinical medicine and have been in use continuously since the 1930’s. They are considered bacteriostatic and appear to act by inhibition of bacterial biosynthesis of folic , which is needed for cell growth, at least in those bacteria that are sensitive to sulfonamides. Because humans rely upon dietary folic , they are usually resistant to the adverse effects of inhibition of folate synthesis. Sulfonamides have a wide range of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and -negative organisms. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to sulfonamides is now common, and their use has decreased with the introduction of more potent classes of antibiotics. However, sulfonamides are still widely used especially for urinary tract infections in combination with trimethoprim and for treatment or prevention of parasitic (toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis jiroveci) and malarial infections usually combined with trimethoprim or pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides with 5-aminosalicyclic  are the structural components of sulfasalazine, which is widely used for long term management of inflammatory bowel disease. The combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is used as prophylaxis against chloroquine-resistant malaria. Dapsone is a sulfonamide related drug that is used for the therapy of leprosy and dermatitits herpetiformis. The sulfonamides are well known to cause idiosyncratic liver injury. Hepatotoxicity appears to be a class effect, in that virtually all sulfonamides used today have been linked to rare, but convincing cases of drug induced liver injury. The pattern of injury is variable, often mixed but it can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic. Most typically, the injury appears precipitously within one to three weeks of starting therapy, often preceded or accompanied by signs of hypersensitivity such as fever, rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis (or both). Hepatotoxicity from sulfonamides may represent a part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity due to sulfa-derived medications and have been linked to many cases of DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) as well as Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis. The severity of injury varies widely. Most instances of sulfonamide related liver injury are mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course. Cases with severe cholestasis may be prolonged and can lead to vanishing bile duct syndrome. Importantly, sulfonamides can cause acute liver failure, particularly in instances with a precipitious onset and hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, the sulfonamides remain one of the most common causes of drug induced acute liver failure and account for 5% to 10% of instances in many case series. Formulations of sulfonamides currently in general use in the United States include sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, and sulfisoxazole as well as the combination formulations including sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfamethazole (TMP-SMZ, also referred to as co-trimoxazole). The term sulfonamide applies to derivatives of para-aminobenzene sulfonamide (sulfanilamide), which is composed of a benzene ring with a sulfate and amide group at one end and an amide group at the other (para-position). These agents will be discussed as groups, rather than individual medications, and cases and references are combined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662726>Cigarette Smoking: An Accessory to the Development of Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by decreased sensitivity of a skeletal or adipose cell to insulin, resulting in decreased glucose uptake by the cell. This can lead to hyperinsulinemia and further reduce insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is one of the primary factors contributing to metabolic syndrome (MetS), causing elevated glucose and fatty  concentrations in the blood. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner. It directly increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via hormone activation, and may indirectly cause insulin resistance due to its effects on abdominal obesity. Nicotine may be the factor underlying these potential mechanisms. With the prevalence of prediabetes and  on the rise, and considering the role of smoking and its relationship to insulin resistance, smoking reduction or cessation may be a viable option for those who are at risk or already identified as insulin resistant. Therefore, smoking cessation or reduction would serve as a beneficial component in any  prevention or treatment plan.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632111>The Impact Of Hyperuricemia On Cardiometabolic Risk Factors In Patients With : A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Hyperuricemia (HUA) is linked to a variety of non-communicable diseases such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, with evidence showing its role in the development of  (DM). Our study's main aim was to explore the associations of HUA with other traditional risk factors in Romanian patients with DM and to assess the impact of the increase of serum UA on DM complications and HbA1c.In this cross-sectional, non-interventional study, we enrolled, according to a population-based, consecutive-case principle, 133 patients previously diagnosed with DM. HbA1c, uric , lipid profile, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate, TSH and FT measurements were performed, while the diagnosis of retinopathy and of diabetic neuropathy was established using standardized methods.An increased uric  level was associated with a significant increase in the risk for development of stroke (OR=1.526; p=0.004). A weak, positive and statistically significant correlation can also be observed between the BMI and the presence of hyperuricemia (r=0.131; p=0.034), and between the triglyceride levels and hyperuricemia (r= 0.173; p=0.004). Glomerular filtration rate was correlated to hyperuricemia in a strong and negative manner, having an important statistical significance (r=-0.818; p=0.003). In our study, UA levels and HbA1c were negatively correlated, without reaching statistical significance.Serum UA is strongly correlated with the BMI, triglyceride level and GFR in Romanian patients with DM and HUA is significantly associated with a higher risk of stroke in these individuals.© 2019 Gaita et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643599>Cholic .</a></h2><p>Cholic  is a naturally occurring bile  that is used to treat patients with genetic deficiencies in the synthesis of bile .

Weight loss agents are held to a higher standard for safety and tolerability than medications for other conditions, because they are often used by otherwise healthy individuals driven more by concerns over appearance than health. Furthermore, all weight loss medications should be used as a part of a coordinated weight loss program that includes modification of behaviors, a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity or exercise. Currently used drugs for weight loss can be separated into those that suppress appetite (such as diethylpropion and phentermine) and those that block absorption of calories (orlistat). The anoxeric agents currently used for weight loss are largely sympathomimetic agents (amphentamine, diethylproprion, and phentermine). Other classes of drugs that can affect appetite, but which are not all specifically approved for weight loss, include serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (bupropion, fenfluramine, fluoxetine), serotonin agonists (lorcaserin), GABAergic agents (topiramate, zonisamide) and cannabinoid antagonists (rimonabant). Sibutamine is unusual in having both sympathomimetic activity as well as blocking serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Sibutamine was withdrawn from use in the United States in 2010 because of concerns over increased risks for cardiovascular adverse events including myocardial infarction and stroke. In 2012, two weight loss agents were approved for use in the United States: a combination of phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia) and a serotonin agonist (Lorcaserin: Belviq). More recently, two new agents were approved: the first, a fixed dose combination of the antidepressant bupropion and the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone which is marketed under the name Contrave; the second, the injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist liraglutide which is approved and used for type 2  (Victoza) was also approved for the additional indication of weight loss (Saxenda). Drugs that suppress appetite generally affect appetite centers in the central nervous system (CNS) and can have other CNS effects such as nervousness, excitability, insomnia, mood changes, and headache. Drugs that affect absorption of nutrients often have other gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, flatulence and abdominal bloating. Liver injury is rare with all of the currently approved medications for weight loss. In contrast, serious hepatotoxicity has been linked to several over the counter and herbal preparations promoted as helping with weight loss (usnic , ephedra, Plethoryl).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643228>Proton Pump Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most potent suppressants of gastric  secretion available and are used widely in the therapy of gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease. PPIs are prodrugs that require gastric  for their activation. After absorption they diffuse into the parietal cells of the stomach and accumulate in the acidic secretory canaliculi. The activated form of the PPIs binds covalently to the H+/K+-ATPase of the -producing parietal cell, inactivating the pump molecule that transports protons (H+ molecules) into the gastric lumen. While the half-life of the PPIs is measured in hours, the activated form is trapped in the parietal cell and inhibition of the proton pump generally lasts for 24 to 48 hours. Oral forms of the PPIs are rapidly absorbed and decrease gastric acidity by 80% to 95%, although peak inhibition may require several days. More rapid inhibition may be achieved by use of intravenous formulations. The PPIs are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system (predominantly CYP 2C19 and 3A4), but are extremely well tolerated and associated with few adverse events. Liver injury due to PPIs has been reported, but is uncommon in view of the millions of individuals who take these agents. Six PPIs are currently approved for use in the United States in various dosage forms, including enteric-coated tablets and gelatin capsules, delayed-release tablets and powdered forms for intravenous use. The initial PPI approved for use was omeprazole (1989: Prilosec) followed by lansoprazole (1995: Prevacid), rabeprazole (1999: Aciphex), pantoprazole (2000: Protonix), esomeprazole (2001: Nexium, the S-isomer of omeprazole), and dexlansoprazole (2009: Dexilant, the R-isomer of lansoprazole). Most are now available in generic forms. Omeprazole, esomeprazole and lansoprazole are also available in over-the-counter formulations. Side effects of PPIs are uncommon, usually mild, and include nausea, abdominal discomfort, constipation, flatulence and diarrhea. Less common side effects include myopathy, arthralgias, headaches and skin rash. Rare instance of acute liver injury have been reported with most of the PPIs. In view of the wide scale use of the PPIs, clinically apparent liver injury is exceedingly rare. Each PPI is discussed separately in LiverTox, with references given after each, as the pattern of hepatic injury that occurs with their use is somewhat different, although all appear to share a tendency to cause hepatocellular liver injury with a short latency, within 4 weeks of starting, and rapid recovery on stopping.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646634>The wound healing effects of the Tilapia collagen peptide mixture TY001 in streptozotocin diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>The Tilapia collagen peptides mixture TY001 is effective in promoting wound healing in acetic -induced skin lesions in Zebrafish and in protecting against lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and disrupt of glucose metabolism in mice. The goal of the present study is to further examine the wound healing effects of TY001 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Full-thickness skin excision wounds were created with 8-mm biopsy punches and TY001 was administered via the drinking water (15, 30, and 45 g/L in emulsion) for 15 days. Wound healing was delayed in diabetic mice but was promoted by TY001 after 5, 10, or 15 days of treatment. Collagen deposition and tissue hydroxyproline contents were increased by TY001. The expressions of insulin growth factor-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth facts β1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor were increased by TY001 as evidenced by immunobiochemistry and qPCR. -associated serum pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-8 were decreased, while anti-inflammatory IL-10 and nitric oxide were increased by TY001, along with increased tissue antioxidant superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. -reduced serum protein levels were also recovered by TY001. Taken together, Tilapia collagen peptide mixture TY001 was effective in enhancing -associated wound healing delay, probably via increasing growth factors and collagen deposition in the wound, attenuating -induced prolonged inflammation, increasing tissue antioxidants, and providing nutritional supports in diabetic mice.

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between n-3 with, C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine (HCY) in Black minorities with and without type 2 .A cross-sectional study was conducted with 406 participants: Haitian Americans (HA): n=238. African Americans (AA): n=172. Participants were recruited from a randomly generated mailing lists, local  educators, community health practitioners and advertisements from 2008-2010. Sociodemographics and anthropometrics were collected and used to adjust analyses. All dietary variables were collected using the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and used to quantify vitamin components. Blood was collected to measure CVD risk factors (blood lipids, HCY, and CRP).African Americans had higher waist circumferences and C-reactive protein and consumed more calories as compared to Haitian Americans. Omega 3 fatty  intake per calorie did not differ between these ethnicities, yet African Americans with low n-3 intake were three times more likely to have high C-reactive protein as compared to their counterparts [OR=3. 32 (1. 11, 9. 26) p=0.031].Although homocysteine did not differ by ethnicity, African Americans with low omega 3 intake (<1 g/day) were four times as likely to have high homocysteine (>12 mg/L) as compared to their counterparts, adjusting for confounders [OR=4.63 (1.59, 12.0) p=0.004]. Consumption of n-3 by  status was not associated with C-reactive protein or homocysteine levels.Consumption of n-3 may be protective of cardiovascular risk factors such as C-reactive protein and homocysteine for certain ethnicities.

Cholinergic receptors are usually categorized as nicotinic or muscarinic. Anticholinergics often demonstrate differential antagonism for different receptors types and subtypes, accounting in part for their variety of actions and clinical usefulness for different conditions. The anticholinergics in clinical use include natural, semisynthetic and synthetic compounds that demonstrate a multitude of actions on smooth muscle cells and the parasympathetic nervous system. Anticholinergics have antisecretory activities and decrease nasal and bronchial secretions, salivation, lacrimation, sweating and gastric  production, and can be used to decrease secretions in allergic and inflammatory diseases. Anticholinergics relax smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, bladder and lung and can be used for gastrointestinal, urological or respiratory conditions associated with spasm and dysmotility. Some anticholinergics have antiemetic properties and are used to prevent nausea and vomiting from motion sickness or during the perioperative period. Anticholinergics increase heart rate and can be used to treat bradycardia. They are also used to reverse cholinergic overstimulation caused by cholinesterase inhibitors and neuromuscular blockers in anesthesia. The common side effects of anticholinergic agents are largely those of parasympathetic stimulation and include dryness of the mouth and eyes, decreased sweating and hyperthermia, headache, visual blurring, constipation, urinary retention, impotence, tachycardia and palpitations, anxiety, restlessness and in some instances agitation and delusions. Anticholinergics rarely cause liver injury. Their relative safety probably relates to their use in low doses for short periods of time only. Most anticholinergics are metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641211>Mitochondrial DNA copy number associates with insulin sensitivity and aerobic capacity, and differs between sedentary, overweight middle-aged males with and without type 2 .</a></h2><p>Increased risk of type 2  (T2DM) is linked to impaired muscle mitochondrial function and reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA). However, studies have failed to control for habitual physical activity levels, which directly influences both mtDNA copy number and insulin sensitivity. We, therefore, examined whether physical conditioning status (maximal oxygen uptake, V̇O) was associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume and mtDNA, and was predictive of T2DM in overweight, middle-aged men.Whole-body physiological (ISI-insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR, V̇O) and muscle biochemical/molecular (vastus lateralis; mtDNA, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes activity, lipid content and markers of lipid peroxidation) measurements were performed in three groups of overweight, middle-aged male volunteers (n = 10 per group): sedentary T2DM (ST2DM); sedentary control (SC) and non-sedentary control (NSC), who differed in aerobic capacity (ST2DM < SC < NSC).mtDNA was greater in NSC versus SC and ST2DM (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and less in ST2DM versus SC (P < 0.01). Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free fat mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty , triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643361>Mefenamic .</a></h2><p>Mefenamic  is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) used largely for acute treatment of pain.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic  (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic , Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty  oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a mega protein complex that promotes energy-consuming anabolic processes of protein and nucleic  synthesis as well lipogenesis in times of energy and nutrient abundance. However, it is best characterized as the regulator of steps leading to protein synthesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system (UPS) is a major intracellular proteolytic system whose activity is increased during periods of nutrient scarcity and in muscle wasting conditions such as cachexia. Recent studies have examined the impact of mTORC1 on levels and functions of the 26S proteasome, the mega protease complex of the UPS. Here we first briefly review current understanding of the regulation of mTORC1, the UPS, and the 26S proteasome complex. We then review evidence of the effect of each complex on the abundance and functions of the other. Given the fact that drugs that inhibit either complex are either in clinical trials or are approved for treatment of cancer, a muscle wasting condition, we identify studying the effect of combinatory mTORC1-proteasome inhibition on skeletal muscle mass and health as a critical area requiring investigation.Copyright © 2019.

This class of drugs acts by binding to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors and blocking their activation and the subsequent inflammatory cascade which cause the symptoms commonly associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4 and E4) are products of arachidonic  metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to CysLT receptors. The CysLT type-1 receptor is found in the human airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages and on other proinflammatory cells. In asthmatic patients, leukotriene mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure and precipitate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Two leukotriene receptor antagonists are available in the United States, zafirlukast (1996) and montelukast (1998). Both are oral agents used in management of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Both have been associated with rare cases of acute liver injury. While they have similar mechanisms of action, these two agents are structurally distinct, and the liver injury they cause does not appear to be similar in pattern of presentation or outcome. Indeed, several instances of hepatotoxicity due to one agent have been described in which the patient has tolerated the other agent without recurrence.

Demographic characteristics, clinical information, biochemical parameters (blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, and autoantibodies against glutamic  decarboxylase 65 (GADA) and islet antigen-2 (IA-2A) were measured. High-resolution DNA genotyping was performed for HLA-DRB1.Eighty-four subjects were clinically diagnosed as type 1  (T1D), seven as type 2  (T2D), and nine as fibrocalculous pancreatic disease (FCPD). Of the 84 with T1D, 37 (44%) were males and 47 (56%) females, with median age at diagnosis 13 years (range 1.6-21.7) and peak age at onset 12-15 years. 85% of subjects were assessed within one month of diagnosis and all within eleven months. For subjects diagnosed with T1D, mean C-peptide was 0.46±0.22 nmol/L (1.40±0.59 ng/mL), with 9 (10.7%) IA-2A positive, 22 (26%) GADA positive, and 5 (6%) positive for both autoantibodies. Analysis of HLA-DRB1 genotypes revealed locus-level T1D association (p=6.0E-05); DRB1*04:01 appeared predisposing (p<3.0E-06), and DRB1*14:01 appeared protective (p=1.7E-02).Atypical forms of T1D appear to be more common in young people in Bangladesh than in European populations.

Therapy with fibrates in humans leads to a lowering of serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels leading to decreases in triglyceride and cholesterol levels.

The fibrates are currently used largely in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and are used in combination with statins to treat hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism by which the fibrates lower lipid levels is unknown, but they may act through interactions with the hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) which regulate gene transcription of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and secretion.

Maillard reaction products are also known to cause oxidation of tissues and inflammation, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and . The aim of this review is to present a detailed information about the role of foodborne constituents as antibrowning agents to significantly reduce the harmful compounds like advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during food processing. This review includes strategies involving addition of amino , aromatic compounds, vitamins, modification of amino , and reducing sugars as antibrowning agents to reduce the AGEs. The role of Food borne functional ingredients such as catechin, epicathechin, luteolin, and ferulic  as inhibitors of AGEs is also discussed. Among the naturally occurring inhibitors, genistein could be a crucial and safe agent to reduce reactive intermediates. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Maillard reaction leads to changes in food color, protein functionality, protein digestibility, and loss of nutrient from foods. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) is also reported to be associated with various inflammatory conditions and may contribute to the progress of chronic diseases, including . It is hence necessary to reduce the MRPs, in both food and biological products, to offset this phenomenon. Among the strategies adopted till date, chemical agents could inhibit reactive carbonyl species and reactive oxygen species, but also are known to elicit serious side effects. Dietary flavonoids could be a very good inhibitor of MRPs both in biological and in food systems. It could be suggested that dietary flavonoids and isoflavones can be used as antibrowning agents in food and pharmaceutical industries particularly for targeted and sustained release of hypoglycemic drug in the intestines.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647926>Empagliflozin reduces the levels of CD36 and cardiotoxic lipids while improving autophagy in the hearts of Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h2><p>The EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in patients with Type 2  (T2DM)) trial made evident the potentiality of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition for treating patients with  and cardiovascular disease. Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking insulin resistance to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty  transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential glycolysis intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino  of relevance as tricarboxylic  suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic , gamma-aminobutyric  and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac inflammation. Our results provide an advancement on the knowledge of the mechanisms linking the therapy with empagliflozin with protective effects on the development of cardiometabolic diseases whose course is associated with remarkable cardiac bioenergetics dysregulation and disarrangement in cardiac metabolome and lipidome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these surgeries via an ideal risk assessment model, and reduce risks via applying some findings (for instance, perioperative beta-blockers). There are some risk assessment systems, but these have generally not been verified for patients with gynecologic cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of surgery for gynecological oncologic patients and suggest an easy risk assessment model and risk reduction by applying our findings.We retrospectively analyzed 258 gynecologic patients with cancer. Age, diagnosis, staging, performance scale, metoprolol use, heart, renal , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease, , operation type and length, carcinoma antigen 125, ascites, albumin, surgical procedure, hospitalization length, and complications were recorded.Of the 258 patients, 173 patients (67.1%) had no complications, 43 patients (16.7%) had one and 42 patients (16.3%) had two or more complications. The most common complication was the -base imbalance (14%), followed by urinary tract infection (9.7%). Parameters associated with complications were performance status, ascites, operating length, metoprolol use, and upper abdominal surgery. In our proposed scoring model with a total score range 0-23, cut-off value points for both the presence and rate of complications was found as >5.In gynecological patients with cancer, the addition of metoprolol use and upper abdominal surgery within preoperative risk assessment evaluation parameters are significantly effective in predicting the rate and severity of complications. Moreover, we have suggested a simple, practical, and convenient scoring model for this evaluation.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3 fatty  ratio is related to liver fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present co-twin control study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs was designed to identify nutritional factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Cross-sectional study of 50 MZ twin pairs (age range: 23-36 years), of which ten pairs were discordant for liver fat (liver fat percentage of one twin ≤5% and his/her co-twin >5% and a difference between co-twins of >5%) as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nutrient intake was calculated from 3-day food records.Among the ten liver fat-discordant twin pairs, the n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly higher in the twins with higher liver as compared to their co-twins with lower liver fat (6.6:1 vs. 3.2:1, p-value = 0.005). In multiple regression analysis of within-pair differences including all 50 twin pairs, a higher n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly associated with a higher liver fat percentage within MZ twin pairs after adjustment for body mass index, energy intake and other covariates (standardized beta = 0.43, p-value = 0.001).Our findings suggest that the n-6: n-3 ratio is a promising dietary agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty -binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino- and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643773>Cocaine.</a></h2><p>Cocaine is a benzoid  ester that that was originally used as a local anesthetic, but is no longer used because of its potent addictive qualities.

To evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of insoluble- (BIF) and soluble fibers (BSF) enzymatically isolated from barley, a conventional rat model and a type 2  rat model were used. Our results showed that 4-week treatment of BIF or BSF effectively reduced FBG in the diabetic condition, with caecal level of propionic  and minor SCFAs increased by BIF and that of butyric  and insulin sensitivity improved by BSF, respectively. The two treatments further ameliorated liver function, judged by the recovered serum level of ALT, albumin and total protein levels. BIF and BSF also increased HDL-C and decreased serum MDA. In normal rats, BIF and BSF showed a hypolipidaemic effect in triglycerides and LDL-C, reduced body weight and enhanced the caecal production of minor SCFAs. Furthermore, the two treatments reduced the caecal level of butyric  while BSF increased that of propionic .

Furthermore, most people with type 2  are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic , and 200µM oleic  as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on insulin secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and insulin secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased insulin secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of insulin secretion.

Beta-cells can stay in the off-mode, ready-mode or on-mode; the mode-switching being determined by the open state probability of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, and the activity of enzymes like glucokinase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Mitochondrial metabolism is critical for insulin secretion. A sound understanding of the intermediary metabolism, electrophysiology, and cell signaling is essential for comprehension of the entire spectrum of the stimulus-secretion coupling. Depolarization brought about by inhibition of the ATP sensitive potassium channel, together with the inward depolarizing currents through the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, leads to electrical activities, opening of the voltage-gated calcium channels, and exocytosis of insulin. Calcium- and cAMP-signaling elicited by depolarization, and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the free fatty  receptors, are intricately connected in the form of networks at different levels. Activation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor augments insulin secretion by amplifying calcium signals by calcium induced calcium release (CICR). In the treatment of type 2 , use of the sulfonylureas that act on the ATP sensitive potassium channel, damages the beta cells, which eventually fail; these drugs do not improve the cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, drugs acting through the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor protect the beta-cells, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. The use of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists is increasing and that of sulfonylurea is decreasing. A better understanding of the stimulus-secretion coupling may lead to the discovery of other molecular targets for development of drugs for the prevention and treatment of type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647676>A scalable self-assembling micellar system for enhanced oral bioavailability and efficacy of lisofylline for treatment of type-I .</a></h2><p>The study summarizes the development of an orally active nanoformulation of a potent but one of the least explored molecules, lisofylline (LSF) in T1D. LSF undergoes rapid metabolism resulting in poor oral bioavailability and short half-life. In this work, to improve its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, LSF was encapsulated in the form of its ester prodrug (LSF-linoleic  (LA) prodrug) into biodegradable self-assembling polymeric micelles (LSF-LA PLM, size: 149.3nm; PDI: 0.209; CMC; 5.95 µg/mL and Nagg: 14.82 at 10 CMC) of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(carbonate-co-L-lactide) (mPEG-b-P(CB-co-LA) block copolymer. LSF-LA PLM was found to be equally effective as LSF-LA prodrug in cell culture studies in insulin secreting MIN6 cells and showed excellent stability in simulating biological fluids and plasma. Pharmacokinetics of LSF-LA PLM (10 mg/kg dose) revealed significant improvement in oral bioavailability of LSF (74.86%; 3.3 fold increase in comparison to free LSF) and drastic reduction in drug metabolism. Further, LSF-LA PLM showed a significant reduction in fasting glucose levels and increase in insulin levels by intraperitoneal (IP) as well oral route in streptozotocin (STZ) induced T1D rat model. Production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and different biochemical markers for liver and kidney functions were much reduced in diabetic animals after treatment with LSF-LA PLM.

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut microbiota to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut microbiota and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty , previously associated with reduced  risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty  oleic  did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC-5) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic  (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC-5 cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA.

For this purpose, after a series of fractionation and purification steps, 7 compounds named as RS1-RS7 were isolated from aerial parts of the plant. The effects of these compounds were evaluated on the morphology and rate of cell proliferation of mouse naive embryonic stem cells. Only RS7 inhibited the proliferation of cell and reduced the induction of differentiation of cell. The qPCR analysis confirmed that the expression of the selected pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog and Sox2) was down regulated by RS7 treatment as compared to control.

Previous studies demonstrated that GPR40 activation enhances Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors. However, it remains unknown how ER Ca release via the IP3 receptor is linked to GIIS potentiation. Recently, stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 was identified as a key regulator of store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), but little is known about its contribution in GPR40 signaling. We show that GPR40-mediated potentiation of GIIS is abolished by knockdown of IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R1), STIM1 or Ca-channel Orai1 in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown significantly impaired SOCE and the increase of intracellular Ca by the GPR40 agonist, fasiglifam. Furthermore, β-cell-specific STIM1 knockout mice showed impaired fasiglifam-mediated GIIS potentiation not only in isolated islets but also in vivo. These results indicate that the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway plays an important role in GPR40-mediated SOCE initiation and GIIS potentiation in pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649071>Sex Differences in Kidney Replacement Therapy Initiation and Maintenance.</a></h2><p>More men than women undergo kidney replacement therapy (KRT) despite a larger number of women being affected by CKD. The aim of this multinational European study was to explore whether there might be historic and geographic trends in sex-specific incidence and prevalence of various KRT modalities.We assessed sex-specific differences in KRT incidence and prevalence using data from nine countries reporting to the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Registry for at least 40 years, during the period 1965-2015. Sex distribution data were compared with the European general population (Eurostat). Statistical methodology included basic descriptive statistics, incidence and prevalence calculations per million population (pmp), as well as their male-to-female ratios. Analyses were stratified by age group and diabetic status.We analyzed data from 230,378 patients receiving KRT (38% women). For all KRT modalities, the incidence and prevalence rates were consistently higher in men than women. For example, the KRT incidence increased from 8 pmp in 1965-1974 to 98 pmp in 2005-2015 in women, whereas it rose from 12 to 173 pmp in men during the same period. Male-to-female ratios, calculated for incident and prevalent KRT patients, increased with age (range 1.2-2.4), showing consistency over decades and for individual countries, despite marked changes in primary kidney disease ( more prevalent than glomerulonephritis in recent decades). The proportion of kidney transplants decreased less with age in incident and prevalent men compared with women on KRT. Stratified analysis of patients who were diabetic versus nondiabetic revealed that the male-to-female ratio was markedly higher for kidney transplantation in patients with .Since the beginning of KRT programs reporting to the ERA-EDTA Registry since the 1960s, fewer women than men have received KRT.

In the present work, we established a facile, sensitive and selective fluorescence method based on silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) and MnO2 nanosheets for the determination of α-glucosidase and one of its inhibitors acarbose. The fluorescence of SiQDs was greatly quenched by MnO2 nanosheets due to the inner filter effect. α-Glucosidase could easily catalyze the hydrolysis of l-ascorbic -2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl (AAG) to produce ascorbic  (AA), which could reduce MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+, resulting in dramatic recovery of the fluorescence of SiQDs. The proposed sensing platform could provide a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of SiQDs and the concentration of α-glucosidase in the range of 0.02-2.5 U mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.007 U mL-1. In addition, the sensing platform could be used for α-glucosidase inhibition.

In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian metabolism, but its precise physiological role in glucose and lipid metabolism and in metabolic disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error. We also reviewed some of the dogmas regarding glucagon secretion in the light of the methodological difficulties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644151>Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino  that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640685>Biochemical parameters and oxidative stress markers in Tunisian patients with periodontal disease.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is involved in many diseases including  and cancer. Numbers of studies have suggested its involvement in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of biochemical parameters and oxidative stress markers in plasma of healthy and chronic periodontitis patients.One hundred thirty subjects were divided into two groups; patients (mean age = 42 ± 13.6 y.o) and control (mean age = 44.8 ± 12.6 y.o). Patients and healthy subjects were free from any infection, coronary or heart disease,  or liver failure. Total cholesterol, LDLc, HDLc, Triglycerides (TG), creatinine, uric  (UA), glucose and urea levels as well as the activities of enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase, glutathione reductase (GR) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), were measured in plasma samples using colorimetric assays. Statistical differences between groups were determined by Student's t-test and p ≤ 0.05 was considered as significant.Periodontitis patients exhibited significant decrease in the activities of catalase, TAOC, GR and TG, cholesterol, LDLc, glucose, HDLc, uric  levels in plasma samples in comparison with healthy subjects. However, no statistically significant differences in the levels of creatinine and urea were observed between the two groups.The reduction of plasma antioxidant activities (Catalase, TAOC, GR) may have a role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Our findings suggest a decrease in the host capacity to control the damage caused by oxidative stress. Therefore, therapeutic strategies, aiming at modulating the oxidative stress could be considered as potential tools for the prevention or treatment of periodontal diseases and their potential systemic effects on the general health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677983>Metformin is associated with increase in lactate level in elderly patients with type 2  and CKD stage 3: A case-control study.</a></h2><p>The FDA has recently endorsed metformin use in patients with T2D and stage 3 CKD (CKD3). However, metformin safety in elderly individuals is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify frequency and risk factors of lactic  (LA) elevation in ambulatory elderly male US veterans with stable diabetic CKD3 treated with metformin. We studied 92 patients with non-diabetic CKD3 (Group1), diabetic CKD3 not on metformin (Group2) and diabetic CKD3 on metformin (Group 3). Mean LA levels were similar at 1.3 ± 0.3 and 1.3 ± 0.4 mmol/L in Groups 1 and 2, respectively; while, LA was significantly higher in Group 3 (2.1 ± 1.0 mmol/L, P < .001). Only 1 patient in each Groups 1 (4%) and 2 (4%) had hyperlactatemia (LA > 2.0 mmol/L), as compared with 17 (42.5%) patients in Group 3 (P < .05). No differences in age, BMI, eGFR, metformin dosage, and HbA1c were seen in Group 3 patients with and without hyperlactatemia. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, metformin use was the only factor significantly associated with hyperlactatemia (adjusted OR 25.48, P < .005). In conclusion, metformin therapy is associated with increased risk of hyperlactatemia in elderly men with diabetic CKD3.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637182>Elevated Lactic  During Ketoacidosis: Pathophysiology and Management.</a></h2><p>Lactic acidosis results from an -base balance disorder of the body due to an excess of lactic .

It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation.  (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between  and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of  along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal inflammation can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic  in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic  were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric  method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric  assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic  level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status.

We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty  oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

We aim to elucidate the mechanism underlying hyperglycemia-induced cardiac dysfunction on a well-established db/db mouse model for  and diabetic complications that lead to heart failure.  We first profiled the expression of miRNAs by microarray and qRT-PCR on db/db mice, and identified miR-320 as a key miRNA associated with the disease phenotype. We next established the clinical relevance of this finding by showing the up-regulation of the same miRNA in the failing heart of  patients. We demonstrated the causal role of miR-320 in inducing diabetic cardiomyopathy, showing that miR-320 overexpression exacerbated while its inhibition improved the cardiac phenotype in db/db mice. Unexpectedly, we found that miR-320 acts as a small activating RNA (saRNA) in the nucleus at the level of transcription. By ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR analysis of Ago2 and RNA Pol II in response to miR-320 induction, we identified CD36 as a key target gene for this miRNA and showed that the induced expression of CD36 is responsible for increased fatty  uptake, thereby causing lipotoxicity in the heart.  These findings uncover a novel mechanism for -triggered cardiac dysfunction, provide an endogenous case for saRNA that has been demonstrated so far only with synthetic RNAs in transfected cells, and suggest a potential strategy to develop a miRNA-based therapy to treat -associated cardiovascular complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672964>Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of gut microbiota and bile  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Pu-erh tea displays cholesterol-lowering properties, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676294>S-Homocysteinylation effects on transthyretin: worsening of cardiomyopathy onset.</a></h2><p>L-Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-proteinogenic α-amino  synthesized from dietary methionine. In healthy humans, high Hcy levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, stroke and type 2 . A recent study reports that Hcy reacts with Cys of transthyretin (TTR), generating a stable covalent adduct. However, to date the effect of S-homocysteinylation on TTR conformational stability remains unknown.The effect of Hcy on the conformational properties of wt- and L55P-TTR were analysed using a set of biophysical techniques. The cytotoxicity of S-homocysteinylated L55P-TTR was also evaluated in the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line, while the effects of the assemblies on kinematic and dynamics properties of cardiac muscle cells were analysed in cardiomyocyte syncytia.We found that Hcy stabilizes tetrameric wt-TTR, while it destabilizes the tetrameric structure of the L55P mutant, promoting the accumulation of self-assembly-prone monomeric species.Our study demonstrated that S-homocysteinylation of the L55P-TTR mutant impairs protein stability, favouring the appearance of toxic monomers. Interestingly, S-homocysteinylation affected only mutant, not wt-TTR. Moreover, we also show that assemblies of S-homocysteinylated L55P-TTR impair cardiomyocytes functional parameters.Our study offers new insights on the negative impact of S-homocysteinylation on L55P-TTR stability, whose aggregation is considered the causative agent of a form of early-onset familial amyloid polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Our results suggest that high homocysteine levels are a further risk factor for TTR cardiomyopathy in patients harbouring the L55P-TTR mutation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Like the natural penicillins, aminopenicillins have a thiazolidine ring structure connected to a beta-lactam ring which makes these agents susceptible to inactivation by beta-lactamase, the usual cause of bacterial resistance to the penicillins. The aminopenicillins, like the natural first generation penicillins, bind to bacterial proteins and inhibit synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, causing cell lysis particularly in rapidly growing organisms. The aminopenicillins are widely used for therapy of mild-to-severe urinary, respiratory, gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone and joint infections. They have activity against Escherichia coli, Hemophilis influenzae, Listeria monocytogenesis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus (non-penicillinase producing), Staphyloccocus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Two third generation penicillins are available in the United States: ampicillin (am" pi sil' in) and amoxicillin (a mox" i sil' in). Ampicillin is also used as a combination antibiotic with sulbactam (sul bak' tam) sodium which provides coverage against penicillinase-resistant bacteria. The references for ampicillin, amoxicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam are given together at the end of this Overview section, because they are rare causes of acute liver injury and appear to share a common pattern of associated liver injury. Typical hepatotoxicity due to the aminopenicillins resembles that of the first generation penicillins. The typical presentation is a cholestatic hepatitis arising 2 to 4 weeks after starting the antibiotic and sometimes 1 to 2 weeks after stopping a limited course. The injury is usually mild-to-moderate in severity, although fatal cases of acute liver failure have been described, and there have been several reports of vanishing bile duct syndrome or prolonged cholestasis following amoxicillin or ampicillin related cholestatic liver injury. In addition, amoxicillin is commonly used in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic . Amoxicillin/clavulanate is one of the most frequent causes of drug induced liver disease, but the liver injury is usually attributed to the clavulanate rather than the aminopenicillin, and the pattern of injury may be slightly different than that described with penicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin alone.

Endothelin receptors are relatively enriched in pulmonary vasculature and their inibition results in a decrease in pulmonary vascular pressure. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, (PAH) the endothelin receptor antagonists have been shown to improve exercise tolerance and slow progression of disease. Three endothelin receptor antagonists are currently approved and in use in the United States: bosentan (2001: Tracleer), ambrisentan (2007: Letairis) and macitentan (2013: Opsumit). Sitaxsentan, a forth endothelin receptor blocker, was approved in Europe, but not in the United States, and has subsequently been withdrawn because of cases of severe liver injury linked to its use. While all endothelin receptor antagonists have been associated with occasional transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, only bosentan and sitaxentan have been clearly linked to instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21 amino  peptide that acts in a paracrine and autocrine fashion as a potent vasoconstrictor. ET-1 appears to play a key role in regulation of vascular tone and can also induce hypertrophy of myocytes, proliferation of fibroblasts and fibrosis. ET-1 acts by engagement of cell surface receptors that result in activation of intracellular pathways leading to vasoconstriction and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Two forms of endothelin receptors have been identified – type A (ETA) and type B (ETB). The ETA receptor is found predominantly on smooth muscle cells, whereas the ETB receptor is present on both smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cells. The intracellular signaling pathways and overall effects are somewhat different for the two receptors, and there may be an advantage to specific inhibition of the type A receptor as opposed to bimodal inhibition of both. The use of endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is based upon the proposed pathogenesis of this disease, which is marked by enhanced synthesis of ET-1 and progressive proliferation and hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vasculature. In several randomized controlled trials, endothelin receptor antagonists were shown to decrease pulmonary vascular pressure and improve exercise tolerance and symptoms in patients with PAH. Their efficacy has been best demonstrated in patients with idiopathic PAH (World Health Organization [WHO] group 1 PAH) and less well in the secondary forms due to left heart failure [WHO group 2], lung disease or hypoxemia [WHO group 3], chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease [WHO group 4] or unclear, multifactorial conditions [WHO group 5].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643749>Penicillins (4th Generation).</a></h2><p>The fourth generation penicillins are semisynthetic modifications of natural penicillin that have the advantage of an extended spectrum of activity particularly against gram negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Proteus and Klebsiella species. The first generation penicillins are bactericidal antibiotics naturally derived from the mold, Penicillium chrysogenum. Their basic structure includes a thiazolidine ring connected to a beta-lactam ring with a variable side chain. Penicillins bind to bacterial proteins and inhibit synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, causing cell lysis particularly in rapidly growing organisms. Bacterial resistance to penicillin is usually mediated by beta-lactamase, an enzyme which destroys the beta-lactam ring of penicillin, rendering it inactive. The fourth generation penicillins (sometimes referred to as penicillins with extended spectrum of action) like natural penicillin are susceptible to beta-lactamase. The extended spectrum penicillins are used for therapy of moderate to severe urinary, respiratory, gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone and joint infections. They have activity against Escherichia coli, Hemophilis influenzae, Listeria monocytogenesis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus (non-penicillinase producing), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty  (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic  seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Triacylglycerols containing shorter and more saturated fatty  were enriched in the morning. SAT transcripts involved in fatty  synthesis and desaturation showed no diurnal variation. Diurnal changes of seven lipid classes were negatively associated with insulin sensitivity, but not with glucose and insulin response or insulin secretion.This study identified postprandial plasma lipid profiles as being strongly affected by meal timing and associated with insulin sensitivity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2  affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty , lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic  levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2  with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Oxidative modiﬁcations of proteins have been shown to be implicated in normal physiological processes of cells, as well as in pathomechanisms leading to the development of cancer, , neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare hereditary metabolic diseases, like classic galactosemia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generate a variety of reversible and irreversible modiﬁcations of amino  residue side chains, and within the protein backbone. These oxidative post-translational modiﬁcations (Ox-PTMs) can participate in the activation of signal transduction pathways, and mediate the toxicity of harmful oxidants. Thus, the application of advanced redox proteomics technologies is important for gaining insights into molecular mechanisms of diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics is one of the most powerful methods that can be used to give detailed qualitative and quantitative information on protein modifications and allows to characterize redox proteomes associated with diseases. The current review illustrates the role and biological consequences of Ox- PTMs under basal and oxidative stress (OS) conditions by focussing on protein carbonylation and S-glutathionylation, two abundant modifications with impact on cellular pathways that were intensively studied during the last decade.</p></html>
