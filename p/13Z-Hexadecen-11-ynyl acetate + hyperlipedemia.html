Female rats of average weight 125 g were exposed to Arrack (12 ml/kg body weight/day) and ethanol (3.2 ml/kg body weight/day) for 15 days before conception and throughout gestation. On 13th day and 19th day of gestation, altered liver function and  was seen in the fetus of both the treated groups. Altered liver function was evidenced by the increased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase or alanine amino transferase (GPT).  was caused by increased biosynthesis since the incorporation of 14C  to lipids and activities of HMG CoA reductase and lipogenic enzymes were elevated. Arrack seemed to potentiate the toxicity induced by alcohol indicating the role of non ethanolic portion. Hepatic functions of the 13th day fetuses were effected to a lesser degree than the 19th day hepatic liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488870>Progesterone abolishes estrogen and/or atorvastatin endothelium dependent vasodilatory effects.</a></h2><p>This double blind randomized placebo controlled study assessed the effects of atorvastatin, estradiol and norethisterone, isolated and in combination, on the lipid profile and on vascular reactivity, in post-menopausal women with hypercholesterolemia and arterial hypertension. Ninety-four women aged 50-65 were selected. All have received dietary counseling (4 weeks), placebo (4 weeks), and drug therapy (12 weeks): 17-beta estradiol 2mg/day (E) (n=17); E + norethisterone  1mg/day (P) (n=18); Atorvastatin 10mg/day (A) (n=20); E + A (n=21) and E + P + A (n=18). All treatment modalities have significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) (E=8.8%, E + P=10.1%, A=27.9%, A + E=29.4% and E + P + A=35.7%) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels (E + P + A=46.6%, E + A=45.9%, A=40.2%, E=20.3%, and E + P=12.1%). As concerns HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), Groups E and E + A had increases of 15.5% and 13.1%, respectively. The addition of a progesterone compound reduced its concentration (Group E + P=-9.1%, and Group E + P + A=-9.5%). By random, approximately half of the patients in each group were designated to the endothelial function evaluation (brachial artery ultrasound). We observed that in Group A (n=10), in Group E (n=10) and with the association (Group E + A) (n=7), there was a significant increase in the flow-mediated vasodilatation as compared to basal measurements. The addition of a progestin has annulled these benefits.Atorvastatin has promoted more beneficial effects on TC and LDL-c, whereas estradiol was responsible for an increase in HDL-c. The addition of a progesterone derivative abolished these benefits. Atorvastatin, estradiol or both together improved endothelial function, an effect suppressed by the addition of norethisterone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760672>Effect of Oat and Tartary Buckwheat - Based Food on Cholesterol - Lowering and Gut Microbiota in Hypercholesterolemic Hamsters.</a></h2><p>The nutritional components in oat and tartary buckwheat had been assessed to have cholesterollowering effects. However, The effect of oat and tartary buckwheat based-food (OF) on cholesterol-lowering and gut microbiota in hypercholesterole hamsters was still limited studied because they are usually consumed in whole gran as well as after being processed. In this study, normal diets, high fat diet (HFD) with/without OF were fed to hamsters for 30 days respectively and growth parameters, metabolic parameters, and gut microbiota were investigated, respectively. It was found that OF significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), lowered liver TC, cholesterol ester (CE), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations, and increased fecal weight and bile acids (BA) concentrations, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of , propionate, butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were significantly increased in hamsters fed with OF, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). OF changed the overall structure of gut microbiota. The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were decreased and the relative abundance of Eubacteriaceae was increased, compared with HFD. These results suggested that OF could reduce the concentrations of plasma lipid by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in liver and promoting excretions of fecal lipid and BA. And it also increased SCFAs and modulated the gut microbiota effectively to exert the hypocholesterolemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22781105>The flavonoid morin restores blood pressure and lipid metabolism in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>This study was undertaken to investigate the antihypertensive and antihyperlipedimic potential of morin against deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats.Hypertension was induced in uninephrectomized rats (UNX) by weekly twice subcutaneous injection of DOCA (25 mg/kg) and 1% NaCl in the drinking water for six consecutive weeks. Morin (50 mg/kg) was administered to DOCA-salt rats orally using an intragastric tube daily for a period of 6 weeks.The DOCA-salt hypertensive rats showed significant elevation in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and reduction in body weight. A significant increase in the concentrations of plasma and tissue (liver, kidney, heart, and aorta) lipids such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, plasma low-density and very low-density lipoproteins cholesterol, and a decrease in the concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were noticed in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Also, the levels of urinary protein and the activity of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in the plasma and tissues were increased, and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity in the plasma was decreased in DOCA-salt rats. Morin supplementation (50 mg/kg) throughout the experimental period restored all the above parameters significantly.Morin has a potential role in attenuating severe hypertension and hyperlipedimia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18188139>Progestins oppose the effects of estradiol on the endothelin-1 receptor type B in coronary arteries from ovariectomized hyperlipidemic rabbits.</a></h2><p>Progestins may be associated with the adverse cardiovascular outcomes observed with estrogen plus progestogen therapy, but the mechanism is not resolved. In this study we examined the effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) alone and in combination with two progestins on the endothelin-1 (ET-1) system in coronary arteries.Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were treated orally with either E2 (4 mg/d), medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) (10 mg/d), norethisterone  (NETA) (2 mg/d), E2 + MPA, E2 + NETA, or placebo for 16 weeks (n=10 in each group). Coronary arteries were used for mRNA and myograph analyses.E2 alone but not in combination with MPA or NETA increased ETB mRNA expression in coronary arteries. Accordingly, E2 alone but not in combination with MPA or NETA reduced the maximal contraction to ET-1, and the reduction was sustained after ETA but not after ETB blockade. E2 reduced preproendothelin-1 mRNA expression; however, this effect was not blunted by MPA or NETA. ETA and ET-converting enzyme-1 mRNA expression was unaffected by treatment.The data suggest that long-term E2 treatment selectively attenuates ET-1-induced vasoconstriction, possibly by increasing ETB gene expression in rabbit coronary arteries and that this effect is abolished by the two progestins investigated. This observation may help to explain how progestins oppose the supposed beneficial effects of estrogen on the arterial wall.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19372304>Effect of thrombin fragment (TP508) on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in hypercholesterolemic pigs.</a></h2><p>Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury occurs frequently in the setting of hypercholesterolemia. We investigated the potential efficacy of a novel thrombin fragment (TP508) on IR injury in a hypercholesterolemic porcine model. Twenty-one hypercholesterolemic male Yucatan pigs underwent 60 min of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Pigs received either placebo (control, n = 7) or TP508 in two doses (TP508 low dose, n = 7, as bolus of 0.5 mg/kg 50 min into ischemia and an infusion of 1.25 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) during reperfusion period or TP508 high dose, n = 7, a double dose of TP508 low-dose group). Myocardial function was monitored throughout the experiment. The area at risk and myocardial necrosis were determined by Monastryl blue/triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Apoptosis in the ischemic territory was assessed. Coronary microvascular reactivity to endothelium-dependent and -independent factors was measured. Myocardial necrosis was lower in both TP508-treated groups vs. control (P < 0.05). Regional left ventricular function was improved only in the TP508 high-dose group (P < 0.05). Endothelium-dependent coronary microvascular reactivity was greater in both TP508-treated groups (P < 0.05) vs. control. The expression of proteins favoring cell survival, 90-kDa heat shock protein and phospho-Bad (Ser112) was higher in the TP508 high-dose group (P < 0.05). The expression of the cell death signaling proteins, cleaved caspase-3 (P < 0.05), apoptosis-inducing factor (P < 0.05), and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (P = 0.07) was lower in the TP508 low-dose group vs. TP508 high-dose and control. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated nick-end labeling positive cell count was lower in both TP508 groups compared with the control (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that, in hypercholesterolemic pigs, TP508 decreases myocardial necrosis and apoptosis after IR. Thus TP508 may offer a novel approach in protecting the myocardium from IR injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28910706>Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of five major triterpenoids after oral administration of Rhizoma Alismatis extract to rats using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Rhizoma Alismatis (RA) was wildly used for treatment of dysuria, pyelonephritis, , enteritis diarrhea, diabetes, inflammation, and cancer. Triterpenoids are the major active components of RA, and its extract is mainly composed of alisol A (ALA), alisol B (ALB), alisol C 23- (ALC-23A), alisol A 24- (ALA-24A), and alisol B 23- (ALB-23A). In this study, a simple, reliable, and sensitive ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was created and validated for the quantification of the five major triterpenoids in rat plasma and various tissues biosamples (including intestine, stomach, liver, kidney, fat, muscle, brain, heart, lung, spleen, and testes). The plasma and tissues biosamples were pretreated by direct precipitation deproteinization method with acetonitrile. 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone was used as internal standard (IS). The chromatography was performed on a Phenomenex C8 column (30×2.00mm, 1.8μm) at room temperature with gradient elution. Compounds were quantified by selected multi-reactions monitoring (SRM) scanning with positive electric spray ionization mode. The linearity of detection for each triterpene was respectively from 1 to 1000ng/mL for ALC-23A and ALA, from 4 to 4000ng/mL for ALA-24A, from 10 to 10,000ng/mL for ALB, and from 2 to 2000ng/mL for ALB-23B (r>0.99) with low quantification limits of 1-10ng/mL for all analytes. All of the other validation parameters were also in an acceptable range. The validated UHPLC-MS/MS method subsequently applied for the pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of RA extract. After orally given 100mg/kg of RA extract, ALA was the most exposed component, followed by ALB and ALA-24A. Whereas significant gender difference was observed for ALB, ALA, and ALA-24A between female and male rats. The AUC of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A in female rats were approximately 2-5 fold larger than that in male rats. These triterpenoids also displayed approximately 1.5-2 times longer half-life (t) in female rats. Appearant K, V and C of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A were calculated by substrate depletion approach, rat P450 CYP3A2 plays an important role in the metabolism of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A, which is an important factor leading to the different exprosures of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A between the male rats and the female rats. Furthermore, results from tissue distribution in male rats showed that the main tissue depots of five triterpenoids were the stomach/intestine, followed by the liver, brain, and fat. However, ALA was still measured in the kidney after a long elimination time. ALB and ALB-23B exhibited lower elimination rate in the testis. These results provide a fundamental support for further pharmacological development and clinical safety application of RA.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Plasma TG concentrations were significantly less in APOE2 mice orally administered MOEO (12.5 μg/d) for 2 wk than in the vehicle-treated group. Cellular TG and cholesterol concentrations were also significantly decreased in a dose- (400 and 800 mg/L) and time- (12 and 24 h) dependent manner in HepG2 cells stimulated with MOEO compared with controls. Mouse hepatic transcriptome analysis suggested MOEO feeding altered several lipid metabolic pathways, including bile acid and cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. In HepG2 cells, the rate of fatty acid oxidation, as assessed using [1-(14)C]palmitate, was unaltered; however, the rate of fatty acid synthesis quantified with [1-(14)C] was significantly reduced by treatment with 400 and 800 mg/L MOEO compared with untreated controls. This reduction was due to the decreased expression of SREBP-1c and its responsive genes in fatty acid synthesis, including FAS, SCD1, and ACC1. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis further demonstrated that the binding of p300/CBP-associated factor, a coactivator of SREBP-1c, and histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation at the FAS, SCD1, and ACC1 promoters were significantly reduced in the livers of APOE2 mice and HepG2 cells treated with MOEO compared with their controls. Additionally, MOEO stimulation in HepG2 cells induced bile acid synthesis and reduced the nuclear form of SREBP-2, a key transcription factor in hepatic cholesterol synthesis. These findings suggest that the intake of phytochemicals with pleasant scent could have beneficial metabolic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11318502>Effect of exposure to a country liquor (Toddy) during gestation on lipid metabolism in rats.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of country liquor Toddy and its equivalent quantity of ethanol on lipid metabolism during gestation in rats. Female rats weighing an average of 125 g were exposed to Toddy (24.5 ml/body weight/day) and ethanol (0.52 ml/kg body weight/day) for 15 days before conception and throughout gestation. On the 19th day of gestation, altered liver function and  was seen in both the treated groups. Altered liver function was evidenced by the increased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or aspartate amino transferase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase or alanine amino transferase (GPT) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).  was caused by increased biosynthesis and decreased degradation of lipids. The incorporation of 14C  in lipids and activities of HMG CoA reductase and lipogenic enzymes were elevated and activity of LPL and bile acids contents were decreased. Toddy treated rats were more severely affected than those receiving an equivalent quantity of ethanol. Toddy seemed to potentiate the toxicity induced by alcohol indicating the role of the nonethanolic portion. Hepatic functions were also affected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28963918>Comprehensive lipid and metabolite profiling of children with and without familial hypercholesterolemia: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature cardiovascular disease. Whereas children with lifestyle-induced dyslipidemias often present with complex lipid abnormalities, children with FH have isolated hypercholesterolemia. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive profiling of FH children is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the lipid-related and metabolic alterations associated with elevated LDL-C in children with FH and healthy children.We measured plasma metabolites in children with FH (n = 47) and in healthy children (n = 57) using a high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy platform, and compared the differences between FH and healthy children.Both statin treated (n = 17) and non-statin treated FH children (n = 30) had higher levels of atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoproteins and lipids, and lipid fractions in lipoprotein subclasses, compared to healthy children (n = 57). FH children displayed alterations in HDL particle concentration and lipid content, compared with healthy children. Interestingly, the small HDL particles were characterized by higher content of cholesteryl esters, and lower levels of free cholesterol and phospholipids. Furthermore, plasma fatty acids were higher in non-statin treated FH children, particularly linoleic acid. Finally, acetoacetate and  were lower in FH children compared with healthy children.Hypercholesterolemia in children associates with diverse metabolic repercussions and is more complex than previously believed. In particular, we found that hypercholesterolemia in FH children was paralleled not only by increased atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoproteins and lipid fractions, but also alterations in HDL subfractions that suggest impaired reverse cholesterol transport.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Human plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is an enzyme primarily associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) while a small proportion of enzymatic activity is also associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Plasma paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an esterase exclusively associated with HDL. The authors investigated the possible relationship between carotid IMT and the plasma levels of PAF-AH mass and activity as well as the PON1 activity in hyperlipidemic patients. One hundred unrelated patients with primary  and 67 age-and sex-matched normolipidemic apparently healthy volunteers participated in the study. The PAF-AH activity in total plasma and in HDL-rich plasma (HDL-PAF-AH activity), the plasma PAF-AH mass, and the serum PON1 activities toward paraoxon and phenyl  were determined. The plasma PAF-AH mass and activity were higher in hyperlipidemic patients compared to controls, whereas the HDL-PAF-AH activity, as well as the serum PON1 activities were not significantly different between the studied groups. When hyperlipidemic patients were divided into 2 subgroups according to their IMT values (IMT <0.7 mm and IMT > or =0.7 mm) patients with IMT > or =0.7 mm had significantly higher age, and serum triglyceride concentrations, whereas no difference was found in the plasma PAF-AH mass and activity as well as in the HDL-PAF-AH activity between the 2 studied subgroups. The same phenomenon was observed for serum PON1 activities. In a multivariate analysis, only the age was significantly correlated with IMT values (p<0.05). Neither the total plasma PAF-AH mass and activity nor the HDL-PAF-AH activity are associated with early carotid atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16526566>Long hydrocarbon chain diols and diacids with central ether or ketone moieties that favorably alter lipid disorders.</a></h2><p>Long hydrocarbon chain derivatives with bis-terminal hydroxyl or carboxyl groups and various central moieties (ketone, ether, ester, amide, carbamate, etc.) have been synthesized and evaluated for their effects on the de novo incorporation of radiolabeled  into lipids in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes as well as for their effects on lipid, glycemic and body weight variables in female obese Zucker fatty rats following one and two weeks of oral administration. The most active compounds were found to be symmetrical with four to five methylene groups separating the ether or ketone central functionality from the gem dimethyl, cycloalkyl or methyl/aryl substituents. Cycloalkyl substitution alpha to the carboxyl group in keto-acids lowered the in vitro activity to micromolar values. Furthermore, in vivo biological activity was found to be greatest for cyclopropyl-substituted ketone derivatives, particularly the ketodiacid with five methylene groups on each side of the central ketone functionality, which was identified as an HDL elevator and was also found to reduce insulin and glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16359128>Beneficial effects of Zingiber officinale Roscoe on fructose induced  and hyperinsulinemia in rats.</a></h2><p>Fructose supplementation produced cardinal features of Syndrome-X including significant elevations in seum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose and insulin and also in body weight. While treatment with methanolic extract of dried rhizomes of Zingiber officinale produced a significant reduction in fructose induced elevation in lipid levels, bodyweight, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, treatment with ethyl  extract of Z officinale did not poduce any significant change in either of the last two parameters. However, it produced a significant reduction in elevated lipid levels and body weight The concentration of 6-gingerol was found to be higher in methanolic extract and less in ethyl  extract. The results suggest that the methanolic extract of Z officinale produces better effects as compared to ethyl  extract in fructose induced  associated with insulin resistance. The extent of activity appears to be dependent on the concentration of 6-gingerol present in the extracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18520334>Increased de novo lipogenesis and delayed conversion of large VLDL into intermediate density lipoprotein particles contribute to  in glycogen storage disease type 1a.</a></h2><p>Glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD-1a) is a metabolic disorder characterized by fasting-induced hypoglycemia, hepatic steatosis, and . The mechanisms underlying the lipid abnormalities are largely unknown. To investigate these mechanisms seven GSD-1a patients and four healthy control subjects received an infusion of [1-(13)C] to quantify cholesterogenesis and lipogenesis. In a subset of patients, [1-(13)C]valine was given to assess lipoprotein metabolism and [2-(13)C]glycerol to determine whole body lipolysis. Cholesterogenesis was 274 +/- 112 mg/d in controls and 641 +/- 201 mg/d in GSD-1a patients (p < 0.01). Plasma triglyceride-palmitate derived from de novo lipogenesis was 7.1 +/- 9.4 and 86.3 +/- 42.5 micromol/h in controls and patients, respectively (p < 0.01). Production of VLDL did not show a consistent difference between the groups, but conversion of VLDL into intermediate density lipoproteins was relatively retarded in all patients (0.6 +/- 0.5 pools/d) compared with controls (4.3 +/- 1.8 pools/d). Fractional catabolic rate of intermediate density lipoproteins was lower in patients (0.8 +/- 0.6 pools/d) compared with controls (3.1 +/- 1.5 pools/d). Whole body lipolysis was similar, i.e., 4.5 +/- 1.9 micromol/kg/min in patients and 3.8 +/- 1.9 micromol/kg/min in controls.  in GSD-1a is associated with strongly increased lipid production and a slower relative conversion of VLDL to LDL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27779658>Ethanol extract of baked Gardeniae Fructus exhibits in vitro and in vivo anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic activities in malignant cancer cells: Role of suppression of the NF-κB and HIF-1α pathways.</a></h2><p>Gardeniae Fructus (GF, Zhi Zi in China), a fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, has been used in traditional medicine to reduce inflammation and headache and to treat hepatic disorders, hypertension, and icterus. In recent studies, extract of raw or stir-baked GF was shown to have pharmacological activities for viral infection, thrombosis, , convulsion, inflammation, oxidative stress, and others. In addition, baked GF extract suppressed the proteolytic activities and altered the cellular morphology of tumor cells. However, the effects of ethanol extract of baked GF (EBGF) on the metastatic and angiogenic capacities of malignant tumor cells and its detailed mechanism of action have not been reported. In this study, we found that EBGF significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced MMP-9 and -13 and uPA expression via suppression of PMA-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65. Metastatic potential, including migration, invasion, and colonization, was substantially reduced by EBGF with no cytotoxicity. In addition, EBGF attenuated tumor-induced angiogenesis, including microvessel sprouting, migration of endothelial cells (ECs), and tube formation of ECs, by inhibiting the release of pro-angiogenic factors from tumor cells. In C57BL/6 mice, we observed that daily administration of EBGF at 50 and 100 mg/kg suppressed metastatic colonization of B16F10 melanoma cells in the lungs. Furthermore, EBGF administration did not cause adverse effects, suggesting that EBGF is safe and may be a potential herbal medicine capable of controlling metastatic malignant cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878614>The protective role of amla (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) against fructose-induced metabolic syndrome in a rat model.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of amla (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) on fructose-induced metabolic syndrome using a rat model. Male Wistar rats were fed a high-fructose (65 %) diet or standard chow for 1 week, and treated with an ethyl  (EtOAc) extract of amla, a polyphenol-rich fraction, at 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight per d, or vehicle, for 2 weeks. Serum glucose, TAG, total cholesterol and blood pressure levels of the high-fructose diet-fed rats were increased compared with those of the normal rats (P < 0.001). However, the EtOAc extract of amla ameliorated the high fructose-induced metabolic syndrome, including hypertriacylglycerolaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. Also, the elevated levels of hepatic TAG and total cholesterol in rats given the high-fructose diet were significantly reduced by 33.8 and 24.6 %, respectively (P < 0.001), on the administration of the EtOAc extract of amla at the dose of 20 mg/kg with the regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 expression. The protein levels of PPARalpha and SREBP-2 were not affected by the feeding of the high-fructose diet or EtOAc extract of amla. In addition, oral administration of the amla extract at the dose of 20 mg/kg significantly inhibited the increased serum and hepatic mitochondrial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels (21.1 and 43.1 %, respectively; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the amla extract inhibited the increase of cyclo-oxygenase-2 with the regulation of NF-kappaB and bcl-2 proteins in the liver, while the elevated expression level of bax was significantly decreased by 8.5 and 10.2 % at the doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight per d, respectively.

Different parts of the plant have been folklorically used for treatment of different diseases. Infusion of dried flowers is used to treat diarrhea, the seeds are emetic and cathartic while the rhizome has been indicated for the treatment of hysteria, abdominal spasm, nervine tonic and headache. Besides these, peony has also been used in different respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) like hypertension, palpitations, congestive heart failure and atherosclerosis. Being a folkloric remedy for the treatment of CVDs, Paeonia emodi (P. emodi) requires to be explored scientifically for MI management.The current research work was designed to explore the possible cardioprotective mechanism of P. emodi in Isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO) induced MI in mice.Experimental animals randomly divided in different groups, received methanolic extract of P. emodi (Pe.ME) and its subsequent fractions for 15 days followed by ISO (100 mg/kg s.c) at 24 h interval for two days. The cardioprotective potential of the test samples were investigated by determining the serum levels of Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK). The ethyl  fraction (Pe.EA) was found potent among all the tested samples of P. emodi. Based on its high potency, Pe.EA was subjected to GC-MS analysis and further relevant experiments including anti-hyperlipidemic, antioxidant, lipid peroxidation, membrane stabilization, thrombolytic, DNA ladder assay and histopathological study.Pe.EA exhibited significant cardioprotective activity through reduction in levels of serum biomarkers responsible for MI. It significantly reduced serum levels of ALT (p < 0.001), AST (p < 0.001), CPK (p < 0.05) and LDH (p < 0.001) at a dose of 300 mg/kg as compared to ISO treated group. The GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of potential compounds (esculetin, methyl eugenol, isovanillic acid) which might play a role in cardioprotection. Further screening confirmed that the effect of Pe.EA is mediated through multiple targets/mechanisms, which include anti-, antioxidant, lipid peroxidation inhibition, membrane stabilization, thrombolytic and DNA protective effects. Histopathological studies revealed the palliative effect for the damage caused in myocardial tissues.Findings of current study provide evidence that P. emodi is a potential candidate for the treatment and management of MI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Significantly different pharmacokinetics between normal and hyperlipidemic rats were observed, which would be beneficial for the clinical use of diosgenin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17111028>Effect of fasudil on macrovascular disorder-induced endothelial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The present study has been designed to investigate the effect of fasudil (Rho-kinase inhibitor) in hypercholesterolemia- and hypertension-induced endothelial dysfunction. High fat diet (8 weeks) and desoxycortisone  (DOCA) (40 mg.kg-1) were administered (s.c.) to rats to produce hypercholesterolemia and hypertension (mean arterial blood pressure > 120 mmHg), respectively. Endothelial dysfunction was assessed using isolated aortic ring, electron microscopy of thoracic aorta, and serum concentration of nitrite/nitrate. The expression of mRNA for p22phox and eNOS was assessed by using RT-PCR. Serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration and aortic superoxide anion concentration were estimated to assess oxidative stress. Fasudil (30 mg.kg-1, p.o.) and atorvastatin (30 mg.kg-1, p.o.) treatments markedly prevented hypercholesterolemia- and hypertension-evoked attenuation of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, impairment of vascular endothelial lining, decrease in expression of mRNA for eNOS and serum nitrite/nitrate concentration, and an increase in expression of mRNA for p22phox, superoxide anion, and serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. The ameliorative effect of fasudil was prevented by L-NAME. In conclusion, fasudil-induced inhibition of Rho-kinase may improve hypercholesterolemia- and hypertension-induced endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064834>Identification of antihyperlipidemic constituents from the roots of Rubia yunnanensis Diels.</a></h2><p>The roots of Rubia yunnanensis Diels (Rubiaceae) have been used as an alternative for Rubia cordifolia for the treatment of various diseases including cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease for a long history in traditional Chinese medicine. To evaluate antihyperlipidemic activity of the roots of Rubia. yunnanensis Diels and to identify active compounds from the active fraction.Antihyperlipidemic effects of extract and compounds of the roots of Rubia yunnanensis were studied in HepG2 cells and in vivo model in olive oil-loaded mice. The isolation of compounds was conducted using various chromatographic methods and the structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by NMR and MS techniques.Methanol extract and ethyl  fraction of Rubia yunnanensis potently decreased the triglycerides accumulation in HepG2 cells and the methanol extract of Rubia yunnanensis (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the TG elevation in a dose dependent manner in olive oil-loaded mice. Through various chromatographic methods, twenty-three compounds (1-23) were isolated in which arborinane-type triterpenoids and a free anthraquinone potently inhibited TG levels in HepG2 cells.Arborinane-type triterpenoids, especial rubiarbonone C (16) and an anthraquinone, 2-methyl-1, 3, 6-trihydroxy-9, 10-anthraquinone (MTHA) (22) were identified as the main active compounds responsible for antihyperlipidemic activity. Based on these findings, we proposed that the extract of Rubia yunnanensis and its active components, arborinane-type triterpenoids and the free anthraquinone might be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of hyperlipidemic disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, it is essential to develop preclinical animal models for HFpEF pharmacological treatment strategies. We created a porcine model of severe hypertension and  by using a combination of deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA, 100 mg kg), Western diet (WD) and angiotensin II infusion. Systolic blood pressure, echocardiography and invasive pressure-volume loop were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 18 weeks. A detailed histological assessment was also performed to determine the cardiac structural remodeling. Compared with controls (n=10), hypertensive animals (n=10) showed markedly higher systolic blood pressure (181 vs. 86 mm Hg) at 18 weeks. Concentric remodeling, characterized by a normal chamber size with a thicker wall, was observed in hypertensive animals. Left ventricle diastolic function showed a tendency toward decline, according to the echocardiographic data. Hemodynamic data showed that the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship was elevated without changes in the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship. Histological results revealed that the fibrotic area in hypertensive animals (P<0.05 vs. controls) and the fibrotic area in the posterior wall of hypertensive animals' left atria were larger than other sites of the left atria (P<0.05 vs. other sites). This model can mimic clinical HFpEF to some degree. We found that the posterior wall of the left atrium is more susceptible to atrial remodeling associated with hypertension compared with other regions of the left atrium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566333>Simultaneous determination of five free and total flavonoids in rat plasma by ultra HPLC-MS/MS and its application to a comparative pharmacokinetic study in normal and hyperlipidemic rats.</a></h2><p>A simple and rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (uHPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of five free flavonoids (amentoflavone, isorhamnetin, naringenin, kaempferol and quercetin) and their total (free and conjugated) forms, and to compare the pharmacokinetics of these active ingredients in normal and hyperlipidemic rats. The free and total forms of these flavonoids were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl . The conjugated flavonoids were deconjugated by the enzyme β-Glucuronidase and Sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C8 USP L7 column using gradient elution. Detection was performed on a 4000Q uHPLC-MS/MS system from AB Sciex using negative ion mode in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The lower limits of quantification were 2.0-5.0ng/mL for all the analytes. Intra-day and inter-day precision were less than 15% and accuracy ranged from -9.3% to 11.0%, and the mean extraction recoveries of analytes and internal standard (IS) from rat plasma were all more than 81.7%. The validated method was successfully applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study of five free and total analytes in rat plasma. The results indicated that the absorption of five total flavonoids in  group were significantly higher than those in normal group with similar concentration-time curves.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of alloxan monohydrate (120 mg/kg). Normal and diabetic rats were divided into different groups (six rats each group) and orally administered with petroleum ether (P.E.) (200 and 400 mg/kg), ethyl  (EtOAc) (100 and 200 mg/kg), methanol (125 and 250 mg/kg), water fraction (150 and 300 mg/kg) and glibenclamide (10 mg/kg) for 21 days. Blood samples were collected from overnight fasted normal rats on day 21, from overnight fasted diabetic rats at 7, 14 and 21 days of treatment and analyzed for blood glucose level. On day 22 blood samples were collected from diabetic rats to estimate biochemical parameters, rats were sacrificed by single stunning and tissues were excised to measure their antioxidant and glycogen status.In the normoglycemic rats, MeOH (125 and 250 mg/kg) and aqueous fractions (150 and 300 mg/kg) showed a significant (P<0.05) hypoglycemic effect on day 21. In diabetic control rats, MeOH (125 and 250 mg/kg) and aqueous fractions (150 and 300 mg/kg) showed significant antihyperglycemic effect (P<0.001). The active fractions (MeOH and aqueous) of Phyllanthus simplex also increased the body weight of diabetic rats significantly compared to the control group. The active fractions were able to normalize the marked alterations in antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant parameters levels in liver and kidney. Treatment with the active fractions also normalized the diabetic induced  and liver glycogen.These results demonstrate the antidiabetic and antioxidant potential of fractions of Phyllanthus simplex and suggests that the plant may have therapeutic value in diabetes and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15055403>Impact of menopause on lipid and bone metabolism and effect of hormone replacement therapy.</a></h2><p> and osteoporosis are the medical targets to improve the quality of life of increasing elderly women.To elucidate the effect of menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on lipid and bone metabolism.With their written informed consent, studied were 89 postmenopausal with 30 premenopausal women, and postmenopausal 35 were assigned into HRT (n = 18) or control group (n = 17); the former received conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg/day) and medroxyprogesterone  (2.5 mg/day), the latter calcium aspartate (800 mg/day).Parameters were measured for lipids; total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), triglycerides (TG), lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins as well as for bone metabolism; parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25(OH)2D3, bone type of alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP), intact bone gla protein (I-BGP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in serum. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

We investigated the protective effects of PGEA against vascular endothelial cell injury induced by oxLDL and dyslipidemia induced by an HF diet, and the mechanisms underlying these effects were studied. The protective effects of PGEA were investigated with respect to calf pulmonary arterial endothelial (CPAE) cell viability and the lactate dehydrogenase release during oxLDL treatment. The in vivo effects of PGEA were examined using C57BL/6 mice, which were fed an HF diet for 9 weeks. The HF diet was supplemented with 0, 25, or 75 mg/kg PGEA during the last 4 weeks of the experimental period. Histologic analyses of hepatic lipid accumulation were performed. The changes in antioxidant protein levels induced by PGEA, which protects against HF diet-induced oxidative stress, were measured using a proteomics approach. We found that PGEA exhibited antioxidant activity. In CPAE cells, PGEA inhibited both oxLDL-induced cell death and lactate dehydrogenase release. In the HF diet-induced obese mice that received PGEA, we observed significantly reduced plasma and hepatic lipid levels, demonstrating that PGEA has beneficial effects on . In addition, we found that PGEA caused the up-regulation of antioxidant proteins.

Few studies focused on the pathophysiological features and treatments in metabolic diseases after severe trauma and shock. Vascular reactivity is significantly decreased after severe trauma and shock. Improving the vascular reactivity with arginine vasopressin (AVP) and phorbol-12 myristate-13- (PMA) is beneficial to trauma and shock. Whether the cardiovascular function and treatment responses have the own features in hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic patients after traumatic hemorrhagic shock is not known. Using hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic and healthy rats, we compared the change patterns in cardiovascular function including vascular reactivity, tissue perfusion, and the hemodynamics after hemorrhagic shock and their responses to AVP, PMA, and common antishock agents including dopamine and norepinephrine. A same degree of hemorrhagic shock (40% hemorrhage or mean arterial pressure maintained at 40 mm Hg for 2 h) resulted in a more obvious decrease in vascular reactivity, hemodynamics, tissue perfusion, and mitochondrial function of liver and kidney in hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic rats, and a more rapidly natural death than in healthy rats. The effectiveness of AVP and PMA in these diseased rats was lower than in healthy rats. The effective dosage of common antishock agents including norepinephrine, dopamine, and AVP in healthy rats was wider than that in these diseased rats. Among the antishock agents used in the current study, AVP had the best effect in improving animal survival and vascular reactivity both in healthy and in diseased rats. These findings suggest that hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic rats have a worse vascular reactivity and organ function than the healthy rats after traumatic hemorrhagic shock, which result in the worse treatment responses and effects to vasoactive agents. Lower dose of AVP can be recommended as the first-line antishock agents for these diseased rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10877207>Three-year study of estrogen alone versus combined with progestin in postmenopausal women with or without hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>This study compares the effects of long-term hormone replacement therapy on the lipid profile of postmenopausal women with or without hypercholesterolemia, with a comparison of 2 different regimens over a 3-year period. A total of 209 women were enrolled in this prospective, nonrandomized trial. They were classified into 2 groups according to baseline serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The hypercholesterolemic group consisted of 83 subjects with a total cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL or higher and LDL cholesterol 140 mg/dL or higher. The normocholesterolemic group consisted of 126 subjects with normal total and LDL cholesterol levels. Therapy was assigned as follows: 44 subjects in the hypercholesterolemic group and 67 in the normal cholesterol group with a total hysterectomy received conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg/d, while 39 subjects in the hypercholesterolemic group and 59 in the normal cholesterol group with a physiological menopause received CEE 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone  2.5 mg/d. Fasting blood samples were monitored periodically for 3 years. Nine women withdrew from the study. Hormone replacement therapy had a more favorable effect in the hypercholesterolemic group versus the normal cholesterol group by decreasing total and LDL cholesterol, 7.0% and 16.6%, versus the normal cholesterol group, 0.8% and 3.9%. Serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were increased in both groups (hypercholesterolemic, 14.4%; normal cholesterol group, 26.5%), with the increase being larger in the normal cholesterol group. These changes were similar with both treatments and were maintained over 3 years. Serum levels of triglyceride were also increased in both groups, with the increase being statistically significant only in the group with normal cholesterol levels at baseline. There were no consistently reported side effects of therapy. The effects of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, estrogen with or without progestin, on the lipid profile appear to be related to the subject's baseline lipid values. Thus, such therapy may have a more favorable effect on LDL cholesterol in postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia, with the beneficial effect being maintained over 3 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898481>Shedding of syndecan-1 from human hepatocytes alters very low density lipoprotein clearance.</a></h2><p>We recently showed that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 mediates hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in mice based on systemic deletion of syndecan-1 and hepatocyte-specific inactivation of sulfotransferases involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Here, we show that syndecan-1 expressed on primary human hepatocytes and Hep3B human hepatoma cells can mediate binding and uptake of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Syndecan-1 also undergoes spontaneous shedding from primary human and murine hepatocytes and Hep3B cells. In human cells, phorbol myristic acid induces syndecan-1 shedding, resulting in accumulation of syndecan-1 ectodomains in the medium. Shedding occurs through a protein kinase C-dependent activation of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17). Phorbol myristic acid stimulation significantly decreases DiD (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate)-VLDL binding to cells, and shed syndecan-1 ectodomains bind to VLDL. Although mouse hepatocytes appear resistant to induced shedding in vitro, injection of lipopolysaccharide into mice results in loss of hepatic syndecan-1, accumulation of ectodomains in the plasma, impaired VLDL catabolism, and hypertriglyceridemia.These findings suggest that syndecan-1 mediates hepatic VLDL turnover in humans as well as in mice and that shedding might contribute to hypertriglyceridemia in patients with sepsis.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19655407>Efficacy of different fractions of Anethum graveolens leaves on serum lipoproteins and serum and liver oxidative status in experimentally induced hypercholesterolaemic rat models.</a></h2><p>Over the last few years, many studies have focused on plants with therapeutic properties. Anethum graveolens L. (Umbilliferae) is used as an anti-hypercholesterolaemic plant in Iranian folk medicine. This study was to disclose the antioxidant and hypolipidaemic properties of different fractions of the Anethum graveolens extract (AGE), evaluated in hypercholesterolaemic rats. The animals were divided into five groups, Group I served as healthy control; groups II to V were made hypercholesterolaemic by feeding high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 weeks. After induction of hypercholesterolaemia, the rats in groups III to V received different fractions [diethyl ether (EEF), ethyl  (EAF) and water (WF) fractions, respectively] of the AGE at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight per day for 2 weeks. Feeding HFD increased serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol significantly in Group II as compared to Group I. Treatments of rats with fractions EEF, EAF and WF caused a significant decrease in TC, TG and LDL-C levels by (53.8, 49.9 and 42.3%), (51.5, 38.45 and 30.5%) and (54.8, 51.4 and 41.8%), respectively, however the HDL-cholesterol level was increased. In an effort to gain some knowledge about the mechanism of action, the effects of different fractions on oxidative stress induced by HFD were also investigated. Treatment with different fractions of AGE significantly increased hepatic antioxidant system activities such as SOD, CAT and GSH, along with decreased lipid peroxidation in HFD treated rats. Among these fractions, EEF showed the highest and WF showed the lowest increase in the above mentioned factors. Based on these results, it can be concluded that different fractions of AGE especially EEF, besides its hypolipidaemic property, could protect the liver against the HFD-induced oxidative damage in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21319007>Beneficial aspect of oral estriol as hormone replacement therapy: consideration on bone and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>To improve the quality of life of elderly people in Japanese society where women have the longest life expectancy in the world, osteoporosis, and  are among the major targets of medical treatment. To differentiate two types of regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), we tried to evaluate the efficacy on lipid and bone metabolism. With informed consent, 34 postmenopausal women of more than 2 years were assigned to receive 1 of 2 types of HRT (the HRT group) for 12 months observation: one with a combination of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg/day and medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) 2.5 mg/day (the CEE group), and the other with oral estriol (E3) 2 mg/day (the E3 group). Parameters of serum lipid were measured, as well as those of bone metabolism with bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using QDR-2000. In HRT groups, lipid and bone metabolism were confirmed to be improved. Whereas, an increase of triglycerides (TG) observed in the CEE group was not observed in the E3 group. Thus, in the clinical management of postmenopausal women, oral E3 preparation as an alternative regimen for HRT for CEE might be efficacious.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16368469>Comparison of effects of pravastatin and hormone therapy on soluble P-selectin and platelet P-selectin expression in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women.</a></h2><p>Recent trials have suggested an adverse early effect on cardiovascular risk of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women, an effect which could be due to an increase in arterial thrombosis via platelet activation. We examined the effect of HT on platelet surface expression of P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, and plasma levels of soluble P-selectin, also believed to be a marker of platelet activation, and compared these effects with pravastatin, a drug proven to reduce cardiovascular events and reported to decrease both platelet and soluble P-selectin.Surface expression of platelet P-selectin, soluble P-selectin and fasting lipids were measured at baseline and 6 months in a randomized, double-blind study of postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women comparing low-dose combined HT (1mg estradiol + 0.5 mg norethisterone ; n = 26) with pravastatin (n = 24).After adjusting for baseline levels, HT and pravastatin produced similar reductions in soluble P-selectin (p < 0.0001 for both). The percentage of platelets expressing P-selectin was also reduced by pravastatin (p = 0.025), but there was a trend to an increase in platelet P-selectin expression with HT (p = 0.13), and a significant difference between pravastatin and HT in the changes in platelet P-selectin (p < 0.002). No relationship was evident between changes in soluble or platelet P-selectin and changes in lipids with either treatment.In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, both pravastatin and HT reduced soluble P-selectin levels, but only pravastatin reduced P-selectin expression on the surface of platelets. An implication of these findings is that the reduction in soluble P-selectin by HT may occur by a non-platelet related mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715352>Effect of simvastatin on serum C-reactive protein during hormone replacement therapy.</a></h2><p>Because statins seem to attenuate the early, increased cardiovascular hazard induced by hormone replacement therapy (HRT), we treated 16 postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women with coronary artery disease with combined HRT, simvastatin, and the combination of HRT and simvastatin in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study; we also evaluated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at the end of each treatment period. We found that only HRT significantly increased CRP compared with placebo, whereas the combination of HRT with simvastatin did not.

Patients were divided into three groups according to apo E phenotype: E2+ (E2/2 and E2/3, n=21), E3/3 (n=176), E4+ (E3/4 and E4/4, n=45).We found that the E4+ group had the highest levels of total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, being significantly higher than in the E2+ group at baseline. The plasma levels of total and LDL cholesterol showed a significant decrease only in the E2+ and E3/3 groups after 12 months of HRT (E2+ group, total cholesterol -8.9% and LDL cholesterol -21.5%; E3/3 group, total cholesterol -2.9% and LDL cholesterol -9.5%). No significant difference in the reduction of total and LDL cholesterol was found in the E4+ group. Other lipid parameters did not differ in the three groups.These data show that the apo E phenotype influenced the response of lipid metabolism in postmenopausal women to HRT, especially in the reduction of LDL cholesterol. Therefore, apo E phenotyping may be important in predicting the cholesterol-lowering effect of HRT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782939>Postnatal dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation rescues glucocorticoid-programmed adiposity, hypertension, and  in male rat offspring raised on a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Fetal glucocorticoid excess programs several adverse outcomes in adult offspring, many of which can be prevented by postnatal, dietary omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids. Here we tested 2 separate hypotheses: 1) a postnatal high-fat diet exacerbates the glucocorticoid-programmed phenotype; and 2) postnatal, dietary n-3 fatty acids rescue programmed outcomes, even in the presence of a high-fat diet challenge. Pregnant Wistar rat dams were either untreated or administered dexamethasone  (Dex; 0.5 μg/mL drinking water) from day 13 of pregnancy. Offspring were cross-fostered to untreated mothers and males were weaned onto a standard (Std), high-fat, low n-3 (HF), or high-fat, high n-3 (HFHn-3) diet. Prenatal Dex reduced birth weight (26%) and delayed puberty onset by 1.2 days, irrespective of postnatal diet. Prenatal Dex programmed increased blood pressure in adult offspring, an effect worsened by the postnatal HF diet. Supplementation with high n-3 fatty acids, however, prevented both the Dex and HF-induced increases in blood pressure. Prenatal Dex also programmed increased adiposity, plasma cholesterol, and plasma triglyceride levels at 6 months of age, particularly in those offspring raised on the HF diet. But again, each of these adverse outcomes was rescued by supplementation of the HF diet with n-3 fatty acids.

BMD of the lumbar spine (L2-4) was determined using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry.While we observed a significant decrease in vertebral bone mass in the HRT-no medication group at 12 months (P=0.049) and 18 months (P=0.013), there was no significant decrease in vertebral bone mass in either the continuous HRT group or the group with change of HRT to 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol. In the group with change of HRT to 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, although urinary pyridinoline level increased significantly from the baseline level throughout the study period (P<0.05), serum propeptide of type-1 procollagen (P1CP) level also increased significantly from the baseline level throughout this period (P<0.001). Furthermore, significant increase from the baseline value (P<0.01) was observed in serum osteocalcin level at 6, 12 and 18 months.These results indicate that switching to 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol therapy after short-term HRT increased both bone resorption and bone formation, and permitted maintenance of increase in bone mass due to HRT for at least 18 months, though this switching accelerated bone turnover. This may have occurred because stimulation of bone formation induced by HRT was maintained by 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, though bone turnover was slightly promoted because of withdrawal of HRT. This method was thus found to be very effective in preventing bone loss in patients who have discontinued HRT and are considered relatively contraindicated for use of estrogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12020980>Effects of a lipid lowering fibrate and hormone replacement therapy on serum lipids and lipoproteins in overweight postmenopausal women with elevated triglycerides.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women after menopause. In essence major risk factors for CVD are similar in women as for men inclusive of serum lipid perturbations. The effects of estrogens and hormone replacement therapy on lipid metabolism is widely discussed and warrant further evaluation especially when combined with other lipid lowering drugs.Postmenopausal women were studied by an open randomised study during 9 months. Subjects were recruited from outpatient clinics in a rural area of Sweden. Major inclusive criteria comprised body mass index (BMI) >28, serum triglycerides >1.5 mmol/l. Participants were at least 12 months postmenopause with a concomitant serum Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) above 28 IU/l. After inclusion in the study patients were instructed to adhere to a low-fat and caloric diet for 3 months and after this period randomised into two groups of intervention; a lipidlowering fibrate (LLF) group and one hormone replacement therapy group (HRT). The LLF group was given gemfibrozil 600 mg orally twice daily and HRT group received 2 mg oestradiol in combination with 1 mg norethisterone  as a continuous combined therapy once daily. After 3 months, the LLF group added the HRT regimen and patients in the HRT group added gemfibrozil. Hence, all participants received the regimens combined for the last 6 months of the study.Serum s-cholesterol was markedly decreased in both groups during the first 3 months of single treatment (P<0.0001). This decrease reflected a reduction especially of calculated low density lipoprotein (LDL) s-cholesterol (P<0.001). High density lipoprotein (HDL) s-cholesterol was reduced in the HRT group (P<0.005) but increased (P<0.004) in the LLF group. Triglycerides were also decreased by both treatments but more marked in the LLF group (P<0.0001) than in the HRT group (P<0.02). After 9 months the reduction remained in both groups but no additive effects were encountered in any of the groups.The effects by gemfibrozil on s-cholesterol and triglycerides levels seem to be superior to continuous combined HRT in overweight women with elevated triglycerides. The combination of the two drugs did not seem to offer any additional benefit concerning the routine serum lipid or lipoprotein profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11152852>Effect of medroxyprogesterone  plus estradiol on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>The addition of medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) is widely accepted to remove the endometrial-cancerogenic effect of estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. To evaluate the effect of MPA on endothelial function, we measured flow-mediated vasodilation of brachial arteries after transient occlusion in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study; we concluded that the addition of MPA attenuates the favorable effects of estradiol on endothelium-dependent vasodilation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21479350>Antioxidant activity of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Jack Fruit) leaf extracts: remarkable attenuations of hyperglycemia and  in streptozotocin-diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>The present study examines the antioxidative, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities of Artocarpus heterophyllus (jack fruit) leaf extracts (JFEs). The 70% ethanol (JFEE), n-butanol (JFBE), water (JFWE), chloroform (JFCE), and ethyl  (JFEAE) extracts were obtained. Both JFEE and JFBE markedly scavenge diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical and chelate Fe+2 in vitro. A compound was isolated from JFBE and identified using 1D and 2D 1H- and 13C-NMR. The administration of JFEE or JFBE to streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) from 200 to 56 and 79 mg%, respectively; elevated insulin from 10.8 to 19.5 and 15.1 µU/ml, respectively; decreased lipid peroxides from 7.3 to 5.4 and 5.9 nmol/ml, respectively; decreased %glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (%HbA1C) from 6.8 to 4.5 and 5.0%, respectively; and increased total protein content from 2.5 to 6.3 and 5.7 mg%, respectively. Triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), VLDL-C, and LDL/HDL ratio significantly declined by -37, -19, -23, -37, and -39%, respectively, in the case of JFEE; and by -31, -14, -17, -31, and -25%, respectively, in the case of JFBE; as compared to diabetic rats. HDL-C increased by +37% (JFEE) and by +11% (JFBE). Both JFEE and JFBE have shown appreciable results in decreasing FBG, lipid peroxides, %HbA1C, TC, LDL-C, and TG levels, and increasing insulin, HDL-C, and protein content. The spectrometric analysis confirmed that the flavonoid isolated from JFBE was isoquercitrin. We can conclude from this study that JFEE and JFBE exert hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in STZ-diabetic rats through an antioxidative pathway that might be referred to their flavonoid contents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21591834>Antihyperlipidemic activity of Ichnocarpus frutescens in triton WR-1339-induced and high-fat diet animals.</a></h2><p>Ichnocarpus frutescens (L.) R.Br. (Apocynaceae) is used to treat diabetes and  in folk medicine.The crude methanol extract and fractions of I. frutescens were investigated for antihyperlipidemic effect.Fresh leaves of I. frutescens were extracted with methanol and fractionated with hexane, benzene, ethyl , acetone, and methanol. The active acetone fraction was subfractionated, which resulted in active fraction 3. The antihyperlipidemic effects of the methanol extract and fractions of I. frutescens were studied in triton WR-1339-induced and high-fat diet (HFD) obese animals. Further, lipid absorption and excretion were studied.The methanol extract significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 29.63% and triglyceride (Tg) by 51.10% at 400 mg/kg in triton WR-1339-induced animals and significantly reduced TC (27.81%) and Tg (37.03%) at 400 mg/kg in HFD animals. Fraction 3 showed significant reduction in TC (25.03%) and Tg (58.05%) at 200 mg/kg. Feeding of HFD consisting 3% of fraction 3 increased feces weight and Tg level in mice.

The level of serum cholesterol was decreased in Gp.NK compared with Gp.HCD (772.8 +/- 70.2 versus 1056.9 +/- 108.3 mg/d), whereas no significant alterations were observed in triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol. NO dependent response stimulated by acetylcholine and calcium ionophore A23187 and tone related basal NO response induced by N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine  were all improved by pitavastatin treatment. Pitavastatin treatment increased the level of cyclic GMP in the aorta of cholesterol fed rabbits. In the aorta, the expression of eNOS mRNA was significantly up regulated and O(2)(-) production was slightly reduced in Gp.NK animals. Atherosclerotic area was significantly decreased in aortic arch and thoracic aorta from Gp.NK compared with those from Gp.HCD ( 15.1 +/- 5.3 versus 41.9 +/- 10.2%, 3.1 +/- 1.1versus 7.9 +/- 1.2% in Gp.NK and Gp.HCD aortic arch and thoracic aorta). Anti-macrophage staining area, the MMP1 or 2 and the nitrotyrosine positive area were decreased in Gp.NK.Pitavastatin retards the progression of atherosclerosis formation and it improves NO bioavailability by eNOS up-regulation and decrease of O(2)(-).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12706470>Estrogen alone or combined with medroxyprogesterone but not raloxifene reduce myocardial infarct size.</a></h2><p>We investigated whether estrogen protects the ischemic myocardium in oophorectomized female rabbits fed with a cholesterol-enriched diet, whether the addition of a progestin compound attenuates the beneficial effect of estrogen and whether raloxifene also limits myocardial necrosis. We treated 32 female oophorectomized hypercholesterolemic rabbits with (a) placebo (N=8, group I), (b) conjugated estrogens alone (N=8, group II), (c) conjugated estrogens combined continuously with medroxyprogesterone  (N=8, group III) and (d) raloxifene (N=8, group IV) all for 4 weeks. All rabbits underwent 30 min of ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Both infarct size (0.38+/-0.08 and 0.45+/-0.05 in groups II and III, respectively, vs. 0.78+/-0.07 in group I, P<0.005) and infarct size/risk zone% (26.34+/-4.18 and 35.01+/-4.39 in groups II and III, respectively, vs. 52.18+/-7.84 in group I, P<0.05) were significantly smaller in the estrogen treatment groups compared to placebo. No significant difference was observed between groups II and III. There was no significant difference between groups I and IV for infarct size (0.78+/-0.07 vs. 0.69+/-0.08, respectively) or for infarct size/risk zone% (52.18+/-7.84 vs. 47.17+/-4.3). Short-term estrogen protects ischemic myocardium in hypercholesterolemic oophorectomized female rabbits; this effect is not attenuated by the addition of a progestin compound. Raloxifene, however, does not decrease infarct size compared to placebo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12753303>Hypertension superimposed on type II diabetes in Goto Kakizaki rats induces progressive nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Type II diabetes in the Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats (derived from Wistar rats) is not associated with the development of obesity, , hypertension, or pronounced renal functional changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of superimposed hypertension on renal function and morphology under conditions of hyper- and normoglycemia.The evolution of biochemical and morphologic renal changes was examined in GK and Wistar rats treated with deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) salt over 24 weeks.Blood pressure was increased from 6 weeks on in GK and Wistar rats with no difference in blood pressure levels between both groups (week 24, 183 +/- 14 mm Hg vs. 191 +/- 13 mm Hg, P = NS, vs. 144 +/- 6 mm Hg in normal controls, P < 0.01). A progressive increase in proteinuria was observed in hypertensive GK rats from 12 weeks on (week 24, 168 +/- 62 mg/day vs. 41 +/- 30 mg/day in hypertensive Wistar rats, P = 0.002). Histologic analysis at weeks 15 and 24 showed progressive glomerulosclerosis in hypertensive GK and Wistar rats (week 24, 13 +/- 4% vs. 8 +/- 1%, P = NS) but not in nonhypertensive GK controls. This was associated with evidence of podocyte damage (de novo desmin expression) in hypertensive as compared to nonhypertensive GK rats (week 24, score 1.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.1, P < 0.001) while no significant increase was observed in hypertensive vs. nonhypertensive Wistar rats. Tubulointerstitial damage was increased in hypertensive GK as compared to hypertensive Wistar rats (week 24, score 1.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.3, P = 0.01). By immunohistochemistry, this was associated with an up-regulation of tubulointerstitial type IV collagen as well as alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, macrophage infiltration and cell proliferation in hypertensive GK rats.Our data demonstrate that long-standing type II diabetes alone is not sufficient to induce progressive nephropathy unless secondary injurious mechanisms such as hypertension are present. The hypertensive GK rat provides a novel model to investigate the mechanisms involved in diabetic nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16100034>Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent stabilization of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor mRNA by herbal medicine berberine.</a></h2><p>Our recent studies identified berberine (BBR) as a novel cholesterol-lowering drug that upregulates low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression through mRNA stabilization. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying regulatory effects of BBR on LDL receptor (LDLR) messenger.We show that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is used primarily by BBR to attenuate the decay of LDLR mRNA in HepG2 cells. Using different reporter constructs, we demonstrate that BBR affects LDLR mRNA stability entirely through 3' untranslated region (UTR) in an ERK-dependent manner, and this stabilizing effect is more prominent in liver-derived cells than nonhepatic cell lines. In contrast to BBR, the mRNA stabilizing effect of bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid is mediated through the LDLR coding sequence, whereas the 5'UTR, 3'UTR, and the coding sequence of LDLR mRNA are all implicated in the action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-. By performing UV cross-linking and SDS-PAGE, we identify 2 cytoplasmic proteins of 52 and 42 kDa that specifically bind to the LDLR 3'UTR in BBR-inducible and ERK-dependent manners.These new findings demonstrate that the BBR-induced stabilization of LDLR mRNA is mediated by the ERK signaling pathway through interactions of cis-regulatory sequences of 3'UTR and mRNA binding proteins that are downstream effectors of this signaling cascade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342070>A porcine model of hypertensive cardiomyopathy: implications for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</a></h2><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) evolves with the accumulation of risk factors. Relevant animal models to identify potential therapeutic targets and to test novel therapies for HFPEF are missing. We induced hypertension and  in landrace pigs (n = 8) by deoxycorticosteroneacetate (DOCA, 100 mg/kg, 90-day-release subcutaneous depot) and a Western diet (WD) containing high amounts of salt, fat, cholesterol, and sugar for 12 wk. Compared with weight-matched controls (n = 8), DOCA/WD-treated pigs showed left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy and left atrial dilatation in the absence of significant changes in LV ejection fraction or symptoms of heart failure at rest. The LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship was markedly shifted leftward. During simultaneous right atrial pacing and dobutamine infusion, cardiac output reserve and LV peak inflow velocities were lower in DOCA/WD-treated pigs at higher LV end-diastolic pressures. In LV biopsies, we observed myocyte hypertrophy, a shift toward the stiffer titin isoform N2B, and reduced total titin phosphorylation. LV superoxide production was increased, in part attributable to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling, whereas AKT and NOS isoform expression and phosphorylation were unchanged. In conclusion, we developed a large-animal model in which loss of LV capacitance was associated with a titin isoform shift and dysfunctional NOS, in the presence of preserved LV ejection fraction. Our findings identify potential targets for the treatment of HFPEF in a relevant large-animal model.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626213>Differing effects of low-dose estrogen-progestin therapy and pravastatin in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women.</a></h2><p>Most studies examining the potential cardioprotective effects of postmenopausal estrogen have been undertaken in healthy women, with doses that may not be appropriate for long-term intervention. New low-dose estrogen-progestin regimens alleviate postmenopausal symptoms with a favorable side-effect profile; however, little is known of the impact of such regimens in women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Hence, we have evaluated the effects of low-dose oral estrogen-progestin therapy on serum lipoprotein lipids, brachial artery reactivity and fibrinogen in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women in direct comparison with the effects of pravastatin, a lipid-lowering agent known to reduce cardiovascular events in women.In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel trial, we studied the effects of continuous combined estrogen-progestin therapy (1 mg 17beta-estradiol with 500 micro g norethisterone  daily) or pravastatin (20 mg daily) in 72 postmenopausal women with fasting serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater than 124 mg/dl after an 8-week run-in diet, over a 24-week period. The primary end-point was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline.The intention-to-treat population comprised 65 women, mean age 59 +/- 6.3 years, and 29 in each group completed the trial. Diet alone reduced LDL cholesterol significantly in both treatment groups, in association with a reduction in weight during this period. Compared with respective baseline values, pravastatin decreased LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol to a greater extent than hormone therapy (p = 0.0001 and 0.003 for difference between treatments, respectively). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels decreased with hormone therapy, but did not change with pravastatin (p = 0.01). Lipoprotein(a) decreased significantly with hormone therapy only (-14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21 to -6%, p = 0.01 for difference between groups). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was impaired at baseline, and this increased with hormone therapy (absolute mean change in artery diameter as percentage units 2.07, 95% CI 0.57-3.57, p = 0.009) versus no change with pravastatin (0.19, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.5, p = 0.78), with a near-significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.058). A significant correlation between improved brachial artery FMD and reduction in LDL cholesterol was not observed. Fibrinogen decreased significantly in both treatment groups with no difference between treatments.In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, pravastatin and hormone therapy exhibited divergent effects. The former lowered total and LDL cholesterol more effectively, whereas hormone therapy lowered lipoprotein(a) significantly and improved brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation, independent of the reduction in LDL cholesterol. The modest increase in brachial artery FMD seen is consistent with hypercholesterolemia compromising endothelial integrity, and suggests that the important effect of estrogen on the endothelial microenvironment may be attenuated in women with endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25947936>Curcumin Ameliorates Lead (Pb(2+))-Induced Hemato-Biochemical Alterations and Renal Oxidative Damage in a Rat Model.</a></h2><p>This study aims to evaluate the protective role of curcumin (Curc) against hematological and biochemical changes, as well as renal pathologies induced by lead  [Pb (CH3COO)2·3H2O] treatment. Male albino rats were intraperitoneally treated with Pb(2+) (25 mg of lead /kg b.w., once a day) alone or in combination with Curc (30 mg of Curc/kg b.w., twice a day) for 7 days. Exposure of rats to Pb(2+) caused significant decreases in hemoglobin (Hb) content, hematocrit (Ht) value, and platelet (Plt) count, while Pb(2+)-related leukocytosis was accompanied by absolute neutrophilia, monocytosis, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia. A significant rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and a marked drop of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were evident in the kidney, liver, and serum of Pb(2+) group compared to that of control. Furthermore, significantly high levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and a sharp drop in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) level were also seen in blood after injection of Pb(2+). Additionally, hepatorenal function tests were enhanced. Meanwhile, Pb(2+) produced marked histo-cytological alterations in the renal cortex. Co-administration of Curc to the Pb(2+)-treated animals restored most of the parameters mentioned above to near-normal levels/features. In conclusion, Curc appeared to be a promising agent for protection against Pb(2+)-induced toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25339541>Robinetinidol-flavone attenuates cholesterol synthesis in hepatoma cells via inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.</a></h2><p>Robinetinidol-(4β,2')-tetrahydroxy-flavone (RBF) is an oligomeric condensed polyphenol that has been shown to exhibit anti-obesity effects in mice. However, little is know regarding its effect on cholesterol synthesis. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the effect of RBF on cholesterol synthesis. It was determined that RBF decreased serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in rats by 25.9 and 50.8%, respectively (P<0.001). These results strengthen evidence for the hypothesis that RBF exerts anti-atherogenic effects in vivo. Furthermore, RBF decreased cholesterol synthesis by 72%, when measured using a 3 h period of radiolabeled  incorporation into cholesterol, but not when using radiolabelled mevalonate, suggesting that RBF-mediated inhibition occurred largely at or above the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) reductase. The mechanism by which RBF inactivates HMG-CoA reductase may be attributed to the induction of phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-kinase, since these results showed that RBF increased phosphorylation of AMP-kinase and HMG-CoA reductase by 2.1- and 3.2-fold, respectively, within 30 min of addition. These results suggest that RBF may be a potential therapeutic agent for hypercholesteremia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12044587>The choice of hormone replacement therapy or statin therapy in the treatment of hyperlipidemic postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Evidence based treatment of cardiovascular risk factors on outcome in women is still inconclusive given the very large numbers needed to achieve a significant difference in cardiovascular event. Although numerous studies of the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on risk factors have suggested benefit, the only data from a randomised control trial of HRT in secondary prevention was neutral. Coronary disease-primary prevention: (a) Statins: Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TEX CAPS). The only randomised controlled trial (RCT) to include women. There were fewer coronary heart disease (CHD) events in women but no difference in mortality. (b) HRT: no completed RCT-the results from Womens Health Initiative (WHI) and Women Intervention Study of Long Duration of Oestrogen in the Menopause (WISDOM) are awaited, the former likely to complete in 2004. There are numerous reports of positive observational epidemiological studies for HRT. There is little evidence for statin use in women who will probably not qualify for treatment on global CHD risk assessment, familial hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes excepted. HRT is, therefore, not only appropriate for its multiple effects on lipoproteins, vascular function and insulin sensitivity but also for prevention of osteoporosis. Coronary disease-(a) Statins: the major measurable effect of these drugs is to reduce total and LDL cholesterol. In RCT trials, the Scandanavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the Cholesterol and Recurrent Event (CARE) and Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID), approximately 20% of subjects were female, in whom CHD events, but not CHD or total mortality were reduced. (b) HRT: there is data available from a single RCT of continuous combined premarin and medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) against placebo, The Heart Estrogen Replacement Study (HERS). A study of 2763 women and mean duration of 4.1 years. This study was neutral, with no reduction in CHD events or mortality. There were more events in the first year, and fewer in years 3-5. Other studies of HRT have been observational and positive for HRT. The effects of treatment on lipoproteins with statins, HRT and combination of statin and HRT have been investigated. In secondary prevention for hyperlipidemic women to achieve cholesterol <5, low density lipoprotein (LDL)<3 mmol/l statins will be first choice, possibly with HRT additionally for its other benefits on cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11759223>[Specificity of lipid and lipoprotein status in healthy students at the University of Novi Sad].</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of hyperlipoproteinemias and normolipidemic dyslipoproteinemias, and distribution of desirable, borderline and high-risk values of certain lipid status parameters in healthy young individuals.In this investigation we examined 213 students of the University of Novi Sad of both genders, 20-30 years of age. Standard biochemical methods were used to determine values of total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and lipoproteins by cellulose  electrophoresis. The level of LDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL cholesterol and total/HDL cholesterol ratios were calculated.In this group hyperlipoproteinemia was established in 42.3% of cases and normolipidemic dyslipoproteinemia in 65.3%. Total serum cholesterol was minimally elevated in 39.0% of tested students, elevated with high risk in 3.3% and triglycerides were minimally elevated in 1.0%. Presence of elevated LDL cholesterol (24.4% minimally and 13.2% with high risk) is remarkably significant. HDL cholesterol is minimally decreased in 54.0% of tested students, and severely in 3.3%.The tested parameters deviate from desirable levels with an alarmingly high frequency, given the fact that this is a group of healthy young individuals with no previous history of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. It can be hypothesized that a joint hyper Lp(a)-lipoproteinemia can exist with a significant occurrence. These results could be associated with similar disorders in families of tested students, unhealthy food habits and lifestyle, use of oral contraceptives and smoking.Our results point to the need for performing gradual laboratory diagnostic procedures for routine check-ups in students.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11269671>Alterations in the oxidative metabolic profile in vascular smooth muscle from hyperlipidemic and diabetic swine.</a></h2><p>High cholesterol, especially LDL cholesterol, has been associated with the development of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries. To investigate the changes in cellular substrate metabolism early in the atherogenic process, Sinclair miniature swine were treated for 12 weeks with either a control diet, a high fat diet, or a high fat diet with the addition of alloxan to induce diabetes. The fractional entry into the TCA cycle of 1,2-(13)C- (5 mM), 1-(13)C-glucose (5 mM), and unlabeled, endogenous lipids was determined in control, hyperlipidemic, and diabetic/hyperlipidemic pigs using 13C-isotopomer analysis of glutamate. The diabetic state of the pigs was validated by plasma glucose measurements made after 10 weeks of alloxan treatment for control (65 +/- 6 mg/dL), hyperlipidemic (63 +/- 5 mg/dL), and diabetic/hyperlipidemic (333 +/- 52 mg/dL) pigs. Plasma glucose values did not correlate with the percentage of glucose entry into the TCA cycle (R2 = 0.0819, n = 10). Alterations in the pattern of substrate oxidation were better correlated with changes in plasma lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) than with changes in plasma glucose. Plasma total cholesterol and total triglyceride levels significantly correlated with changes in  metabolism (R2 = 0.7768 and R2 = 0.4787, respectively) and with changes in glucose metabolism (R2 = 0.6067 and R2 = 0.4506, respectively). We conclude that alterations in lipid profile, especially those that were observed in the diabetic milieu, are associated with early changes in vascular smooth muscle oxidative metabolism. These changes in oxidative metabolism may precede alterations in smooth muscle phenotype and, therefore, may play an important role in the early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15167313>Substitution of transdermal estradiol during oral estrogen-progestin therapy in postmenopausal women: effects on hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>We investigated effects of changing from oral estrogen to transdermal estradiol on the lipid and lipoprotein profile of postmenopausal women who developed hypertriglyceridemia (serum concentrations exceeding 150 mg/dL) during estrogen-progestin therapy.Sixty-one postmenopausal Japanese women receiving 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone  daily for 12 months had developed serum triglyceride concentrations exceeding 150 mg/dL after 12 months of treatment. Thirty-six of them, chosen randomly for study, were assigned at random to either a group that continued this oral regimen or another that changed to transdermal estradiol while continuing 2.5 mg of oral medroxyprogesterone  for the next 3 months (n = 18 for each). Blood lipids were compared between groups.Serum concentrations of triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride decreased significantly after changing to transdermal estradiol (triglyceride, from 226.0 +/- 43.9 to 110.5 +/- 44.1 mg/dL, P < 0.01). No changes were seen in concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Changing to transdermal estradiol may improve triglyceride metabolism in women who developed hypertriglyceridemia during oral estrogen-progestin therapy, with minimal effect on cholesterol profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693157>Lifibrol as a model compound for a novel lipid-lowering mechanism of action.</a></h2><p>Lifibrol is a potent lipid-lowering drug with an unknown mechanism of action. We investigated its effects on lipoprotein and sterol metabolism in normocholesterolemic male participants. Seven participants were treated for 4 weeks with 600 mg/d lifibrol and 9 with 40 mg/d pravastatin in a double-blind randomized parallel-group trial. Kinetic studies were performed at baseline and under acute and chronic treatment. Turnover of apolipoprotein B-100 was investigated with endogenous stable-isotope labeling, and kinetic parameters were derived by multicompartmental modeling. Lathosterol and cholesterol metabolism were investigated using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) after [1-(13)C] labeling. Carbon metabolism was investigated by calculating the total isotope incorporation into newly formed sterols and measuring the disposal of  by (13)CO(2) breath analysis. Total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 18% and 27% under lifibrol and by 17% and 28% under pravastatin, respectively, whereas very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol did not change. Very-low-density lipoprotein apoB fractional synthesis and production increased under lifibrol but remained unchanged under pravastatin. Low-density lipoprotein apoB fractional synthesis and production increased under pravastatin but remained unchanged under lifibrol. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis indicated that both drugs decrease endogenous sterol synthesis after acute administration, but pravastatin had more powerful effects. Carbon-13 appearance in breath was higher during pravastatin than during lifibrol treatment. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis and carbon metabolism analysis indicated compartmentalization at the site of sterol synthesis, thus suggesting differential effects of the 2 drugs. Although having comparable lipid-lowering properties, lifibrol seems to have a mechanism of action distinct from that of statins. Lifibrol could serve as a model compound for the development of new lipid-lowering agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11882599>Lysophosphatidylcholine inhibits insulin-induced Akt activation through protein kinase C-alpha in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>To better understand the intracellular signaling mechanism that causes the association of insulin resistance and  with cardiovascular diseases, we specifically looked at the ability of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) to inhibit the Akt activation induced by insulin in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. LysoPC inhibited the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, and the inhibition was concentration dependent. Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, inhibited the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. LysoPC stimulated PKC phosphorylation at Ser660, which was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. The PKC-alpha/beta-selective inhibitor Go6976 also blocked the PMA- and lysoPC-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by insulin. PKC-alpha, but not PKC-beta, is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and overexpression of PKC-alpha, but not PKC-beta or PKC-delta, inhibited insulin-induced Akt activation. LysoPC rapidly stimulated PKC-alpha translocation to the membrane. In contrast, pretreatment with the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 or the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 did not block the lysoPC-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by insulin. In addition, lysoPC inhibited the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 but not that of the insulin receptor beta subunit or insulin binding. PMA treatment or PKC-alpha overexpression also inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. From these data, we conclude that lysoPC negatively regulates the insulin signal at the point of IRS-1 through PKC-alpha in the vasculature, which may explain the association of  with hyperinsulinemia in cardiovascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12218725>Combination therapy of low-dose medroxyprogesterone  and oral estrogen does not affect endothelial function in the forearms of postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>We investigated whether low-dose medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) combined with oral estrogen had adverse effects on endothelial function compared with oral estrogen alone in postmenopausal women with mild hypercholesterolemia.Subjects were divided into two groups. One group received conjugated equine estrogen (CEE, 0.625 mg daily) orally for the first 3 months, followed by estrogen combined with MPA (2.5 mg daily) orally for an additional 3 months ( = 26). The other group received no treatment (control group, = 12). Forearm blood flow (FBF) during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual nitroglycerin administration was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Nitrite/nitrate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and lipid concentrations were measured in the serum.Both CEE and CEE combined with MPA significantly increased the FBF during reactive hyperemia. This increase was similar in both active treatment phases. No changes were seen in controls. FBF after sublingual nitroglycerin did not change over 6 months in either group. Significant and similar increases in serum concentration of nitrite/nitrate and plasma renin activity as well as decreases in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity were found in both treatment phases. No such changes occurred in the control group. There was no significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol between the treatment phases. Likewise, no such changes were observed in the control group.Our 6-month study suggests that the addition of low-dose MPA with CEE had no adverse effects on forearm resistance artery endothelial function compared with CEE alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10846625>Comparative evaluation of different rat models with co-existing diabetes-mellitus and hypertension.</a></h2><p>We have evaluated the suitability of different rat models for the study of effects of antihypertensives on cardiovascular and metabolic complications of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. IDDM was induced in Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats by single tail vein injection of STZ (45 mg/kg, i.v.). Neonatal STZ-diabetes (nSTZ) was induced by administering STZ, 70 mg/kg (i.p.) to 5 day old Wistar rat pups. DOCA-hypertension was induced in Wistar and STZ-diabetic rats using deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA, 5 mg/kg, s.c.) and NaCl (2%) in drinking water. Intravenous injection of STZ produced cardinal signs of diabetes mellitus including hyperglycemia, loss of body weight, polyphagia and polydipsia. STZ-diabetic rats also showed  and hypoinsulinemia. STZ-treated rats developed hypertension and bradycardia. nSTZ rats were found to have mild hyperglycemia and were hypertensive and hyperinsulinemic. The OGTT and ITT revealed that nSTZ rats are insulin resistant. SH rats were also found to be hyperinsulinemic and hypertensive. Although, these rats were found to be insulin resistant, they did not demonstrate hyperglycemia. DOCA-treated STZ-diabetic rats were found to have milder hyperglycemia when compared to STZ-diabetic rats not treated with DOCA. Although, DOCA treatment was not found to alter serum levels of glucose and insulin, results of OGTT revealed enhanced glucose disposal in DOCA-treated Wistar rats, suggesting that DOCA probably produces some effect on glucose homeostasis in rats. The present data also suggest that STZ-diabetic rat may be considered a suitable model for IDDM. On the other hand, nSTZ and SH rats were hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant and may be used as models to study insulin sensitivity. DOCA-hypertensive rat may not be a suitable model for studying the effects of various drug interventions on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity as DOCA itself appears to influence these factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24171681>Cholesterol- and lanolin-rich diets may protect against steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rabbits.</a></h2><p>It remains controversial how hypercholesterolemia influences the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis (ON). We investigated the role of hypercholesterolemia induced by a cholesterol-rich diet on the development of ON in rabbits.40 adult male Japanese white rabbits were randomly divided into 2 groups. 20 rabbits were maintained on a cholesterol-rich diet for 2 weeks before receiving steroid treatment (the CHOL group). The other 20 rabbits were maintained on a standard diet (the control (CTR) group). 2 weeks after the start of the study, all 40 rabbits were injected with methylprednisolone  (MPSL) into the right gluteus medius muscle (20 mg/kg body weight). 2 weeks after the steroid injection, both the femora and humeri were examined histopathologically for the presence of ON. Hematological analysis of the serum lipid levels was performed every week. Based on the same protocol, we also investigated the effects of lanolin, a primary component of a cholesterol-rich diet, in another group (the LA group).The incidence of ON in the CHOL group (3/20) was lower than that observed in the CTR group (15/20) (p < 0.001). During the whole experiment, the levels of total cholesterol and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein in the CHOL group were higher than those observed in the CTR group (p < 0.001). The LA group also had a lower incidence of ON (2/20), and the lipid levels in the LA group showed similar changes to those observed in the CHOL group.Our findings suggest that preexisting hypercholesterolemia itself induced by a cholesterol-rich diet does not increase the risk of developing steroid-induced ON, but rather seems to diminish it. Lanolin may be the active anti-ON component of the cholesterol diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11064500>Osteonecrosis in HIV: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) has been infrequently reported in HIV-infected patients. It is not known whether HIV itself is an independent risk factor for osteonecrosis.We identified 25 patients with osteonecrosis from 1984 to 1999 from a large county teaching hospital and two large practices in Dallas County that specialize in HIV-disease related therapy. A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate potential risk factors for osteonecrosis. Each case was matched with two controls for HIV positive status and date of osteonecrosis diagnosis.In the study, 22 of 25 (88%) case patients had at least one osteonecrosis risk factor compared with 24 of 50 (48%) controls, p =.003. The most common osteonecrosis risk factors were  (32%), alcoholism (28%), pancreatitis (16%), corticosteroids (12%), and hypercoaguability (12%). Of the cases, 12% were idiopathic. Multiple joints were involved in 72% of cases. Four of the case patients compared with none of the controls received megesterol  before the diagnosis of osteonecrosis, p =.01. No significant differences were found between cases and controls with respect to liver function tests, testosterone levels, triglyceride levels, cholesterol levels, or CD4 cell counts. Saquinavir was independently associated with osteonecrosis, p <.05. However, no differences in overall use of protease inhibitors among cases and controls were noted: 79% versus 76%, respectively.The increased incidence of osteonecrosis in HIV/AIDS may be due to an increased frequency of risk factors previously associated with osteonecrosis such as , corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, and hypercoaguability. Use of protease inhibitors was not independently associated with osteonecrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22856453>Anti-atherogenic effects of a phenol-rich fraction from Brazilian red wine (Vitis labrusca L.) in hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice.</a></h2><p>Moderate wine intake (i.e., 1-2 glasses of wine a day) is associated with a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effects of a nonalcoholic ethyl  fraction (EAF) from a South Brazilian red wine obtained from Vitis labrusca grapes. Experiments were carried out on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor knockout (LDLr⁻/⁻) mice, which were subjected to a hypercholesterolemic diet and treated with doses of EAF (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the level of plasma lipids, the vascular reactivity, and the atherosclerotic lesions were evaluated. Our results demonstrated that the treatment with EAF at 3 mg/kg significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL plus very low-density lipoprotein levels compared with control hypercholesterolemic mice. The treatment of mice with EAF at 3 mg/kg also preserved the vasodilatation induced by acetylcholine on isolated thoracic aorta from hypercholesterolemic LDLr⁻/⁻ mice. This result is in agreement with the degree of lipid deposit on arteries. Taken together, the results show for the first time that the lowest concentration of an EAF obtained from a red wine produced in southern Brazil significantly reduced the progression of atherosclerosis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930470>Pyrroloquinoline quinone-secreting probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 ameliorates ethanol-induced oxidative damage and  in rats.</a></h2><p>Chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption is associated with oxidative tissue damage, decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities, and increase in hepatic and plasma lipids. This study investigates the effect of modified probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) secreting pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) against EtOH-induced metabolic disorder in rats.Male Charles Foster rats were gavaged with EtOH (5 g/kg body weight [acute study] and 3 g/kg body weight per day for 10 weeks [chronic study]).Pretreatment of PQQ, vitamin C, and PQQ-secreting EcN prevented acute EtOH-induced oxidative damage in rats reflected by reduced lipid peroxidation in blood and liver and increased hepatic reduced glutathione. However, PQQ given externally was found to be most effective against acute EtOH toxicity. In the chronic study, rats treated with PQQ-secreting EcN showed remarkable reduction in oxidative tissue damage (liver, colon, blood, and kidney) with significant increase in antioxidant enzyme activities as compared to only EtOH-treated rats. Additionally, these rats had significantly lowered hepatic and plasma lipid levels with concomitant reduction in mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (0.5-fold) and increase in mRNA expression of acyl coenzyme A oxidase (2.4-fold) in hepatic tissue. Antioxidant and hyperlipidemic effects of PQQ-secreting EcN are correlated with increased colonic short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e., , propionate, and butyrate) levels, and PQQ concentration in fecal samples (2-fold) and liver (4-fold). Extracted PQQ and vitamin C were given once a week, but they did not exhibit any ameliorative effect against chronic EtOH toxicity.Accumulated PQQ in tissues prevents hepatic and systemic oxidative damage. PQQ along with SCFAs reduced , which can be correlated with changes in mRNA expression of hepatic lipid metabolizing genes. Our study suggests that endogenous generation of PQQ by EcN could be an effective strategy in preventing alcoholic liver disease.Copyright © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12524654>Disturbed regulation of cholesterol synthesis in monocytes of obese patients with hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to clarify the influence of obesity on the functions of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-coenyzme A (HMG-CoA) reductase both in healthy control subjects and in patients with hypercholesterolemia (HC). Experiments were performed on monocytes of 15 non-obese (C I) and 11 obese (C II) healthy control subjects and on 22 non-obese (HC I) and 26 obese (HC II) patients with HC. [(125)I]LDL was used to determine LDL-R activity by measuring binding and intracellular degradation. The rate of endogenous cholesterol synthesis was measured using [(14)C] incorporation into the cholesterol fraction of monocytes. The binding ability of [(125)I]LDL was identical across all groups. The [(14)C] incorporation in resting monocytes was increased only in obese HC group. The 50-microg/mL LDL protein-induced inhibition of [(14)C] incorporation was significantly diminished (P <.001) in the same group. A strong positive correlation was detected between the [(14)C] incorporation by resting cells and LDL-induced inhibition in all groups except the obese HC group, in which their correlation was negative (P <.001). Furthermore, in the obese HC group, a significant positive correlation was detected between body mass index (BMI) and the basal level of [(14)C] incorporation, whereas a negative correlation was found between BMI and LDL-induced inhibition of [(14)C] incorporation. The present data suggest that in patients with HC the concomitant obesity results in dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis, which may contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis.Copyright 2003, Elsevier Science (USA).

Alisol B 23-, one of the abundant triterpenes in ZX, was used as the marker of quality control for ZX in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while it could not reflect the lipid-lowering effect because other triterpenes in ZX also had prominent medicinal efficacy. To identify the significantly bioactive triterpenes in ZX, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based characteristic chemical profile (CCP)-support vector machine (SVM) model was used to explore the relationship between triterpenes and lipid-lowering effect of ZX. Firstly, the content of 87 targeted triterpenes was quantified by the MRM-based CCP using UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS. Secondly, the lipid-lowering effect of 30 ZX samples was assessed by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Thirdly, 9 of the 87 triterpenes possessing high mean impact value were identified to have significant lipid-lowering effect via the particle swarm-optimized SVM model. The new SVM model constructed by the 9 triterpenes showed good prediction performance and the overall prediction accuracy reached 81.94%. Finally, the real activity of these triterpenes was partly confirmed and was consistent with the prediction of SVM. These results showed that the method for discovery of triterpenes with prominent lipid-lowering activity in ZX was reliable. The proposed method is expected to provide an efficient and rapid approach for screening of active component and drug discovery in traditional herbs.

We investigated the effects of PON1 levels, activity, and genetic variation on high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, circulating oxidized LDL (OxLDL), subclinical inflammation [high-sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP)], and carotid atherosclerosis. PON1 genotypes (L55M, Q192R, -107C/T, -162A/G, -824G/A, and -907G/C) were determined in 302 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. PON1 activity was monitored by the hydrolysis rate of paraoxon, diazoxon, and phenyl . PON1 levels, OxLDL, and Hs-CRP were determined using an immunoassay. The genetic variants of PON1 that were associated with high levels and activity of the enzyme were associated with higher HDL-C levels (P values for trend: 0.008, 0.020, 0.042, and 0.037 for L55M, Q192R, -107C/T, and -907G/C, respectively).

Here, we have studied the long-term effects of vitamins C and E on plasma F2-isoprostanes, a widely used marker of lipid peroxidation in vivo. As a study cohort, a subset of the "Antioxidant Supplementation in Atherosclerosis Prevention" (ASAP) study was used. ASAP is a double-masked placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to study the long-term effect of vitamin C (500 mg of slow release ascorbate daily), vitamin E (200 mg of D-alpha-tocopheryl  daily), both vitamins (CellaVie), or placebo on lipid peroxidation, atherosclerotic progression, blood pressure and myocardial infarction (n = 520 at baseline). Lipid peroxidation measurements were carried out in 100 consecutive men at entry and repeated at 12 months. The plasma F2-isoprostane concentration was lowered by 17.3% (95% CI 3.9-30.8%) in the vitamin E group (p = 0.006 for the change, as compared with the placebo group). On the contrary, vitamin C had no significant effect on plasma F2-isoprostanes as compared with the placebo group. There was also no interaction in the effect between these vitamins. In conclusion, long-term oral supplementation of clinically healthy, but hypercholesterolemic men, who have normal vitamin C and E levels with a reasonable dose of vitamin E lowers lipid peroxidation in vivo, but a relatively high dose of vitamin C does not. This observation may provide a mechanism for the observed ability of vitamin E supplements to prevent atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639479>Evaluation of Medicago sativa L. sprouts as antihyperlipidemic and antihyperglycemic agent.</a></h2><p>Medicago sativa L.

This study was designed to investigate the potential antihyperlipidemic and antihyperglycemic activity of M. sativa sprouts in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes via i.p. injection of 55 mg/kg of STZ. Experimental animals were divided into the following groups: GP1 (normal), GP2 (STZ-hyperlipidemic), GP3 (rouvastatin), GP4 (metformin), GP 5-9 (diabetic treated with methanolic, petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl  and butanol extracts). The administration of the total methanolic extract (500 mg/kg), the petroleum ether (32.5mg) and butanol fractions (60 mg) for 4 weeks significantly decreased (p<0.05) triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in comparison to rouvastatin. Petroleum ether fraction proved to exhibit the best activity as antihyperlipidemic agent (12.23%). On the other hand, ethyl  fraction retained the best activity (vs. metformin) as antihyperglycemic agent. Histopathological evidences on liver, pancreas and spleen were in agreement with the above mentioned results.

Both menopause and hypercholesterolemia are associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased coronary risk. Forearm blood flow (FBF) during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) administration was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Treated women received conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone  (2.5 mg) daily for 6 months. Nitrite/nitrate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and lipids were measured in serum. FBF during reactive hyperemia as well as serum nitrite/nitrate concentrations were significantly lower in hypercholesterolemic than normocholesterolemic subjects. Increases in the FBF induced by NTG were similar in the two groups. HRT significantly increased estradiol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum nitrite/nitrate, while decreasing circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in both groups. Reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was seen only in hypercholesterolemic subjects. After 6 months of HRT, maximal FBF response during reactive hyperemia increased in both groups. Augmentation of this response was greater in hypercholesterolemic than in normocholesterolemic subjects (maximal FBF, 55.4 +/- 11.2 vs. 25.9 +/- 11.5%; P < 0.05). Changes in the FBF with NTG were not altered by HRT in either group. Long-term HRT augments endothelial function in forearm resistance artery.

Previously, we have shown that camphene, a constituent of mastic gum oil, lowers cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) in the plasma of hyperlipidemic rats without affecting HMG-CoA reductase activity, suggesting that its hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects are associated with a mechanism of action different than that of statins. In the present study, we examine the mechanism by which camphene exerts its hypolipidemic action. We evaluated the effect of camphene on the de novo synthesis of cholesterol and TG from [14C]- in HepG2 cells, along with the statin mevinolin. Camphene inhibited the biosynthesis of cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner, and a maximal inhibition of 39% was observed at 100 μM while mevinolin nearly abolished cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, treatment with camphene reduced TG by 34% and increased apolipoprotein AI expression. In contrast, mevinolin increased TG by 26% and had a modest effect on apolipoprotein AI expression. To evaluate the mode of action of camphene, we examined its effects on the expression of SREBP-1, which affects TG biosynthesis and SREBP-2, which mostly affects sterol synthesis. Interestingly, camphene increased the nuclear translocation of the mature form of SREBP-1 while mevinolin was found to increase the amount of the mature form of SREBP-2. The effect of camphene is most likely regulated through SREBP-1 by affecting MTP levels in response to a decrease in the intracellular cholesterol.

Each treatment period was 8 weeks long with a 4 week washout interval between treatments. Circulating cell adhesion molecules and plasma lipids were evaluated at the end of each treatment period.All three active treatments--simvastatin, hormone replacement therapy and the combination therapy--significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol, compared to placebo (P<0.001). Only hormone replacement therapy, alone and in combination with simvastatin, significantly decreased lipoprotein(a) when compared to placebo (P<0.05), whereas simvastatin had no significant effect. Likewise, hormone replacement therapy and the combination therapy significantly reduced the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) plasma levels (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively), while simvastatin, which was superior to hormone replacement therapy in lowering total and LDL cholesterol, did not modify ICAM-1 levels; the combination therapy was not more effective than hormone replacement therapy alone in ICAM-1 reduction. Neither the effect, on any treatment when compared to placebo, of VCAM-1 nor E-selectin levels differed significantly.Hormone replacement therapy may limit the inflammatory response to injury by modulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules from the endothelial cells, possibly in association with lipoprotein (a) reduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487906>EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE HYDRO-ETHANOLIC ROOT EXTRACT OF  ON HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN CYCLOPHOSPAMIDE TREATED RATS.</a></h2><p>The use of cyclophosphamide in cancer therapy is usually associated with challenging immunosuppression which exposes patients to increased risk of anemia and necessitating preventive measures during therapy. This study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of the hydro-ethanolic extract of the root of  in preventing and/or improving cyclophosphamide induced myelosuppression and oxidative stress in rats.Animals were divided into 6 groups of 6 rats each and were pretreated oral doses of 75, 150 and 225 mg/kg of the extract for 7 days and then co-administered with 2.5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide for 28 days.The LD of the extract was found to be 1682.3 mg/kg. Phytochemical analysis of the plant extract showed the presence of tannins, saponins, alkaloids and flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids and phenols. In the anti-oxidant enzyme assay, CAT was significantly ( < 0.05) increased for animals treated with 150 mg/kg+CP compared to 75 mg/kg+CP and 225 mg/kg+CP. GPx was significantly ( < 0.01) increased in rats treated with 75 mg/kg+CP compared to 150 mg/kg+CP and control. SOD was significantly ( < 0.01) increased in rats treated with 75 mg/kg+CP compared to the control. WBC was significantly ( < 0.05) reduced for 225 mg/kg, 225 mg/kg+CP ( < 0.001), 150 mg/kg+CP ( < 0.001), 75 mg/kg+CP ( < 0.001) and CP administered rats ( < 0.001) respectively compared to the control. LDL and CHOL were significantly reduced ( < 0.05) for rats treated with 75 mg/kg+CP, 225 mg/kg+CP and 225 mg/kg.Findings from this study demonstrates that the hydro-ethanolic root extract of  could be beneficial in  and in cases of malignancies with abnormal cholesterol metabolism an effect which may be mediated via combating oxidative stress.

Recent studies suggest an important role of leptin in obesity associated complications. We investigated the effect of chronic hyperleptinemia on two antioxidant enzymes contained in plasma lipoproteins: paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). The study was performed on three groups of male Wistar rats: (1) control, fed ad libitum, (2) leptin treated, receiving leptin (0.25 mg/kg twice daily s.c. for 7 days), (3) pair-fed, in which food intake was identical as in leptin-treated animals. PON1 activity toward paraoxon, phenyl , gamma-decanolactone and homogentisic acid lactone was lower in leptin-treated than in control group by 30.4, 30.8, 34.5 and 62%, respectively. Leptin increased plasma concentration and urinary excretion of isoprostanes by 46.4 and 49.2%, respectively. Leptin treatment had no effect on plasma lipid profile and glucose level. Plasma leptin was 208.8% higher in leptin-treated and 51.5% lower in pair-fed than in control group. These data indicate that hyperleptinemia induced by exogenous leptin administration markedly decreases plasma PON1 activity and induces oxidative stress. These mechanisms may be involved in atherogenesis in hyperleptinemic obese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459037>Hypolipidemic effects of Myrica rubra extracts and main compounds in C57BL/6j mice.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluated the antihyperlipidemic activity of myricetin, myricetrin, the alcohol fraction (AF) and the ethyl  fraction (EF) obtained from the bark of Myrica rubra (MR) in high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC) induced hyperlipidemic C57BL/6j mice. Mice were treated with myricetin, myricetrin, AF and EF with a dose of 130 mg per kg per day for 35 days. After treatment, serum parameters including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total bile acids (TBA), etc., were examined. The results revealed that EF showed the highest weight lowering activity (P < 0.01). All tested samples decreased the levels of the TC, TG, LDL-C, TBA and LPS (lipopolysaccharide) content in the serum of mice to different extents. Liver fat deposition was significantly reduced after myricetin, myricetrin, AF and EF therapy (P < 0.01). Additionally, the cell size of epididymal adipose tissue was also decreased in myricetin, AF and EF groups (P < 0.05). The antihyperlipidemic activity of these samples may be attributed to the inhibition of lipid synthesis via suppressing the expression of HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) and ACC1 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), promoting the metabolism and excretion of lipids via up-regulating the expression of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element binding proteins), LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor), UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) and CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase). These results may provide a powerful foundation for seeking and utilizing Myrica rubra bio-active compounds for the treatment of  and cardiovascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16338199>Guggul for : a review by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the scientific evidence on guggul for  including expert opinion, folkloric precedent, history, pharmacology, kinetics/dynamics, interactions, adverse effects, toxicology, and dosing.Electronic searches were conducted in nine databases, 20 additional journals (not indexed in common databases), and bibliographies from 50 selected secondary references.

At this time, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of guggul for any medical condition. Guggul may cause stomach discomfort or allergic rash as well as other serious side effects and interactions. It should be avoided in pregnant or breast-feeding women and in children.

As glucocorticoid replacement is associated with a pronounced decrease in plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, we also tested associations of HDL cholesterol with the -629C>A CETP promoter polymorphism in subjects with and without ACTH deficiency.In a university setting, we retrieved protocolized clinical and laboratory data from 165 adult hypopituitary patients, who had received GH for 1 year.After adjustment for age, sex and smoking, non-HDL cholesterol (P = 0.05) and triglycerides (P = 0.004) were higher, but HDL cholesterol was not decreased in 117 glucocorticoid (mainly cortisone  in two divided doses) receiving subjects compared to 48 ACTH-sufficient subjects. The prevalence of elevated plasma glucose and/or diabetes (P = 0.04) and hypertriglyceridaemia (P = 0.005), but not of other metabolic syndrome components, was higher in glucocorticoid-replaced subjects. HDL cholesterol was higher in -629 A allele carriers compared to -629CC homozygotes in ACTH-sufficient subjects (P = 0.04), but not in glucocorticoid-treated subjects (P = 0.13). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that only in ACTH-sufficient subjects, HDL cholesterol was independently related to this CETP gene variation (P = 0.03).In GH- and glucocorticoid-replaced hypopituitary patients, serum non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are higher and the prevalence of hyperglycaemia is increased, but HDL cholesterol is not decreased.

This study investigated the anti-diabetic potential of OG leaf fractions (OGLF) in a rat model of Type-2 diabetes (T2D). : Methanol crude extract of OG leaf was fractionated with solvents of increasing order of polarity (-hexane, chloroform, ethyl-, -butanol and water). The anti-diabetic potential of the fractions was evaluated in vivo. T2D was induced in Albino Wistar rats and treated with OGLF. : The T2D rats showed significant elevation in serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), liver and kidney function biomarkers. At 4-weeks of intervention with OGLF, the untreated diabetic control group maintained severe hyperglycaemia in the presence of 61.7% serum insulin, 17.3% pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA-β) and 51.5% Insulin sensitivity. The glucose tolerance ability was enhanced in the -butanol-fraction (OGb) treated group. With 74.8% available serum insulin and 38.6% improvement in insulin sensitivity, the OGb treated group had a 63.5% reduction in FBG and it was found to be most effective as it ameliorates a majority of the changes caused in the studied parameters in diabetic rats. : The data from this study suggest that OGb fraction is a potential candidate for the development of an effective drug for the management of T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16392818>Influence of various central moieties on the hypolipidemic properties of long hydrocarbon chain diols and diacids.</a></h2><p>A series of long (11-15) hydrocarbon chain diols and diacids with various central functional groups and terminal gem-dimethyl or -methyl/aryl substituents was synthesized and evaluated in both in vivo and in vitro assays for its potential to favorably alter lipid disorders including metabolic syndrome.

Those who discontinued DMPA were followed for up to 2 additional years. Participants completed questionnaires containing demographic and behavioral measures every 6 months and underwent 24-hour dietary recalls annually. Mixed-model regression analyses and general-estimating-equations procedures were used to estimate changes over time in lipids by method along with their predictors.Users of OCs experienced significantly greater increases in levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol than did nonhormonal-contraceptive users (P<.001). However, no difference was noted in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol:HDL ratio between OC users and nonhormonal-contraceptive users. Among DMPA users, HDL levels initially decreased for 6 months but then returned to baseline. The LDL:HDL ratio rose in the first 6 months of DMPA use but then dropped back to baseline over the next 24 months. After DMPA was discontinued, triglyceride, VLDL, and HDL levels were significantly higher in women who used OCs than in those who chose nonhormonal (P<.05) methods.Use of very-low-dose OCs containing desogestrel can elevate lipid levels. Users of DMPA were at increased risk of developing an abnormally low HDL level as well as an abnormally high LDL level and an increase in the LDL:HDL cholesterol ratio, although these effects appeared to be temporary.II.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28105139>Baicalin promotes cholesterol efflux by regulating the expression of SR-BI in macrophages.</a></h2><p>Intake of a high dosage of baicalin has previously been shown to attenuate  induced by a high-fat diet. Baicalin functions as an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which is the key regulator of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that baicalin could promote cholesterol efflux in macrophages through activating PPAR-γ. Phorbol 12-myristate 13--stimulated THP-1 cells were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein and (H)-cholesterol for 24 h, and the effects of baicalin on cholesterol efflux were evaluated in the presence of apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1), or high-density lipoprotein subfraction 2 (HDL) or subfraction 3 (HDL). The expression levels of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), PPAR-γ and liver X receptor-α (LXRα) were detected and specific inhibitors or activators of SR-BI, PPAR-γ and LXRα were applied to investigate the mechanism. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with baicalin significantly accelerated HDL-mediated, but not ApoA-1-mediated cholesterol efflux. However, baicalin treatment increased the expression of SR-BI at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and pre-treatment with the SR-BI inhibitor BLT-1 and SR-BI small interfering RNA significantly inhibited baicalin-induced cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, baicalin increased the expression of PPAR-γ and LXRα, and the application of specific agonists and inhibitors of PPAR-γ and LXRα changed the expression of SR-BI, as well as cholesterol efflux. It may be concluded that baicalin induced cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages via the PPAR-γ/LXRα/SR-BI pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961702>Alisol A 24- Isolated from the Alismatis Rhizoma Improves Hepatic Lipid Deposition in Hyperlipidemic Mice by ABCA1/ABCG1 Pathway.</a></h2><p>The Alisol A 24- is an effective component of the Alismatis Rhizoma (AR) extract, which is often used in the treatment of . This study explored the effect and mechanism of the Alisol A 24- from AR on lipid deposition in the liver of hyperlipidemic mice. After establishing hyperlipidemic mouse model (Model) by oral high-fat diet (HFD), the animals were treated with Alisol A 24- for 4 weeks. The changes of blood lipid in mice were detected by ELISA. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to evaluate the degree of liver lipid deposition in hyperlipidemic mice. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of ABCG1 and ABCA1 mRNA in the liver. The expression of ABCG1 and ABCA1 protein was detected by Western blotting (WB). After 4 weeks of high-fat diet, the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C in the mouse were increased, and the HDL-C level was decreased. After treatment with Alisol A 24-, the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C in the blood of hyperlipidemic mouse were significantly reduced, and the level of HDL-C was increased. The results of H&E staining showed that the lipid deposition in the liver of hyperlipidemic mouse was improved after treatment with Alisol A 24-. RT-qPCR and WB analysis documented that ABCG1 and ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression in hyperlipidemic mice were promoted after the Alisol A 24- treatment. In conclusion, Alisol A 24- effectively alleviates the liver lipid deposition in hyperlipidemic mice, and this effect is achieved mostly by promoting the expression of ABCG1 and ABCA1 at the mRNA and protein levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19099225>Anti-hyperlipidemic effect of an edible brown algae, Ecklonia stolonifera, and its constituents on poloxamer 407-induced hyperlipidemic and cholesterol-fed rats.</a></h2><p>We conducted this study to isolate novel anti-hyperlipidemic agents derived from natural marine products.

However, treatment with the water (H(2)O) fraction did not exert any significant effects on the serum levels of hyperlipidemic rats. In addition, eckol and dieckol isolated from the active EtOAc fraction induced a significant reduction in serum TG, TC, and LDL-C levels, as well as in the atherogenic index (A.I.). Furthermore, treatment with dieckol induced a greater decrease in the serum TG, TC, and LDL-C levels of hyperlipidemic rats than eckol or lovastatin, as well as an increase in the serum HDL-C levels.

However, additional effects of alpha-tocopherol at the intracellular level may contribute to the clinical outcome of intervention studies.We investigated whether alpha-tocopherol influences the inflammatory responses of immune cells in normolipidemic and hypertriglyceridemic subjects.RRR-alpha-Tocopherol was administered for 6 wk at a dose of 600 IU (402 mg)/d to 12 primary hypertriglyceridemic and 8 normolipidemic (fasting triacylglycerol >3.0 and <2.0 mmol/L, respectively) subjects. Cytokine production [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-8] by mononuclear cells and superoxide production by polymorphonuclear cells and in diluted whole blood were determined before and after the intervention.Cytokine and superoxide production did not differ significantly between hypertriglyceridemic and normolipidemic subjects. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the concentration of alpha-tocopherol in plasma and LDL. Whereas superoxide production in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13- decreased in all subjects, response to oxidized LDL increased in 19 of 20 subjects.

Modulation of the intestinal microbial ecosystem (IME), in principle, can ameliorate lipid profiles. In this study, we characterized the IME of children and adolescents with primary  by analyzing fecal samples through 16S rRNA gene profiling (n = 15) and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) quantification (n = 32). The same analyses were also carried out on age-matched normolipidemic controls (n = 15). Moreover, we evaluated the modulatory effect of regular hazelnut intake (approximately 0.43 g of hazelnuts with skin per kg of body weight) on the IME of 15 children and adolescents with  for eight weeks. We found alterations of numerous operational taxonomic units potentially associated with SCFA-producing bacteria and reductions in the fecal levels of , butyrate and propionate in hyperlipidemic subjects. Furthermore, we observed that an eight-week hazelnut intervention may induce limited changes in fecal microbiota composition but can significantly modulate the fecal levels of predominant intestinal SCFAs, such as . Finally, correlation analyses indicated that changes in lipidemic parameters are linked to modifications of the abundance of specific bacterial taxa, such as the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and the genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium. This study suggests that children and adolescents with primary  possess an altered IME. The promising results presented here support the need for future dietary interventions aimed at positively modulating the IME of hyperlipidemic subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12469898>Reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes in populations at risk for atherosclerotic disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in circulating leukocytes in populations at risk for atherosclerosis compared with in healthy individuals. The study populations consisted of 27 non-diabetic men (aged 40-69 years) with untreated hypercholesterolemia (HC), 13 individuals (aged 39-56 years) with well-controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), and 20 healthy individuals (aged 26-61 years) (REF). Citrated whole blood was collected in fasting condition. Using flow cytometric techniques, the resting levels and the response upon phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA, 100 ng/mL) stimulation of ROS were measured in circulating monocytes (MO) and granulocytes (GR). The relative mean fluorescence intensity (rMFI) in 10(4) leukocytes of fluorochromes mainly reflecting the levels of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2-) was recorded. Significantly, higher basal levels of ONOO- in GR from the combined risk population compared with REF were found (1.4 vs. 1.5 rMFI, p<0.05). Upon PMA stimulation, significantly lower levels of O2 in GR in the risk populations compared to REF (119 vs. 90 Si, p<0.001) were observed. In conclusion, increased resting levels of ROS in circulating granulocytes, but reduced response to PMA stimulation could be demonstrated in populations at risk for atherosclerosis compared with in healthy individuals. This might indicate a higher degree of resting oxidative reactions, with partly exhausted cells and less capacity to host defence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15828232>[ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)--regulation of the PPARalpha gene by CLOCK: BMAL1].</a></h2><p>The main pathological findings in atherosclerosis include abnormal reactions of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells, and the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial wall. Therefore, investigating the effects of these abnormal reactions on the arterial wall may improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. Three types of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs): PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma are expressed in endothelial cells. In endothelial cells, the ligands/activators for PPARalpha and PPARgamma increase Cu2+, Zn2+ -superoxide dismutase. In addition, the phorbol myristate  (PMA)-stimulated 22 kDa-subunit (p22phox) protein levels and 47 kDa-subunit (p47phox) protein levels in NADPH (superoxide generating enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form)) oxidase were decreased by treatment with PPARalpha and PPARgamma ligands/activators. Recently, we showed that the CLOCK: BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the PPARalpha gene via promoter of PPARalpha. Moreover, we report a patient with severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with anemia and hypoalbuminemia, in which the former may have caused the latter two conditions. This is the first reported case of abrupt onset of severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting in suppression of bone marrow and liver function. Here, based on recent studies including our own, we describe the relationships between risk factors for atherosclerosis, especially  and PPARs and the molecular mechanisms that govern lipid metabolism in the arteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12082364>Cyproterone  could counteract the benefits of estradiol valerate in oophorectomized cholesterol-fed rabbits.</a></h2><p>The administration of hormonal replacement treatment to women with an intact uterus needs to be supplemented with progestogenic compounds to avoid endometrial hyperplasia. However, progestins may cancel the beneficial effects of estrogens on the cardiovascular system. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of adding cyproterone  to estradiol (E(2))on aorta atherogenesis.Thirty-two cholesterol-fed New Zealand white rabbits were studied for 4 months. The animals underwent laparotomy and were randomly allocated to four groups. Twenty-four rabbits underwent bilateral ovariectomy, and the other eight were sham-operated (group S). The ovariectomized rabbits were allocated to three groups of eight animals each receiving E(2) valerate (group E), E(2) valerate plus cyproterone  (group EC), or placebo after sterilization (group C).After 4 months, the cholesterol-rich diet caused atherosclerotic aortic lesions in both treated groups that affected 17.91% +/- 10.19% and 28.16% +/- 7.97% of the aortic surface of groups E and EC, respectively, with a markedly lower aortic plaque size in group E than in groups C and S. Rabbits from group E (but not from group EC) had aortic cholesterol content significantly lower than rabbits from the sham-operated and control groups.E(2) valerate reduces aortic atheromatosis in cholesterol-fed, ovariectomized rabbits, and the addition of cyproterone  may neutralize this effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856709>Effects of Piper nigrum extracts: Restorative perspectives of high-fat diet-induced changes on lipid profile, body composition, and hormones in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Piper nigrum Linn (Piperaceae) (PnL) is used in traditional medicine to treat gastric ailments, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension.The present study explores the possible protective effects of P. nigrum extracts on high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats.High-fat diet-induced obese rats were treated orally with 200 mg/kg bw of different extracts (hexane, ethylacetate, ethanol, and aqueous extracts) of PnL for 42 d. The effects of PnL extracts on body composition, insulin resistance, biochemical parameters, leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile, liver marker enzymes, and antioxidants were studied.The HFD control group rats showed a substantial raise in body weight (472.8 ± 9.3 g), fat% (20.8 ± 0.6%), and fat-free mass (165.9 ± 2.4 g) when compared with normal control rats whose body weight, fat%, and fat-free mass were 314.3 ± 4.4 g, 6.4 ± 1.4%, and 133.8 ± 2.2 g, respectively. Oral administration of ethyl  or aqueous extracts of PnL markedly reduced the body weight, fat%, and fat-free mass of HFD-fed rats. In contrast to the normal control group, a profound increase in plasma glucose, insulin resistance, lipid profile, leptin, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and the activities of lipase and liver marker enzymes, and a decrease in adiponectin and antioxidant enzymes were noted in HFD control rats. Administration of PnL extracts to HFD-induced obese rats significantly (p < 0.05) restored the above profiles.PnL extracts significantly reduced the body weight, fat%, and ameliorated HFD-induced  and its constituents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284923>Hepatoprotective Effect of Houttuynia cordata Thunb Extract against Carbon Tetrachloride-induced Hepatic Damage in Mice.</a></h2><p>Houttuynia cordata Thunb (Saururaceae) is a traditional medicinal herb used to treat several disease symptoms. The present study was focused on the hepatoprotective effects of H. cordata ethyl  extract in experimental mice. Further the antioxidant potential of the extract was also evaluated to substantiate its hepatoprotective properties. Carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic damage in mice was used to measure the serum biochemical parameters. Morphological changes in hepatocyte architecture were studied by haematoxylin and eosin staining. In vitro alkyl and hydroxyl free radical scavenging assays were performed to evaluate the antioxidant effect. Administration of H. cordata extract significantly reduced the elevated serum levels and regulated the altered levels of serum cholesterol in carbon tetrachloride-treated mice (P<0.05). The morphological changes in hepatocyte architecture were also reversed by H. cordata treatment. Further, the extract showed significant antioxidant actions by scavenging the alkyl and hydroxyl free radicals. The concentration of the extract necessary for 50% scavenging of alkyl and hydroxyl radicals was 15.5 and 410 μg/ml, respectively. H. cordata extract exhibited significant hepatoprotective property in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. The strong antioxidant activities possessed by the extract might be responsible for such actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15630845>Rhabdomyolysis in prostate cancer--caution in prescribing cyproterone  with statins.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15322087>Guggulsterone inhibits NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha kinase activation, suppresses expression of anti-apoptotic gene products, and enhances apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Guggulsterone, derived from Commiphora mukul and used to treat obesity, diabetes, , atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis, has been recently shown to antagonize the farnesoid X receptor and decrease the expression of bile acid-activated genes. Because activation of NF-kappaB has been closely linked with inflammatory diseases affected by guggulsterone, we postulated that it must modulate NF-kappaB activation. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect of this steroid on the activation of NF-kappaB induced by inflammatory agents and carcinogens. Guggulsterone suppressed DNA binding of NF-kappaB induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), phorbol ester, okadaic acid, cigarette smoke condensate, hydrogen peroxide, and interleukin-1. NF-kappaB activation was not cell type-specific, because both epithelial and leukemia cells were inhibited. Guggulsterone also suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation expressed in most tumor cells. Through inhibition of IkappaB kinase activation, this steroid blocked IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, thus suppressing p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene transcription induced by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK was also blocked by guggulsterone but without affecting p65-mediated gene transcription. In addition, guggulsterone decreased the expression of gene products involved in anti-apoptosis (IAP1, xIAP, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2, cFLIP, and survivin), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and metastasis (MMP-9, COX-2, and VEGF); this correlated with enhancement of apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our results indicate that guggulsterone suppresses NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, which may explain its anti-inflammatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15821374>Cholesterol-lowering effect of organosulphur compounds from garlic: a possible mechanism of action.</a></h2><p> constitutes a major etiopathological factor for atherosclerosis. The medicinal value of garlic is best known for its lipid lowering effects and antiatherogenic effects. The mechanism by which lipid soluble organosulphur compounds from garlic reduce plasma lipids has not been fully investigated. The author had previously shown that the hepatic activity of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and the incorporation of radiolabeled (1, 2 14C),  into hepatic free and esterified cholesterol was significantly decreased in rat treated with garlic derived organosulphur compounds. We hypothesised that the antiatherogenic effect of the organosulphur compounds may be attributed to the formation of protein internal disulphide and thus inactivation of thiol (-SH) group enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase and the multienzyme complex of fatty acid synthesis. The objective of the present study is to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism by in vitro studies.Lipid soluble organosulphur compounds from garlic were treated in vitro with Luke's cysteine reagent (representing the thiol (-SH) group of enzymes) and the interaction products were separated by paper chromatography.The result indicated that the organosulphur compounds were capable of interacting with the thiol (-SH) group of cysteine and thus forming cysteine derivatives.The antiatherogenic effects of these organosulphur compounds can be attributed to such reactions that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and other lipogenic enzymes. The anticarcinogenic effects of these compounds may also be due to inhibitory reactions on enzymes that activate carcinogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572041>The formation of short-chain fatty acids is positively associated with the blood lipid-lowering effect of lupin kernel fiber in moderately hypercholesterolemic adults.</a></h2><p>Lupin kernel fiber beneficially modifies blood lipids because of its bile acid-binding capacity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effects of a lupin kernel fiber preparation on cardiovascular diseases and to clarify possible mechanisms. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial, 60 moderately hypercholesterolemic adults (plasma total cholesterol: >5.2 mmol/L) passed 3 intervention periods in different orders with a 2-wk washout phase between each. Participants consumed either a high-fiber diet containing 25-g/d lupin kernel fiber (LF) or citrus fiber (CF), or a low-fiber control diet (CD) for 4 wk each. Anthropometric, plasma, and fecal variables were assessed at baseline and after the interventions. Contrary to the CF period, total (9%) and LDL (12%) cholesterol as well as triacylglycerols (10%) were lower after the LF period when compared with the CD period [P ≤ 0.02, adjusted for baseline, age, gender, and body mass index (BMI)]. HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. Moreover, the LF period reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.02) and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.01) when compared with baseline. Bile acid binding could not be shown because the excretion of total bile acids remained constant after the high-fiber diets. However, the LF period resulted in an enhanced formation of the main short-chain fatty acids in comparison with the CD period. During the CF period, only  increased significantly. Both high-fiber diets led to higher satiety and modified nutritional behavior, resulting in significantly lower body weight, BMI, and waist circumference compared with the CD period. The blood lipid-lowering effects of LF are apparently not a result of bile acid binding. Rather, we hypothesize for the first time, to our knowledge, that the blood lipid-lowering effects of LF may be mainly attributed to the formation of short-chain fatty acids, specifically propionate and .

Compounds were assessed for their effects on the de novo incorporation of radiolabeled  into lipids in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes as well as for their effects on lipid and glycemic variables in obese female Zucker fatty rats [Crl:(ZUC)-faBR] following 1 and 2 weeks of oral administration. The most active compounds were found to be symmetrical with four to five methylene groups separating the central ketone functionality and the gem dimethyl or methyl/aryl substituents. Furthermore, biological activity was found to be greatest in both in vivo and in vitro assays for the tetramethyl-substituted keto diacids and diols (e.g., 10c, 10g, 14c), and the least active were shown to be the bis(arylmethyl) derivatives (e.g., 10e, 10f, 14f). Compound 14c dose-dependently elevated HDL-cholesterol, reduced triglycerides, and reduced NEFA, with a minimum effective dose of 30 mg/kg/day. Compound 1 g dose-dependently modified non-HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids, with a minimum effective dose of 10 mg/kg/day. At this dose, compound 10g elevated HDL-cholesterol levels 2-3 times higher than pretreatment levels, and a dose-dependent reduction of fasting insulin and glucose levels was observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19703547>Cholesterol-reducer, antioxidant and liver protective effects of Thymbra spicata L. var. spicata.</a></h2><p>Thymbra spicata is a member of the Lamiaceae family; leaves of this plant have recently gained much popularity as a remedy to combat hypercholesterolaemia.To evaluate the antihypercholesterolaemic, antioxidant and anti-steatohepatitic activities of the diethyl ether (DEE), ethyl  (EtOAc) and remaining aqueous (RA) extracts from Thymbra spicata var. spicata in mice.In this study, diethyl ether, ethyl  and remaining aqueous extracts of Thymbra spicata L. var. spicata P.H.Davis (Lamiaceae) were evaluated for the effects on the plasma total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG) and glucose; blood malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH); erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity (CAT) in mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD).The HFD induced an increase in plasma TC, TG, LDL, MDA concentrations compared to control group. However, administration of DEE with HFD reduced TC, LDL, TG and MDA concentrations, while increased HDL concentration, as well as GSH, SOD and CAT activities compared to HFD. The other extract from the plant was RA, which also showed a similar activity profile with DEE except CAT. On the other hand, administration of EtOAc extract with HFD decreased plasma TC, TG and MDA, while GSH concentration was increased. Histopathologically, best liver conditions were observed in DEE and lesser in RA extracts. Based on the results obtained in this investigation it is suggested that the DEE and partially RA extracts of Thymbra spicata var. spicata displayed significant antihypercholesterolaemic, antioxidant and anti-steatohepatitic activities. HPLC analysis of the DEE extract of Thymbra spicata var. spicata revealed the presence of carvacrol (44.13%).The observed cholesterol-reducer, antioxidant and liver protective effects of the DEE and partially of RA extracts of Thymbra spicata which contain mainly carvacrol indicates that these extracts possess some potential medicinal value and explain their ethnomedical use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29190422>Structure-Specific Effects of Short-Chain Fatty Acids on Plasma Cholesterol Concentration in Male Syrian Hamsters.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are capable of decreasing plasma cholesterol. However, the relative plasma-cholesterol-lowering activity of individual SCFAs and the underlying mechanisms by which SCFAs decrease plasma cholesterol remain largely unknown. The present study was done to compare the plasma-cholesterol-lowering potencies of four common SCFAs with 2-5 carbons and to investigate their interactions with gene expressions of key regulatory factors involved in cholesterol metabolism. For 6 weeks, five groups of male Golden hamsters were fed either a control high-cholesterol diet (HCD) or one of the four experimental HCDs containing 0.5 mol of  (Ac), propionate (Pr), butyrate (Bu), or valerate (Va) per kilogram of the diet. The results showed that Ac, Pr, and Bu significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol (TC) by 24, 18, and 17% (P < 0.05), respectively. All four SCFAs could decrease non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and the non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio. The addition of Ac, Pr, or Bu into the diet significantly promoted fecal excretion of bile acids by 121, 113, or 120% (P < 0.05), respectively, and upregulated the gene expressions of sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the liver. It was concluded that SCFAs with 2-4 carbons (Ac, Pr, and Bu) are more hypocholesterolemic than Va, which has 5 carbons, via enhancing fecal excretion of bile acids and promoting the hepatic uptake of cholesterol from the blood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19554302>OSBPL10, a novel candidate gene for high triglyceride trait in dyslipidemic Finnish subjects, regulates cellular lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Analysis of variants in three genes encoding oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) homologues (OSBPL2, OSBPL9, OSBPL10) in Finnish families with familial low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (N = 426) or familial combined  (N = 684) revealed suggestive linkage of OSBPL10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with extreme end high triglyceride (TG; >90th percentile) trait. Prompted by this initial finding, we carried out association analysis in a metabolic syndrome subcohort (Genmets) of Health2000 examination survey (N = 2,138), revealing association of multiple OSBPL10 SNPs with high serum TG levels (>95th percentile). To investigate whether OSBPL10 could be the gene underlying the observed linkage and association, we carried out functional experiments in the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. Silencing of OSBPL10 increased the incorporation of [(3)H] into cholesterol and both [(3)H] and [(3)H]oleate into triglycerides and enhanced the accumulation of secreted apolipoprotein B100 in growth medium, suggesting that the encoded protein ORP10 suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and very-low-density lipoprotein production. ORP10 was shown to associate dynamically with microtubules, consistent with its involvement in intracellular transport or organelle positioning. The data introduces OSBPL10 as a gene whose variation may contribute to high triglyceride levels in dyslipidemic Finnish subjects and provides evidence for ORP10 as a regulator of cellular lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21530057>Elevated C-reactive protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to analyse serum concentrations of CRP and MCP-1 in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and to test the effect of these factors on human THP-1 cells to determine the inflammatory state of these patients.Eighty-five women with PCOS and 65 healthy women with regular menstrual cycles, matched for age and body mass index (BMI), were included in the study. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting glucose and fasting insulin were monitored. Serum CRP and MCP-1 were compared between patients with PCOS and controls. Phorbol 12-myristate 13- was used to induce the differentiation of human THP-1 monocytes into THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with serum from patients with PCOS or controls for 24h, and MCP-1 mRNA expression was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Serum CRP and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with controls (CRP 1.9±2.0 mg/l vs. 0.9±0.8 mg/l; MCP-1 125.7±68.0 ng/ml vs. 89.8±68.3 ng/ml, respectively). Serum CRP level was positively correlated with BMI (r=0.494, p=0.000), waist:hip ratio (r=0.451, p=0.000), testosterone (r=0.214, p=0.032), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; r=0.617, p=0.000) and MCP-1 (r=0.219, p=0.027), and negatively correlated with HDL-C (r=-0.209, p=0.035).

They induce a significant reduction in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma triglycerides, therefore they are widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia even of its severe form-familiar hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin and atorvastatin as the most widely used statins in clinical treatment and their hydroxy-acid/lactone forms were determined by means of UPLC in connection with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Deuterium labeled reference standard compounds were used as internal standards for the quantitation. Separation was performed on Acquity BEH C18 (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) using gradient elution by mobile phase containing acetonitrile and ammonium  pH 4.0, which is convenient in order to prevent interconversion of analytes. ESI in positive mode was used for the ionization of all compounds. Two SRM (selected reaction monitoring) transitions were carefully optimized for each analyte in order to get high sensitivity and selectivity.

We investigated the association of T-138C MGP promoter polymorphism with the degree of atherosclerosis, vascular calcification and patients' clinical background including calcification of the trachea and costal cartilage. Analysis of 108 autopsy cases was carried out by polymorphism-specific PCR on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Statistical correlations among eight risk factors and five markers related to atherosclerosis and extra-bone tissue calcification were multivariantly analyzed. We found very high canonical correlations between the factors and the markers, and Pearson's correlation analysis revealed six significant correlations between age and the Gore index; age and costal cartilage calcification; sex and costal cartilage calcification; hypertension and the Gore index; hypertension and the calcification factor of the Gore index; and  and costal cartilage calcification. The promoter activity of the -138T allele was significantly higher than that of the -138C allele; treatment with 12-O-tetradecanonylphorbol 13- (TPA) significantly activated the former, but had almost no effect on the latter. The C genotype was significantly common among Japanese subjects, (TT 45.5%, TC 37.6% and CC 16.8%) compared with that reported in the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and France. No significant correlation was observed, however, between T-138C MGP promoter polymorphism and the markers. Although the C genotype (TC+CC) tended to show a higher calcification factor than the TT genotype, no significant difference was observed among the genotypes in the Gore index or in the calcification factor. Although MGP promoter activity and the binding of the AP-1 transcription factor were clearly different between T-138 and C-138 MGP promoter polymorphism in vitro, T-138C polymorphism was, statistically, not an independent factor of atherosclerosis or atherosclerotic vascular calcification in the abdominal aorta.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11855739>Diurnal rhythm of cholesterol biosynthesis in experimental chronic renal failure.</a></h2><p>Changes in lipid metabolism are an important risk factor for vascular complications during chronic renal failure (CRF). In experimental CRF hypercholesterolemia has been found to be the main lipid disorder. It is probably due to enhanced cholesterologenesis. Mechanisms of these changes remain poorly understood. It is well known that activity of cholesterologenesis undergoes a significant diurnal rhythm. However, there was no evidence that this rhythm is still present in the course of experimental CRF. Results of our studies indicate that in contrast to puromycin induced nephrotic syndrome, diurnal rhythm of cholesterologenesis in CRF rats is preserved both in liver and in the intestine tissue. Significant higher incorporation of tritiated water into cholesterol fraction was found in vivo both in liver as well as in intestine of CRF rats, as compared to control animals. Increased (with comparison to the controls) incorporation of 14C-, and 3H-mevalonate into CRF rat liver sterols indicate that mechanism of enhanced cholesterologenesis is more complex than simply due to the elevated level of mevalonate (potential substrate for cholesterologenesis) which has been reported in plasma of CRF animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14586118>Effects of the marine unicellular alga Nannochloropsis sp. to reduce the plasma and liver cholesterol levels in male rats fed on diets with cholesterol.</a></h2><p>The effects of Nannochloropsis were studied on rats consuming hypercholesterolemic diets.

The microstructures of various zebrafish organs are observed by combining high-contrast staining (osmium tetroxide and uranyl ) and embedding a protocol to enhance the image contrast of soft tissues. Furthermore, blood vessels are identified using a barium sulfate injection technique. The internal organs and cells, such as liver, intestine, oocytes, and adipocytes, of a hypercholesterolemic zebrafish are compared with those of normal organs and cells. The SR-μCT is useful for understanding the pathogenesis of circulatory vascular diseases by detecting the modifications in the 3D morphological structures of the whole body of the zebrafish. This bio-imaging technique can be readily used to study other disease models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040968>Surface association of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A accounts for its colocalization with activated macrophages.</a></h2><p>Intense immunostaining for pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a newly characterized metalloproteinase in the insulin-like growth factor system, colocalizes with activated macrophages in human atherosclerotic plaque. To determine macrophage regulation of PAPP-A expression, we developed two models of human macrophages with basal and activated phenotypes. THP-1 cells and peripheral blood monocytes could be differentiated into macrophages and activated upon specific treatment regimens with phorbol myristate , macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-1beta. Activation was assessed by cell secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which increased 30- to 100-fold with activation. Activated macrophages also secreted matrix metalloproteinase-9. However, no PAPP-A mRNA or PAPP-A antigen could be detected in these cells under any condition. Upon incubation with recombinant PAPP-A, we found that activated macrophages bound and internalized more PAPP-A than unactivated macrophages or monocytes. Internalization accounted for at least 50% of macrophage-associated PAPP-A, as assessed in studies with cytochalasin B. Membrane-bound PAPP-A retained protease activity, whereas internalized PAPP-A had little or no activity. Similar experiments carried out with a mutated variant of PAPP-A, which retains functionality as a protease but is unable to bind surface-associated glycosaminoglycan, showed no macrophage association or internalization. Absence of PAPP-A expression was confirmed in activated macrophages isolated from a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model of atherosclerosis. We therefore conclude that PAPP-A is not synthesized in, but rather is bound and internalized by, macrophages. Our findings likely account for the observed intense immunostaining for PAPP-A colocalizing with activated macrophages and may have physiological significance in the development of vulnerable plaque.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19934485>Macroporous poly(vinyl alcohol) microspheres bearing phosphate groups as a new adsorbent for low-density lipoprotein apheresis.</a></h2><p>A new low-density lipoprotein (LDL) adsorbent with phosphate groups as the ligand was prepared in this study. Macroporous poly(vinyl -co-triallyl isocyanurate) microspheres were prepared using a free-radical suspension polymerization method. A hydrolysis reaction in sodium hydroxide/methanol changed the materials into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) microspheres. Further reaction with phosphorus oxychloride in anhydrous DMF led to the LDL adsorbent PVA-phosphate microspheres. The preparation conditions such as reaction time, temperature and the amount of phosphorus oxychloride were optimized. The adsorption of plasma lipoproteins was examined by in vitro adsorption assays. The influence of adsorption time, plasma volume and ionic strength on the adsorption capacity was investigated. The circulation adsorption showed that the pathogenic lipoproteins in the plasma such as total cholesterol (TC), LDL and triglyceride (TG) could be removed markedly, in which the removal percentages were 42.9%, 45.0% and 44.74%, respectively. However, the reduction of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and other normal plasma components was very slight. For in vivo experiment, rabbits were fed with high-cholesterol food to develop a  model and treated by extracorporeal blood perfusion using the PVA-phosphate columns. Eight  rabbits were treated with the PVA-phosphate adsorbent, and the removal of TC, LDL and TG was 45.03 +/- 6.64%, 48.97 +/- 9.92% and 35.42 +/- 14.17%, respectively. The sterilization and storage tests showed that the adsorbent was chemically and functionally stable. It could be easily sterilized by a common method and stored for months without loss of adsorption capacity. Therefore, this new PVA-phosphate-based LDL adsorbent may have potential for application in LDL apheresis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19271316>Protective role of flax lignans against lead  induced oxidative damage and  in rats.</a></h2><p>The results showed that the lead concentration was higher than Cr, Ni and Cd in roadside soil samples. Also, the present study was conducted to investigate the protective role of flax lignans against the effects of lead  on oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes and lipid profile. Animals were divided into three groups; the first group was used as control. While, groups 2, and 3 were orally treated with 200 mg/L lead  in drinking water and the combination of lead  (200 mg/L) plus flax lignans (30 mg/100 g BW), respectively. Rats were administered their respective doses daily for 3 weeks. Results showed that lead  increased TBARS, and decreased the activities of GST, SOD, GR and CAT, and the contents of glutathione in liver extracts, compared to control. The present data indicated that total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-c were significantly increased by lead  treatment, while HDL-c levels were decreased in the serum and liver extracts. Animals treated with flax lignans in combination with lead  alleviated its toxic effects in the tested parameters. Also, the morph metric analysis of the dorsal aorta revealed that, the histological alterations induced after lead  treatments were markedly reduced.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584015>Trenbolone Improves Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Myocardial Tolerance to Ischemia-Reperfusion in Male Rats With Testosterone-Deficient Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity adds another dimension to the pathophysiology of testosterone (TEST) deficiency (TD) and potentially impairs the therapeutic efficacy of classical TEST replacement therapy. We investigated the therapeutic effects of selective androgen receptor modulation with trenbolone (TREN) in a model of TD with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Male Wistar rats (n=50) were fed either a control standard rat chow (CTRL) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet. After 8 weeks of feeding, rats underwent sham surgery or an orchiectomy (ORX). Alzet miniosmotic pumps containing either vehicle, 2-mg/kg·d TEST or 2-mg/kg·d TREN were implanted in HF/HS+ORX rats. Body composition, fat distribution, lipid profile, and insulin sensitivity were assessed. Infarct size was quantified to assess myocardial damage after in vivo ischaemia reperfusion, before cardiac and prostate histology was performed. The HF/HS+ORX animals had increased sc and visceral adiposity; circulating triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin; and myocardial damage, with low circulating TEST compared with CTRLs. Both TEST and TREN protected HF/HS+ORX animals against sc fat accumulation, hypercholesterolaemia, and myocardial damage. However, only TREN protected against visceral fat accumulation, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia and reduced myocardial damage relative to CTRLs. TEST caused widespread cardiac fibrosis and prostate hyperplasia, which were less pronounced with TREN. We propose that TEST replacement therapy may have contraindications for males with TD and obesity-related MetS. TREN treatment may be more effective in restoring androgen status and reducing cardiovascular risk in males with TD and MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25045676>Protective role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid against lead -induced toxicity in liver and kidney of female rats.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the protective role of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids against lead -induced toxicity in liver and kidney of female rats. Animals were divided into four equal groups; group 1 served as control while groups 2 and 3 were treated orally with Omega-3 fatty acids at doses of 125 and 260 mg/kg body weight, respectively, for 10 days. These groups were also injected with lead  (25 mg/kg body weight) during the last 5 days. Group 4 was treated only with lead  for 5 days and served as positive control group. Lead  increased oxidative stress through an elevation in MDA associated with depletion in antioxidant enzymes activities in the tissues. Moreover, the elevation of serum enzymes activities (ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH) and the levels of urea and creatinine were estimated but total proteins were decreased. Also, lead -treatment induced  via increasing of lipid profiles associated with decline in HDL-c level. Significant changes of Hb, PCV, RBCs, PLT, and WBCs in group 4 were recorded. The biochemical alterations of lead  were confirmed by histopathological changes and DNA damage. The administration of Omega-3 provided significant protection against lead  toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28840832>Torenia concolor Lindley var. formosana Yamazaki extracts improve inflammatory response and lipid accumulation via PPARs activation.</a></h2><p>Background/Introduction: At present, human diet is replete with sugar and fat. Abnormal metabolism and hyperglycemia or  in the body induces the development of an overactive and continuous inflammatory response, resulting in obesity and metabolic syndromes, including hypertension, , and insulin resistance. Torenia concolor Lindley var. formosana Yamazaki (TC), a perennial creeping herbaceous plant, is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb widely used for the treatment of heat stroke, aching muscles and bones, cold, dysentery, and ambustion.This study evaluated the influence of TC on inflammation responses and lipid metabolism.In this study, ground TC powder was extracted with 95% ethanol. The ethanol was removed by vacuum concentration, and the resulting extract was further extracted with a number of solvents of different polarity to produce four final extracts: an ethanol extract (TCEE), an ethyl  extract (TCEAE), an n-butanol extract (TCBUE), and a water extract (TCWE). The anti-inflammatory efficacy of the extracts and their capability for lipid metabolism regulation was then explored.TCEE, TCEAE, and TCBUE exhibited good anti-inflammatory efficacy; TCEAE also simultaneously regulated lipid metabolism. In RAW264.7 cells, these three extracts suppressed the expression of iNOS and IL-6 via the signaling pathway activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and thereby showed anti-inflammatory efficacy. In 3T3-L1 cells, these three extracts promoted lipid metabolism and reduced lipid accumulation through the activation of PPARα and the increased expression of adiponectin, thus demonstrating regulation of lipid metabolism.These results indicate that TC possesses anti-inflammatory efficacy and can regulate lipid metabolism through the activation of transcription factor PPARs. We speculate that these nutraceutical effects are attributable to betulin, an active ingredient in this herbal medicine.© Author(s) 2017.

The aim of this work is to comparatively evaluate the physiological effects of HT and its lipophilic derivatives, hydroxytyrosyl  (HT-Ac) and ethyl hydroxytyrosyl ether (HT-Et), in high-cholesterol fed animals. Male Wistar rats (n = 8) were fed a standard diet (C group), a cholesterol-rich diet (Chol group) or a cholesterol-rich diet supplemented with phenolic compounds (HT group, HT-Ac group and HT-Et group) for 8 weeks. Body and tissue weights, the lipid profile, redox status, and biochemical, hormonal, and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, glucose, insulin and leptin, as well as malondialdehyde in serum increased in Chol compared to C (p < 0.05). Rats fed the test diets had improved glucose, insulin, leptin and MDA levels and antioxidant capacity status, with HT-Ac being the most effective compound. The studied phenolic compounds also modulated TNF-α and IL-1β plasma levels compared to Chol. HT-Ac and HT-Et improved adipose tissue distribution and adipokine production, decreasing MCP-1 and IL-1β levels. Our results confirm the metabolic effects of HT, which are maintained and even improved by hydrophobic derivatives, particularly HT-Ac.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12680848>Effects of dietary Angelica keiskei on lipid metabolism in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>1. The effect of dietary Angelica keiskei on lipid metabolism was examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 2. Six-week-old male SHRSP were fed diets containing 0.2% A. keiskei extract (ethyl  extract from the yellow liquid of stems) for 6 weeks with free access to the diet and water. 3. Elevation of systolic blood pressure tended to be suppressed on and after 2 weeks; however, this effect was not statistically significant. 4. Serum levels of cholesterol and phospholipid in SHRSP were significantly elevated after treatment with A. keiskei extract and this effect was accompanied by significant increases in serum apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I and ApoE concentrations. These changes in the serum were due to increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) containing ApoA-I and ApoE. 5. In the liver, significant decreases in relative weight and triglyceride content were observed in SHRSP after treatment with A. keiskei extract. An investigation of mRNA expression of enzymes involved in hepatic triglyceride metabolism indicated a decreased level of hepatic Acyl-coenzyme A synthetase mRNA expression. 6. In conclusion, dietary A. keiskei produces elevation of serum HDL levels and a reduction of liver triglyceride levels in SHRSP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321401>Impaired vasomotor function induced by the combination of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Although it is well known that endothelial function is compromised in the presence of either hypertension (HTN) or hypercholesterolemia (HCh), less is known about whether and how the combination of these risk factors (HTN+HCh) results in impaired endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of HTN+HCh on vasomotor function and to identify the mechanisms that underlie the altered vascular reactivity elicited by HTN+HCh. Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasomotor responses of aortic vessels were studied in mice with diet-induced HCh and/or HTN induced by chronic administration of either angiotensin II (AngII) or deoxycorticosterone -salt. HTN+HCh elicited an impairment of EDD that appeared between each risk factor alone. Incubation with catalase resulted in more severe EDD impairment. Each risk factor enhanced vascular H₂O₂ production, but a larger response was noted with HTN+HCh. An attenuated EDD was not observed in AngII type 1a receptor deficient (AT1r(-/-)) mice, but AT1r(-/-) bone marrow chimeras exhibited more profound impairment compared with wild-type. HTN+HCh does not exert an additive effect of vasomotor dysfunction compared with either risk factor alone, and both H₂O₂ and blood cell-associated AT1r contribute to the impaired EDD responses in mice with HTN+HCh.Copyright © 2013 American Society of Hypertension.

Here, we report the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), on hypertension + -induced HFpEF in a pig model.HFpEF pigs were established by infusing a combination of deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II), and Western diet (WD) feeding for 18 weeks. In the 9th week, half of the HFpEF pigs were randomly assigned to receive additional dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day) by oral gavage daily for the next 9 weeks. Blood pressure, lipid levels, echocardiography and cardiac hemodynamics for cardiac structural and functional changes, as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in the plasma and tissues were measured. After sacrifice, cardiac fibrosis, the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activity in the cardiovascular system were also determined.Blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were markedly increased in HFpEF pigs, but only blood pressure was significantly decreased after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. By echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment, dapagliflozin significantly attenuated heart concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs, but failed to improve diastolic function and compliance with the left ventricle (LV). In the dapagliflozin treatment group, TH expression and norepinephrine concentration in the aorta were strongly mitigated compared to that in the HFpEF group. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in aortic tissue were markedly elevated in HFpEF pigs and inhibited by dapagliflozin. Furthermore, the reduced expression of eNOS and the PKG-1 protein and the cGMP content in the aortas of HFpEF pigs were significantly restored after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment.9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment decreases hypertension and reverses LV concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs partly by restraining sympathetic tone in the aorta, leading to inhibition of the inflammatory response and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26346939>The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt on high-glucose-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic renal damage in rats.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes whose development process is associated with inflammation, renal hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt, traditionally used as a healthcare tea, has anti-inflammatory, anti-, and glycemic regulation activities. The aim of our study was to investigate the renal protective effect of ethyl  extract of C. tinctoria Nutt (AC) on high-glucose-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.A diabetic rat model was induced by high-glucose-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg STZ. After treatment with AC at a daily dose of 150, 300 or, 600 mg/kg for 4 weeks, metabolic and renal function parameters of serum and urine were examined. Degree of renal damage, renal proinflammatory cytokines, and fibrotic protein expression were analyzed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Renal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad signaling pathway were determined by western blotting.Diabetic rats showed obvious renal dysfunction, inflammation and fibrosis. However, AC significantly reduced levels of blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and urinary albumin, as well as expression of kidney proinflammatory cytokines of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. AC also ameliorated renal hypertrophy and fibrosis by reducing fibronectin and collagen IV and suppressing the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. Meanwhile, AMPKα as a protective cytokine was markedly stimulated by AC.In summary, AC controls blood glucose, inhibits inflammatory and fibrotic processes, suppresses the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, and activates phosphorylation of AMPKα in the kidneys, which confirms the protective effects of AC in the early stage of diabetic kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11907931>Electrocardiogram pattern in hypercholesterolemic women: the influence of hormone replacement therapy.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to delineate electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns in postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia and to assess the possible influence of female sex hormones.A total of 72 postmenopausal women with moderately elevated total cholesterol levels constituted the case group, of which 48 came from a clinical trial and 24 from a cohort study. Some 236 women aged 50-59 years with normal levels of cholesterol were participants in the same cohort study in the local area. These 236 women had been subdivided into three groups: premenopausal, postmenopausal and postmenopausal with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Of the 48 women in the clinical study group, 12 patients showed pathological ECG changes. Six of these patients were treated with HRT for 2 years (transdermal estradiol 50 micrograms/day and a daily dose of 5 mg medroxyprogesterone , MPA) and the rest were non-users of HRT.In the women with hypercholesterolemia, 16 of 72 patients (22%) showed ischemic ECG changes, compared to nine of 88 (10%) with normal cholesterol levels (p = 0.04). We found no significant difference in the prevalence of ECG changes between postmenopausal women with and without HRT in the groups with normal levels of cholesterol. In the hormone treatment group, four of six patients showed an improvement in ECG pattern, in contrast to two of six non-users of HRT.This preliminary study revealed a higher prevalence of pathological ECG changes in postmenopausal women who had hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemic women. These findings support the idea that  contributes to the overall increase in cardiovascular disease, as this is also associated with ECG changes. Transdermal estradiol combined with MPA has a beneficial effect in reversing the process of atherosclerosis, as well as improving the ECG pattern. The prevalence of pathological ECG patterns was similar for HRT users and non-users. This outcome may be affected by several factors. Hence, further research is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29986183>Studies on the lipid-regulating mechanism of alisol-based compounds on lipoprotein lipase.</a></h2><p>Studies on the lipid-regulating effects of alisol compounds are reported that include alisol B, alisol A 24- (24A), alisol A and an alisol B - 24A - alisol A mixture (content ratio = 1:1:1). The effects on the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key lipid-modulating enzyme, were studied to investigate the molecular mechanism of lipid-regulating activity of alisols. The effects of alisols on regulating blood lipids and the activities of LPL were determined using a reagent kit method. The structure of LPL was obtained by homology modeling and the interactive mechanism of alisol monomers and the mixture with LPL was investigated by molecular simulation. The alisol monomer and mixture were shown to regulate blood lipids, suggesting that alisols may decrease the level of triglyceride (TG) by improving the activity of LPL. The order of intensity was: mixture > alisol A > alisol B > 24A, indicating that alisols of alismatis rhizoma feature a synergistic effect on LPL. The N- and C-terminus of LPL both represented the catalytic active domains of this lipid-regulating effect. Cys306, Gln129 and Ser166 were the key amino acid residues resulting in the lipid-regulating effect of the alisol monomer while Ser166 and Arg18 were found to be responsible for the lipid-regulating effect of the mixture. The C-terminus of LPL was indirectly involved in the enzymatic process. A folded side chain of alisols or the parent ring was found to bind somewhat weaker to LPL than an open side chain or parent ring. The hydroxyl groups on the C14-, C22-, C28-, C30- and C31-terminus in the side chain, the ring ether structure in C23-position, and the acetyl group in C29-position represented the key sites for the lipid-regulating action of alisols. Meanwhile, the C30-site hydroxyl group played an important role in the synergistic effect of the alisol mixture.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The supplementation of Se has been shown to lower blood cholesterol and increase tissue concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH); however, the effects of Se supplementation, either alone or in combination with supplemental Vit E, on FO-induced oxidative stress and  have not been studied. Male Syrian hamsters received FO-based diets that contained 14.3 wt% fat and 0.46 wt% cholesterol supplemented with Vit E (129 IU D-alpha-tocopheryl /kg diet) and/or Se (3.4 ppm as sodium selenate) or that contained basal requirements of both nutrients. The cardiac tissue of hamsters fed supplemental Se showed increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) but decreased oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations. The higher concentrations of LPO in the hearts of Se-supplemented hamsters were not lowered with concurrent Vit E supplementation. In the liver, Se supplementation was associated with higher Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity and an increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio, whereas a lower hepatic non-Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity was seen with Vit E supplementation. Supplemental intake of Se was associated with lower plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol plus very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. In view of the pro-oxidative effects of Se supplementation on cardiac tissue, a cautionary approach needs to be taken regarding the plasma lipid-lowering properties of supplemental Se.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15336361>A study of matrix effects on an LC/MS/MS assay for olanzapine and desmethyl olanzapine.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this research project was to investigate potential matrix effects of anticoagulant and lipemia on the response of olanzapine, desmethyl olanzapine, olanzapine-D(3) and desmethyl olanzapine-D(8) in an LC/MS/MS assay. Blank human serum and sodium heparin, sodium citrate, and K(3)EDTA plasma with various degrees of lipemia were fortified with olanzapine, desmethyl olanzapine, olanzapine-D(3) and desmethyl olanzapine-D(8). Six replicates of each sample were extracted using Waters Oasis MCX cartridges and analyzed using electrospray LC/MS/MS. The analytes were separated on a Phenomenex LUNA phenyl hexyl, 2 mm x 50 mm, 5 microm, analytical column and a gradient rising from 2 to 85% mobile phase B. Mobile phase A consisted of acetonitrile-ammonium  (20 mM) (52:48 v/v) and mobile phase B was formic acid-acetonitrile (0.1:100 v/v). Ion suppression was investigated through post column infusion experiments. The degree of lipemia of each sample, indicated by turbidity, was ranked into categories from least to greatest and used for statistical analyses. The results from analysis of variance testing indicated that lipemia, anticoagulant and their interaction significantly influenced mass spectral matrix effects and extraction matrix effects. Differential behavior between the analytes and labeled internal standards contributed to variability. The most significant source of variability however, was ion suppression due to co-eluting matrix components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989154>The effect of cyproheptadine hydrochloride (periactin) and megestrol  (megace) on weight in children with cancer/treatment-related cachexia.</a></h2><p>Children with cancer frequently have associated cachexia and malnutrition.

In a randomized, crossover study subjects underwent two 4-week treatments (400 mg/day) with undeuterated RRR- and all rac-alpha-tocopheryl  around a 12-week washout. Before and after each supplementation period subjects underwent a biokinetic protocol (48 h) with 150 mg deuterated RRR- or all rac-alpha-tocopheryl . During the biokinetic protocols, the elimination of endogenous plasma alpha-tocopherol was significantly faster in smokers (P < 0.05). However, smokers had a lower uptake of deuterated RRR than nonsmokers, but there was no difference in uptake of deuterated all rac. The supplementation regimes significantly raised plasma alpha-tocopherol (P < 0.001) with no differences in response between smokers and nonsmokers or between alpha-tocopherol forms. Smokers had significantly lower excretion of alpha-carboxyethyl-hydroxychroman than nonsmokers following supplementation (P < 0.05). Nonsmokers excreted more alpha-carboxyethyl-hydroxychroman following RRR than all rac; however, smokers did not differ in excretion between forms. At baseline, smokers had significantly lower ascorbate (P < 0.01) and higher F(2)-isoprostanes (P < 0.05). F(2)-isoprostanes in smokers remained unchanged during the study, but increased in nonsmokers following alpha-tocopherol supplementation.

Statistically significant correlations between  and propionate and BDI somatic score (r = -0.21,  = 0.01; r = -0.17,  = 0.03), as well as correlations regarding isocaproic and both cognitive/affective (r = 0.37,  = 0.0001) and somatic (r = 9.37,  < 0.001) scores were found. Women who declared current usage of lipid-lowering and thyroid drugs in the past, had higher content of C6:0-i (Users; median {IQR}: 1.91 {3.62} vs. non-users; 0.55 {0.67};  = 0.0048).and lower of C2:0 (Users; median {IQR}: 23.07 {12.80} vs. non users 33.73 {21.44};  = 0.041), respectively. No correlations regarding SCFAs concentration and fiber intake were found. We concluded that SCFAs may potentially contribute to depression phenotype, however, due to the small size of groups suffering from moderately heavy ( = 5) and severe ( = 7) depression, the conclusion should be treated with caution. Pharmacotherapy of  and thyroid disease might affect SCFAs synthesis.

To determine the susceptibility of BSM to lipotoxicity we examined the normal pattern of mitochondrial substrate selection in BSM and the ability of BSM to respond to changes in metabolic substrate provision.BSM strips were incubated in 5 mM 1-13C-glucose and 0 to 5 mM 1,2-13C-. The pattern of substrate use measured by 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance using BSM extracts. BSM was also cultured for 4 days to elicit changes in cell phenotype.At physiological levels of glucose and  about 50% of the substrate used by mitochondria was glucose. When  concentration was changed from physiological levels (0.1 mM) to pathophysiological levels (0.5 mM), BSM was able to increase the use of , while sparing the use of glucose and intracellular substrates, likely lipids. Above 0.5 mM  BSM was unable to further use . With increasing  use anaplerosis increased, consistent with a depletion of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. After 4 days of organ culture BSM mitochondria used significantly more unlabeled intracellular substrates and less 13C labeled glucose than control bladder, consistent with metabolic adaptation to increase lipid use, such as what occurs with .We conclude that BSM has modest plasticity of the pattern of mitochondrial substrate selection and excess lipid provision may be able to induce lipotoxicity in BSM, resulting in impaired detrusor function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17049599>Neuropeptides induced a pronounced and statin-sensitive dysregulation of mevalonate cycle in human monocytes of patients with hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) and leptin generate statin-inhibitable superoxide anion production that accounts for only part of the entire superoxide anion production. In our recent studies, we aimed at elucidating whether Ang II and leptin, affecting the intensity of the mevalonate cycle, are able to increase endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, we compared the superoxide anion and cholesterol production capability of monocytes of healthy control volunteers and monocytes obtained from patients with hypercholesterolemia (HC). We also studied the differences of the produced statin-inhibitable superoxide anion and cholesterol synthesis in control and HC-monocytes, depending on the applied stimulating ligands. In control and HC-monocytes--stimulated by Ang II, leptin, fenyl-Me-Leu-Phe (FMLP), phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) and A23187--we determined the proportion of mevalonate cycle-dependent and -independent superoxide and cholesterol production, using lovastatin (Lov), and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). According to our results; (1) superoxide anion generation in HC-monocytes was elevated after Ang II, leptin and FMLP-stimulation, whereas PMA and A23187-stimulation had lower stimulating effect in HC than in control cells. (2) Cholesterol synthesis was increased only after stimulation with Ang II and leptin. (3) The Ang II and leptin-induced total superoxide anion generation and cholesterol synthesis were more elevated in HC than in control monocytes. (4) In contrast, the increase in Lov and 25-HC sensitive cholesterol synthesis were higher in resting, but lower in stimulated HC monocytes than in control cells. Summarizing our results, we concluded that Ang II and leptin are involved in enhancement of endogenous cholesterol synthesis through a statin-sensitive pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719086>Determination of DNA damage induced by oxidative stress in hyperlipidemic patients.</a></h2><p>In the present paper, we report data on the genotoxic properties of hydrogen peroxide in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNLs) separated from normolipidemic and type II/a hyperlipidemic patients. In all, 15 hyperlipidemic patients (11 female, 4 male, mean age 54.6+/-10.25 years) were involved in the study, and 7 normolipidemic patients (5 female, 2 male, mean age 53.4+/-8.07 years) served as controls. Using the comet assay, there was a significant difference in the degree of DNA damage between the two groups. The visual score characteristic of the degree of DNA damage was 350.97+/-31.31 in the hyperlipidemic group, while it was 289.5+/-29.49 in the control group (P<0.001). In the hyperlipidemic patients, a positive correlation was found between the degree of DNA damage and the basic oxidation of PMNLs (r=0.517), and the superoxide anion production of the cells stimulated with phorbolmiristate  (PMA) (r=0.326) and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) (r=0.525) as well. There was a negative correlation between DNA damage and HDL-associated antioxidant paraoxonase (PON) activity (r=-0.469), and the PON/HDL ratio (r=-0.631). No correlation was found between the degree of DNA damage and the plasma concentration of nitric oxide (NO) (r=0.098) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) (r=0.061) in hyperlipidemic patients. Our results show that in hyperlipidemic patients there is an increase in lymphocyte DNA damage caused by oxidative stress when compared to normolipidemic individuals as demonstrated by comet assay. Decreased antioxidant capacity in hyperlipidemic patients may play a significant role in this process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26141755>Modulation by geraniol of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism leading to a reduction of serum-cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</a></h2><p>Geraniol (G) is a natural isoprenoid present in the essential oils of several aromatic plants, with various biochemical and pharmacologic properties. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action of G on cellular metabolism are largely unknown.We propose that G could be a potential agent for the treatment of  that could contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to advance our understanding of its mechanism of action on cholesterol and TG metabolism.NIH mice received supplemented diets containing 25, 50, and 75 mmol G/kg chow. After a 3-week treatment, serum total-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by commercial kits and lipid biosynthesis determined by the [(14)C]  incorporated into fatty acids plus nonsaponifiable and total hepatic lipids of the mice. The activity of the mRNA encoding HMGCR-the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis-along with the enzyme levels and catalysis were assessed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and HMG-CoA-conversion assays, respectively. In-silico analysis of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and regulated by G in cultured cells was also performed. Finally, the mRNA levels encoded by the genes for the low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), the sterol-regulatory-element-binding transcription factor (SREBF2), the very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA) were determined by real-time RT-PCR.Plasma total-cholesterol and triglyceride levels plus hepatic fatty-acid, total-lipid, and nonsaponifiable-lipid biosynthesis were significantly reduced by feeding with G. Even though an up-regulation of the mRNA encoding HMGCR occurred in the G treated mouse livers, the protein levels and specific activity of the enzyme were both inhibited. G also enhanced the mRNAs encoding the LDL and VLDL receptors and reduced ACACA mRNA, without altering the transcription of the mRNA encoding the SREBF2.The following mechanisms may have mediated the decrease in plasma lipids levels in mice: a down-regulation of hepatocyte-cholesterol synthesis occurred as a result of decreased HMGCR protein levels and catalytic activity; the levels of LDLR mRNA became elevated, thus suggesting an increase in the uptake of serum LDL, especially by the liver; and TG synthesis became reduced very likely because of a decrease in fatty-acid synthesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

SunAmla and ethyl  (EtOAc) extract of amla significantly inhibited thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substance level in the Cu(2+)-induced LDL oxidation and the effects were stronger than those of probucol. In addition, the administration of SunAmla (at a dose of 20 or 40 mg/kg body weight/d) or EtOAc extract of amla (at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight/d) for 20 d to rats fed 1% cholesterol diet significantly reduced total, free and LDL-cholesterol levels in a dose-dependent manner, and EtOAc extract of amla exhibited more potent serum cholesterol-lowering effect than SunAmla in the same amount. Furthermore, the oxidized LDL level in serum was markedly elevated in cholesterol-fed control rats as compared with normal rats, while it was significantly decreased by the administration of SunAmla or EtOAc extract of amla. Moreover, the serum TBA-reactive substance level was also significantly decreased after oral administration of SunAmla or EtOAc extract of amla.

We have here treated WHHLMI rabbits, a model for coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, with a novel squalene synthase inhibitor, lapaquistat  (TAK-475).Young male WHHLMI rabbits were fed a diet supplemented with lapaquistat  (100 or 200 mg per kg body weight per day) for 32 weeks. Serum lipid levels were monitored every 4 weeks. After the treatment, lipoprotein lipid and coenzyme Q10 levels were assayed, and coronary atherosclerosis and xanthomas were examined histopathologically or immunohistochemically. From histopathological and immunohistochemical sections, the composition of the plaque was analysed quantitatively with computer-assisted image analysis. Xanthoma was evaluated grossly.Lapaquistat  decreased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, by lowering lipoproteins containing apoB100. Development of atherosclerosis and xanthomatosis was suppressed. Accumulation of oxidized lipoproteins, macrophages and extracellular lipid was decreased in coronary plaques of treated animals. Treatment with lapaquistat  increased collagen concentration and transformed coronary plaques into fibromuscular plaques. Lapaquistat  also suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the plaque and increased peripheral coenzyme Q10 levels. Increased coenzyme Q10 levels and decreased very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were correlated with improvement of coronary plaque composition.Inhibition of squalene synthase by lapaquistat  delayed progression of coronary atherosclerosis and changed coronary atheromatous plaques from unstable, macrophage/lipid accumulation-rich, lesions to stable fibromuscular lesions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27261853>Evaluation of hypolipidemic Marrubium vulgare effect in Triton WR-1339-induced  in mice.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities of four Marrbium vulgare herb extracts using Triton WR-1339-induced  in mice. was developed by intraperitoneal injection of Triton (200 mg/kg body weight).

Crude polyphenol fraction was obtained from the ethyl  extract of Clerodenrdon colebrookianum (CC). Investigation was conducted by administering graded oral doses (0.25 g, 0.5 g and 1 g/kg b. w. /day) of the CPCC for a period of 28 days. Significant (p < 0.01) rise in plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed in cholesterol fed rats. Increased lipid profile has been depleted and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has been increased after chronic feeding of CPCC. In addition, CPCC extract enhanced the excretion of fecal cholesterol (FC) but could not arrest the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activities. Histopathological observations showed loss of normal liver architecture in cholesterol fed rats which were retained in CPCC treated groups. Moreover, the analysis of CC extract demonstrated the presence of substantial amount of total polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins content, further HPLC analysis led to the identification and quantification of two most important biologically active secondary metabolites i.e. (+) Catechin (432 ppm) and Quarcetin (105 ppm).

The isometric force produced by explanted arteries in the presence of 10(-8) to 10(-5) M PGF2alpha was recorded by the myograph technique. The results showed that compared with controls, the contractile response to 10(-5) M PGF2alpha was approx. 2 fold increased in HD group, and approx. 1.75 and 1.62-fold enhanced in H and D groups, respectively. Activation of protein kinase C with 10(-6) M phorbol 12-myristate 13- increased the contractility to PGF2alpha in all groups and particularly in HD hamsters (approx. 10.16-fold). Inhibition of cyclooxygenase by indomethacin increased approx. 1.81-fold the arterial contractility to PGF2alpha in C group, whereas in H, D and HD hamsters had no effect. Blockage of Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-channels with 10(-3) M tetraethylammonium augmented the contraction to PGF2alpha approx. 6.43-fold in C group, and at significantly lower levels in H, D and HD groups, i.e. approx. 3.84, 3.72 and 3.33-fold, respectively. The results validate two conclusions: (i) simultaneous insult of hyperlipemia-hyperglycemia is associated with the highest contractility of the resistance arteries to PGF2alpha; the highest circulating glucose and cholesterol levels, and the enhancement in the protein kinase C pathway underlay the augmented contractility; (ii) no matter the pathology induced (hyperlipemia, diabetes or both simultaneously) a common dysfunctional response to PGF2alpha was installed; this consists in a reduced effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition, and a altered activity of Ca(2+) dependent K(+) channels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759957>Phaleria macrocarpa Boerl.

In this study we investigated whether 3Ac-OA exerted beneficial effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats and its potential underlying mechanisms. Treatment with 3Ac-OA (1-100 μmol/L) dose-dependently decreased the intracellular levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in FFA-treated primary rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, oil red staining studies showed that 3Ac-OA caused dose-dependent decrease in the number of lipid droplets in FFA-treated primary rat hepatocytes. SD rats were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and subsequently treated with 3Ac-OA (60, 30, 15 mg·kg·d) for 4 weeks. 3Ac-OA administration significantly decreased the body weight, liver weight and serum TC, TG, LDL-C levels in HFD rats. Furthermore, 3AcOA administration ameliorated lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis in the liver of HFD rats. Using adipokine array analyses, we found that the levels of 11 adipokines (HGF, ICAM, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, lipocalin-2, MCP-1, M-CSF, Pref-1 and RAGE) were increased by more than twofold in the serum of 3Ac-OA-treated rats, whereas ICAM, IGF-1 and lipocalin-2 had levels increased by more than 20-fold. Moreover, 3Ac-OA administration significantly increased the expression of glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT-2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), as well as the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the liver tissues of HFD rats.

We have investigated the effects of amla on the lipid metabolism and protein expression involved in oxidative stress during the ageing process. SunAmla or ethyl  extract of amla, a polyphenol-rich fraction, was administered at a dose of 40 or 10 mg/kg body weight per d for 100 d to young rats aged 2 months and aged rats aged 10 months. The lipid levels, such as cholesterol and TAG, in serum and liver were markedly elevated in aged control rats, while they were significantly decreased by the administration of amla. The PPARalpha is known to regulate the transcription of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. The PPARalpha protein level in liver was reduced in aged control rats. However, the oral administration of amla significantly increased the hepatic PPARalpha protein level. In addition, oral administration of amla significantly inhibited the serum and hepatic mitochondrial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels in aged rats. Moreover, the elevated expression level of bax was significantly decreased after the oral administration of amla, while the level of bcl-2 led to a significant increase. Furthermore, the expressions of hepatic NF-kappaB, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels were also increased with ageing. However, amla extract reduced the iNOS and COX-2 expression levels by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation in aged rats.

Wistar rats fed a standard laboratory diet or a cholesterol-rich diet for 16 weeks were used. The serum lipid levels, the malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as that of catalase (CAT) were examined. The cholesterol-rich diet induced hypercholesterolemia that was manifested in the elevation of total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Administration of aqueous methanol and ethyl  extracts of green olives and ethyl  extract of black olives significantly lowered the serum levels of TC and LDL-C, while increasing the serum level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, the content of MDA in liver, heart and kidney decreased significantly after oral administration of green and black olive extracts compared with those of rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet. In addition, olive extracts increased CAT and SOD activities in liver. These results suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of green and black olive extracts might be due to their abilities to lower serum cholesterol level as well as to slow down the lipid peroxidation process and to enhance the antioxidant enzyme activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28901277>Repositioning of Tak-475 In Mevalonate Kinase Disease: Translating Theory Into Practice.</a></h2><p>Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD, OMIM #610377) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic and inflammatory disease. In MKD, defective function of the enzyme mevalonate kinase, due to a mutation in the MVK gene, leads to the shortage of mevalonate- derived intermediates, which results in unbalanced prenylation of proteins and altered metabolism of sterols. These defects lead to a complex multisystem inflammatory and metabolic syndrome.Although biologic therapies aimed at blocking the inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 can significantly reduce inflammation, they cannot completely control the clinical symptoms that affect the nervous system. For this reason, MKD can still be considered an orphan drug disease. The availability of MKD models reproducing the MKD-systematic inflammation, is crucial to improve the knowledge on its pathogenesis, which is still unknown. New therapies are also required in order to improve pateints' conditions and their quality of life.MKD-cellular models can be obtained by biochemical inhibition of mevalonatederived isoprenoids. Of note, these cells present an exaggerated response to inflammatory stimuli that can be reduced by treatment with zaragozic acid, an inhibitor of squalene synthase, thus increasing the availability of isoprenoids intermediates upstream the enzymatic block.A similar action might be obtained by lapaquistat  (TAK-475, Takeda), a drug that underwent extensive clinical trials as a cholesterol lowering agent 10 years ago, with a good safety profile.Here we describe the preclinical evidence supporting the possible repositioning of TAK-475 from its originally intended use to the treatment of MKD and discuss its potential to modulate the mevalonate pathway in inflammatory diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236236>Effects of dietary hull-less barley β-glucan on the cholesterol metabolism of hypercholesterolemic hamsters.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effects of dietary hull-less barley β-glucan (HBG) on cholesterol metabolism in hamsters which were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet. The hamsters were divided into 3 groups and fed experimental diets, containing 5‰ HBG or 5‰ oat β-glucan (OG), for 30days. The HBG, as well as OG, lowered the concentration of plasma LDL-cholesterol significantly. The excretion of total lipids and cholesterol in feces were increased in HBG and OG groups compared with the control group. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in liver was reduced significantly in the HBG group compared with the control and OG groups. The activity of cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the liver, in the HBG and OG groups, was significantly increased compared with the control group. The concentrations of , propionate and total short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were not significantly different between the HBG and control groups. These results indicate that dietary HBG reduces the concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol by promoting the excretion of fecal lipids, and regulating the activities of HMG-CoA reductase and CYP7A1 in hypercholesterolemic hamsters.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TP508 is also known to readily convert to a dimer in an aqueous environment. In this study the dimeric form of TP508 was investigated in a porcine model of acute myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (and compared with its monomer). Twenty-four hypercholesterolemic pigs underwent 60 min of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion and received either vehicle (n = 6), TP508 monomer (n = 6), or two different doses of dimer (n = 6). Infarct size was significantly reduced in the monomer and two dimer groups compared with vehicle. Improvement in both endothelium-dependent and -independent coronary microvascular relaxations was also observed in treated groups. In addition, the expression of 27-kDa heat shock protein, alphaB-crystalline, and phosphorylated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Ser70) in the ischemic area at risk were higher in treated groups than in vehicle, whereas the expression of cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase was lower in treated groups. Finally, there were fewer apoptotic cells in treated groups than in vehicle. This study suggests that TP508 dimer provides a myocardial-protective effect on acute ischemia reperfusion injury in hypercholesterolemic swine, similar to TP508 monomer, by up-regulating cell survival pathways or down-regulating apoptotic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17019381>Effects of soy germ isoflavones and hormone therapy on nitric oxide derivatives, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, and vascular reactivity in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effects of soy germ isoflavones and hormone therapy on vascular reactivity, the formation of nitric oxide derivatives, and lipid peroxidation in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women.Women were treated with soy germ, 17beta-estradiol or 17beta-estradiol + noretisterone  for 3 months after taking placebo for 1 month. The plasma concentrations of nitrite + nitrate and S-nitrosothiols were evaluated by gaseous phase chemiluminescence; nitrotyrosine, electronegative low-density lipoprotein, and estradiol levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; cholesterol oxides and isoflavones were determined by gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Vascular reactivity was analyzed by high-resolution ultrasonography.Soy germ isoflavones and hormone therapy induced a decrease in nitrite + nitrate, electronegative low-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol oxides, as well as an increase in S-nitrosothiols. Soy germ isoflavones lowered electronegative low-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol oxides more efficiently than did hormone therapy. Only soy isoflavones inhibited nitrotyrosine formation. A significant improvement of vascular reactivity was only seen in women treated with 17beta-estradiol.The soy germ isoflavones and 17beta-estradiol, alone or associated with noretisterone , in the doses and forms used here, have similar effects on the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Soy germ treatment inhibited lipid peroxidation more effectively than hormone therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11531212>Hepatic de novo lipogenesis after liver transplantation.</a></h2><p>The liver can synthesize fatty acids from carbohydrate (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]). We hypothesized that stimulation of this process may be involved in the development of obesity and dyslipidemia, 2 conditions frequently encountered after liver transplantation.Hepatic fractional DNL and glucose metabolism were measured in 2 groups of 5 patients (age 36.8 +/- [SD] 14.9 years, BMI 26.3+/-5.3 kg/M2) 1 to 5 years after liver transplantation and 8 healthy subjects (age 28.1+/-5.3 years, BMI 27.2+/-4.5 kg/M2). Subjects were studied while receiving an isoenergetic nutrition (based on 1.1 x their basal energy expenditure) as hourly oral liquid formula during 10 hours. Their hepatic DNL was measured by infusing 1-13C  and measuring tracer incorporation in VLDL-palmitate. Their glucose metabolism was assessed by means of 6,6-2H2 glucose and indirect calorimetry.Two liver transplant recipients and 4 healthy subjects were obese, as defined by a BMI > 27 kg/M2. Fractional hepatic DNL was not different in the 2 groups of subjects: liver transplant recipients 3.1+/-1.7% vs 3.2+/-2.1% in healthy subjects. In both groups, DNL increased in proportion to BMI. When both groups were analyzed together, BMI was positively correlated with DNL (DNL = 0.28 x BMI - 4.28, r2 = .445, p < .05). Whole body glucose turnover was 15.0+/-4.4 micromol/kg per minute in liver transplant recipients and 15.8+/-4.1 micromol/kg per minute in healthy subjects (NS). Net carbohydrate oxidation tended to be lower in liver transplant recipients (8.1+/-2.6 micromol/kg per minute) than in healthy subjects (10.4+/-2.4 micromol/kg per minute; NS). Net nonoxidative glucose disposal (4.0+/-2.7 in liver transplant recipients vs 1.9+/-1.8 in healthy subjects, NS) and energy expenditure (0.065+/-0.01 vs 0.065+/-0.01 kJ/kg per minute) were similar in both groups.These results indicate that fractional hepatic DNL is not altered by liver transplantation during near continuous nutrition. The disposal of orally administered carbohydrate is also essentially unchanged. This strongly argues against a role of hepatic DNL in the pathogenesis of obesity and dyslipidemia after liver transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756946>Role of antioxidant property of carvedilol in mild to moderate hypertensive patients: A prospective open-label study.</a></h2><p>Carvedilol is a nonselective third generation β-blocker that does not display the negative effects of traditional β-blockers. Regarding the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and distinct metabolic properties of carvedilol which are similar to that of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1), the present study intends to investigate the effects of carvedilol treatment on malondialdehyde (MDA) and soluble lectin-like ox-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (sLOX-1) as markers of oxidative stress in association to lipid profiles, apolipoproteins (apo), and PON1 activity in hypertensive patients.This clinical trial study was performed on forty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Subjects were studied before and after 2 months treatment with carvedilol, 25 mg daily. Lipids and lipoproteins were measured using a biochemistry analyzer. PON and arylesterase activity were assayed using paraoxon and phenyl  as substrates, respectively. MDA was quantified using a chemical colorimetric assay. ELISA was used to measure sLOX-1.Our results showed that carvedilol treatment decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as much as forty and 16 mmHg, respectively ( < 0.001). It also increased HDL, total cholesterol, and serum PON1 activity ( < 0.05), but the levels of triglyceride, LDL, apo A-I, and apo B did not significantly change. There was an inverse correlation between serum PON1 activity and serum MDA.This study confirmed the antihypertensive effect of the drug and its beneficial metabolic effects through augmenting HDL and PON1 activity. We propose that the antioxidant effects of carvedilol can be partially attributed to increased PON-1 activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406357>Antidiabetic effect of Streblus asper in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>In the Indian traditional system of medicine, Streblus asper Lour (Moraceae) is prescribed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.In the present study, α-amyrin  isolated from S. asper, and the petroleum ether extract of S. asper stem bark (PESA) was screened for their antidiabetic properties in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Successive Soxhlet extraction of the dried stem bark with petroleum ether and then with ethanol (95%) yielded petroleum ether and ethanol extracts, respectively, which were concentrated under reduced pressure. Hyperglycemia was induced in rats by STZ (50 mg/kg, b.w.). Twenty-four hours after STZ induction, respective groups of diabetic rats received PESA (100, 250 and 500 mg/kg, b.w.) and α-amyrin  (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg, b.w.) respectively, orally daily for 15 days. Glibenclamide (0.5 mg/kg, orally) served as a reference. Blood glucose levels were measured on every 5th day during the 15 days of treatment. The serum lipid profiles and biochemical parameters, viz., serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin level, were measured.PESA significantly (p < 0.01) normalized blood-glucose levels and serum biochemical parameters as compared with those of STZ controls. α-Amyrin  (75 mg/kg, b.w.) exhibited maximum glucose lowering effect (71.10%) in diabetic rats compared to the other dose (25, 50 mg/kg) at the end of the study. The protective effect was further confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver.PESA and α-amyrin  demonstrated remarkable antidiabetic activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24379186>Synergistic effects of high blood cholesterol and hypertension on leukocyte and platelet recruitment in the cerebral microcirculation.</a></h2><p>Hypertension or hypercholesterolemia can induce a proinflammatory and prothrombogenic phenotype in the microcirculation of the brain; however, less is known about how the combination of these risk factors affects the vasculature. We recently reported that a moderate (60%) increase in plasma cholesterol blunts the recruitment of leukocytes and platelets in the cerebral microvessels elicited by hypertension. In this study, we examined whether larger increments in blood cholesterol (4-fold) exerts a similar modulating influence on the vasculature in the presence of hypertension. Apolipoprotein E-knockout mice with deoxycorticosterone  salt-induced hypertension were placed on a high-cholesterol diet and exhibited exaggerated leukocyte and platelet adhesion responses in cerebral microvessels. Intermittent feeding (every fourth day) with high-cholesterol diet yielded similar phenotypic changes in the vasculature. Once the mice were placed on high-cholesterol diet, 4 days on normal diet (ND) were needed to revert to a normal vascular phenotype. Angiotensin II type 1 receptors and reactive oxygen species seem to contribute to the vascular responses induced by hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Our findings indicate that the combination of hypertension and large increases in plasma cholesterol concentration results in a severe, but reversible, inflammatory and thrombogenic phenotype in the cerebral microvasculature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15623833>Hyperlipidemic subjects have reduced uptake of newly absorbed vitamin E into their plasma lipoproteins, erythrocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes, as studied by deuterium-labeled alpha-tocopherol biokinetics.</a></h2><p>Vitamin E homeostasis in  is poorly understood. The biokinetics of deuterated alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) in blood components was investigated in normolipidemic (N; total cholesterol < 5.5 mmol/L and triglycerides < 1.5 mmol/L, n = 9), hypercholesterolemic (HC; total cholesterol > 6.5 mmol/L and triglycerides < 1.5 mmol/L, n = 10), and combined hypercholesterolemic and hypertriglyceridemic (HCT; total cholesterol > 6.5 mmol/L and triglycerides > 2.5 mmol/L, n = 6) subjects. Subjects ingested 150 mg hexadeuterated RRR-alpha-tocopheryl , and blood was collected up to 48 h after ingestion. Labeled alpha-T was measured in plasma, lipoproteins, erythrocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. In plasma, HC had an earlier time of maximum concentration (6 h) compared with N and HCT (12 h) (P < 0.05). HCT had a lower uptake of labeled alpha-T (P < 0.005) and a longer half-life (P < 0.05). In chylomicrons, the maximum labeled alpha-T concentration was higher in HC compared with N and HCT (P < 0.00005); however, HCT had a lower uptake of labeled alpha-T in LDL. In all groups, the lowest density LDL subfraction contained more labeled alpha-T than denser subfractions (P < 0.05). In platelets, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes, the areas under the labeled alpha-T concentration vs. time curves were in the order N > HC > HCT. In lymphocytes, differences in labeled alpha-T were found at 6 and 48 h (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that there are differences in the uptake of newly absorbed alpha-T into blood components in . Because these blood components are functionally affected by vitamin E, reduced uptake of alpha-T may be relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11942476>Hypolipidemic action of the soybean isoflavones genistein and genistin in glomerulonephritic rats.</a></h2><p>Effects of genistein and its glycoside genistin were studied in nephritic rats with endogenous . Male Wistar rats with glomerulonephritis caused by a single intravenous injection of nephrotoxic serum were orally given 5 mg of genistein or 8 mg of genistin/d/100 g body weight for 12 d. These isoflavones suppressed nephritis-induced severe hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and their hypolipidemic action was almost identical. Fecal steroid excretion was unchanged by administration of the two isoflavones. Genistein inhibited the incorporation of [1-14C] into cholesterol and FA in liver slices from nephritic rats when added to an incubation buffer, whereas genistin did not. These results suggest that genistin may be hydrolyzed to genistein and that genistein itself and/or its metabolite(s) may be intracorporal entities suppressing hepatic lipid syntheses. They also suggest that the suppression of hepatic lipid synthesis may be one mechanism of the hypolipidemic action of genistein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11343693>Deterioration of the protein kinase C-K(ATP) channel pathway in regulation of coronary flow in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits.</a></h2><p>We studied the effect of experimental hypercholesterolaemia/atherosclerosis on changes in coronary flow and cardiac function, induced by protein kinase C and ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel modulators in isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Both phorbol 12-myristate-13- (PMA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB, 0.1 microM each), activators of protein kinase C, decreased, whereas staurosporine, (0.1 microM), a protein kinase C inhibitor, increased coronary flow and left ventricular dP/dt, an index of ventricular contractility. Glyburide (5-50 microM), a K(ATP) channel inhibitor, blocked the effect of staurosporine. The phorbol esters were without effect in the presence of pinacidil (5 microM), a K(ATP) channel activator. Neither the protein kinase C modulators nor glyburide produced any effect on coronary flow and left ventricular contractility, when the hearts were prepared from animals either maintained on a cholesterol (1.5%)-enriched diet or treated with lovastatin (5 mg/kg/day per os). Treatment with farnesol (1 mg/kg twice a day for 7 days intravenously) restored the reactivity of hearts from either hypercholesterolaemic or lovastatin-treated animals to protein kinase C modulators. We conclude that non-cholesterol mevalonate products are necessary for the functional integrity of the protein kinase C-K(ATP) channel pathway in the rabbit heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671004>Hypertriglyceridemic Pancreatitis Caused by the Oral Contraceptive Agent Estrostep.</a></h2><p>Norethindrone /ethinyl estradiol (Estrostep; Warner Chilcott, Rockaway, New Jersey) is an "estrophasic" type of oral contraceptive, which combines a continuous low progestin dose with a gradually increasing estrogen dose. In clinical trials, this medication failed to produce clinically significant changes in serum lipid levels. We report a case of severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis in a 24-year-old woman caused by Estrostep, occurring nearly 10 years after she began using the drug. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for aggressive volume resuscitation and management of severe electrolyte abnormalities. Laboratory studies obtained on admission indicated severe hypertriglyceridemia (2,200 mg/dL), hyponatremia (120 mEq/L), and hypocalcemia (0.78 mmol/L). Amylase and lipase levels were also elevated (193 and 200 U/L, respectively). Ranson score calculated after 48 hours of admission was 4, and her Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score was 35. Treatment included an insulin infusion, ω-3 fatty acid esters, and gemfibrozil. The insulin infusion reduced serum triglyceride levels by 50% after 1 day of treatment and to 355 mg/dL by day 7 of her ICU course. We believe that this is the first reported case of severe, acute hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis caused by this medication.© The Author(s) 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16780846>Concord grape juice attenuates platelet aggregation, serum cholesterol and development of atheroma in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.</a></h2><p>Intake of Concord grape juice (CGJ), rich in polyphenolics, inhibits platelet aggregation (PA), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), in normocholesterolemic animals and humans. It is unclear whether CGJ can attenuate hypercholesterolemia-enhanced PA. The effects of daily CGJ consumption on hypercholesterolemia-enhanced PA and the development of atherosclerosis were investigated. Two groups of rabbits (Control and Treated; n=10 each) were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet for 48 days. Treated group then received supplemental CGJ (225mL/day) while Control group received supplemental iso-caloric sugar water for 48 days. Collagen-, collagen+epinephrine- and phorbol-12-myristate-13--induced whole blood PA responses were measured on Days 0, 48 and 96; total serum cholesterol and blood pressure were also measured. The development of aortic atheroma was quantified at the end. Both groups showed significant increases in PA and serum cholesterol at Day 48. However, at Day 96, Treated group showed significantly lower PA and development of atheroma (30.7+/-3.9% lower (p<0.001)) than Control group; Treated group also had significantly lower total serum cholesterol and blood pressure than Control group. In conclusion, daily consumption of CGJ attenuates hypercholesterolemia-enhanced PA, blood pressure, total serum cholesterol and development of atheroma in rabbits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11063909>Studies of LDL oxidation following alpha-, gamma-, or delta-tocotrienyl  supplementation of hypercholesterolemic humans.</a></h2><p>In vitro tocotrienols (T3s) have potent vitamin E antioxidant activity, but unlike tocopherols can inhibit cholesterol synthesis by suppressing 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarylCoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Because hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may be involved in atherogenesis, we investigated whether daily supplements of placebo, or alpha-, gamma-, or delta- (alpha-, gamma-, or delta-) tocotrienyl acetates would alter serum cholesterol or LDL oxidative resistance in hypercholesterolemics in a double-blind placebo controlled study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 13), alpha- (n = 13), gamma- (n = 12), or delta- (n = 13) tocotrienyl  supplements (250 mg/d). All subjects followed a low-fat diet for 4 weeks, then took supplements with dinner for the following 8 weeks while still continuing diet restrictions. Plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherols were unchanged by supplementation. Plasma T3s were undetectable initially and always in the placebo group. Following supplementation in the respective groups plasma concentrations were: alpha-T3 0.98 +/- 0.80 micromol/l, gamma-T3 0.54 +/- 0.45 micromol/l, and delta-T3 0.09 +/- 0.07 micromol/l. Alpha-T3 increased in vitro LDL oxidative resistance (+22%, p <.001) and decreased its rate of oxidation (p <. 01). Neither serum or LDL cholesterol nor apolipoprotein B were significantly decreased by tocotrienyl  supplements. This study demonstrates that: (i) tocotrienyl  supplements are hydrolyzed, absorbed, and detectable in human plasma; (ii) tocotrienyl  supplements do not lower cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic subjects on low-fat diets; and (iii) alpha-T3 may be potent in decreasing LDL oxidizability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25720374>Antihyperlipidemic and biochemical activities of Mcy protein in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of a novel anti-hyperglycemic "Mcy protein" isolated from the fruits of Momordica cymbalaria in streptozotocin induced- diabetes rat model.Wild type and Streptozotocin induced diabetic male wistar albino rats were either treated with single intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg Mcy protein/kg body weight or  buffer daily for 30 days.

In the present study, ethyl  fraction of P. emodi (Pe.EA) was subjected to column chromatography to obtain sub- fractions. These sub-fractions were screened for their cardioprotective activity in isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO) induced myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. The most active fraction Pe. EA 40 was used for its gold nanoparticles synthesis (Pe.EA 40-AuNPs). Pe.EA 40 and Pe.EA 40-AuNPs were investigated for their cardioprotective, antihyperlipidemic, DNA fragmentation assay and histopathological study. Pe.EA 40 (80 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced the serum levels of Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) to 66.07 ± 1.54, 77.08 ± 1.79, 84.86 ± 1.34 and 265.34 ± 4.34 IU/L respectively as compared to ISO treated group. Pe.EA 40-AuNPs (40 mg/kg) reduced the levels of ALT, AST, CPK and LDH to 60.74 ± 2.79, 75.47 ± 1.67, 80.48 ± 2.64 and 247.54. ± 5.57 IU/L respectively. A significant reduction was observed in lipid profile, protection in DNA damage and restoration of histopathological changes as compared to ISO treated group.

Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) has been the renal replacement therapy for the past 5 years since a failed cadaveric renal transplant. Past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, bilateral subclavian vein thrombosis with superior vena cava syndrome, secondary hyperparathyroidism, leukemia (at age 8), and . On presentation, soft tissue nodules were noted in the anterolateral surfaces of the legs. After 3 months of continued low-calcium-dialysate CCPD, calcitriol, and oral phosphate binders, a 2 x 3 cm nodule was noted on the posterior aspect of the thorax at the scapula. The only complaint at this time was shoulder pain at the acromioclavicular joint. Radiological examination revealed a 3 x 4 cm soft tissue opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe laterally. Despite a prior subtotal parathyroidectomy, phosphate binders, and calcitriol, the parathyroid hormone levels continued to increase, with development of tumoral calcinosis, worsening renal osteodystrophy, and calciphylaxis. Computed tomography examination revealed extensive soft tissue calcification consistent with tumoral calcinosis. An ulcerative lesion (1 cm) developed on the lateral aspect of the upper thigh owing to warfarin necrosis versus calciphylaxis. At this time, the phosphate binder was changed from calcium  to sevelamer hydrochloride. Aggressive wound treatment and aggressive calcium and phosphate control added to the treatment regimen has resulted in healing of the single ulcer and a decrease in the size of the tumoral lesions. In conclusion, early recognition and aggressive treatment of calciphylaxis can result in reduced morbidity and mortality from calciphylaxis in ESRD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575974>Antihyperlipidemic effect of Melothria maderaspatana leaf extracts on DOCA-salt induced hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>To investigate the antihyperlipidemic effect of crude ethanolic extract of Melothria maderaspatana (M. maderaspatana) leaf (CEEM) on deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats.A midscapular incision was made on each rat and the left kidney was excised after ligation of the renal artery. The surgical wound was closed using an absorbable suture. After one week recovery period, hypertension was induced by subcutaneous injection of DOCA-salt solution, twice a week, and the rats received a 1% sodium chloride solution as drinking water throughout the experimental period. CEEM or nifedipine was administered orally once a day for 6 weeks.In DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, the level of plasma and tissues of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA) and phospholipids (PL) significantly increased and administration of CEEM significantly reduced these parameters towards normality. Further, the levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) significantly increased while high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased in hypertensive rats and administration of CEEM brought these parameters to normality which proved their antihyperlipidemic action. Histopathology of liver, kidney and heart on DOCA-salt induced rats treated with CEEM showed reduced the damages towards normal histology.These findings provided evidence that CEEM was found to be protecting the liver, kidney and heart against DOCA-salt administration and the protective effect could attribute to its antihyperlipidemic activities.Copyright © 2012 Hainan Medical College.

It extracts numerous substances from blood including targeted drugs and interfering substances, specifically triglycerides (TG). With increasing prevalence of , the influences of TG on LLE and on subsequent analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) may become a major issue for forensic laboratories. This study aims to elucidate the influences of TG on LLE and to provide possible solutions to this problem. Nineteen commonly encountered drugs in forensic cases were spiked to human whole blood with different TG concentrations. Diethyl ether, ethyl /hexane mixed solutions, chlorobutane and several other frequently used solvents were tested for the extraction of drugs from spiked whole blood. The supernatant organic layer was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted with methanol. The resultant products were analyzed by GC-MS, and the extraction recovery was calculated. LLE with diethyl ether, ethyl /hexane (9:1) and chlorobutane all possessed effective and reliable extraction recoveries for blood sample with low TG concentrations (0.63-6.85 mmol/L). At high TG concentrations, diethyl ether produced a highly turbid substance that could not be further analyzed using GC-MS. Extraction recoveries drastically dropped for ethyl /hexane (9:1) mixture at high TG concentrations, while chlorobutane experienced minimal drops in extraction recoveries. In conclusion, TG levels in whole blood noticeably influence drug recovery to variable extents depending on the LLE solvent. Chlorobutane showed minimal influences from TG content in whole blood and thus is the recommended LLE solvent for forensic drug extraction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972288>Alteration of gut bacteria and metabolomes after glucaro-1,4-lactone treatment contributes to the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone (1,4-GL) has been shown to have a hypocholesterolemic effect in rats and human subjects. However, little information is known concerning the alteration of metabolome associated with the effect. Here, we show that 1,4-GL delays the development of hypercholesterolemia with the coadministration of a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFHC) in rats. Metabonomic results based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that urinary trimethylamine N-oxide, trimethylamine, lactate, , formate, and creatinine are significantly altered after 1,4-GL and HFHC treatments. Colonic flora test results reveal that the quantity of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the intestines respectively increase by about 1.7- and 4.2-fold in rats treated with 1,4-GL compared with those in the control group. Rats that were coadministered with HFHC and 1,4-GL exhibit normal levels of lactate and  in serum and display urinary excretions of lactate and  that are 2 to 3 times higher compared with those treated with HFHC alone. The results imply that the increased probiotic quantities and urinary excretion of breakdown products of fat/cholesterol after 1,4-GL treatment contribute to the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.

The extracts and fractions of A. wilhelmsii were thoroughly analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the total content of phenols and flavonoids was determined. The hypoglycemic activity was evaluated in vivo using alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The effect upon inflammatory mediators was evaluated in vitro using the human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). The anti-hypercholesterolemic activity was evaluated in vitro using the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase assay kit. The water extract (WE)-treated group showed the highest reduction in the fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL). The chloroform fraction (CF) and ethyl  fraction (EAF) both showed a significant ability to reduce the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).

Retrospective analysis of 61 patients with CRPC on AA or enzalutamide, treated at the Boston Medical Center, was performed. We evaluated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), HDL, LDL, Triglycerides and BMI within 2months before the initiation of treatment with AA or enzalutamide and progression-free survival (PFS) under this treatment. Regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to evaluate the data. HbA1c levels were found to predict adversely the PFS on the novel agents (df (1, 37), P=0.00, R(2)=0.40, coeff=-3.28). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that there is significant difference in survival between the HbA1c 4.7-5.9% compared with patients with HbA1c 7.8-11.6% (6.72±1.3months, log rank test P<0.0001) LDL (P=0.07), HDL (P=0.14), and triglycerides (P=0.33) were not found to predict PFS. BMI predicted PFS positively (df (1.59), P=0.02, R(2)=0.09, coeff=0.03), but not independently of HbA1c (P=0.07). No significant implications of social and family history, previous chemotherapy regimen, and Gleason score with PFS were found. Multiple markers of patients' health state were not associated with HbA1c values. Uncontrolled diabetes can predict for poor response of CRPC patients to AA and enzalutamide determining PFS under this treatment. Elevated BMI can positively affect PFS at this stage of disease.© 2016 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25780672>Antihyperlipidemic Activity of the Ethyl- Fraction of Stereospermum Suaveolens in Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Dyslipidemia in diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ethyl- fraction of an ethanolic extract from Streospermum suaveolens on lipid metabolism in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced by intraperitonial injection of STZ (50 mg/kg). Diabetic rats were treated with an ethyl- fraction orally at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg daily for 14 days. On the 15(th) day, serum lipid profiles, such as total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), were estimated in experimental rats. The atherogenic (AI) and the coronary risk (CRI) indices were also evaluated.The ethyl- fraction at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg significantly (P< 0.001) and dose-dependently reduced serum cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, but increased HDL towards near normal levels as compared to diabetic control rats. The fraction also significantly (P< 0.001) lowered the atherogenic index (AI) and coronary risk index (CAI) in a dose-dependent manner.The present study demonstrated that the ethyl- fraction of Stereospermum suaveolens exhibits a potent antihyperlipidemic activity in hyperglycemic rats and suggests that the plant may have therapeutic value in treating the diabetic complication of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18809454>Comparative evaluation of the hypolipidemic effects of coconut water and lovastatin in rats fed fat-cholesterol enriched diet.</a></h2><p>The coconut water presents a series of nutritional and therapeutic properties, being a natural, acid and sterile solution, which contains several biologically active components, l-arginine, ascorbic acid, minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, which have beneficial effects on lipid levels. Recent studies in our laboratory showed that both tender and mature coconut water feeding significantly (P<0.05) reduced  in cholesterol fed rats [Sandhya, V.G., Rajamohan, T., 2006. Beneficial effects of coconut water feeding on lipid metabolism in cholesterol fed rats. J. Med. Food 9, 400-407]. The current study evaluated the hypolipidemic effect of coconut water (4ml/100g body weight) with a lipid lowering drug, lovastatin (0.1/100g diet) in rats fed fat-cholesterol enriched diet ad libitum for 45 days. Coconut water or lovastatin supplementation lowered the levels of serum total cholesterol, VLDL+LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol in experimental rats (P<0.05). Coconut water feeding decreased activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes and increased HMG CoA reductase and lipoprotein lipase activity (P<0.05). Incorporation of radioactive  into free and ester cholesterol in the liver were higher in coconut water treated rats. Coconut water supplementation increased hepatic bile acid and fecal bile acids and neutral sterols (P<0.05). Coconut water has lipid lowering effect similar to the drug lovastatin in rats fed fat-cholesterol enriched diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16815506>Medroxyprogesterone  attenuates long-term effects of 17beta-estradiol in coronary arteries from hyperlipidemic rabbits.</a></h2><p>The progestin component in hormone replacement treatment may oppose the effects of estrogen on vascular function. This study examined the effect of long-term treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) alone and in combination with two progestins on K(+) and Ca(2+)-mediated mechanisms in coronary arteries.Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were treated orally with either E(2) (4 mg/day), medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) (10 mg/day), norethindrone  (NETA) (2 mg/day), E(2)+MPA, E(2)+NETA, or placebo for 16 weeks (n=10 in each group). Coronary arteries were used for mRNA and myograph studies.E(2) increased vasodilatation induced by sodium nitroprusside and decreased vasocontraction induced by potassium. The first but not the latter response was opposed by MPA. The combination of MPA and E(2), but neither compound alone enhanced nimodipine-induced vasodilatation and increased the expression of L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel mRNA. NETA had no opposing effects. Hormone treatment did not affect large-conductance Ca(2+) activated or ATP-sensitive K(+) channels or cGMP-dependent protein kinase mRNA expression.  had no effect on vascular reactivity.When E(2) is administered with MPA, effects of E(2) on nitric oxide and Ca(2+)-mediated vascular reactivity in rabbit coronary arteries are modulated. The results suggest that the progestin component in hormone replacement treatment may interfere with the supposed beneficial vascular effects of estrogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22658257>Salvianolic acid B inhibits macrophage uptake of modified low density lipoprotein (mLDL) in a scavenger receptor CD36-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a host of vascular inflammatory diseases. Through a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for CD36 antagonist, we previously identified salvianolic acid B (SAB), a hydrophilic component derived from the herb Danshen, as a potential candidate. Danshen, the dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been widely used in China for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis-related disorders. Previous studies showed that SAB acted as an anti-oxidant by preventing lipid peroxidation and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) formation. The present study was to investigate the specificity and efficacy of SAB in the inhibition of CD36-mediated lipid uptake. SAB reduced modified LDL (mLDL) uptake in a dose-dependent manner in phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA)-stimulated THP-1 and RAW 264.7 cells. In the CD36 silenced THP-1 cells, SAB had no effect in reducing mLDL uptake, whereas its overexpression in CHO cells reinstates the effect, indicating a specific involvement of SAB in antagonizing the CD36's function. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed a direct binding of SAB to CD36 with a high affinity (K(D) = 3.74 μM), confirming physical interactions of SAB with the receptor. Additionally, SAB reduced oxLDL-induced CD36 gene expression in the cultured cell lines and primary macrophages. In ApoE KO mice fed a high fat diet, SAB reduced CD36 gene expression and lipid uptake in macrophages, showing its ability to antagonize CD36 pathways in vivo. These results demonstrate that SAB is an effective CD36 antagonist and suggest SAB as a potential anti-atherosclerotic agent.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Parameters such as free fatty acid and cholesterol content in blood were determined enzymically. The biosynthesis of cholesterol and triacylglycerols was determined in HepG2 cells using the radioactive precursor [(14)C]- and by using gas chromatography. Plasma free fatty acids were significantly decreased 5 and 10 min after an Ap(4)A bolus (0.75 mg kg(-1) b.w.) given to rats. Plasma cholesterol was reduced 5 and 60 min after Ap(4)A administration. LPDS (lipoprotein-deficient serum)-stimulated cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells was significantly reduced after 1 h incubation with Ap(4)A. Triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in HepG2 cells was not significantly influenced by Ap(4)A; there was just a tendency for a concentration-dependent decrease in TAG levels. In conclusion Ap(4)A as a diabetogenetic compound is not likely to be responsible for the development of insulin resistance or of . Parameters such as free fatty acids, cholesterol and triacylglycerols are not elevated by Ap(4)A, but are even decreased.

We investigated the physiological effects of a concentrated oat beta-glucan on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints in human subjects. We also compared the fermentability of concentrated oat beta-glucan with inulin and guar gum in a model intestinal fermentation system.Seventy-five hypercholesterolemic men and women were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: 6 grams/day concentrated oat beta-glucan or 6 grams/day dextrose (control). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, homocysteine and C-reactive protein (CRP). To estimate colonic fermentability, 0.5 g concentrated oat beta-glucan was incubated in a batch model intestinal fermentation system, using human fecal inoculum to provide representative microflora. Fecal donors were not involved with the beta-glucan feeding trial. Inulin and guar gum were also incubated in separate serum bottles for comparison.Oat beta-glucan produced significant reduction from baseline in total cholesterol (-0.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol (-0.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L), and the reduction in LDL cholesterol were significantly greater than in the control group (p = 0.03). Concentrated oat beta-glucan was a fermentable fiber and produced total SCFA and  concentrations similar to inulin and guar gum. Concentrated oat beta-glucan produced the highest concentrations of butyrate at 4, 8, and 12 hours.Six grams concentrated oat beta-glucan per day for six weeks significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol in subjects with elevated cholesterol, and the LDL cholesterol reduction was greater than the change in the control group. Based on a model intestinal fermentation, this oat beta-glucan was fermentable, producing higher amounts of butyrate than other fibers. Thus, a practical dose of beta-glucan can significantly lower serum lipids in a high-risk population and may improve colon health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21518985>Lapaquistat : development of a squalene synthase inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Lapaquistat  is a squalene synthase inhibitor investigated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.This report summarizes the phase 2 and 3 results from the lapaquistat clinical program, which was halted at an advanced stage as a result of potential hepatic safety issues. Efficacy and safety data were pooled from 12 studies (n=6151). These were 6- to 96-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- or active-controlled trials with lapaquistat monotherapy or coadministration with other lipid-altering drugs in dyslipidemic patients, including a large (n=2121) 96-week safety study. All studies included lapaquistat 100 mg daily; 5 included 50 mg; and 1 included 25 mg. The main outcome measures were the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, secondary lipid/metabolic parameters, and overall safety. Lapaquistat 100 mg significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 21.6% in monotherapy and by 18.0% in combination with a statin. It also reduced other cardiovascular risk markers, such as C-reactive protein. Total adverse events were higher for lapaquistat than placebo, although individual events were generally similar. At 100 mg, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase value ≥3 times the upper limit of normal on ≥2 consecutive visits (2.0% versus 0.3% for placebo in the pooled efficacy studies; 2.7% versus 0.7% for low-dose atorvastatin in the long-term study). Two patients receiving lapaquistat 100 mg met the Hy Law criteria of alanine aminotransferase elevation plus increased total bilirubin.Squalene synthase inhibition with lapaquistat , alone or in combination with statins, effectively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase, combined with a rare increase in bilirubin, presented potential hepatic safety issues, resulting in termination of development.

We investigated the effects of 12 months of treatment with conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone  on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and other lipoproteins in Japanese postmenopausal women (PMW) with and without dyslipidemia.Forty-three normolipidemic and 17 dyslipidemic PMW [total cholesterol (TC) >/=220 mg/dl or triglyceride (TG) >/=150 mg/dl] received conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone  (2.5 mg) daily for 12 months, and the results were compared with those of 26 normolipidemic and 14 dyslipidemic subjects declining this treatment as controls. The fasting serum levels of Lp(a), TC, TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) AI, Apo AII, Apo B, Apo CII, and Apo E were measured in each subject at baseline and 12 months after this treatment initiation.The treatment decreased Lp(a) similarly in normolipidemic and dyslipidemic PMW and decreased TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Apo CII, and Apo E and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Apo AI, and Apo AII in both groups. The therapy also significantly increased TG in normolipidemic but not dyslipidemic subjects. In controls, the levels of Lp(a) and other lipoproteins were unaltered.In PMW with or without dyslipidemia, improvement in Lp(a) and other lipoproteins may represent cardiovascular benefits of hormone replacement therapy. However, an elevation of the TG levels seen with the therapy warrants caution, especially in PMW without dyslipidemia.Copyright 2004 S.

In the study we investigate the effects of this mushroom on hyperlipidemic hamster rats. Four dietary forms of the mushroom were created as follows. The powdered dry fruiting body, hot-water extract, and two kinds of elutes were obtained, from ethyl  extract and methanol extract, respectively, in different mixed proportion solvents over silica gel column chromatography (referred to as EAE and MOE, respectively). They were tested at different dosages as a supplement to a high-fat diet in hyperlipidemic rats. Serum triglycerides and total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in groups supplemented with the highest dosages of EAE and MOE (0.5 g/kg, body weight daily) as compared with the control groups that received no mushroom additive. High-density lipoprotein levels in these same two experimental groups were also significantly higher than those in the negative control group. The tested rats that were fed with EAE had the highest serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity, and those with the MOE and EAE had the highest DPPH free radical scavenging activities and ferric-reducing abilities, tested in vitro. The major constituents of MOE and EAE were identified as ergosterol and nicotinic acid, respectively. P. citrinopileatus extracts may have a significant antihyperlipidemia effect.

WSCA reduced cholesterol and triglyceride content in the cells and their supernatant. WSCA inhibited the incorporation of [2-14C] into cellular cholesterol and fatty acids, suggesting the inhibition of lipid synthesis. In addition, WSCA inhibited HMG-CoA reductase, a key metabolic enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. WSCA also increased cholesterol and fatty acid secretion into the cell supernatant, suggesting the enhanced removal of cholesterol and fatty acids. Furthermore, WSCA showed decreased linoleic acid (18:2) and arachidonic acid (20:4) content in HepG2 cells.

In addition, effect of coconut protein were compared with rats fed L-arginine. The results indicate that those fed coconut protein and those fed L-arginine showed significantly lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL+ VLDL cholesterol, Triglycerides and Phospholipids in the serum and higher levels of serum HDL cholesterol. The concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids in the tissues were lower in these groups. There was increased hepatic cholesterogenesis which is evident from the higher rate of incorporation of labeled  into free cholesterol. Increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and increased fecal excretion of bile acids were observed. Feeding coconut protein results in decreased levels of Malondialdehyde in the heart and increased activity of Superoxide dismutase and Catalase. Supplementation of coconut protein causes increased excretion of urinary nitrate which implies higher rate of conversion of arginine into nitric oxide. In the present study, the arginine supplemented group and the coconut protein fed group produced similar effects.

In addition, the high-fat diet caused a remarkable increase of ALT, AST, GLU, TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA levels. A decline in HDL-C and SOD concentrations and a reversal of effects were observed in different Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) extracts groups, especially in the aqueous extract and ethanol extract groups.The different extracts of Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) can play a protecting role against liver injury in  rats maybe through decreasing ALT, AST, GLU, TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA levels and enhancing the liver anti-oxidative ability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602892>[Correlation between lipid-lowering efficacy and components of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae].</a></h2><p>Based on pharmacodynamics-component correlation analysis,the best effective part of  of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae( PCR) was screened out to confirm the possible constituents with the lipid regulating effect,in order to provide a basis for the development of new drugs.  rats induced by fat emulsion were used to screen out the best hypolipidemic parts of PCR with TC,LDL-c as the index. HPLC-ESI-MS were used to analyze common constituents of the different solvent extracts from PCR. The constituents were classified and identified based on the retention time,m/z and UV spectra. And the HPLC-DAD were used to determine the contents of flavonoids( narirutin,hesperidin,didymin,nobiletin,tangeretin,3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptemthoxyflavone).Correlation analysis was conducted on the constituents and efficacy with the method of SPSS ANOVA bivariate correlation. Five extracts could significantly decrease the content of TC,LDL-c of hyperlipemia rats induced by fat emulsion,and the best effective part were95% ethanol and ethyl . There were 19 common peaks in five different solvent extracts from PCR,and 17 flavonoids were identified and classified,including 10 polymethoxyflavonoids and 7 other flavonoids. According to the raw material quantity,the order of content of flavonones arranged from high to low: n-butyl alcohol part> 95% ethanol part> water part> ethyl  part> petroleum ether part; and the order of PMFs arranged from high to low: n-butyl alcohol part≈95% ethanol part≈ethyl  part > petroleum ether part > water part. The decreased percentage of TC,LDL-c was positively correlated with 10 common PMFs constituents,which suggested that PMFs may be the effective components for reducing blood lipid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27937042>Prevention of hypertension-induced vascular dementia by Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented products.</a></h2><p>Numerous etiological studies have established positive clinical association between hypertension and vascular dementia (VaD). Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented products have been shown to decrease vascular risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis,  and obesity.This study investigated the effect of ethanol extract of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented products (NTU101F) in hypertension-induced VaD in rats.Hypertension was promoted by subcutaneous injection of deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA, 25 mg/kg body weight/day, twice a week) and substitution of drinking water with 1.0% NaCl and 0.2% KCl. The NTU101F groups (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0) administered NTU101F at the concentrations 11, 22, and 110 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively, starting from day 51 day of DOCA-salt treatment. Morris water maze (MWM) was used for testing learning and memory. Different biochemical estimations were used to assess oxidative stress and inflammatory response in hippocampus.Oral administration of NTU101F in DOCA-salt hypertension-induced VaD rats resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure by 18.3-23.2% (p < 0.001), which was regulated by increasing eNOS density (about 3-fold) in the aorta, promoting NO production, and decreasing of matrix metallopeptidase 9 activity (about 2-fold) in the hippocampus, in addition to improve the kidney function and structure, decrease escape latency and increase the times spent in the target quadrant by 23.5-27.8% (p < 0.05).Overall, our findings suggest that NTU101F could exert neuroprotection in the brain and attenuate hypertension-induced VaD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19330879>Serum high-molecular weight adiponectin is related to early postprandial glycemic increases and gastric emptying in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hyperglycemia and  are frequently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical determinants of postprandial glycemia and lipemia, especially serum high-molecular weight adiponectin.Twenty-seven diabetic patients treated with diet alone and 13 healthy volunteers took liquid test meal containing 53 g carbohydrate and 47 g lipid, dosed with nonradioactive isotope (13)C-. Venous blood and breath samples were obtained for 180 min after the meal. Gastric emptying was evaluated by peak excretion time of (13)CO(2) in the breath samples. Delayed gastric emptying was defined as peak excretion time > 2.5 h (mean + 2 SD in the healthy volunteers).Diabetic patients showed delayed insulin secretion, postprandial hyperglycemia and  compared with control. Postprandial glycemic increases significantly correlated with enhanced gastric emptying. Serum high-molecular weight adiponectin correlated with postprandial glycemic increases at 30 and 60 min after meal (r = 0.42, p < 0.05; r = 0.37, p < 0.05, respectively). Serum high-molecular weight adiponectin also correlated with gastric emptying (versus peak excretion time r = - 0.58, p < 0.05). In addition, diabetic patients with delayed gastric emptying showed the suppressed postprandial glycemia with lower serum high-molecular weight adiponectin than those with normal gastric emptying. On the other hand, postprandial increases in serum triglyceride were not related to serum high-molecular weight adiponectin or gastric emptying, but significantly related to liver function test (serum transaminases) and body mass index.Early postprandial glycemic increases were related to elevated serum high-molecular weight adiponectin, which might be associated with enhanced gastric emptying.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11910595>Concurrent use of simvastatin and estrogen--progestin therapy compared with each therapy alone for hypercholesterolemia in postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Substantial improvements in lipoprotein-lipid profiles have previously been shown with both simvastatin and combined estrogen-progestin therapy in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women. Since little is known about the impact of the concomitant use of these therapies, the effects of concurrent hormone therapy and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women have been evaluated.Twenty-three postmenopausal women with fasting serum total cholesterol levels greater than 250 mg/dl received, in a randomized cross-over design, simvastatin (10 mg daily) for 8 weeks or postmenopausal hormone therapy (up to 1.25 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone  daily) for 8 weeks, with an 8-week wash-out interval between the two treatment periods. In a third, non-randomized treatment period after a second wash-out interval, each woman received a combination of simvastatin and postmenopausal hormone therapy in the same dosage regimens as above. Fasting blood was sampled monthly from baseline to measure total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a).For total cholesterol, the mean decreases with hormone therapy, simvastatin and combination therapy were 12% (95% confidence interval 6-17%), 26% (20-31%) and 28% (24-31%), respectively, and for LDL cholesterol 21% (14-27%), 37% (30-44%) and 46% (41-51%), respectively. Simvastatin was more effective than hormone therapy (p < 0.001), while the effect of the combined therapy was even greater (total cholesterol, p = 0.012; LDL cholesterol, p < 0.001). The level of HDL cholesterol increased similarly with each treatment: 4% (-3-11%), 6% (2-10%) and 7% (2-13%), respectively. Triglyceride levels increased with hormone therapy and decreased with simvastatin (p < 0.001), while there was little change with the combination (effect of combined therapy vs. simvastatin, p = 0.002; vs. hormone therapy, p < 0.001). Both hormone therapy and combined therapy reduced lipoprotein(a) similarly (-23% and -14%, respectively, p = 0.078). Simvastatin had no effect on lipoprotein(a) levels.For postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia, use of a statin in combination with continuous combined oral estrogen and progestin therapy can result in a more cardioprotective lipoprotein-lipid profile than that achieved with either therapy used alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25133961>Resource utilization and use of life-extending therapies and corticosteroids in prostate cancer patients with corticosteroid-sensitive comorbidities.</a></h2><p>Corticosteroids (CSs) are used concomitantly with life-extending therapies (LETs) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This study examined time to LETs, LETs and concomitant CS adherence, and monthly all-cause healthcare utilization and costs in patients with CPRC with and without CS-sensitive comorbidities in the Veterans Health Administration population.Patients had CRPC if records showed prostate cancer diagnosis, medical/surgical castration and ≥2 prostate-specific antigen increases through 1 June 2007-31 May 2012. CS-sensitive comorbidities were assessed 6 months prior to the index date. Adherence, defined as medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥0.8, among patients initiating LETs (cabazitaxel, docetaxel, or abiraterone ) before 30 November 2011, resource utilization and costs among patients with concomitant CS were assessed. Statistical analysis included descriptive, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression models.Common CS-sensitive conditions among 12,128 patients with CRPC included hypertension (75.74%) and  (54.69%). Those with glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67), ischemic heart disease (HR = 0.78), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (HR = 0.78) were less likely to be prescribed LETs (all p < 0.01). Duration of LET was shorter among patients with CS-sensitive comorbidities (125.02 vs 133.08 days; p = 0.04) in the 6 month follow-up period. Among LET-treated patients with and without CS-sensitive comorbidities, less than half had MPR ≥ 0.8 (LET: 48.72% vs 54.05%; concomitant CS: 42.19% vs 40.54%, respectively). Cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio = 0.107; 95% confidence interval = 0.012 to 0.966) and PVD (odds ratio = 0.523; 95% confidence interval = 0.276 to 0.991) were associated with reduced CS adherence. Among patients with concomitant CS, those with CS-sensitive comorbidities had more inpatient stays than those without (20.45% vs 12.88%; p = 0.033), incurring higher monthly inpatient costs ($1157 vs $342; p < 0.0001) and total costs ($5725 vs $4772; p = 0.036).CS-sensitive conditions influence initiation and duration of LETs, concomitant CS adherence, inpatient stays, and total costs. Future efforts should focus on specific strategies for treating prostate cancer patients with CS-sensitive comorbidities to ensure that they have appropriate access to LETs and to reduce costs and inpatient stays.

We examined the dose effects of corticosteroids on the development of ON in a rabbit model.Rabbits were injected once intramuscularly with 1 (12 rabbits), 5 (12 rabbits), 20 (20 rabbits), and 40 (25 rabbits) mg/kg of methylprednisolone  (MPSL) into the right gluteus medius muscle. Four weeks after the MPSL injection, the proximal and distal parts of both the femora and humeri were histopathologically examined for the presence of ON. Hematological examinations were performed before and after the corticosteroid injection.In rabbits with 1, 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg MPSL, the incidence of ON was 0, 42%, 70%, and 96%, respectively. The dose of MPSL showed a significant association with the incidence of ON. Histologically, reparative tissues around the ON sites were observed in the rabbits with 5 mg/kg MPSL, but not observed in rabbits with 20 and 40 mg/kg MPSL. On hematological examination,  and thrombocytopenia were most apparent in the rabbits receiving 40 mg/kg MPSL.The study suggested that the dose of corticosteroids plays an important role in the development of ON in rabbits. The repair process was also found to be influenced by the dose of corticosteroids. Corticosteroid-induced  and thrombocytopenia seemed to be associated with the incidence of ON.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744780>Relationship between carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia and fatty acid synthesis in lean and obese subjects.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that a eucaloric, low fat, liquid formula diet enriched in simple carbohydrate markedly increased the synthesis of fatty acids in lean volunteers. To examine the diet sensitivity of obese subjects, 7 obese and 12 lean volunteers were given two eucaloric low fat solid food diets enriched in simple sugars for 2 weeks each in a random-order, cross-over design (10% fat, 75% carbohydrate vs. 30% fat, 55% carbohydrate, ratio of sugar to starch 60:40). The fatty acid compositions of both diets were matched to the composition of each subject's adipose tissue and fatty acid synthesis measured by the method of linoleate dilution in plasma VLDL triglyceride. In all subjects, the maximum % de novo synthesized fatty acids in VLDL triglyceride 3;-9 h after the last meal was higher on the 10% versus the 30% fat diet. There was no significant difference between the dietary effects on lean (43+/-13 vs. 12+/-13%) and obese (37+/-15 vs. 6+/-6%) subjects, despite 2-fold elevated levels of insulin and reduced glucagon levels in the obese. Similar results were obtained for de novo palmitate synthesis in VLDL triglyceride measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis after infusion of [(13)C]. On the 10% fat diet, plasma triglycerides (fasting and 24 h) were increased and correlated with fatty acid synthesis. Triglycerides were higher when fatty acid synthesis was constantly elevated rather than having diurnal variation.Thus, eucaloric, solid food diets which are very low in fat and high in simple sugars markedly stimulate fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrate, and plasma triglycerides increase in proportion to the amount of fatty acid synthesis. However, this dietary effect is not related to body mass index, insulin, or glucagon levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843018>Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) producing Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) alleviates age associated oxidative stress and , and improves mitochondrial function in ageing rats.</a></h2><p>Ageing involves oxidative stress mediated by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present work demonstrates the protective effect of PQQ producing EcN against rotenone induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and consequence of mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction in naturally ageing rat model. PQQ is a potent antioxidant molecule also known to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function in mammals.Firstly, adult rats (16-18 weeks old) were treated with rotenone (2.5 mg/kg body weight; i.p.) daily for 28 days along with PQQ (10 mg/kg diet, daily) and modified probiotic EcN strains (10(8) CFU twice weekly). Secondly, ageing rats (48-50 weeks old) were gavaged with probiotic EcN strains (10(8)CFU twice weekly) and PQQ (10 mg/kg diet, daily) for 8 months.PQQ producing EcN-5 treatment prevented rotenone induced hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in rats as assessed by reduced lipid peroxidation (29%), elevated glutathione (GSH) content (43%), increased catalase (52%) and superoxide dismutase (52%) activities when compared to only rotenone treatment. Moreover, increased hepatic mitochondrial content (41%), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) mRNA (25%) and mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase (Mit-SOD) activity (94%) were also observed in EcN-5 treated rats. Rotenone treated rats did not exhibit gain in body weight, whereas rats co-treated with EcN-5 showed significant restoration in body weight gain. Furthermore, weekly administration of EcN-5 to naturally ageing rats for eight months resulted in significant reduction of oxidative stress in hepatic and colonic tissues (assessed by lipid peroxidation, GSH content and catalase and SOD enzyme activities) along with increase in hepatic mitochondrial enzyme activities (Mit-SOD and succinate dehydrogenase) and biogenesis, when compared to untreated rats. Additionally, these rats also exhibited reduced expression of fatty acid synthase (50%) and increased expression of acyl coenzyme oxidase (225%) genes in liver in contrast to untreated rats resulting in lowered triglyceride (13% & 13.5%) and cholesterol (21% & 27%) levels in plasma and liver, respectively. Increased levels of butyrate (93%), propionate (45%) and  (18%) were also found in colonic content of these rats. PQQ administered daily (supplemented in diet) exhibited more or less similar effect as weekly gavaged EcN-5 in both the experiments, which substantiate that these effects are mediated by PQQ.These results suggest that genetically modified EcN-5 can be used as a nutritional supplement which can reduce age related oxidative stress and . Furthermore, it also rejuvenates healthy mitochondria by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We determined the effect of TRI on myocardial uptake of circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids using intravenous injection of [(3)H]-triolein and [(14)C]-bromopalmitate, respectively. Myocardial blood flow, oxidative metabolism, and metabolic rate of glucose (MMRG) were determined using micro-positron emission tomography (microPET) with [(13)N]-ammonia, [(11)C]-, and 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG).TRI reduced myocardial incorporation of [(3)H]-triolein but not [(14)C]-bromopalmitate showing that it selectively reduces myocardial fatty acid delivery from circulating triglycerides but not from free fatty acids. IL reduced myocardial blood flow and MMRG by 37% and 56%, respectively, but did not affect myocardial oxidative metabolism. TRI did not abolish the effect of IL on myocardial blood flow and MMRG.Hypertriglyceridemia acutely reduces myocardial blood flow and MMRG in rats, but this effect is not explained by increased myocardial fatty acid delivery through intravascular triglyceride lipolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28479718>Potential Lipid-Lowering Effects of  (L) Gaertn.

Furthermore, H-Ei significantly reduced body weight and improved serum profile and did not show hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity based on the serum profile. Moreover, H-Ei alleviated HFD-induced hepatosteatosis and ameliorated induced adiposity in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.Our results demonstrate that H-Ei effectively improved .

The aim of this study was to investigate the lipid-modifying potential of organic solvent-partitioned extracts from fruiting bodies of Amauroderma rugosum in vitro using oleate-induced human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results demonstrated that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with ethyl  (EA) extract greatly decreased intracellular and secreted total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) compared with other extracts. Further investigation of cellular expression of selected apolipoproteins also revealed that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with the EA extract best attenuated the apolipoprotein (Apo) profile by downregulating ApoB-100 and ApoE while upregulating ApoA1. Because both ApoB-100 and ApoE are key components of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL), which are recognized as "bad cholesterol," this result indicates that treatment with the EA extract inhibited LDL and VLDL production in oleate-induced HepG2 cells. On the other hand, increasing ApoA1 evidence shows antiatherogenic benefits to increasing ApoA1, the key component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), particularly in relation to its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport and preventing LDL oxidation; this indicates that the EA extract upregulated the production of HDL ("good cholesterol").

During the course of treatment, he developed gynecomastia on the left side, which resolved after the drug was stopped and replaced with alpha tocopherol . Sixteen months after fenofibrate discontinuation, the patient was rechallenged and subsequently developed gynecomastia symptoms on the right side. The usual etiologies of gynecomastia were excluded by careful assessment of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and results of diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray, mammography, scrotal ultrasonography, routine blood chemistry, and extensive hormonal panel. Gynecomastia again resolved after discontinuation of fenofibrate.In this case, the resolution of gynecomastia on discontinuation of fenofibrate and recurrence after rechallenge highly suggest the role of fenofibrate. Use of the Naranjo probability scale registered causality as probable. Case reports of gynecomastia caused by different drugs have been previously published, but, to our knowledge, this is the first report linking gynecomastia to the use of fenofibrate. The pathogenesis of this adverse drug reaction remains unclear.Although fenofibrate-induced gynecomastia appears to be uncommon, patients receiving this medication should be monitored for this adverse drug reaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20178824>Effect of Pterocarpus santalinus bark, on blood glucose, serum lipids, plasma insulin and hepatic carbohydrate metabolic enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to investigate the effect of bark of Pterocarpus santalinus, an ethnomedicinal plant, on blood glucose, plasma insulin, serum lipids and the activities of hepatic glucose metabolizing enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated (acute/short-term and long-term) with ethyl :methanol fractions of ethanolic extract of the bark of P. santalinus. Fasting blood glucose, HbA(1C), plasma insulin and protein were estimated before and after the treatment, along with hepatic glycogen, and activities of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Further anti-hyperlipidemic activity was studied by measuring the levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins.Phytochemical analysis of active fraction showed the presence of flavonoids, glycosides and phenols. Biological testing of the active fraction demonstrated a significant antidiabetic activity by reducing the elevated blood glucose levels and glycosylated hemoglobin, improving  and restoring the insulin levels in treated experimental induced diabetic rats. Further elucidation of mechanism of action showed improvement in the hepatic carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes after the treatment.

Lack of appropriate animal models has hampered generation of new knowledge in this area of research and we therefore sought to develop an animal model with combined atherosclerosis and -like skin inflammation.Topical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) was applied to the ears twice per week for 8 weeks in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice.TPA led to localized skin inflammation with increased epidermal thickness, infiltration of inflammatory-like cells and augmented tissue interleukin-17F levels. Systemic effects of the topical application of TPA were demonstrated by increased plasma concentration of serum amyloid A and splenic immune modulation, respectively. However, atherosclerotic plaque area and composition, and mRNA levels of several inflammatory genes in the aortic wall were not significantly affected by TPA-induced skin inflammation.TPA-induced -like skin inflammation in atherosclerosis-prone ApoE(-/-) mice evoked systemic immune-inflammatory effects, but did not affect atherogenesis. The results may question the role of -induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in  patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12808299>3-Methylethergalangin isolated from Alpinia officinarum inhibits pancreatic lipase.</a></h2><p>The pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of the rhizome of Alpinia officinarum (AO) and its antihyperlipidemic activity were measured. When the water extract of AO was fractionated stepwise with organic solvents, the ethyl  fraction exhibited the most potent inhibition. 3-Methylethergalangin was isolated from that fraction as an inhibitor of pancreatic lipase with an IC(50) value of 1.3 mg/ml (triolein as a substrate). AO and its ethyl  fraction significantly inhibited the serum TG level in corn oil feeding-induced triglyceridemic mice, and serum triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol in Triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemic mice. However, this compound and the AO ethyl  fraction did not show hypolipidemic activity in high cholesterol diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice. The results suggest that the hypolipidemic activity of AO and 3-methylethergalangin is due to the inhibition of pancreatic lipase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959387>Serum from hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin inhibits cultured human smooth muscle cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the pharmacological activity of whole-blood serum from atorvastatin- vs. simvastatin- (both 40 mg/day) treated hypercholesterolemic patients (n=10) on cultured smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and cholesterol biosynthesis, as related to lipid-lowering effect. Patients received either single or 2-weeks repeated doses of both simvastatin and atorvastatin, following a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. Blood samples were collected before drug administration and at the scheduled intervals after administration, and the obtained serum was separated by centrifugation, sterilized and frozen until assayed. Cultured SMC were supplemented with medium plus 15% of separate serum sampled from the patients, and grown for 72 h. Proliferation was assayed by a Coulter Counter, while cholesterol biosynthesis was measured by the incorporation of 14C- into cholesterol, under the same experimental conditions. Atorvastatin was more active vs. simvastatin in reducing total- (-28.3% vs. -20.7%; p=0.045) and LDL-cholesterol (-39.8% vs. -30.1%; p=0.011) after a 2-weeks regimen. Serum from atorvastatin-treated patients inhibited SMC proliferation vs.t=0 after both single (AUC -21.6%) and repeated (AUC -26.9%) doses, while serum from simvastatin-treated patients inhibited SMC proliferation only after repeated doses (AUC -24.5%). Interestingly, in the same experimental conditions, the serum concentrations of both statins (and of their active metabolites) were constantly below the detection limits, as shown from the lack of inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. The absence of any significant association between the lipid-lowering effects and the inhibition of SMC proliferation, together with no detectable active statin in the serum, suggests that these effects are elicited through independent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18845659>Paraoxonase 1 activity in different types of multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an antioxidant enzyme bound to plasma high-density lipoproteins and is also present in the brain.The aim of this study was to estimate the activity of PON1 in patients with different types of MS.The PON1 activity toward paraoxon and phenyl  and lipid profile was examined in 40 relapsing-remitting (RR) patients in relapse, in 42 RR patients in remission, in 55 progressive MS patients and in 40 healthy individuals.PON1 activity did not differ in MS patients compared to control group. PON1 activity in relapse was significantly lower in comparison to the other MS groups. Hypercholesterolemia was observed in MS patients.PON1 activity does not change in the course of stable and progressive type of MS and is decreased by the relapse of MS.</p></html>
