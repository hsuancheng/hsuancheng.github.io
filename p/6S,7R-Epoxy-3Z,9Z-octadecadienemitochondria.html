Among them compounds 6q, 6r and  showed significant cytotoxic activity with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 4.1 μM. Structure–activity relationships were elucidated with various substitutions on these conjugates. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these compounds arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induce cell death by apoptosis. The tubulin polymerization assay and immunofluorescence analysis showed that these compounds (6q, 6r and ) effectively inhibited the microtubule assembly in human prostate cancer cells (DU-145). The docking studies showed that  interacts and binds efficiently with the tubulin protein at the colchicine binding site. This was further confirmed by the colchicine competitive binding assay. Moreover, compounds 6q, 6r and  possess anti-tubulin activity both in vitro and within cells as demonstrated by the ratio of soluble versus polymerized tubulin. Further the apoptotic effects of compounds were confirmed by Hoechst staining, caspase 3 activation, annexin-V FITC, mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation analysis. Interestingly, these compounds did not affect the normal human embryonic kidney cells, HEK-293.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29526507>Stereochemical and structural effects of (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine on the mitochondrial metabolome in PC-12 cells.</a></h1><p>Impairment in mitochondrial biogenesis and function plays a key role in depression and anxiety, both of which being associated with changes in fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism. The antidepressant effects of (R,S)-ketamine have been linked to its conversion into (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK); however, the connection between structure and stereochemistry of ketamine and HNK in the mitochondrial homeostatic response has not yet been fully elucidated at a metabolic level.We used a multi-platform, non-targeted metabolomics approach to study the change in mitochondrial metabolome of PC-12 cells treated with ketamine and HNK enantiomers. The identified metabolites were grouped into pathways in order to assess global responses.Treatment with (2R,6R)-HNK elicited the significant change in 49 metabolites and associated pathways implicated in fundamental mitochondrial functions such as TCA cycle, branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway, glycoxylate metabolic pathway, and fatty acid β-oxidation. The affected metabolites included glycerate, citrate, leucine, N,N-dimethylglycine, 3-hexenedioic acid, and carnitine and attenuated signals associated with 9 fatty acids and elaidic acid. Important metabolites involved in the purine and pyrimidine pathways were also affected by (2R-6R)-HNK. This global metabolic profile was not as strongly impacted by treatment with (2S,)-HNK, (R)- and (S)-ketamine and in some instances opposite effects were observed.The present data provide an overall view of the metabolic changes in mitochondrial function produced by (2R,6R)-HNK and related ketamine compounds and offer an insight into the source of the observed variance in antidepressant response elicited by the compounds.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We biolistically transfected astrocytes in rat hippocampal slice cultures to facilitate fluorescent confocal microscopy, and subjected these slices to transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) that causes delayed excitotoxic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This insult caused a delayed loss of mitochondria from astrocytic processes and increased colocalization of mitochondria with the autophagosome marker LC3B. The losses of neurons in area CA1 and mitochondria in astrocytic processes were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists, tetrodotoxin, ziconotide (Ca(2+) channel blocker), two inhibitors of reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (KB-R7943, YM-244769), or two inhibitors of calcineurin (cyclosporin-A, FK506). The effects of OGD were mimicked by NMDA. The glutamate uptake inhibitor (3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-l-aspartate increased neuronal loss after OGD or NMDA, and blocked the loss of astrocytic mitochondria. Exogenous glutamate in the presence of iGluR antagonists caused a loss of mitochondria without a decrease in neurons in area CA1. Using the genetic Ca(2+) indicator Lck-GCaMP-, we observed two types of Ca(2+) signals: (1) in the cytoplasm surrounding mitochondria (mitochondrially centered) and (2) traversing the space between mitochondria (extramitochondrial). The spatial spread, kinetics, and frequency of these events were different. The amplitude of both types was doubled and the spread of both types changed by ∼2-fold 24 h after OGD. Together, these data suggest that pathologic activation of glutamate transport and increased astrocytic Ca(2+) through reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange triggers mitochondrial loss and dramatic increases in Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytic processes.Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain, are vital integrators of signaling and . Each astrocyte consists of many long, thin branches, called processes, which ensheathe vasculature and thousands of synapses. Mitochondria occupy the majority of each process. This occupancy is decreased by ∼50% 24 h after an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, due to delayed fragmentation and mitophagy. The mechanism appears to be independent of neuropathology, instead involving an extended period of high glutamate uptake into astrocytes. Our data suggest that mitochondria serve as spatial buffers, and possibly even as a source of calcium signals in astrocytic processes. Loss of mitochondria resulted in drastically altered calcium signaling that could disrupt neurovascular coupling and gliotransmission.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/367110-19$15.00/0.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357111>Imaging of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Ca Signals in Cultured Astrocytes.</a></h1><p>This unit provides a step-by-step protocol for constructing cell type- and -targeted GCaMP genetically encoded Ca indicators (GECIs) for mitochondrial Ca imaging in astrocytes.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary  in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the -, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation,  dysregulation, or inflammation and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal  alteration, fat accumulation, inflammation and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease. These results suggest that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930285>Dynamics of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore: Transient and permanent opening events.</a></h1><p>A gentle optical examination of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening events was carried out in isolated quiescent ventricular myocytes by tracking the inner membrane potential (ΔΨ) using TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester). Zeiss Airyscan 880 ″super-resolution" or "high-resolution" imaging was done with very low levels of illumination (0.009% laser power). In cellular areas imaged every 9 s (ROI or regions of interest), transient depolarizations of variable amplitudes occurred at increasing rates for the first 30 min. The time to first depolarization events was 8.4 min (±1.1 SEM n = 21 cells). At longer times, essentially permanent and irreversible depolarizations occurred at an increasing fraction of all events. In other cellular areas surrounding the ROI,  were rarely illuminated (once per 5 min) and virtually no permanent depolarization events occurred for over 1 h of imaging. These findings suggest that photon stress due to the imaging itself plays an important role in the generation of both the transient mPTP opening events as well as the permanent mPTP opening events. Consistent with the evidence that photon "stress" in  loaded with virtually any photon absorbing substance, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1-5], we show that cyclosporine-A (CsA, 10 μM) and the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 10 mM), reduced the number of events by 80% and 93% respectively. Furthermore, CsA and NAC treatment led to the virtual disappearance of permanent depolarization events. Nevertheless, all transient depolarization events in any condition (control, CsA and NAC) appeared to repolarize with a similar half-time of 30 ± 6 s (n = 478) at 37 °C. Further experiments showed quantitatively similar results in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, using a different confocal system, and different photon absorbing reagent (TMRE; tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester). In these experiments, using modest power (1% laser power) transient depolarization events were seen in only 8 out of 23 cells while with higher power (8%), all cells showed transient events, which align with the level of photon stress being the driver of the effect. Together, our findings suggest that photon-induced ROS is sufficient to cause depolarization events of individual  in quiescent cells; without electrical or mechanical activity to stimulates mitochondrial metabolism, and without raising the mitochondrial matrix Ca. In a broad context, these findings neither support nor deny the relevance or occurrence of ΔΨ depolarization events in specific putatively physiologic mitochondrial behaviors such as MitoFlashes [6,7] or MitoWinks [8]. Instead, our findings raise a caution with regards to the physiological and pathophysiological functions attributed to singular ΔΨ depolarization events when those functions are investigated using photon absorbing substances. Nevertheless, using photon stress as a tool ("Optical Stress-Probe"), we can extract information on the activation, reversibility, permanency and kinetics of mitochondrial depolarization. These data may provide new information on mPTP, help identify the mPTP protein complex, and establish the physiological function of the mPTP protein complex and their links to MitoFlashes and MitoWinks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Live cell mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging is an important approach to understand mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics. Recently developed GCaMP genetically-encoded Ca(2+) indicators provide unique opportunity for high sensitivity/resolution and cell type-specific mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging. In the current study, we implemented cell-specific mitochondrial targeting of GCaMP5G/ (mito-GCaMP5G/) and used two-photon microscopy to image astrocytic and neuronal mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics in culture, revealing Ca(2+) uptake mechanism by these organelles in response to cell stimulation. Using these mitochondrial Ca(2+) indicators, our results show that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in individual  in cultured astrocytes and neurons can be seen after stimulations by ATP and glutamate, respectively. We further studied the dependence of mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics on cytosolic Ca(2+) changes following ATP stimulation in cultured astrocytes by simultaneously imaging mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca(2+) increase using mito-GCaMP5G and a synthetic organic Ca(2+) indicator, x-Rhod-1, respectively. Combined with molecular intervention in Ca(2+) signaling pathway, our results demonstrated that the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is tightly coupled with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of G protein-coupled receptors. The current study provides a novel approach to image mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics as well as Ca(2+) interplay between the endoplasmic reticulum and , which is relevant for neuronal and astrocytic functions in health and disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
