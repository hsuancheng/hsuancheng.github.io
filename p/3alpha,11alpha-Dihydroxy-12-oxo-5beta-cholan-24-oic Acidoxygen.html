As shown in the present study, TGR5 is also expressed in astrocytes and neurons. Here, TGR5 may act as a neurosteroid receptor, which is activated by nanomolar concentrations of 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one and micromolar concentrations of 5β-pregnan-3α-17α-21-triol-20-one and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone). TGR5 stimulation in astrocytes and neurons is coupled to adenylate cyclase activation, elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and the generation of reactive  species. In cultured rat astrocytes, TGR5 mRNA is downregulated in the presence of neurosteroids and ammonia already at concentrations of 0.5 mmol L(-1). Furthermore, TGR5 protein levels are significantly reduced in isolated rat astrocytes after incubation with ammonia. A marked downregulation of TGR5 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex from cirrhotic patients dying with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) when compared with brains from noncirrhotic control subjects. It is concluded that TGR5 is a novel neurosteroid receptor in brain with implications for the pathogenesis of HE.© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936844>[Chemical constituents from ripe fruit of Cornus officinalis].</a></h1><p>To investigate the chemical compounds from the fruit of Cornus officinalis, six compounds were isolated and determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis as 6'-O-acetyl-7α-O-ethyl morroniside (1), (-)-isolariciresinol 3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside(2), apigenin (3), cirsiumaldehyde(4), p-coumaric  (5), caffeic  (6).

They are composed of alpha- and beta-subunits that belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS superfamily. Here we examined the expression of HIF-alpha subunit proteins in the human kidney and found that, in addition to HIF-1alpha and -2alpha, HIF- was also expressed. The sequence analysis revealed that, like mouse HIF-, human HIF- has high similarity with HIF-1alpha and -2alpha in the bHLH and PAS domains, but lacks structures for transactivation found in the C-terminus of HIF-1alpha and -2alpha. Furthermore, we performed reporter gene analysis and showed that HIF- suppresses hypoxia-inducible HIF-mediated gene expression. HIF- might be a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible gene expression in the human kidney.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12774021>Elevated hepatocyte levels of the Forkhead box A2 (HNF-3beta) transcription factor cause postnatal steatosis and mitochondrial damage.</a></h1><p>The Forkhead box (Fox) transcription factor Foxa2 (HNF-3beta) and related family members Foxa1 (HNF-) and Foxa3 (HNF-3gamma) act in concert with other hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF) to coordinately regulate liver-specific gene expression. To circumvent the hepatic functional redundancy of the Foxa proteins, we used the T-77 transgenic (TG) mouse line in which the -3-kb transthyretin (TTR) promoter functioned to increase hepatocyte expression of the Foxa2 cDNA. Adult TG mice exhibited reduced hepatic glycogen and progressive liver injury, but maintained normal serum levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon. In this study, we further characterized the postnatal liver defect in TTR-FoxA2 TG mice. The postnatal TG mice displayed significant reduction in serum glucose levels and in hepatocyte glycogen storage without increased serum levels of ketone bodies and free fatty  suggesting that they are not undergoing a starvation response. We show that TG liver developed a substantial transient steatosis, which reached a maximum at postnatal day 5 and is associated with increased expression of hepatic genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis, lipid beta-oxidation, and amino  biosynthesis. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis of postnatal TG liver revealed extensive mitochondrial membrane damage, which is likely due to reactive  species generated from lipid beta-oxidation. In conclusion, our model proposes that in response to reduction in hepatocyte glycogen storage, the TTR-Foxa2 TG mice survive by maintaining sufficient serum levels of glucose through gluconeogenesis using deaminated amino  with dicarboxylate products of peroxisomal lipid beta-oxidation shuttled through the tricarboxylic  cycle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357075>NF-κB inhibitory and cytotoxic activities of hexacyclic triterpene  constituents from Glechoma longituba.</a></h1><p>Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most-frequent cause of cancer death, and novel chemotherapeutic drugs for treating NSCLC are urgently needed. 2α, 3α, 23-trihydroxy-13α, 27-cyclours-11-en-28-oic  (euscaphic  G) is a new hexacyclic triterpene  isolated by our group from Glechoma longituba (Nakai) Kupr. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the anticancer effects of hexacyclic triterpene  have not been elucidated.In the present work, we evaluated growth inhibitory effect of the new isolated hexacyclic triterpene  and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.Herbs were extracted and constituents were purified by chromatographic separation, including silica gel, ODS, MCI, Sephadex LH-20 and preparative HPLC. The compound structures were elucidated by the use of UV, NMR and MS spectral data. The anticancer activity of euscaphic  G was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell cycle, apoptosis, reactive  species and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by flow cytometry. To display the possible mechanism of euscaphic  G on NCI-H460 cells, RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were carried out.A new hexacyclic triterpene , euscaphic  G, together with fifteen known triterpenoids, was isolated from the aerial parts of G. longituba. Our results showed that euscaphic  G exerted strong anti-proliferative activity against NCI-H460 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry demonstrated euscaphic  G arrested the cell cycle at G1 phase, induced cellular apoptosis, accompanied by ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential reduction. Mechanistic studies revealed that euscaphic  G treatment inhibited IKKα/β phosphorylation and IκBα phosphorylation, which subsequently caused the blockage of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.In conclusion, these results suggested that euscaphic  G from G. longituba showed potential anticancer effects against lung cancer cells via inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, at least partly, through NF-κB signaling pathways.Copyright © 2019.

Recent investigations indicate that mechanisms of such stimulated endogenous neuroprotection are related to the family of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), however there are still little data available on the role of HIF family members in hippocampus-a brain structure, highly sensitive to  deficiency. We have used the model of cultured hippocampal slices and single-cell quantitative RT-PCR to study HIF-1α and HIF-3α mRNA expression following triple 5-min mild anoxia, 30-min -glucose deprivation and their combination. We also tested the effects of HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibition with 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic  diethyl ester pre-treatment followed by a 30-min -glucose deprivation. It was found that neuronal damage induced by -glucose deprivation was accompanied by a significant decrease in both HIF-1α and HIF-3α mRNA levels in CA1 but not CA3 neurons. Anoxia preconditioning did not affect cell viability and HIF mRNA levels but applied before -glucose deprivation prevented neuronal damage and suppression of HIF-1α and HIF-3α mRNA expression. It was also found that effects of the prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor were similar to anoxia preconditioning. These results suggest that anoxia preconditioning increases anti-ischemic neuronal resistance which to a certain extent correlates with the changes of HIF-1α and HIF-3α expression.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Hydroxylation of one or two critical prolines by specific hydroxylases (P4Hs) targets their HIF-alpha subunits for proteasomal degradation. By studying the three human HIF-P4Hs, we found that the longest and shortest isoenzymes have major transcripts encoding inactive polypeptides, which suggest novel regulation by alternative splicing. Recombinant HIF-P4Hs expressed in insect cells required peptides of more than 8 residues, distinct differences being found between isoenzymes. All the HIF-P4Hs hydroxylated peptides corresponding to Pro564 in HIF-1alpha, whereas a Pro402 peptide had 20-50-fold Km values for two isoenzymes but was not hydroxylated by the shortest isoenzyme at all; this difference was not explained by the two prolines being in a -Pro402-Ala- and -Pro564-Tyr-sequence. All the HIF-P4Hs-hydroxylated peptides corresponding to two of three potential sites in HIF-2alpha and one in HIF-. The Km values for O2 were slightly above its atmospheric concentration, indicating that the HIF-P4Hs are effective  sensors. Small molecule inhibitors of collagen P4Hs also inhibited the HIF-P4Hs, but with distinctly different Ki values, indicating that it should be possible to develop specific inhibitors for each class of P4Hs and possibly even for the individual HIF-P4Hs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707926>Prolonged fasting activates hypoxia inducible factors-1α, -2α and -3α in a tissue-specific manner in northern elephant seal pups.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are important regulators of energy homeostasis and cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions. Northern elephant seals are naturally adapted to prolonged periods (1-2 months) of food deprivation (fasting) which result in  changes that may activate HIF-1. However, the effects of prolonged fasting on HIFs are not well defined. We obtained the full-length cDNAs of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and partial cDNA of HIF-3α in northern elephant seal pups. We also measured mRNA and nuclear protein content of HIF-1α, -2α, -3α in muscle and adipose during prolonged fasting (1, 3, 5 & 7 weeks), along with mRNA expression of HIF-mediated genes, LDH and VEGF. HIF-1α, -2α and -3α are 2595, 2852 and 1842 bp and encode proteins of 823, 864 and 586 amino  residues with conserved domains needed for their function (bHLH and PAS) and regulation (ODD and TAD). HIF-1α and -2α mRNA expression increased 3- to 5-fold after 7 weeks of fasting in adipose and muscle, whereas HIF-3α increased 5-fold after 7 weeks of fasting in adipose. HIF-2α protein expression was detected in nuclear fractions from adipose and muscle, increasing approximately 2-fold, respectively with fasting. Expression of VEGF increased 3-fold after 7 weeks in adipose and muscle, whereas LDH mRNA expression increased 12-fold after 7 weeks in adipose. While the 3 HIFα genes are expressed in muscle and adipose, only HIF-2α protein was detectable in the nucleus suggesting that HIF-2α may contribute more significantly in the up-regulation of genes involved in the  adaptation during fasting in the elephant seal.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Regulation of GA biosynthesis and enhancing GA production are critical to using G. lucidum as a medicine. However, regulation of GA biosynthesis by various signaling remains poorly understood. This study investigated the role of apoptosis signaling on GA biosynthesis and presented a novel approach, namely apoptosis induction, to increasing GA production. Aspirin was able to induce cell apoptosis in G. lucidum, which was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUPT nick end labeling assay positive staining and a condensed nuclear morphology. The maximum induction of lanosta-7,9(11), 24-trien-3α-01-26-oic  (ganoderic  24, GA24) production and total GA production by aspirin were 2.7-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively, after 1 day. Significantly lower levels of GA 24 and total GAs were obtained after regular fungal culture for 1.5 months. ROS accumulation and phosphorylation of Hog-1 kinase, a putative homolog of MAPK p38 in mammals, occurred after aspirin treatment indicating that both factors may be involved in GA biosynthetic regulation. However, aspirin also reduced expression of the squalene synthase and lanosterol synthase coding genes, suggesting that these genes are not critical for GA induction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that GA biosynthesis is linked to fungal apoptosis and provides a new approach to enhancing secondary metabolite production in fungi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10820199>Pregnenolone sulfate, a naturally occurring excitotoxin involved in delayed retinal cell death.</a></h1><p>The present study was designed to investigate the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS), known for its ability to modulate NMDA receptors and interfere with acute excitotoxicity, in delayed retinal cell death. Three hours after exposure of the isolated and intact retina to a 30-min PS pulse, DNA fragmentation as assessed by genomic DNA gel electrophoresis and a modified in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method appeared concurrently with an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and thiobarbituric -reactive substances (TBARS) levels. At 7 h, the increased amount of DNA laddering was accompanied by a higher number of TUNEL-positive cells in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. Necrotic signs were characterized by DNA smear migration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and damage mainly in the inner nuclear layer. PS-induced delayed cell death was markedly reduced by the NMDA receptor antagonists 4-(3-phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazinecarboxylic  and -hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one sulfate but completely blocked after concomitant addition of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Steroids with antioxidant properties (progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate ester, and 17beta-estradiol) differently prevented PS-induced delayed cell death. Cycloheximide treatment protected against DNA fragmentation and LDH release but failed to prevent the rise in SOD activity and TBARS level. We conclude that a brief PS pulse causes delayed cell death in a slowly evolving apoptotic fashion characterized by a cycloheximide-sensitive death program downstream of reactive  species generation and lipid peroxidation, turning into secondary necrosis in a retinal cell subset.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24065526>Molecular characterization and expression analysis of three hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits, HIF-1α, -2α and -3α in hypoxia-tolerant Indian catfish, Clarias batrachus [Linnaeus, 1758].</a></h1><p>The present study aimed at characterization of three HIF-α subunits, HIF-1α -2α and -3α from hypoxia-tolerant Clarias batrachus, as well as to elucidate their expression pattern under short and long-term hypoxic conditions and identification of biomarker candidate. The complete cDNAs of HIF-1α, -2α and -3α were 2,833, 4,270 and 3,256 bp in length, encoding 774, 818 and 628 amino  residues, respectively. In C. batrachus, HIF-α subunits were structurally similar in DNA binding, dimerization, degradation and transcriptional activation domains, but differed in their oxygen-dependent degradation domains. Presence of c-Jun N-terminal kinase binding domain in HIF-α subunits was reported here for the first time in fish. In adult C. batrachus, three HIF-α mRNAs were detected in different tissues under normoxic conditions, however HIF-1α was highly expressed in all the tissues studied, in comparison to HIF-2α and -3α. Short-term hypoxia exposure caused significant increase in three HIF-α transcripts in brain, liver and head kidney, while after long-term hypoxia exposure, significant up-regulation of HIF-1α in spleen and -2α in muscle was observed and HIF-3α significantly down-regulated in head kidney. These observations suggest that the differential expression of HIF-α subunits in C. batrachus was hypoxic time period dependent and may play specialized roles in adaptive response to hypoxia. HIF-2α, with its highly elevated expression in muscle tissues, can be a robust biomarker candidate for exposure to hypoxic environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26756900>COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 suppresses doxorubicin-induced p53 accumulation through inhibition of ROS-mediated Jnk activation.</a></h1><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is one of the isoforms of cyclooxygenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the arachidonic  cascade. COX-2 protein expression is highly induced by numerous factors and it has been reportedly overexpressed in various human malignancies. Although anti-tumorigenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors have been shown, several lines of evidence suggest that COX-2 inhibitors antagonize the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, on modulation of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced p53 accumulation. Non-selective and selective COX-2 inhibitors attenuated DOX-induced accumulation of wild type (WT) but not mutant p53. Nutlin-3α or MG132 abolished the suppressive effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on DOX-induced p53 increase. Moreover, the DOX-induced increase in p53 protein levels was reduced in COX-2 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to those in WT or COX-1 KO MEFs. DOX-induced accumulation of p53 was attenuated by a specific inhibitor or knockdown of Jun-N-terminal kinase (Jnk). In addition, DOX-induced Jnk activation was decreased in COX-2 KO MEFs or by COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that Jnk stabilizes p53 by a mechanism that involves COX-2. Pre-treatment with a reactive  species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, attenuated DOX-induced Jnk activation and subsequent p53 accumulation. Furthermore, the absence or inhibition of COX-2 resulted in suppression of DOX-induced increase in ROS levels. These results suggest that COX-2 activates Jnk through modulation of ROS levels, leading to accumulation of p53. Our study identifies a putative novel cross-talk between COX-2 and p53.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23820265>Oncogenic functions of the transcription factor Nrf2.</a></h1><p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of a large pool of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes regulating the cellular response to oxidative and electrophilic stress. Nrf2 is negatively regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and, upon stimulation by an oxidative or electrophilic insult, is rapidly activated by protein stabilization. Owing to its cytoprotective functions, Nrf2 has been traditionally studied in the field of chemoprevention; however, there is accumulated evidence that Keap1/Nrf2 mutations or unbalanced regulation that leads to overexpression or hyperactivation of Nrf2 may participate in tumorigenesis and be involved in chemoresistance of a wide number of solid cancers and leukemias. In addition to protecting cells from reactive oxygen species, Nrf2 seems to play a direct role in cell growth control and is related to apoptosis-regulating . Moreover, Nrf2 activity is connected with oncogenic kinase , structural proteins, hormonal regulation, other transcription factors, and epigenetic enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of various types of tumors. The aim of this review is to compile and summarize existing knowledge of the oncogenic functions of Nrf2 to provide a solid basis for its potential use as a molecular marker and pharmacological target in cancer.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

PAH began after 20 weeks of age, causing death by &60 weeks. FHR/BN1 did not develop PAH. FHR pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) had a rarified reticulum of hyperpolarized mitochondria with reduced expression of electron transport chain components and superoxide dismutase-2. These mitochondrial abnormalities preceded PAH and persisted in culture. Depressed mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production caused normoxic activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha), which then inhibited expression of -sensitive, voltage-gated K+ channels (eg, Kv1.5). Disruption of this mitochondrial-HIF-Kv pathway impaired  sensing (reducing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, causing polycythemia), analogous to the pathophysiology of chronically hypoxic Sprague-Dawley rats. Restoring ROS (exogenous H2O2) or blocking HIF-1alpha activation (dominant-negative HIF-1alpha) restored Kv1.5 expression/function. Dichloroacetate, a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, corrected the mitochondrial-HIF-Kv pathway in FHR-PAH and human PAH PASMCs. Oral dichloroacetate regressed FHR-PAH and polycythemia, increasing survival. Chromosome 1 genes that were dysregulated in FHRs and relevant to the mitochondria-HIF-Kv pathway included HIF- (an HIF-1alpha repressor), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, and superoxide dismutase-2. Like FHRs, human PAH-PASMCs had dysmorphic, hyperpolarized mitochondria; normoxic HIF-1alpha activation; and reduced expression/activity of HIF-, cytochrome c oxidase, and superoxide dismutase-2.FHRs have a chromosome 1 abnormality that disrupts a mitochondria-ROS-HIF-Kv pathway, leading to PAH. Similar abnormalities occur in idiopathic human PAH. This study reveals an intersection between -sensing mechanisms and PAH.

With normal pressure of  the 7-OH oxidation products are obtained. No biotransformations are achieved in anaerobic conditions. The microbial 7alpha-OH epimerisation is achieved by oxidation of 7-OH function and subsequent reduction.

However, biochemical evidence supporting this hypothesis was limited to single concentration studies in long sleep (LS) mice.The present paper addresses these issues by extending biochemical investigation of pressure effects on allosteric modulators across a range of concentrations that allosterically enhance gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA)A receptor function and alter behavior using two mouse genotypes. In addition, the effects of pressure on ligand binding were explored to further investigate the mechanism of pressure antagonism of allosteric modulation.The effects of 12 times normal atmospheric pressure (ATA) of helium- gas (heliox) on allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptor function and [3H]flunitrazepam binding was tested in LS and C57BL mouse brain membranes (microsacs) using chloride flux and high-affinity binding assays.In both genotypes, exposure to 12 ATA heliox antagonized the allosteric enhancement of GABA(A) receptor function by flunitrazepam (0.1-10 microM) and pentobarbital (0.1-50 microM) but did not affect allosteric modulation by -hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one (0.1-1 microM). Pressure did not affect benzodiazepine receptor affinity (Kd) or the number of benzodiazepine receptors (Bmax).(1) confirm that there are differences in sensitivity to pressure antagonism of allosteric coupling among GABA(A) allosteric modulators; (2) demonstrate that these differences are not concentration or genotype dependent; (3) add evidence that pressure antagonizes allosteric modulation by uncoupling the receptor and (4) support the hypothesis that allosteric modulation of receptor function can be sub-categorized on the basis of sensitivity to pressure antagonism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034873>Induction of a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with autophagic characteristics with steroidal maleic anhydrides and 7β-hydroxycholesterol on glioma cells.</a></h1><p>Steroidal maleic anhydrides were prepared in one step: lithocholic, chenodeoxicholic, deoxicholic, ursocholic, and hyodeoxicholic  derivatives. Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with lithocholic and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death. It is concluded that these compounds trigger a non apoptotic mode of cell death, involving the mitochondria and associated with several characteristics of autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The complex is composed of two b-HLH protein subunits, HIF-1beta (ARNT), that is constitutively expressed, and a HIF-alpha subunit, that is present only in hypoxic cells. HIF-alpha proteins are continuously synthesized, but are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system under oxic conditions. Hypoxia, transition metals, iron chelators, and several antioxidants stabilize the HIF-alpha proteins, allowing the formation of the transcriptionally active HIF complex. However, the sequences and mechanisms involved in the regulated degradation of the alpha protein subunits are poorly understood. Analysis of the available cloned sequences of human and mouse members of the HIF-alpha family of proteins revealed an area of about 15 amino  with strong sequence conservation between all the members. This area corresponds to the region encompassing amino  557-571 of the hHIF-1alpha subunit. Fragments of HIF-1alpha and HIF- proteins containing this conserved sequence were able to confer hypoxia regulation when expressed as fusion proteins in Hep-3B cells. Regulation was observed with all the known hypoxia "mimics," including the reducing thiol donor N-mercaptopropionylglycine (NMPG). Selective alanine substitutions of amino  561-568 stabilized the protein in normoxic conditions. Furthermore, transfection with an expression vector containing a fragment of hHIF-1alpha comprising amino  540-580 enhanced transactivation activity of the full-length hHIF-1alpha protein. These results suggest that the above-mentioned conserved sequences are likely involved in the hypoxic stabilization of HIF-alpha proteins. The mechanisms and the interacting ubiquitin-ligases involved in the selective degradation process remain unknown.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394960>Crystal structure of a lithium salt of a glucosyl derivative of lithocholic .</a></h1><p>The crystal structure of a Li(+) salt of a glucosyl derivative of lithocholic  (lithium 3α-(α-d-glucopyranosyl)-5β-cholan-24-oate) has been solved.

In this study, we identified full-length cDNAs of HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α in an endangered hypoxia-sensitive fish species, Chinese sucker. The HIF-1α/2α/3α cDNAs are 3890, 3230 and 3374 bp in length, encoding 780, 782 and 632 amino  residues, respectively. The real-time PCR results suggested that HIF-1α and HIF-3α mRNAs were highly expressed in liver and gonads, followed by spleen and muscle. Moreover, HIF-1α and HIF-3α transcription factors revealed similar developmental expression patterns, with the lowest expression at 48h post-fertilization, and reaching the highest expression level at 360 h post-fertilization. Short-term hypoxia exposure (2.2, 2.8 and 3.2mg/L dissolved  for 24h) increased mRNA levels of HIF-1α and HIF-3α. HIF-2α mRNA showed similar expression patterns with that of HIF-1α and HIF-3α, however, its expression was extremely low in the spatio-temporal expression patterns and hypoxia treatment. This is the first report describing the potential to identify hypoxia-sensitive/tolerant fishes according to the number of the serine residues of fish -dependent degradation (ODD) domain. It was suggested that Cyprinomorpha fishes, with less than 40 serine residues in fish ODD domain were hypoxia-sensitive fishes and more than 40 serine residues in this domain were hypoxia-tolerant fishes.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Vaccination against BRD-associated viruses does not offer complete immune protection and vaccine failure animals present potential routes for disease spread. Serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is possible using antigen-deleted vaccines, but during virus outbreaks DIVA responses are masked by wild-type virus preventing accurate serodiagnosis. Previous work by the authors has established the potential for metabolomic profiling to reveal metabolites associated with systemic immune responses to vaccination. The current study builds on this work by demonstrating for the first time the potential to use plasma metabolite profiling to differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals following infection-challenge. Male Holstein Friesian calves were intranasally vaccinated (Pfizer RISPOVAL®PI3+RSV) and subsequently challenged with Bovine Parainfluenza Virus type-3 (BPI3V) via nasal inoculation. Metabolomic plasma profiling revealed that viral challenge led to a shift in acquired plasma metabolite profiles from day 2 to 20 p.i., with 26 metabolites identified whose peak intensities were significantly different following viral challenge depending on vaccination status. Elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin and decreased 3-indolepropionic  in non-vaccinated animals at day 6 p.i. may be associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen scavenging at periods of peak virus titre. During latter stages of infection, increased levels of N-[(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine and lysophosphatidycholine and decreased enterolactone in non-vaccinated animals may reflect suppression of innate immune response mechanisms and progression to adaptive immune responses. Levels of hexahydrohippurate were also shown to be significantly elevated in non-vaccinated animals from days 6 to 20 p.i. These findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic profiling to identify plasma markers that can be employed in disease diagnostic applications to both differentially identify infected non-vaccinated animals during disease outbreaks and provide greater information on the health status of infected animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11932946>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha from the estuarine teleost, Fundulus heteroclitus: interaction of HIF-2alpha with two ARNT2 splice variants.</a></h1><p>The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are dimeric transcription factors that mediate changes in gene expression during adaptation of animals to  stress. Both alpha (HIFalpha) and beta (ARNT) subunits are members of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim family of proteins. Mammals have at least three different HIF-alpha subunits, paralogous proteins expressed in tissue-specific fashion (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and HIF-). However, the diversity and functional properties of teleost HIFs are poorly understood. In efforts to characterize mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation in estuarine fish, we have isolated cDNAs encoding HIF subunits from Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish or mummichog), including a HIF-2alpha homolog and ARNT2alt, a splice variant of ARNT2 that contains an additional exon encoding 16 amino  near the amino terminus. HIF-2alpha protein synthesized in vitro binds cognate DNA elements in concert with either Fundulus ARNT2 splice variant or murine ARNT1. HIF-2alpha, ARNT2, and ARNT2alt mRNAs are expressed in all organs examined. The HIF-2alpha cDNA encodes a protein of 96.4 kDa, sharing 53-54% identity with mammalian and avian orthologs. The -dependent degradation domain, however, exhibits substantial divergence from well-conserved mammalian sequences, suggesting the possibility of important functional differences, perhaps in the sensitivity to induction of activity by hypoxia. Hypoxia-tolerant fishes such as F. heteroclitus represent a unique opportunity for the study of functional and evolutionary aspects of adaptation to hypoxia at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. This study extends the understanding of hypoxia signaling in fish, the evolution and diversity of HIF function, and the evolution of the PAS family of proteins.Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17764065>Anti-inflammatory ergostanes from the basidiomata of Antrodia salmonea.</a></h1><p>Three new anti-oxidative ergostanes, methyl antcinate L (1), antcin M (2), and methyl antcinate K (3), together with nine additional known compounds, 3-ketodehydrosulphurenic , sulphurenic , dehydrosulphurenic , 3beta,15alpha-dihydroxylanosta-7,9(11),24-trien-21-oic , zhankuic  A, zhankuic  B, zhankuic  C, antcin C, and antcin K were isolated from the basidiomata of Antrodia salmonea, a newly identified species of Antrodia (Polyporaceae) in Taiwan. These three new compounds were identified as methyl ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-4alpha-methylergosta-8,24(29)-dien-11-on-26-oate (1), ,12alpha-dihydroxy-4alpha-methylergosta-8,24(29)-dien-11-on-26-oic  (2), and methyl ,4beta,7beta-trihydroxy-4alpha-methylergosta-8,24(29)-dien-11-on-26-oate (3) by spectroscopic analysis. We studied their antioxidative potential on the production of reactive  species and nitric oxide (NO) in neutrophils and microglial cells, respectively. Compounds 1-3 displayed potent antioxidative activity with IC50 values of around 2.0-8.8 microM that was partially due to inhibition (6-67%) of NADPH oxidase activity but not through direct radical-scavenging properties. Compounds 1-3 also inhibited NO production with IC50 values of around 1.7-16.5 microM and were more potent than a non-specific NOS inhibitor. We conclude that these three new compounds 1, 2, and 3 exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in activated inflammatory cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11373299>Regulation of ecdysteroid signaling: cloning and characterization of ecdysone oxidase: a novel steroid oxidase from the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis.</a></h1><p>One route of inactivation of ecdysteroids in insects involves ecdysone oxidase-catalyzed conversion into 3-dehydroecdysteroid followed by irreversible reduction by 3-dehydroecdysone -reductase to 3-epiecdysone. We have purified from Spodoptera littoralis the first ecdysone oxidase and subjected it to limited amino  sequencing. A reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based approach has been used to clone the cDNA (2.8 kilobases) encoding this 65-kDa protein. Northern blotting showed that the mRNA transcript was expressed in midgut during the prepupal stage of the last larval instar at a time corresponding to an ecdysteroid titer peak. Conceptual translation of the ecdysone oxidase cDNA and data base searching revealed that the enzyme is an FAD flavoprotein that belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase superfamily. Ecdysone oxidase represents the only oxidase in eukaryotic animals known to catalyze -dependent oxidation of steroids; by contrast, oxidation of steroids in vertebrates occurs via NAD(P)(+)-linked dehydrogenases. The injection of RH-5992, an ecdysteroid agonist, induced the transcription of ecdysone oxidase, suggesting that ecdysone oxidase is an ecdysteroid-responsive gene. The gene encoding this enzyme, consisting of five exons, has also been isolated. Sequences similar to the binding motifs for Broad-Complex and FTZ-F1 have been found in the 5'-flanking region. Southern blotting indicated that ecdysone oxidase is encoded by a single-copy gene. We have determined the kinetic characteristics of this novel recombinant ecdysone oxidase produced using a baculovirus expression system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126907>Human HIF-3alpha4 is a dominant-negative regulator of HIF-1 and is down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>A universal response to changes in cellular  tension is governed by a family of heterodimeric transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Tumor hypoxia, as well as various cancer-causing mutations, has been shown to elevate the level of HIF-1alpha, signifying a critical role of the HIF pathway in cancer development. The recently identified third member of the human HIF-alpha family, HIF-, produces multiple splice variants that contain extra DNA binding elements and protein-protein interaction motifs not found in HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha. Here we report the molecular cloning of the alternatively spliced human HIF- variant HIF-3alpha4 and show that it attenuates the ability of HIF-1 to bind hypoxia-responsive elements located within the enhancer/promoter of HIF target genes. The overexpression of HIF-3alpha4 suppresses the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous HIF-3alpha4 increases transcription by hypoxia-inducible genes. HIF-3alpha4 itself is -regulated, suggesting a novel feedback mechanism of controlling HIF-1 activity. Furthermore, the expression of HIF-3alpha4 is dramatically down-regulated in the majority of primary renal carcinomas. These results demonstrate an important dominant-negative regulation of HIF-1-mediated gene transcription by HIF-3alpha4 in vivo and underscore its potential significance in renal epithelial oncogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/240854>Biosynthesis of cholic  in rat liver. 24-Hydroxylation of , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic .</a></h1><p>Conversion of , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-[7beta-3H]cholestanoic  into , 7alpha, 12alpha, 24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic  in rat liver was catalyzed either by the mitochondrial fraction fortified with the 100,000 times g supernatant fluid or the microsomal fraction fortified with 100,000 times g supernatant fluid and ATP. The microsomal system was more active than the mitochondrial system. With the microsomal system the rate of reaction was considerably faster with free , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic  as substrate than with the corresponding coenzyme A ester. Addition of coenzyme A inhibited the activity. Addition of cofactors other than ATP and coenzyme A did not markedly influence the reaction. The 100,000 times g supernatant fluid could be substituted with a protein fraction obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sephadex chromatography of the 100,000 times g supernatant fluid. The reaction was not catalyzed by a mixed function oxidase since there was no incorporation of 18O into the product when the reaction was performed in an atmosphere containing 18O2. On the other hand,  may be obligatory since there was almost complete inhibition when the reaction was performed in an atmosphere consisting of nitrogen. Carbon monoxide did not inhibit the reaction. One atom of deuterium was incorporated into the product when the reaction was performed in a medium containing deuterated water. It was concluded that microsomal 24-hydroxylation of , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic  involves the combined action of a desaturase and a hydratase. The reaction catalyzed by the hydratase appears to be stereospecific since the 24alpha epimer of , 7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic  was the predominant product. In contrast to the microsomal system, the mitochondrial system was not stimulated by the addition of ATP and was not inhibited by coenzyme A. The coenzyme A ester of , 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic  was 24-hydroxylated more efficiently than the free .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15280364>Histone deacetylase 7 associates with hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and increases transcriptional activity.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha is a transcription factor that controls expression of genes responsive to low  tension, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin, and glycolytic enzymes. The activity of HIF-1alpha is regulated by binding to the transcriptional co-activator cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/p300. Using the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we found that the inhibitory domain of HIF-1alpha strongly interacted with the C-terminal domain of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 7. The o-nitrophenyl beta-d-galactopyranoside assay revealed that regions containing amino  735-785 of HIF-1alpha and amino  669-952 of HDAC7 were minimum contact sites of the interaction. The binding of HDAC7 with HIF-1alpha was reproduced in HEK293 cells grown under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (2% O(2)). HDAC7 bound solely to HIF-1alpha among other HIF-alpha family members, including HIF-2alpha and HIF-, whereas HIF-1alpha only interacted with HDAC7 in the class II HDAC family. Although HDAC7 was localized dominantly in the cytoplasm at normal  concentrations, HDAC7 co-translocated to the nucleus with HIF-1alpha under hypoxic conditions. In the nucleus, HDAC7 increased transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha through the formation of a complex with HIF-1alpha, HDAC7, and p300. Taken together, these results indicate that HDAC7 is a novel transcriptional activator of HIF-1alpha.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316122>An α-acetoxy-tirucallic  isomer inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling and induces oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Here we provide evidence that αATA(8,24) (3α-acetyloxy-tir-8,24-dien-21-oic ) inhibits Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. αATA(8,24) and other tirucallic  were isolated from the acetylated extract of the oleo gum resin of Boswellia serrata to chemical homogeneity. Compared with related tirucallic , αATA(8,24) was the most potent inhibitor of the proliferation of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, in prostate cancer xenografted onto chick chorioallantoic membranes. αATA(8,24) induced loss of cell membrane asymmetry, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation in vitro and in vivo. These effects were selective for cancer cells, because αATA(8,24) exerted no overt toxic effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the chick embryo. At the molecular level, αATA(8,24) inhibited the Akt1 kinase activity. Prior to all biochemical signs of cellular dysfunction, αATA(8,24) induced inhibition of the Akt downstream target mTOR as indicated by dephosphorylation of S6K1. This event was followed by decreased expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin B1, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK2 and phosphoretinoblastoma protein, which led to inhibition of the cell-cycle progression. In agreement with the mTOR inhibition, αATA(8,24) and rapamycin increased the volume of acidic vesicular organelles. In contrast to rapamycin, αATA(8,24) destabilized lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes and induced reactive oxygen species production in cancer cells. The ability of αATA(8,24) to inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling and to induce simultaneously oxidative stress could be exploited for the development of novel antitumor therapeutics with a lower profile of toxic side effects.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11060293>The reactive  species--and Michael acceptor-inducible human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 reduces the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene.</a></h1><p>The human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 (20alpha()-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is induced by electrophilic Michael acceptors and reactive  species (ROS) via a presumptive antioxidant response element (Burczynski, M. E., Lin, H. K., and Penning, T. M. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 607-614). Physiologically, AKR1C1 regulates progesterone action by converting the hormone into its inactive metabolite 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and toxicologically this enzyme activates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols to redox-cycling o-quinones. However, the significance of its potent induction by Michael acceptors and oxidative stress is unknown. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and other alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation were reduced by AKR1C1 with high catalytic efficiency. Kinetic studies revealed that AKR1C1 reduced HNE (K(m) = 34 microm, k(cat) = 8.8 min(-1)) with a k(cat)/K(m) similar to that for 20alpha-hydroxysteroids. Six other homogeneous recombinant AKRs were examined for their ability to reduce HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 possessed one of the highest specific activities and was the only isoform induced by oxidative stress and by agents that deplete glutathione (ethacrynic ). Several hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the AKR1C subfamily catalyzed the reduction of HNE with higher activity than aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). NMR spectroscopy identified the product of the NADPH-dependent reduction of HNE as 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene. The K(m) of recombinant AKR1C1 for nicotinamide cofactors (K(m) NADPH approximately 6 microm, K(m)(app) NADH >6 mm) suggested that it is primed for reductive metabolism of HNE. Isoform-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that exposure of HepG2 cells to HNE resulted in elevated levels of AKR1C1 mRNA. Thus, HNE induces its own metabolism via AKR1C1, and this enzyme may play a hitherto unrecognized role in a response mounted to counter oxidative stress. AKRs represent alternative GSH-independent/NADPH-dependent routes for the reductive elimination of HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 provides an inducible cytosolic barrier to HNE following ROS exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15547110>Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition improves vascular endothelial dysfunction in a rat model of endotoxic shock: role of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and oxidative stress.</a></h1><p>We investigated whether cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) and decreased NO availability contribute to endothelial dysfunction in endotoxemic rats. The involvement of reactive  species (ROS) was also evaluated. Rats were injected with Salmonella-derived lipopolysaccharide or saline. After 6 h, endothelial function of mesenteric resistance arteries was evaluated. In controls, acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation was inhibited by the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) and unaffected by 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl)-phenyl-2(5H)-furanone (DFU) (COX-2 inhibitor). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats, the response to ACh was blunted compared with controls, less sensitive to l-NMMA, and enhanced by DFU. COX-2 blockade also improved the inhibitory effect of l-NMMA on cholinergic relaxation. SC-560 [5-(4-clorophenyl)-1-(4-metoxyphenyl)-3-trifluoromethylpirazole] (COX-1 inhibitor) did not modify the response to ACh in both groups. LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction was unaffected by the thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) receptor antagonist SQ-29548 (7-[3-[[2-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]hydrazino]methyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1] hept-2-yl]-[1S(1alpha,2alpha(Z),,4alpha)]-5-heptenoic ). In vivo inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibition by S-methylisothiourea partly attenuated LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction. The antioxidants ascorbic  and superoxide dismutase normalized endothelium-dependent relaxation and restored the inhibitory action of l-NMMA on ACh. Responses to sodium nitroprusside were similar in both groups. In LPS-treated rats, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed a marked increase in mesenteric iNOS and COX-2 expressions, whereas endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and COX-1 were unchanged. LPS-induced COX-2 overexpression was reduced but not abrogated by S-methylisothiourea. LPS-induced COX-2 up-regulation was also documented by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, mesenteric resistance vessels from endotoxemic rats show impaired endothelial function due to reduced NO availability, a condition that is partly ascribable to an iNOS-dependent enhanced COX-2 expression, whereas TxA(2) does not seem to be involved. Oxidative stress is the main mechanism responsible for reduced NO availability, and COX-2 might act as a source of ROS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726658>Low oxygen atmosphere facilitates proliferation and maintains undifferentiated state of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in an hypoxia inducible factor-dependent manner.</a></h1><p>As we approach the era of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) application in the medical clinic, the standarization of their culture conditions are of the particular importance. We re-evaluated the influences of oxygens concentration on proliferation, stemness and differentiation of human umbilical cord Wharton Jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs).Primary cultures growing in 21% oxygen were either transferred into 5% O2 or continued to grow under standard 21% oxygen conditions. Cell expansion was estimated by WST1/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or cell counting. After 2 or 4 weeks of culture, cell phenotypes were evaluated using microscopic, immunocytochemical, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting and molecular methods. Genes and proteins typical of mesenchymal cells, committed neural cells or more primitive stem/progenitors (Oct4A, Nanog, Rex1, Sox2) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α-3α were evaluated.Lowering O2 concentration from 21% to the physiologically relevant 5% level substantially affected cell characteristics, with induction of stemness-related-transcription-factor and stimulation of cell proliferative capacity, with increased colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-F) centers exerting OCT4A, NANOG and HIF-1α and HIF-2α immunoreactivity. Moreover, the spontaneous and time-dependent ability of WJ-MSCs to differentiate into neural lineage under 21% O2 culture was blocked in the reduced oxygen condition. Importantly, treatment with trichostatin A (TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor) suppressed HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression, in addition to blockading the cellular effects of reduced oxygen concentration.A physiologically relevant microenvironment of 5% O2 rejuvenates WJ-MSC culture toward less-differentiated, more primitive and faster-growing phenotypes with involvement of HIF-1α and HIF-2α-mediated and TSA-sensitive chromatin modification mechanisms. These observations add to the understanding of MSC responses to defined culture conditions, which is the most critical issue for adult stem cells translational applications.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Oxidative challenge offsets TP degradation, a key component in limiting TxA(2)'s actions. Following TP activation, we observed cellular reactive  species (ROS) generation coincident with increased TP expression. We examined the link between TP-evoked ROS and TP regulation. TP expression was augmented in TPalpha-transfected cells treated with a TxA(2) analog [1S-1alpha,2beta(5Z),(1E,3R*),4alpha]]-7-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-(4'-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo-[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-heptenoic  (IBOP). This was reduced with a cellular antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine, or two distinct NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin. Homologous upregulation of the native TP was also reduced in apocynin-treated aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) and was absent in ASMCs lacking an NADPH oxidase subunit (p47(-/-)). TP transcription was not increased in IBOP-treated cells, indicating a posttranscriptional mechanism. IBOP induced translocation of TPalpha to the Golgi and reduced degradation of the immature form of the receptor. These data are consistent with a ROS-dependent mechanism whereby TP activation enhanced TP stability early in posttranscriptional biogenesis. Given the significant role played by TP and ROS in perturbed cardiovascular function, the convergence of TP on ROS-generating pathways for regulation of TxA(2)-dependent events may be critical for cardiovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488244>Changes in signalling pathways regulating protein synthesis in human muscle in the recovery period after endurance exercise.</a></h1><p>Exercise induced alterations in the rate of muscle protein synthesis may be related to activity changes in signalling pathways involved in protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether such changes in enzyme phosphorylation occur after endurance exercise.Six male subjects performed ergometer cycling exercise for 1 h at 75% of the maximal  uptake. Muscle biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis were taken before, immediately after, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after exercise for the determination of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase 3 kinase (GSK-3), p70S6 kinase (p70(S6k)) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation.The phosphorylation of Akt was unchanged directly after exercise, but two- to fourfold increased 1 and 2 h after the exercise, whereas GSK- and beta phosphorylation were two- to fourfold elevated throughout most of the 3-h recovery period. Phosphorylation of mTOR was elevated threefold directly after, 30 min and 2 h after exercise and eEF2 phosphorylation was decreased by 35-75% from 30 min to 3 h-recovery. Exercise led to a five- to eightfold increase in Ser(424)/Thr(421) phosphorylation of p70(S6k) up to 30 min after exercise, but no change in Thr(389) phosphorylation.The marked decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation suggests an activation of translation elongation and possibly protein synthesis in the recovery period after sustained endurance exercise. The lack of p70(S6k) activation suggests that translation initiation is activated via alternative pathways, possibly via the activation of eukaryotic initiating factor 2B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12009978>Biologically active secondary metabolites from Ginkgo biloba.</a></h1><p>Three new compounds, (7E)-2beta,-dihydroxy-megastigm-7-en-9-one (1), 3-[5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-4H-chromen-8-yl]-4-methoxybenzoic  (2), and 4'-O-methyl myricetin 3-O-(6-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), were isolated from Ginkgo biloba, together with 27 known compounds.

Compared with our extensive understanding of HIF-1 and HIF-2, our knowledge of HIF-3 is limited. In this study, we characterized the zebrafish hif-3α gene and determined its temporal and spatial expression, physiological regulation, and biological activity. We show that the chromosomal location, gene structure, and protein structure of zebrafish hif-3α are similar to its mammalian orthologs. When tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein and transfected into cultured cells, zebrafish Hif-3α was localized in the nucleus and stimulated reporter gene expression in a hypoxia response element-dependent manner. During early development, hif-3α mRNA was detected in all tissues with higher levels in the head. This expression pattern became more apparent in larvae at the 72, 96, and 120 hours post fertilization stages. In the adult stage, hif-3α mRNA was detected in all examined tissues with the highest levels in the ovary. Hypoxia treatment increased Hif-3α protein levels in both embryos and adults. Hypoxia also increased hif-3α mRNA expression levels, and this regulation was tissue-specific. Expression of a stabilized form of Hif-1α in zebrafish embryos increased the expression of igfbp-1a, a Hif-1 target gene, whereas it did not change hif-3α mRNA levels, suggesting that hif-3α is not a Hif-1α target. These results provide new information about the structural and functional conservation, spatial and temporal expression, and physiological regulation of hif-3α in a teleost model organism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546615>Melatonin decreases muscular oxidative stress and inflammation induced by strenuous exercise and stimulates growth factor synthesis.</a></h1><p>Strenuous exercise is detrimental to athletes because of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Melatonin, a classic antioxidant, has been shown to exhibit beneficial effects regarding intense exercise and tissue repair. In this study, we evaluated the onset and resolution of inflammation in melatonin-treated and nontreated rats subjected to a strenuous exercise session. We also analyzed the formation of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Control and treated rats were subjected to exhaustive exercise after a period of 10 days of melatonin treatment (20 mg/dL). Plasma and muscle levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2-alpha/beta (CINC-2α/β), l-selectin, macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha (MIP-3α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured prior to, immediately after, and 2 hr after exercise. Our data revealed decreases in the muscle concentrations of IL-1β (35%), TNF-α (13%), IL-6 (48%), and TBARS (40%) in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We also observed decreases in the plasma concentrations of IL-1β (17%) in the melatonin-treated group. VEGF-α concentrations and SOD activity increased by 179% and 22%, respectively, in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We concluded that muscle inflammation and oxidative stress resulting from exhaustive exercise were less severe in the muscles of melatonin-treated animals than in the muscles of control animals. Thus, melatonin treatment may reverse exercise-induced skeletal muscle inflammation and stimulate growth factor synthesis.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Vinpocetine was shown to protect cells from the inhibition in redox status induced by exposure to Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-40, the maximal protection being achieved at a vinpocetine concentration of 40 microM. At this concentration, vinpocetine blocked the inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes II-III and IV and completely abolished the depletion of pyruvate levels induced by toxic concentrations of Abeta peptides. Furthermore, the accumulation of ROS in cells exposed to Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-40 evaluated using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCF), was reduced in the presence of 40 microM vinpocetine. Taken together, the data presented herein demonstrate that vinpocetine protects cells from Abeta toxicity, preventing the generation of oxidative stress due to the excessive accumulation of ROS. This study suggests that vinpocetine can exert neuroprotective properties which might be of importance and contribute to its clinical efficacy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative disorders in which oxidative stress is involved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237540>Unsaturated fatty  as high-affinity ligands of the C-terminal Per-ARNT-Sim domain from the Hypoxia-inducible factor 3α.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) form heterodimeric complexes that mediate cell responses to hypoxia. The oxygen-dependent stability and activity of the HIF-α subunits is traditionally associated to post-translational modifications such as hydroxylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation.

Acute hypoxic stress is considered as one of the important factors inducing tissue damage. Here, we evaluate the influence of short-term hypoxia (1% O2 for 24 h) on perivascular adipose tissue-derived cells (ASCs) permanently expanded in tissue-related O2 (5%) microenvironment. After hypoxic exposure, ASCs retained high viability, stromal cell morphology and mesenchymal phenotype (CD73+, CD90+, CD105+ and CD45-). Mild oxidative damage was unveiled as elevation of reactive  species and thiobarbituric -active products, while no reduction in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase and a 20% statistically significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity was detected. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-3α isoforms was differently regulated. HIF-1α displayed transient up-regulation, with maximum levels 30 min after acute hypoxic exposure, while HIF-3α was significantly up-regulated after 24 h. Up-regulation of ERK7, MEK1 and c-fos, and down-regulation of MKK6, p53, CCNA2, CCNB1 and CCNB2 were observed after 24 h of  deprivation. Acute hypoxic exposure did not affect the gene expression of other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and MAPK kinases, MAPK/ERK kinase-interacting proteins, MAPK-activated transcription factors and scaffolding proteins. Significant stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor α and interleukin-6 production was detected in ASC-conditioned medium. Thus, tissue O2-adapted ASCs are resistant to hypoxic stress, which can ensure their effective involvement in the regeneration of tissue damage under significant  deprivation.© 2015 S.

In this study, two novel (1 and 5) and four known (2, 3, 4 and 6) terpenoids were isolated from the leaves of Rubus corchorifolius L. f. Structural analysis was performed using various spectroscopic methods (H NMR, C NMR and MS) to identify the following six compounds: (16α)-16,17,18-trihydroxy-ent-kauran-18-O-β-d-glucoside (1), ent-16β,17-dialkyl-3--kaurane (2), ent-kaurane-3α,16β,17-triol (3), ent-kaurane(5R,8S,9R,10R,13R,16R)-2-one-16α,17-diol (4), (16R)-16β,17,19-trihydroxy-ent-kaur-3-one (5) and ent-16α,17-dihydroxy-kauran-19-oic- (6). These compounds showed different inhibitory effects on various human cancer cells. Compounds 3 and 6 exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on human colon cancer HCT116 cells than the other 4 compounds. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that both compounds 3 and 6 caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and induced cellular apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Compounds 3 and 6 modulated the expression levels of key signaling proteins closely related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, i.e., increasing the levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p53, and p27, and decreasing the levels of EGFR, cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK4. Overall, our findings provided insight into the anticancer components of Rubus corchorifolius L. f. leaves, which could facilitate their utilization as functional food ingredients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18070924>Abnormal heart development and lung remodeling in mice lacking the hypoxia-inducible factor-related basic helix-loop-helix PAS protein NEPAS.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are crucial for  homeostasis during both embryonic development and postnatal life. Here we show that a novel HIF family basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) protein, which is expressed predominantly during embryonic and neonatal stages and thereby designated NEPAS (neonatal and embryonic PAS), acts as a negative regulator of HIF-mediated gene expression. NEPAS mRNA is derived from the HIF- gene by alternative splicing, replacing the first exon of HIF- with that of inhibitory PAS. NEPAS can dimerize with Arnt and exhibits only low levels of transcriptional activity, similar to that of HIF-. NEPAS suppressed reporter gene expression driven by HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. By generating mice with a targeted disruption of the NEPAS/HIF- locus, we found that homozygous mutant mice (NEPAS/HIF-(-)(/)(-)) were viable but displayed enlargement of the right ventricle and impaired lung remodeling. The expression of endothelin 1 and platelet-derived growth factor beta was increased in the lung endothelial cells of NEPAS/HIF--null mice. These results demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism in which the activities of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are negatively regulated by NEPAS in endothelial cells, which is pertinent to lung and heart development during the embryonic and neonatal stages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17442338>Mouse 17alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21) binds steroids differently from other aldo-keto reductases: identification and characterization of amino  residues critical for substrate binding.</a></h1><p>The mouse 17alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (m17alpha-HSD) is the unique known member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the conversion of androstenedione (Delta4) into epi-testosterone (epi-T), the 17alpha-epimer of testosterone. Structural and mutagenic studies had already identified one of the residues delineating the steroid-binding cavity, A24, as the major molecular determinant for the stereospecificity of m17alpha-HSD. We report here a ternary complex crystal structure (m17alpha-HSD:NADP(+):epi-T) determined at 1.85 A resolution that confirms this and reveals a unique steroid-binding mode for an AKR enzyme. Indeed, in addition to the interactions found in all other AKRs (van der Waals contacts stabilizing the core of the steroid and the hydrogen bonds established at the catalytic site by the Y55 and H117 residues with the  atom of the ketone group to be reduced), m17alpha-HSD establishes with the other extremity of the steroid nucleus an additional interaction involving K31. By combining direct mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we found that the elimination of this hydrogen bond did not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its steroid substrate but led to a slight but significant increase of its catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)), suggesting a role for K31 in the release of the steroidal product at the end of the reaction. This previously unobserved steroid-binding mode for an AKR is similar to that adopted by other steroid-binding proteins, the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family and the steroid hormone nuclear receptors. Mutagenesis and structural studies made on the human type 3 -HSD, a closely related enzyme that shares 73% amino  identity with the m17alpha-HSD, also revealed that the residue at position 24 of these two enzymes directly affects the binding and/or the release of NADPH, in addition to its role in their 17alpha/17beta stereospecificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21128096>Molecular selection and functional divergence of HIF-α proteins in vertebrates.</a></h1><p>HIF-α transcription factors, as key master regulators of  homeostasis, constitute a subgroup of the large bHLH-PAS transcription factor family and have been identified in many vertebrates. Although the amino  sequences of bHLH-PAS domain are conserved, the physiological and pathological roles of this family are variable. They also have different patterns of expression. It is possible that the HIF-α copies have been retained as a consequence of adaptive amino  replacements or relaxed selective constraint which have conferred subtle changes in function after duplications. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that at least two major duplications had occurred early in the vertebrate lineages. Analyses of the ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates revealed that relaxation of selective constraints might play important roles over evolutionary time and shape variation in some members of the family. The coefficients of functional divergence (θ) estimated between pairwise comparisons of gene groups from HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α indicated statistically significant site-specific shift of evolutionary rates between them, suggesting that altered functional constraints may have taken place at some amino  residues after their duplications. Moreover, we also mapped sites identified to have been relaxed from purifying selection onto the three-dimensional structure of human HIF-2α. Overall, our study demonstrated that the functional diversity of HIF-αs members may be caused by relaxed negative selection on the N-terminal transactivation domains after HIF-αs duplications, which recruited new partners leading to functional specificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10749662>27-Oxygenation of C27-sterols and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 in kidney: cloning, structure and expression of pig kidney CYP27A.</a></h1><p>This paper describes the molecular cloning of a cytochrome P450 enzyme in pig kidney that catalyses the hydroxylations of vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) and C(27)-sterols. DNA sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that the enzyme belongs to the CYP27 family. The first 36 amino  have many hallmarks of a mitochondrial signal sequence. The mature pig kidney CYP27 protein contains 498 amino . The M(r) of the mature protein was calculated to be 56607. The structure of pig kidney CYP27, as deduced by DNA sequence analysis, shows 77-83% identity with CYP27A in rat, rabbit and human liver. Transfection of the renal CYP27A cDNA into simian COS cells resulted in the synthesis of an enzyme that catalysed the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D(3) and the 27-hydroxylation of 5beta-cholestane-,7alpha,12alpha-triol, and the further oxidation of the product into the corresponding C(27)- ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic . As part of these studies, the enzymic activities of cultured human embryonic kidney cells were examined using vitamin D(3) and C(27)-sterols as substrates. The cells were found to express CYP27A mRNA and to convert the respective substrates into the same products as recombinantly expressed CYP27A, i.e. 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and 27-oxygenated C(27)-sterols. The results of the present study describing the structure and expression of CYP27A in kidney suggest that this enzyme is involved in the renal metabolism of vitamin D(3) and that the kidney plays a role in the metabolism of cholesterol and other C(27)-sterols.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28211011>TEOA, a triterpenoid from Actinidia eriantha, induces autophagy in SW620 cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress and ROS-dependent mitophagy.</a></h1><p>2α,3α,24-Thrihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oicacid (TEOA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, isolated from the roots of Actinidia eriantha, exhibits significant cytotoxicity against SW620, BGC-823, HepG-2, A549 and PC-3 cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the anticancer activity of TEOA in SW620 cells. We demonstrated that TEOA induced apoptosis through cleavage of caspase-9 and PARP in SW620 cells. In addition, evidence of TEOA-mediated autophagy included the induction of autophagolysosomes and activation of autophagic markers LC-3B and p62. Further analysis illustrated that TEOA promoted the phosphorylation of PERK and elF2α, followed by up-regulation of the downstream protein CHOP, suggesting the involvement of PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway and ER stress in TEOA-induced autophagy in SW620 cells. Meanwhile, TEOA-mediated PINK1, Parkin, ubiquitin and p62 activation revealed that TEOA induced specific autophagy-mitophagy in SW620 cells. Additionally, an antioxidant NAC attenuated the TEOA-induced mitophagy, indicating that TEOA triggers mitophagy via a ROS-dependent pathway. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel cellular mechanism of TEOA in the colon cancer cell line SW620, thus providing a molecular basis for developing TEOA into an anti-tumor candidate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22819560>Protective effects of dietary EPA and DHA on ischemia-reperfusion-induced intestinal stress.</a></h1><p>The immunoregulatory effects of dietary omega-3 fatty  are still not fully characterized. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) intake limits intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. To test this, rats were fed either control or EPA/DHA supplemented diet for 3 weeks following which they underwent either a sham or an IR surgical protocol. A significant reduction in mucosal damage was observed after EPA/DHA supplemented diet as reflected by maintenance of total protein content. To address the underlying mechanisms of protection, we measured parameters of oxidative stress, intestinal and serological cytokines and intestinal eicosanoids. Interestingly, EPA/DHA fed animals displayed a higher activity of oxidative stress enzyme machinery, i.e., superoxide dismutase and catalase in addition to a reduction in total nitrate/nitrite content. While no changes in cytokines were observed, eicosanoid analyses of intestinal tissue revealed an increase in metabolites of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway following IR. Further, IR in EPA/DHA fed animals was accompanied by a significant increase of 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic , 8-Iso prostaglandin F(3α) and thromboxane B(3), by more than 12-, 6-, 3-fold, respectively. Thus, the data indicate that EPA/DHA supplementation may be able to reduce early intestinal IR injury by anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Isolated endothelium-intact IMA and RA rings precontracted with KCl (30 mM) rapidly dilated to hypoxia (95% N(2)/5% CO(2)) with a greater relaxation in RA than IMA. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (10 microM indomethacin) and the thromboxane A(2) (TxA)(2) receptor [1 microM [1S-[1alpha,2alpha(Z),,4alpha]]-7-[3-[2-(phenylamino)carbonyl]hydrazine]methyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic  (SQ-29548)] potentiated the relaxation to hypoxia in IMA, but not RA, a response associated with increases in TxA(2). Relaxation of IMA and RA to hypoxia appears to involve a calcium-reuptake mechanism inhibited by cyclopiazonic  (0.2 mM), and it was not attenuated by a blocker of potassium channels (10 mM TEA). The recovery of force generation of IMA, but not RA, upon reoxygenation after 30 min of hypoxia was significantly reduced in the initial phase of reoxygenation by indomethacin and SQ-29548 and by endothelin receptor blocker BQ-123 [cyclo(l-Leu-d-Trp-d-Asp-l-Pro-d-Val)]. Thus, hypoxia relaxes IMA and RA by a prostaglandin-independent mechanism potentially involving enhanced intracellular calcium reuptake. The prostaglandin-mediated alterations of responses to hypoxia-reoxygenation seen in IMA, but not in RA, may predispose IMA to vasospasm-related complications of CABG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26398371>Tideglusib protects neural stem cells against NMDA receptor overactivation.</a></h1><p>N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are major pharmacological targets to prevent or reduce the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Successful therapy with NMDA receptor antagonists in humans has been limited by the severe side effects of complete receptor blockade. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible protective effects of tideglusib against NMDA receptor overactivation in neural stem cells.We measured the alteration in membrane integrity, free radical generation, intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)/mitochondrial morphology and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (α/β isoforms and phospho-GSK-3α/β) protein expression levels following treatments.NMDA treatment, with or without d-serine, significantly increased LDH leakage and triggered cell death in neural stem cells. Reactive  species (ROS) formation and intracellular Ca(2+) levels were increased following NMDA receptor overactivation. The significant reduction in MMP was found in NMDA/d-serine-treated cells. Tideglusib significantly decreased ROS production and membrane degradation, but did not change intracellular Ca(2+) levels following NMDA receptor activation. Both in the presence or in the absence of NMDA/d-serine, tideglusib increased MMP and the levels of phospho-GSK-3β in NSCs. Moreover, GW9662 (a peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist) treatment significantly inhibited the protective effect of tideglusib in NMDA/d-serine-treated cells.Our study provides the evidence that GSK-3β and PPARγ may be directly involved in pathways leading to NMDA receptor-induced cell death and that the inhibitors including tideglusib may exert neuroprotective effect against these receptor overactivation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The activation of biosynthetic routes was attempted by the diversification of process conditions and growth media. Several strategies were tested, including the addition of rapeseed oil or inulin, changing the concentration of nitrogen source, reduction of chlorine supply, cultivation under saline conditions, and using various aeration schemes. Fifteen secondary metabolites were identified in the course of the study by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, namely mevinolinic , 4a,5-dihydromevinolinic , 3α-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L , terrein, aspulvinone E, dihydroisoflavipucine, (+)-geodin, (+)-bisdechlorogeodin, (+)-erdin, asterric , butyrolactone I, desmethylsulochrin, questin, sulochrin, and demethylasterric . The study also presents the collection of mass spectra that can serve as a resource for future experiments. The growth in a salt-rich environment turned out to be strongly inhibitory for secondary metabolism and the formation of dense and compact pellets was observed. Generally, the addition of inulin, reducing the  supply, and increasing the content of nitrogen source did not enhance the production of examined molecules. The most successful strategy involved the addition of rapeseed oil to the chlorine-deficient medium. Under these conditions, the highest levels of butyrolactone I, asterric , and mevinolinic  were achieved and the presence of desmethylsulochrin and (+)-bisdechlorogeodin was detected in the broth. The constant and relatively high aeration rate in the idiophase was shown to be beneficial for terrein and (+)-geodin biosynthesis.</p></html>
