However, several studies have suggested that thyroid cancer coexists with autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto Thyroiditis (HT) and Graves disease (GD). We have shown that the risk of developing thyroid cancer is higher in patients with a silent form of autoimmune thyroid disease -Euthyroid Hashimoto Thyroiditis-(EHT).We analyzed data from 2633 consecutive patients with GD, HT, EHT and non-Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (Non-AITD) for the presence of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC). We further investigated the microenvironment, and cellular mechanism of protection from DTC in GD/EHT by ex-vivo aspirating infiltrates from thyroid samples. We also re-constituted in vitro the in-vivo microenvironment to mimic an in-vivo context. We isolated NK cells and differentiated macrophages into M1 and  phenotype from healthy human peripheral blood monocytes.DTC was less frequent/aggressive in GD as compared to EHT or Non-AITD. Intra-thyroidal immune-cell profiling revealed differential Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and macrophage polarization in the settings of GD versus EHT. In GD, NK-cells were activated, and macrophages showed M1-like phenotype whereas, in EHT, NK-cells were less active and macrophages displayed -like phenotype. Furthermore, in vitro co-cultures of NK-cells with differentiated macrophage subsets revealed that the presence of activated NK (NA) cells favors M1 macrophages, boosts macrophage action and amplifies the innate defense mechanisms. Moreover, co-culture of  macrophages with NA, increases the cytotoxicity of NK-cells and favors a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that reverts the anti-inflammatory  towards pro-inflammatory M1.Surveillance innate immune-cells like Natural Killer (NK) cells and macrophages are complementary to each other in their actions. We discovered here that activated NK-cells in the background of the thyroid autoimmune disease, GD, drive macrophage differentiation to the M1/killer phenotype which in turn is cytotoxic to cancer cells and down regulates the /repair phenotype. Understanding the molecular basis of macrophage-NK cell interface in Thyroid Cancer, ETH and GD will open new vistas for immunopathology and therapeutic intervention. Macrophages/innate  can be modulated from  to M1 phenotype to help treat thyroid cancer as naturally done by GD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031765>Complementing the Cancer- Cycle.</a></h2><p>Reactivation of cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses has set a new direction for cancer immunotherapy. Neutralizing antibodies targeting immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) have been particularly successful for tumor types with limited therapeutic options such as melanoma and lung cancer. However, reactivation of T cells is only one step toward tumor elimination, and a substantial fraction of patients fails to respond to these therapies. In this context, combination therapies targeting more than one of the steps of the cancer-immune cycle may provide significant benefits. To find the best combinations, it is of upmost importance to understand the interplay between cancer cells and all the components of the immune response. This review focuses on the elements of the complement system that come into play in the cancer- cycle. The complement system, an essential part of innate , has emerged as a major regulator of cancer . Complement effectors such as C1q, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and their receptors C3aR and C5aR1, have been associated with tolerogenic cell death and inhibition of antitumor T-cell responses through the recruitment and/or activation of immunosuppressive cell subpopulations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), or  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Evidence is provided to support the idea that complement blocks many of the effector routes associated with the cancer- cycle, providing the rationale for new therapeutic combinations aimed to enhance the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597355>Mitochondrial Calcium Uptake Is Instrumental to Alternative Macrophage Polarization and Phagocytic Activity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are highly plastic and dynamic cells that exert much of their function through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis depends on a coordinated, finely tuned, and compartmentalized regulation of calcium concentrations. We examined the role of mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in macrophage polarization and function. In primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages, calcium uptake in mitochondria was instrumental for alternative () macrophage polarization. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibition with KB-R7943 or MCU knockdown, which prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake, reduced  polarization, while not affecting classical (M1) polarization. Challenging macrophages with  fragments induced spikes of mitochondrial calcium concentrations, which were prevented by MCU inhibition or silencing. In addition, mitochondria remodelled in  macrophages during phagocytosis, especially close to sites of  internalization. Remarkably, inhibition or knockdown of MCU significantly reduced the phagocytic capacity of  macrophages. KB-R7943, which also inhibits the membrane sodium/calcium exchanger and Complex I, reduced mitochondria energization and cellular ATP levels, but such effects were not observed with MCU silencing. Therefore, phagocytosis inhibition by MCU knockdown depended on the impaired mitochondrial calcium buffering rather than changes in mitochondrial and cellular energy status. These data uncover a new role for MCU in alternative macrophage polarization and phagocytic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703100>Evidence of a causal relationship between body mass index and psoriasis: A mendelian randomization study.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that has been reported to be associated with obesity. We aimed to investigate a possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis.Following a review of published epidemiological evidence of the association between obesity and psoriasis, mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test for a causal relationship with BMI. We used a genetic instrument comprising 97 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI as a proxy for BMI (expected to be much less confounded than measured BMI). One-sample MR was conducted using individual-level data (396,495 individuals) from the UK Biobank and the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. Two-sample MR was performed with summary-level data (356,926 individuals) from published BMI and psoriasis genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The one-sample and two-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model. To test for a potential reverse causal effect, MR analysis with genetic instruments comprising variants from recent genome-wide analyses for psoriasis were used to test whether genetic risk for this skin disease has a causal effect on BMI. Published observational data showed an association of higher BMI with psoriasis. A mean difference in BMI of 1.26 kg/ (95% CI 1.02-1.51) between psoriasis cases and controls was observed in adults, while a 1.55 kg/ mean difference (95% CI 1.13-1.98) was observed in children. The observational association was confirmed in UK Biobank and HUNT data sets. Overall, a 1 kg/ increase in BMI was associated with 4% higher odds of psoriasis (meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.04; P = 1.73 × 10(-60)). MR analyses provided evidence that higher BMI causally increases the odds of psoriasis (by 9% per 1 unit increase in BMI; OR = 1.09 (1.06-1.12) per 1 kg/; P = 4.67 × 10(-9)). In contrast, MR estimates gave little support to a possible causal effect of psoriasis genetic risk on BMI (0.004 kg/ change in BMI per doubling odds of psoriasis (-0.003 to 0.011). Limitations of our study include possible misreporting of psoriasis by patients, as well as potential misdiagnosis by clinicians. In addition, there is also limited ethnic variation in the cohorts studied.Our study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI, provides evidence that higher BMI leads to a higher risk of psoriasis. This supports the prioritization of therapies and lifestyle interventions aimed at controlling weight for the prevention or treatment of this common skin disease. Mechanistic studies are required to improve understanding of this relationship.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698644>Lenalidomide in combination with intravenous rituximab (REVRI) in relapsed/refractory primary CNS lymphoma or primary intraocular lymphoma: a multicenter prospective 'proof of concept' phase II study of the French Oculo-Cerebral lymphoma (LOC) Network and the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA)†.</a></h2><p>Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) are mainly diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) of the non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) subtype. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of rituximab plus lenalidomide (R2) in DLBCL-PCNSL.Patients with refractory/relapsed (R/R) DLBCL-PCNSL or primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) were included in this prospective phase II study. The induction treatment consisted of eight 28-day cycles of R2 (rituximab 375/ i.v. D1; lenalidomide 20 mg/day, D1-21 for cycle 1; and 25 mg/day, D1-21 for the subsequent cycles); in responding patients, the induction treatment was followed by a maintenance phase comprising 12 28-day cycles of lenalidomide alone (10 mg/day, D1-21). The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR) at the end of induction (P0 = 10%; P1 = 30%).Fifty patients were included. Forty-five patients (PCNSL, N = 34; PVRL, N = 11) were assessable for response. The ORR at the end of induction was 35.6% (95% CI 21.9-51.2) in assessable patients and 32.0% (95% CI 21.9-51.2) in the intent-to-treat analysis, including 13 complete responses (CR)/unconfirmed CR (uCR; 29%) and 3 partial responses (PR; 7%). The best responses were 18 CR/uCR (40%) and 12 PR (27%) during the induction phase. The maintenance phase was started and completed by 18 and 5 patients, respectively. With a median follow-up of 19.2 months (range 1.5-31), the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.8 months (95% CI 3.9-11.3) and 17.7 months (95% CI 12.9 to not reached), respectively. No unexpected toxicity was observed. The peripheral baseline CD4/CD8 ratio impacted PFS [median PFS = 9.5 months (95% CI, 8.1-14.8] for CD4/CD8 ≥ 1.6; median PFS = 2.8 months, [95% CI, 1.1-7.8) for CD4/CD8 < 1.6, P = 0.03).The R2 regimen showed significant activity in R/R PCNSL and PVRL patients. These results support assessments of the efficacy of R2 combined with methotrexate-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment of PCNSL..© The Author(s) 2019.

For the export of several biomolecules in diverse species, the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is considered to represent an alternative transport mechanism, but no study to date has investigated EVs from dermatophytes. Here, we describe biologically active EVs from the dermatophyte , a causative agent of mycoses worldwide. EV preparations from  were examined using nanoparticle-tracking analysis, which revealed vesicular structures 20-380 nm in diameter. These vesicles induced the production of proinflammatory mediators by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and an addition of the EVs to BMDMs also stimulated the transcription of the M1-polarization marker iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and diminished the expression of the  markers arginase-1 and Ym-1. The observed M1 macrophages' polarization triggered by EVs was abolished in cells obtained from knockout Toll-like receptor-2 mice. Also, the EVs-induced productions of pro-inflammatory mediators were blocked too. Furthermore, the EVs from  enhanced the fungicidal activity of BMDMs. These results suggest that EVs from  can modulate the innate immune response of the host and influence the interaction between  and host immune cells. Our findings thus open new areas of investigation into the host-parasite relationship in dermatophytosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30288851>IRGM promotes glioma  macrophage polarization through p62/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway mediated IL-8 production.</a></h2><p>Alternatively activated () macrophage promotes glioma progression and immune escape as the most immunocyte in glioma microenvironment. Finding out the key protein regulating  macrophage polarization is necessary for improving treatment. Whether  related GTPase M (IRGM) is involved in glioma development and  macrophage polarization is unknown. IRGM and  macrophage marker CD206 expression were examined using immunohistochemistry among 35 glioma and 11 non-cancerous brain specimens. We found IRGM scores were positively correlated with CD206 scores in glioma specimens and monocyte proportion in blood samples. A172 glioma cells transfected with either IRGM knock-down lentivirus (Lenti-IRGM) or control lentivirus (Lenti-HK) were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. In vivo, xenografted glioma size of the Lenti-IRGM group was smaller and had weaker fluorescence signal than Lenti-HK control group. Immunofluorescence results showed that there was obviously decreased IRGM, CD206, and IL-8 expression in the mice glioma of Lenti-IRGM group than Lenti-HK control group. In vitro, flow cytometry results showed that  polarization from THP-1 cocultured with Lenti-IRGM glioma cells decreased in contrast to that with Lenti-HK glioma cells; there were less interleukin-8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflammation protein 3-α (MIP-3α), but more interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the supernatant of Lenti-IRGM glioma cells than matched control. Western blot and immunofluorescence displayed that IRGM strongly promoted sequestosome-1 (p62/SQSTM1), necrosis factor receptor-activating factor 6 (TRAF6) expression and NF-κB transportation to the nucleus. Realtime PCR results demonstrated IRGM also promoted NF-κB downstream cytokines IL-8 and MIP-3α mRNA expression. These data suggested that IRGM could promote glioma development and  macrophage polarization by regulating p62/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway-mediated IL-8 production.© 2018 International Federation for Cell Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519790>Oxytocin system alleviates intestinal inflammation by regulating macrophages polarization in experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammation, but the accurate etiology remains to be elucidated. Increasing evidence has shown that macrophages polarize to different phenotypes depending on the intestinal microenvironment and are associated with the progression of IBD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin, a neuroendocrinal, and pro-health peptide, on the modulation of macrophages polarization and the progression of experimental colitis. Our data demonstrated that oxytocin decreased the sensitivity of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but increased the sensitivity to IL-4 stimulation with enhanced expression of -type genes, arginase I (Arg1), CD206, and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3). This bidirectional modulation was partly due to the up-regulation of β-arrestin2 and resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and reinforcement of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 phosphorylation. Moreover, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) myeloid deficiency mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intervention compared with the wild mice. For the first time, we reveal that oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system participates in modulating the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates experimental colitis. These findings provide new potential insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD.© 2019 The Author(s).

Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) protects against inflammatory processes such as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), organ transplantation, and atherosclerosis. To test our hypothesis that HO-1 regulates macrophage polarization and protects against IRI, we generated myeloid-specific HO-1-knockout (mHO-1-KO) and -transgenic (mHO-1-Tg) mice, with deletion or overexpression of HO-1, in various macrophage populations. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mHO-1-KO mice, treated with M1-inducing LPS or -inducing IL-4, exhibited increased mRNA expression of M1 (CXCL10, IL-1β, MCP1) and decreased expression of  (Arg1 and CD163) markers as compared with controls, while BMDMs from mHO-1-Tg mice displayed the opposite. A similar pattern was observed in the hepatic M1/ expression profile in a mouse model of liver IRI. mHO-1-KO mice displayed increased hepatocellular damage, serum AST/ALT levels, Suzuki's histological score of liver IRI, and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, while mHO-1-Tg mice exhibited the opposite. In human liver transplant biopsies, subjects with higher HO-1 levels showed lower expression of M1 markers together with decreased hepatocellular damage and improved outcomes. In conclusion, myeloid HO-1 expression modulates macrophage polarization, and protects against liver IRI, at least in part by favoring an  phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409781>RIG-I-like receptors direct inflammatory macrophage polarization against West Nile virus infection.</a></h2><p>RIG-I-Like Receptors (RLRs) RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, are vital pathogen recognition receptors in the defense against RNA viruses. West Nile Virus (WNV) infections continue to grow in the US. Here, we use a systems biology approach to define the contributions of each RLR in the innate immune response to WNV. Genome-wide RNAseq and bioinformatics analyses of macrophages from mice lacking either RLR reveal that the RLRs drive distinct immune gene activation and response polarization to mediate an M1/inflammatory signature while suppressing the /wound healing phenotype. While LGP2 functions to modulate inflammatory signaling, RIG-I and MDA5 together are essential for M1 macrophage polarization in vivo and the control of WNV infection through potential downstream control of ATF4 and SMAD4 to regulate target gene expression for cell polarization. These analyses reveal the RLR-driven signature of macrophage polarization, innate immune protection, and immune programming against WNV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802996>Molecular model linking Th2 polarized  tumour-associated macrophages with deaminase-mediated cancer progression mutation signatures.</a></h2><p>A new and diverse range of somatic mutation signatures are observed in late-stage cancers, but the underlying reasons are not fully understood. We advance a "combinatorial association model" for deaminase binding domain (DBD) diversification to explain the generation of previously observed cancer-progression associated mutation signatures. We also propose that changes in the polarization of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are accompanied by the expression of deaminases with a new and diverse range of DBDs, and thus accounting for the generation of new somatic mutation signatures. The mechanism proposed is molecularly reminiscent of combinatorial association of heavy (H) and light (L) protein chains following V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin molecules (and similarly for protein chains in heterodimers α/β and γ/δ of V(D)Js of T Cell Receptors) required for pathogen antigen recognition by B cells and T cells, respectively. We also discuss whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) emanating from tumour enhancing -polarized macrophages represent a likely source of the de novo deaminase DBDs. We conclude that -polarized macrophages extruding EVs loaded with deaminase proteins or deaminase-specific transcription/translation regulatory factors and like information may directly trigger deaminase diversification within cancer cells, and thus account for the many new somatic mutation signatures that are indicative of cancer progression. This hypothesis now has a plausible evidentiary base, and it is worth direct testing in future investigations. A long-term objective would be to identify molecular biomarkers predicting cancer progression (or metastatic disease) and to support the development of new drug targets before metastatic pathways are activated.© 2019 The Authors.

Beta cell specific T cells are highly differentiated and show evidence of previous antigen exposure. Exerciseinduced mobilisation of highly-differentiated CD8+ T cells facilitates immune surveillance and regulation. We aimed to explore exercise-induced T cell mobilisation in T1D. In this study, we compared the effects of a single bout of vigorous intensity exercise on T cell mobilisation in T1D and control participants. N=12 T1D (mean age 33.2yrs, predicted VO2 max 32.2 mL/(kg·min), BMI 25.3Kg/) and N=12 control (mean age 29.4yrs, predicted VO2 max 38.5mL(kg.min), BMI 23.7Kg/) male participants completed a 30-minute bout of cycling at 80% predicted VO2 max in a fasted state. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline, immediately post-exercise, and 1 hour post-exercise. Exercise-induced mobilisation was observed for T cells in both T1D and control groups. Total CD8+ T cells mobilised to a similar extent in T1D (42.7%; p=0.016) and controls (39.7%; p=0.001). CD8 effector memory CD45RA+ (EMRA) subset were the only T cell lineage subset to be significantly mobilised in both groups though the percentage increase of CD8+ EMRA was blunted in T1D (T1D (26.5%) p=0.004, control (66.1%) p=0.010). Further phenotyping of these subsets revealed that the blunting was most evident in CD8+ EMRA that expressed adhesion (CD11b: T1D 37.70%, Control 91.48%) and activation markers (CD69: T1D 29.87%, Control 161.43%), and appeared to be the most differentiated (CD27-CD28-: T1D 7.12%, Control 113.76%). CD4+ T cells mobilised during vigorous intensity exercise in controls (p=0.001), but not in T1D. The blunted mobilisation response of particular T cell subsets was not due to CMV serostatus or apparent differences in exertion during the exercise bout as defined by heart rate and RPE. Predicted VO2 max showed a trend to be lower in the T1D group than the control group but is unlikely to contribute to this blunted response. We postulate the reasons for a blunted mobilisation of differentiated CD8+ EMRA cells includes differences in blood glucose, adrenaline receptor density, and sequestration of T cells in the pancreas of T1D participants. In conclusion, mobilisation of CD8+ EMRA and CD4+ subsets T cells is decreased in people with T1D during acute exercise.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Exercise and Immunology.

Unfortunately, radiation and hypoxia could induce the  macrophages infiltration and polarization.  In this study, we investigated the relevance of macrophage recruitment with radiation and hypoxia by transwell. We also evaluated the effect of β-elemene on the infiltration of  macrophages and explored its underlying molecular mechanism by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.  Irradiated or hypoxia lung cancer cells recruit macrophages, and the recruitment is MCP-1 dependent. We also found that radiation and hypoxia-induced MCP-1 secretion follows upregulation of Prx-1, which leads to nuclear accumulation of NF-κB and HIF-1α expression. In addition, β-elemene could effectively suppress this recruitment phenomenon through Prx-1/NF-κB/HIF-1α signaling. Our study showed that radiation and hypoxia significantly promoted the macrophages recruitment. β-elemene could effectively suppress this recruitment phenomenon and MCP-1 expression via inhibiting Prx-1/NF-κB/HIF-1α pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253648>Local Blockade of Interleukin 10 and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 with Nano-Delivery Promotes Antitumor Response in Murine Cancers.</a></h2><p>In many cancers, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is largely immune suppressive, blocking the antitumor  and resulting in immunotherapy resistance. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a major player controlling the immunosuppressive TME in different murine tumor models. Increased IL-10 production suppresses intratumoral dendritic cell production of interleukin 12, thereby limiting antitumor cytotoxic T-cell responses and activation of NK cells during therapy. We engineered, formulated, and delivered genes encoding an IL-10 protein trap to change immunosuppressive TME, which could enhance antitumor . Additionally, to achieve stronger and long-term therapeutic efficacy in a pancreatic cancer model, we targeted C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), a key factor for inhibiting T-cell tumor infiltration, and simultaneously delivered an IL-10 trap. Following three injections of the lipid-protamine-DNA (LPD) nanoparticles loaded with trap genes (IL-10 trap and CXCL12 trap), we found tumor growth reduction and significantly prolonged survival of the host compared to control groups. Furthermore, the combination trap gene treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive cells, such as  macrophages, MDSCs, and PD-L1 cells, and activated immunosuppressive tolerogenic dendritic cells, NK cells, and macrophages intratumorally. We have also shown that, when effectively delivered to the tumor, the IL-10 trap gene alone can inhibit triple-negative breast cancer growth. This strategy may allow clinicians and researchers to change the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor with either a single therapeutic agent or in combination with other immunotherapies to prime the immune system, preventing cancer invasion and prolonging patient survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248427>Macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) is induced on  microglia and participates in the resolution phase of autoimmune neuroinflammation.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves a misdirected immune attack against myelin in the brain and spinal cord, leading to profound neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. While the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis have been widely studied, the suppression mechanisms that lead to the resolution of the autoimmune response are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the C-type lectin receptor macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), usually expressed on tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as a negative regulator of autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation.We used in silico, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis to explore the expression and functionality of MGL in human macrophages and microglia, as well as in MS post-mortem tissue. In vitro, we studied the capacity of MGL to mediate apoptosis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-derived T cells and mouse CD4 T cells. Finally, we evaluated in vivo and ex vivo the immunomodulatory potential of MGL in EAE.MGL plays a critical role in the resolution phase of EAE as MGL1-deficient (Clec10a) mice showed a similar day of onset but experienced a higher clinical score to that of WT littermates. We demonstrate that the mouse ortholog MGL1 induces apoptosis of autoreactive T cells and diminishes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory autoantibodies. Moreover, we show that MGL1 but not MGL2 induces apoptosis of activated mouse CD4 T cells in vitro. In human settings, we show that MGL expression is increased in active MS lesions and on alternatively activated microglia and macrophages which, in turn, induces the secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, underscoring the clinical relevance of this lectin.Our results show a new role of MGL-expressing APCs as an anti-inflammatory mechanism in autoimmune neuroinflammation by dampening pathogenic T and B cell responses, uncovering a novel clue for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies with relevance for in MS clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530089>Diversity, Mechanisms, and Significance of Macrophage Plasticity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a diverse set of cells present in all body compartments. This diversity is imprinted by their ontogenetic origin (embryonal versus adult bone marrow-derived cells); the organ context; the activation or deactivation of various signals in the contexts of microbial invasion, tissue damage, and metabolic derangement; and by polarization of adaptive T cell responses. Classic adaptive responses of macrophages include tolerance, priming, and a wide spectrum of activation states, including M1, , or -like. Moreover, macrophages can retain long-term imprinting of microbial encounters (trained innate ). Single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes in health and disease has added a new dimension to our understanding of the diversity of macrophage differentiation and activation. Epigenetic landscapes, transcription factors, and microRNA networks underlie the adaptability of macrophages to different environmental cues. Macrophage plasticity, an essential component of chronic inflammation, and its involvement in diverse human diseases, most notably cancer, is discussed here as a paradigm.

We sought to detail the effect of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibition on the composition of the mammary tumor immune portfolio. We hypothesized that Hh signaling mediates a crosstalk between breast cancer cells and macrophages that dictates alternative polarization of macrophages and consequently supports a tumor-promoting microenvironment. We used an immunocompetent, syngeneic mouse mammary cancer model to inhibit Hh signaling with the pharmacological inhibitor, Vismodegib. Using molecular and functional assays, we identified that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling mediates a molecular crosstalk between mammary cancer cells and macrophages that culminates in alternative polarization of macrophages. We carried out an unbiased kinomics and genomics assessment to unravel changes in global kinomic and gene signatures impacted by Hh signaling. Our investigations reveal that in an immunocompetent mammary cancer model, the administration of Vismodegib led to changes in the portfolio of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This was characterized by a marked reduction in immune-suppressive innate and adaptive cells concomitant with an enrichment of cytotoxic immune cells. Breast cancer cells induce  polarization of macrophages via a crosstalk mediated by Hh ligands that alters critical kinomic and genomic signatures. Macrophage depletion improved the benefit of Hedgehog inhibition on eliciting an immunogenic, pro-inflammatory profile. We define a novel role for Hh signaling in disabling anti-tumor . Inhibition of Hh signaling presents with dual advantages of tumor cell-targeting as well as re-educating a dysfunctional tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368555>High expression of CCL2 in tumor cells and abundant infiltration with CD14 positive macrophages predict early relapse in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are important for the function of the innate immune system, and in solid tumors, they represent a significant proportion of the tumor mass. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have a  phenotype and show a multitude of pro-tumoral functions, promoting tumor cell survival, proliferation, and dissemination. CCL2, synthesized by tumor and stromal cells, initiates a chemokine cascade inducing these processes. We studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the frequency of TAMs and CCL2 expressing cells in three groups of primary tumor (PT)-recurrence (R) pairs, where relapse was recorded within 2 years (group 1), between 5 and 10 years (group 2), and after 10 years (group 3). In our study all established breast cancers were heavily infiltrated by CD68 positive cells. Both in PTs and in R lesions the infiltration was more abundant in the peritumoral than in the intratumoral stroma. The mean frequency of  marker and CD14 positive cells in the intratumoral stroma and CCL2 expressing tumor cells was higher in the Rs as compared to the corresponding PTs. In PTs, a high frequency of CD14 positive cells and a high expression of CCL2 by tumor cells was associated with an early recurrence. The findings support the current understanding of immune cell orchestrated development, progression and metastatic spread of breast cancer. Our study showed that a high frequency of CCL2 positive tumor cells and CD14 positive TAMs are significant risk factors for rapid tumor recurrence. Potential targets for intervention are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734977>The immunophenotype of decidual macrophages in acute atherosis.</a></h2><p>Acute atherosis is a uteroplacental arterial lesion that is associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and preterm birth, the latter being the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the immunobiology of acute atherosis is poorly understood.Placental basal plate samples were collected from women who delivered with (n = 11) and without (n = 31) decidua basalis lesions of acute atherosis. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to quantify M1- and -like macrophage subsets and the expression of iNOS and IL-12 by decidual macrophages. Multiplex fluorescence staining and phenoptics were performed to localize M1-, MOX-, and Mhem-like macrophages in the decidual basalis.Macrophages displayed diverse phenotypes in the decidua basalis with acute atherosis. -like macrophages were the most abundant subset in the decidua; yet, this macrophage subset did not change with the presence of acute atherosis. Decidual M1-like macrophages were increased in acute atherosis, and such macrophages displayed a pro-inflammatory phenotype, as indicated by the expression of iNOS and IL-12. Decidual M1-like pro-inflammatory macrophages were localized near both transformed and non-transformed vessels in the decidua basalis with acute atherosis. MOX and Mhem macrophages were also identified near transformed vessels in the decidua basalis with acute atherosis. Finally, monocyte-like cells were present on the vessel wall of non-transformed decidual vessels, indicating a possible intravascular source for macrophages in acute atherosis.Decidual macrophages display different phenotypes, namely M1-like, -like, MOX, and Mhem subsets. Yet, pro-inflammatory macrophages are enriched in the decidua basalis with acute atherosis. These findings provide a molecular foundation for future mechanistic inquiries about the role of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the pathogenesis of acute atherosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The patients were evaluated clinically, radiologically and were investigated thoroughly according to PMDT guidelines and then were started on MDR TB treatment. The study was conducted at drug resistance tuberculosis center (DR-TB) managed by department of Pulmonary Medicine.474 cases were included in the study and we found that patients were in the age range of 10-84 years, maximum patients were in age group of 30 to 39 years, and mean age was 38 yrs. Male to female ratio was 2.73 to 1, most of the patients in the study were from rural area i.e. 61.6%. Illiteracy was found in 339 (71.5%) cases and out of these 339, 165 patients (48.6%) were defaulter, 101(29.8%) are cases of relapse, 39(11.5%) were failure, 34(10.02%) of new cases. Maximum numbers of patient were in lower class accounting 63.7% and upper lower class 31.6%, lower middle class only 4.5%. Study also showed mean BMI was 14.9 kg/ (range 5.7-25.4 kg/), 88.6% of patients were undernourished with BMI less then 18.5kg/ .The most common symptoms was cough seen in 96%, followed by fever 67.5%, Dyspnea 52.7%, Anorexia 26.2%, chest pain in 19.8% and least common was haemoptysis seen in 7.6% of patient. Common co-morbidities with MDR-TB found was anemia in 176 out of 474 (i.e.37.1%), 123(25.9%) COPD. Radiological severity showed 219(46.2%) moderate lesion, 139 (29.3%) mild, 107(22.6%) extensive lesion and 9(1.9%) normal, 312(65.8%) of patient are non-cavitory and 162 (34.2%) are cavitory in which 99 (20.9%) were unilateral and 63(13.3%) are bilateral cavitory lesion. Defaulter are most common accounting of 218(46.0%), relapse139 (29.3%) and failure 68 (14.3%), new 48 (10.2%), most of them had taken more than one episode of ATT (72.8%). Most common source of ATT taken by patient is RNTCP it accounts 424 (89.5%) and 46 (9.7%) from private. 181 out of 474 (38.2%) cases delayed the treatment for 1-7 days, 82 out of 474 (17.3%) cases delayed treatment for 8-10 days, 96 out of 474 (20.3%) cases delayed treatment for 11-19 days and 115 out of 474 delayed the treatment for more than 19 days. 95 out of 474 cases i.e. 20.1% cases come from more than 150 km away from their residing area for the initiation of treatment.The epidemiological picture of TB showed that males were predominant in our study however female were more affected in younger age group compared to male. More than 51% of the cases were in productive age group which affects the socioeconomic condition of family and society. More than 2/3 of patients were from lower socioeconomic group with low BMI. Therefore improving nutrition and  can play an important role. 2.3% of the cases were HIV reactive and were on ART. Co-morbidities like COPD and Diabetes were seen in our study which were statistically significant and had impact on the treatment outcome of results. Significant delay in initiation of MDR-TB regimen from date of DST was seen in 24.3% cases which is matter of concern. Most of the patients had taken ATT from RNTCP in which Defaulter and relapse was major contributor of MDR-TB suspect in our study and patient taking ATT privately were less. Large number of cases which resides more than 150 kilometers from DRTB center initiated the drug after a gap of more than 19 days from the date of DST.© Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028753>Human antigen presenting cells stimulated with Salmonella delivered influenza antigens induce cytokine production and proliferation of human CD4 T cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate whether the human antigen presenting cells (APCs) can process and present Salmonella expressing H7N9 hemagglutinin (Sal-HA), neuraminidase (Sal-NA) or  ectodomain (Sal-M2e) to T cells and subsequently activate CD4 T cell responses in vitro. In this study, APCs generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were first treated with mitomycin-C, followed by stimulation with Sal-HA, Sal-M2e, Sal-NA or Salmonella alone for 24 h. Subsequently, stimulated APCs were coincubated with untreated PBMCs (1:10) of the same individual for 24 or 72 h and then analysed for cytokine induction and T cell proliferations by qRT-PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Our results demonstrated that APCs stimulated with Sal-HA, Sal-M2e or Sal-NA induced significantly (p < .05) higher CD3CD4 T cell proliferations compared to the APCs treated with Salmonella alone. Our data further revealved that APCs treated with Sal-HA induced significantly (p < .05) higher CD3CD4 T cell responses compared to the APCs treated with either Sal-M2e or Sal-NA, which both induced almost comparable levels. The T cell proliferation responses were further measured by lymphocyte proliferation assay and the results showed that Sal-HA and Sal-M2e stimulated APCs induced significantly (p < .05) higher proliferations in T cells compared to the APCs stimulated with either Sal-NA or Salmonella alone. With respect to cytokine inductions, APCs treated with either Sal-HA or Sal-M2e induced significantly (p < .05) higher mRNA transcription levels of proinflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23), Th1 (IFN-γ), Th17 (IL-17 and IL-21) and Th2 (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines in T cells compared to Sal-NA or Salmonella alone treated APCs. In conclusion, we show that Salmonella system can efficiently deliver vaccine antigens to APCs and is, thus, capable to elicit heterologous antigen-specific adaptive .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The latter group of tumor responds better to treatment than the non-virally induced VSCC. This may be explained by a difference in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME).This review summarizes literature on TME of VSCC and its precursors, and extrapolates this to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies.Both types of VSCC and their precursors are infiltrated with variable numbers of  macrophages, regulatory T cells and CD8+ T cells, indicating that they express targetable tumor antigens. Type 1 T cell  in precursor lesions is associated with fewer recurrences and better clinical responses to immunotherapy. Escape of these lesions and progression toward VSCC is associated with the downregulation of HLA Class I, increased expression of co-inhibitory molecules, infiltration with immunosuppressive cells and the local production of immunosuppressive enzymes and cytokines. More in-depth studies of the VSCC TME are required to fully comprehend the impact of the immune system on VSCC, and subsequently to identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579932>Inflammatory macrophages switch to CCL17-expressing phenotype and promote peritoneal fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Peritoneal fibrosis remains a problem in kidney failure patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. Severe peritoneal fibrosis with encapsulation or encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is devastating and life-threatening. Although submesothelial fibroblasts as the major precursor of scar-producing myofibroblasts in animal models and  macrophage (Mϕ)-derived chemokines in peritoneal effluents of patients before diagnosis of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis have been identified, attenuation of peritoneal fibrosis is an unmet medical need partly because the mechanism for cross talk between Mϕs and fibroblasts remains unclear. We use a sodium hypochlorite-induced mouse model akin to clinical encapsulated peritoneal sclerosis to study how the peritoneal Mϕs activate fibroblasts and fibrosis. Sodium hypochlorite induces the disappearance of CD11b F4/80 resident Mϕs but accumulation of CD11b F4/80 inflammatory Mϕs (InfMϕs) through recruiting blood monocytes and activating local cell proliferation. InfMϕs switch to express chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17), CCL22 and arginase-1 from day 2 after hypochlorite injury. More than 75% of InfMϕs undergo genetic recombination by Csf1r-driven Cre recombinase, providing the possibility to reduce myofibroblasts and fibrosis by diphtheria toxin-induced Mϕ ablation from day 2 after injury. Furthermore, administration of antibody against CCL17 can reduce Mϕs, myofibroblasts, fibrosis and improve peritoneal function after injury. Mechanistically, CCL17 stimulates migration and collagen production of submesothelial fibroblasts in culture. By breeding mice that are induced to express red fluorescent protein in Mϕs and green fluorescence protein (GFP) in Col1a1-expressing cells, we confirmed Mϕs do not produce collagen in peritoneum before and after injury. However, small numbers of fibrocytes are found in fibrotic peritoneum of chimeric mice with bone marrow from Col1a1-GFP reporter mice, but they do not contribute to myofibroblasts. These data demonstrate that InfMϕs switch to pro-fibrotic phenotype and activate peritoneal fibroblasts through CCL17 after injury. CCL17 blockade in patients with peritoneal fibrosis may provide a novel therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

Its role in modifying anti-tumor  has been recently recognized. In this study, the biologic effects of STAT3 on immune checkpoint expression and anti-tumor responses were investigated in breast cancer (BC). A transcriptional signature of phosphorylated STAT3 was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in two independent cohorts of early BC. Pharmacologic inhibition and gene silencing of  led to decreased Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels in vitro, and resulted as well in reduction of tumor growth and decreased metastatic dissemination in a mammary carcinoma mouse model. The hampering of tumor progression was correlated to an anti-tumoral macrophage phenotype and accumulation of natural-killer cells, but also in reduced accrual of cytotoxic lymphocytes. In human BC, pro-tumoral macrophages correlated to PD-L1 expression, proliferation status and higher grade of malignancy, indicating a subset of patients with immunosuppressive properties. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for STAT3-mediated regulation of PD-L1 and modulation of immune microenvironment in BC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30233587>Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells Improve Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Through Regulating Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, a novel population of innate-like lymphocytes, have been involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, their role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the alterations of phenotype and immunological function of MAIT cells in NAFLD. Analysis of PBMCs in 60 patients with NAFLD and 48 healthy controls (HC) revealed that circulating MAIT cell frequency decreased in NAFLD, especially in the patients with higher serum levels of γ-glutamyl transferase or total triglyceride. Functional alterations of circulating MAIT cells were also detected in NAFLD patients, such as the increased production of IL-4 whereas the decreased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Furthermore, elevated expression of CXCR6 was observed in circulating MAIT cells of patients. Meanwhile, we found an increased number of MAIT cells in the livers of NAFLD, and the number was even greater in patients with higher NAFLD activity score. Moreover, activated MAIT cells induced monocytes/macrophages differentiation into  phenotype . Additionally, MAIT cells were enriched and displayed Th2 type cytokines profile in livers of wild type mice fed with methionine and choline deficient diet (MCD). Notably, mice deficient of MAIT cells exhibited more severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation upon MCD, accompanied with more CD11c proinflammatory macrophages (M1) and less CD206 anti-inflammatory macrophages () in livers. Our results indicate that MAIT cells protect against inflammation in NAFLD through producing regulatory cytokines and inducing anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, which may provide novel therapeutic strategies for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905817>Metabolic reprogramming of macrophages during infections and cancer.</a></h2><p>In response to different microenvironmental stimuli, macrophages are polarized into two populations, M1 macrophages which are classically activated by interferon (IFN)-γ with lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and  macrophages which are alternatively activated by interleukin-4 (IL-4), to perform specific roles in innate immune responses. Accordingly, macrophages occupy distinct metabolic profiles, regulated by orchestrated factors and signaling pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, HIF, c-Myc, AMPK, and PPARs pathways. These factors and pathways play pivotal roles not only in metabolic regulation but also in macrophage polarization. After activation, classically activated M1 macrophages and alternatively activated  macrophages display distinct patterns in glucose, lipid, amino acid and iron metabolism. Here, we summarized recently discovered metabolism-related inflammatory signaling factors, along with reprogrammed metabolism, after the activation of macrophages under conditions related to  and cancer.

A context-dependent spectrum of macrophage phenotypes are shown to affect tissue integration and performance of implanted biomaterials and medical devices. Recent studies by our group demonstrated that the host response in aged animals was characterized by delayed macrophage recruitment, differences in marker expression and a shifted pro-inflammatory (M1) response, associated with an unresolved host response in the long-term. The present work sought to study the effects of single and sequential cytokine delivery regimens in aged mice to restore delayed recruitment of macrophages and shift the inflammatory host response towards an -like phenotype, using MCP-1 (macrophage chemotactic protein-1) and IL-4 (interleukin-4), respectively. Implantation of cytokine-eluting implants showed a preserved response to MCP-1 in both young and aged animals, restoring delayed macrophage recruitment in aged mice. However, the response elicited by IL-4, sequential delivery of MCP-1/IL-4 and coating components was distinct in young versus aged mice. While single delivery of IL-4 did not counteract the high inflammatory response observed in aged mice, the sequential delivery of MCP-1/IL-4 was capable of restoring both recruitment and shifting the macrophage response towards an -like phenotype, associated with decreased implant scarring in the long-term. In young mice, sequential delivery was not as effective as IL-4 alone at promoting an -like response, but did result in a reduction of M1 macrophages and capsule deposition downstream. These results demonstrate that a proper understanding of patient/context-dependent biological responses are needed to design biomaterial-based therapies with improved outcomes in the setting of aging.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Both keratinocytes and macrophages play crucial roles in host defence against C. albicans. However, the interaction of keratinocytes with macrophages during C. albicans colonisation has not been well studied. In this study, macrophages were cultured in conditioned medium from keratinocytes treated with heat-inactivated C. albicans (CM-C. albicans), macrophage migration and polarised activation and were then assessed by a Transwell assay, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Western blot and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that CM-C. albicans-stimulated macrophages display significantly increased migration and phagocytosis, and they display an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin (IL)-12 and nitric oxide (NO)). Markers characteristic of M1 macrophages, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD86 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), are upregulated, whereas markers of  macrophages, such as mannose receptor (MR) and Arginase 1 (Arg1), are not affected. Additionally, the levels of TNF-a, IL-12 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) in CM-C. albicans are markedly upregulated, whereas the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 are not affected. And the CM-C. albicans-induced M1 macrophage polarisation, proinflammatory cytokine production and phagocytosis could be blocked by an anti-TNF-a neutralising antibody. This study showed that keratinocytes may promote macrophage recruitment and M1 polarisation during C. albicans colonisation at least in part by secreting TNF-a.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357820>Plasticity of antimicrobial and phagocytic programs in human macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophage (MΦ) polarization is triggered during the innate immune response to defend against microbial pathogens, but can also contribute to disease pathogenesis. In a previous study, we found that interleukin-15 (IL-15) -derived classically activated macrophages (M1 MΦ) have enhanced antimicrobial activity, whereas IL-10-derived alternatively activated macrophages ( MΦ) were highly phagocytic but lacked antimicrobial activity. Given that the ability to modulate MΦ polarization from  MΦ to M1 MΦ may promote a more effective immune response to infection, we investigated the plasticity of these MΦ programs. Addition of IL-10 to M1 MΦ induced -like MΦ, but IL-15 had little effect on  MΦ. We determined the set of immune receptors that are present on  MΦ, elucidating two candidates for inducing plasticity of  MΦ, Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) and interferonγ (IFN-γ) receptor 1. Stimulation of  MΦ with TLR2/1 ligand (TLR2/1L) or IFN-γ alone was not sufficient to alter  MΦ phenotype or function. However, co-addition of TLR2/1L and IFN-γ re-educated  MΦ towards the M1 MΦ phenotype, with a decrease in the phagocytosis of lipids and mycobacteria, as well as recovery of the vitamin-D-dependent antimicrobial pathway compared with  MΦ maintained in polarizing conditions. Similarly, treatment of  MΦ with both TLR2/1L and anti-IL-10 neutralizing antibodies led to polarization to the M1-like MΦ phenotype and function. Together, our data demonstrate an approach to induce MΦ plasticity that provides the potential for re-educating MΦ function in human mycobacterial disease to promote host defense and limit pathogenesis.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874397>[Role and progress of innate  in pathogenesis of osteoarthritis].</a></h2><p>To review and summarize the role and progress of innate  in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA).The domestic and foreign literature in recent years was reviewed.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effects of BBR in adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rats and its regulatory role in the polarization of macrophages. Rats were immunized with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), and then BBR (40, 80, 160 mg/kg) was administered orally for 14 days. BBR significantly reduced paw swelling and arthritis global assessment as well as alleviated joint destruction and inflammatory cell infiltration. The index of the thymus and thymocyte proliferation were significantly reduced by BBR. Moreover, BBR treatment restrained the phagocytic function of macrophages and restored the balance of M1/ by reducing the levels of M1 cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6), increasing the levels of  cytokines (interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β1), increasing the expression of arginase 1(Arg1) ( marker) and decreasing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (M1 marker). BBR also downregulated the ratio of Th17/Treg cells. Further research on the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway found that BBR upregulated the activity of AMPK, while it downregulated the expression of phospho-RelA (p-p65), phospho-NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (p-IκBα) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Therefore, our findings suggest BBR has significantly therapeutic effects in AA rats by regulating the polarization of macrophages through the AMPK/NF-кB pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Vaccination constitutes the primary approach for controlling influenza. Current influenza vaccines elicit a strain-specific response yet occasionally exhibit suboptimal effectiveness. This review describes the limits of available immunization tools and the future prospects and potentiality of universal influenza vaccines.New 'universal' vaccines, which are presently under development, are expected to overcome the problems related to the high variability of influenza viruses, such as the need for seasonal vaccine updates and re-vaccination. Here, we explore vaccines based on the highly conserved epitopes of the HA, NA, or extracellular domain of the influenza  protein, along with those based on the internal proteins such as NP and M1.The development of a universal influenza vaccine that confers protection against homologous, drifted, and shifted influenza virus strains could obviate the need for annual reformulation and mitigate disease burden.

In lean animals, adipose-resident leukocytes maintain an anti-inflammatory microenvironment that preserves the proper functioning of the tissue. In this review, we describe two populations of innate T cells enriched in adipose tissue, invariant NKT and γδ T cells, and how they serve overlapping and nonredundant roles in controlling adipose tissue functions. These cells interact with and expand anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells and  macrophages, thereby driving a metabolically beneficial tissue milieu. Surprisingly, we have found that adipose invariant NKT and γδ T cells also promote weight loss and heat production in a process called "nonshivering thermogenesis."

Bothropstoxin-I (BthTX-I) from Bothrops jararacussu is a K49-phospholipase A, involved in the injury and envenomation's inflammatory response. Immune system components act in the resolution of tissue damage and regeneration. Thus, macrophages exert a crucial role in the elimination of dead tissue and muscle repair. Here, we studied the cellular influx and presence of classical and alternative macrophages (M1 and ) during muscle injury induced by BthTX-I and the regeneration process. BthTX-I elicited intense inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil migration, then increased influx of M1 macrophages followed by  population that declined, resulting in tissue regeneration. The high expressions of TNF-α and IL6 were changed by increased TGF-β expression after BthTX-I injection, coinciding with the iNOs and arginase expression and the peaks of M1 and  macrophages in muscle tissue. A coordinated sequence of PAX7, MyoD, and myogenin expression involved in muscle regenerative process appeared after BthTX-I injection.

The saliva inoculated in this microenvironment modulates host hemostasis, inflammation and adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanisms involved in these biological activities remain poorly understood and few studies explored the potential roles of mosquito saliva on the individual cellular components of the immune system. Here, we report the immunomodulatory activities of Aedes aegypti salivary cocktail on murine peritoneal macrophages.The salivary gland extract (SGE) of Ae. aegypti inhibited the production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12, as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NF-κB by murine macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The spare respiratory capacity, the phagocytic and microbicidal activities of these macrophages were also reduced by Ae. aegypti SGE. These phenotypic changes are consistent with SGE suppressing the proinflammatory program of M1 macrophages. On the other hand, Ae. aegypti SGE did not influence -associated markers (urea production, arginase-1 and mannose receptor-1 expression), either in macrophages alternatively activated by IL-4 or in those classically activated by LPS plus IFN-γ. In addition, Ae. aegypti SGE did not display any cytokine-binding activity, nor did it affect macrophage viability, thus excluding supposed experimental artifacts.Given the importance of macrophages in a number of biological processes, our findings help to enlighten how vector saliva modulates vertebrate host .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30520029>CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer immunotherapy: A review.</a></h2><p>CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are preferred immune cells for targeting cancer.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), macrophage type 2 () cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) could make immunologic barriers against CD8  T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses. Thus, CD8  T cells are needed to be primed and activated toward effector CTLs in a process called tumor  cycle for making durable and efficient antitumor immune responses.

Upon activation, effector CTLs infiltrate to the core or invading site of the tumor (so-called infiltrated-inflamed [I-I] TME) and take essential roles for killing cancer cells.

Due to a diverse relation between CTLs with Tregs, the Treg activity could be dampened for increasing the number and rescuing the functional potential of CTLs to induce immunosensitivity of cancer cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231526>Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals defense responses against soft rot in Chinese cabbage.</a></h2><p> ssp.

In this study, plants harboring the resistant mutant  gene, which confers resistance against , were screened from an 800 M population mutated by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and scored in vitro and in vivo for lesion size. The transcript profiles showed ~512 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between  and WT plants occurring between 6 and 12 h postinoculation (hpi), which corresponded to the important defense regulation period (resistance) to  in Chinese cabbage.

They can either reduce tumor growth by secreting antitumorigenic factors or promote tumor progression by secreting a variety of soluble factors. The purpose of this study was to define the monocyte/macrophage population prevalent in skeletal tumors, explore a mechanism employed in supporting prostate cancer (PCa) skeletal metastasis, and examine a novel therapeutic target. Phagocytic CD68+ cells were found to correlate with Gleason score in human PCa samples, and -like macrophages (F4/80CD206) were identified in PCa bone resident tumors in mice. Induced -like macrophages in vitro were more proficient at phagocytosis (efferocytosis) of apoptotic tumor cells than M1-like macrophages. Moreover, soluble factors released from efferocytic versus nonefferocytic macrophages increased PC-3 prostate cancer cell numbers in vitro. Trabectedin exposure reduced -like (F4/80+CD206+) macrophages in vivo. Trabectedin administration after PC-3 cell intracardiac inoculation reduced skeletal metastatic tumor growth. Preventative pretreatment with trabectedin 7 days prior to PC-3 cell injection resulted in reduced -like macrophages in the marrow and reduced skeletal tumor size. Together, these findings suggest that -like monocytes and macrophages promote PCa skeletal metastasis and that trabectedin represents a candidate therapeutic target.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we demonstrate that chronic exposure of macrophages to insulin either in culture or in vivo in diet-induced, glucose-intolerant mice rendered them resistant to insulin signals marked by failure to induce Akt2 phosphorylation. Similarly, macrophages lacking Akt2 or IGF1 receptor were also resistant to insulin signals. Insulin-resistant macrophages had increased basal mTORC1 activity, possessed an -like phenotype, and reduced LPS responses. Moreover, they exhibited increased glycolysis and increased expression of key glycolytic enzymes. Inhibition of mTORC1 reversed the -like phenotype and suppressed glycolysis in insulin-resistant macrophages. In the context of polymicrobial sepsis, mice harboring insulin-resistant macrophages exhibited reduced sepsis-induced lung injury. Thus, macrophages obtain resistance to insulin characterized by increased glycolysis and a unique -like phenotype, termed M-insulin resistant, which accounts for obesity-related changes in macrophage responses and a state of trained .Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30327654>The G2A Receptor Controls Polarization of Macrophage by Determining Their Localization Within the Inflamed Tissue.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are highly versatile cells, which acquire, depending on their microenvironment, pro- (M1-like), or antiinflammatory (-like) phenotypes. Here, we studied the role of the G-protein coupled receptor G2A (GPR132), in chemotactic migration and polarization of macrophages, using the zymosan-model of acute inflammation. G2A-deficient mice showed a reduced zymosan-induced thermal hyperalgesia, which was reversed after macrophage depletion. Fittingly, the number of M1-like macrophages was reduced in the inflamed tissue in G2A-deficient mice. However, G2A activation was not sufficient to promote M1-polarization in bone marrow-derived macrophages. While the number of monocyte-derived macrophages in the inflamed paw was not altered, G2A-deficient mice had less macrophages in the direct vicinity of the origin of inflammation, an area marked by the presence of zymosan, neutrophil accumulation and proinflammatory cytokines. Fittingly neutrophil efferocytosis was decreased in G2A-deficient mice and several lipids, which are released by neutrophils and promote G2A-mediated chemotaxis, were increased in the inflamed tissue. Taken together, G2A is necessary to position macrophages in the proinflammatory microenvironment surrounding the center of inflammation. In absence of G2A the macrophages are localized in an antiinflammatory microenvironment and macrophage polarization is shifted toward -like macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429378>A nanoparticle-incorporated STING activator enhances antitumor  in PD-L1-insensitive models of triple-negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has few therapeutic options, and alternative approaches are urgently needed. Stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is becoming an exciting target for therapeutic adjuvants. However, STING resides inside the cell, and the intracellular delivery of CDNs, such as cGAMP, is required for the optimal activation of STING. We show that liposomal nanoparticle-delivered cGAMP (cGAMP-NP) activates STING more effectively than soluble cGAMP. These particles induce innate and adaptive host immune responses to preexisting tumors in both orthotopic and genetically engineered models of basal-like TNBC. cGAMP-NPs also reduce melanoma tumor load, with limited responsivity to anti-PD-L1. Within the tumor microenvironment, cGAMP-NPs direct both mouse and human macrophages (M), reprograming from protumorigenic -like phenotype toward M1-like phenotype; enhance MHC and costimulatory molecule expression; reduce  biomarkers; increase IFN-γ-producing T cells; augment tumor apoptosis; and increase CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Activated T cells are required for tumor suppression, as their depletion reduces antitumor activity. Importantly, cGAMP-NPs prevent the formation of secondary tumors, and a single dose is sufficient to inhibit TNBC. These data suggest that a minimal system comprised of cGAMP-NP alone is sufficient to modulate the tumor microenvironment to effectively control PD-L1-insensitive TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120725>Combining Nanomedicine and Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine holds significant potential to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Thus far, nanomedicines, i.e., 1-100(0) nm sized drug delivery systems, have been primarily used to improve the balance between the efficacy and toxicity of conjugated or entrapped chemotherapeutic drugs. The clinical performance of cancer nanomedicines has been somewhat disappointing, which is arguably mostly due to the lack of tools and technologies for patient stratification. Conversely, the clinical progress made with immunotherapy has been spectacular, achieving complete cures and inducing long-term survival in advanced-stage patients. Unfortunately, however, immunotherapy only works well in relatively small subsets of patients. Increasing amounts of preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that combining nanomedicine with immunotherapy can boost therapeutic outcomes, by turning "cold" nonimmunoresponsive tumors and metastases into "hot" immunoresponsive lesions. Nano-immunotherapy can be realized via three different approaches, in which nanomedicines are used (1) to target cancer cells, (2) to target the tumor immune microenvironment, and (3) to target the peripheral immune system. When targeting cancer cells, nanomedicines typically aim to induce immunogenic cell death, thereby triggering the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular patterns, such as calreticulin translocation, high mobility group box 1 protein and adenosine triphosphate. The latter serve as adjuvants to alert antigen-presenting cells to take up, process and present the former, thereby promoting the generation of CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Nanomedicines targeting the tumor immune microenvironment potentiate cancer immunotherapy by inhibiting immunosuppressive cells, such as -like tumor-associated macrophages, as well as by reducing the expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as transforming growth factor beta. In addition, nanomedicines can be employed to promote the activity of antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment. Nanomedicines targeting the peripheral immune system aim to enhance antigen presentation and cytotoxic T cell production in secondary lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, as well as to engineer and strengthen peripheral effector immune cell populations, thereby promoting anticancer . While the majority of immunomodulatory nanomedicines are in preclinical development, exciting results have already been reported in initial clinical trials. To ensure efficient translation of nano-immunotherapy constructs and concepts, we have to consider biomarkers in their clinical development, to make sure that the right nanomedicine formulation is combined with the right immunotherapy in the right patient. In this context, we have to learn from currently ongoing efforts in nano-biomarker identification as well as from partially already established immuno-biomarker initiatives, such as the Immunoscore and the cancer immunogram. Together, these protocols will help to capture the nano-immuno status in individual patients, enabling the identification and use of individualized and improved nanomedicine-based treatments to boost the performance of cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30287233>Effect of efferocytosis of apoptotic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on C57BL/6 peritoneal macrophages function.</a></h2><p>Phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (Efferocytosis) could affect the polarization of macrophages and promote  anti-inflammatory and regulatory phenotype and function.

In this study, Macrophages were incubated with apoptotic MSCs and after 48 h interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-alpha (TNFα), and nitric oxide (NO) production were measured. Furthermore, phagocytosis ability and arginase activity were analyzed. The results showed that apoptotic MSCs could reduce TNFα and NO production, and increase IL-10 levels. Moreover, arginase activity and phagocytosis ability were also increased in tested macrophages compared to controls.

We investigated the antigenic and immunogenic properties of tandem repeat M2e (5xM2e) proteins and virus-like particles (5xM2e VLP) to better understand how VLP and protein platform vaccines induce innate and protective adaptive immune responses. Despite the high antigenic properties of 5xM2e proteins, the 5xM2e VLP was superior to 5xM2e proteins in inducing IgG2a isotype antibodies, T cell responses, plasma cells and germinal center B cells as well as in conferring cross protection. Mice primed with 5xM2e VLP were found to be highly responsive to 5xM2e protein boost, overcoming the low immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 5xM2e proteins. Immunogenic differences between VLPs and proteins in priming immune responses might be due to an intrinsic ability of 5xM2e VLP to stimulate dendritic cells secreting T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines. We also found that 5xM2e VLP was effective in inducing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and in recruiting macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and CD11b⁺ dendritic cells at the injection site. Therefore, this study provides evidence that 5xM2e VLP is an effective vaccine platform, inducing cross-protection by stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246961>Influenza  virus-like particle vaccination enhances protection in combination with avian influenza HA VLPs.</a></h2><p>Despite the ability to induce a broad range of cross protection, M2e5x virus-like particles (VLPs) alone provide limited vaccine efficacy and confer low efficacy of protection against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection in chickens. Avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) has been a major antigenic target that enhances humoral immunity, but the efficacy of avian HA-based vaccines against HPAIV needs to be further improved. In this study, we evaluated the vaccine efficacy induced by combination of conserved tandem repeat M2e5x VLPs and HA VLPs against an avian influenza virus. We found that combinatorial vaccine elicited higher levels of reassortant H5N1 (rgH5N1) virus-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibody responses compared to M2e5x VLPs in sera and lungs of mice. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination induced higher levels of CD8+ T cell and germinal center B cell responses in lung and spleen compared to M2e5x VLPs. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination showed significantly reduced inflammatory responses and lung viral loads upon rgH5N1 virus challenge infection, resulting in less body weight loss compared to M2e5x VLPs alone. These results indicate that immune responses to both M2e and HA might provide a strategy of vaccination inducing enhanced protection against avian influenza virus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263276>The macrophage tetraspan MS4A4A enhances dectin-1-dependent NK cell-mediated resistance to metastasis.</a></h2><p>The plasma membrane tetraspan molecule MS4A4A is selectively expressed by macrophage-lineage cells, but its function is unknown. Here we report that MS4A4A was restricted to murine and human mononuclear phagocytes and was induced during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in the presence of interleukin 4 or dexamethasone. Human MS4A4A was co-expressed with /-like molecules in subsets of normal tissue-resident macrophages, infiltrating macrophages from inflamed synovium and tumor-associated macrophages. MS4A4A interacted and colocalized with the β-glucan receptor dectin-1 in lipid rafts. In response to dectin-1 ligands, Ms4a4a-deficient macrophages showed defective signaling and defective production of effector molecules. In experimental models of tumor progression and metastasis, Ms4a4a deficiency in macrophages had no impact on primary tumor growth, but was essential for dectin-1-mediated activation of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated metastasis control. Thus, MS4A4A is a tetraspan molecule selectively expressed in macrophages during differentiation and polarization, essential for dectin-1-dependent activation of NK cell-mediated resistance to metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261204>Investigation of tunable acetalated dextran microparticle platform to optimize M2e-based influenza vaccine efficacy.</a></h2><p>Influenza places a significant health and economic burden on society. Efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines can be suboptimal due to poor matching between vaccine and circulating viral strains. An influenza vaccine that is broadly protective against multiple virus strains would significantly improve vaccine efficacy. The highly conserved ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) and 3'3' cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) were selected as the antigen and adjuvant, respectively, to develop the basis for a potential universal influenza vaccine. The magnitude and kinetics of adaptive immune responses can have great impact on vaccine efficacy. M2e and cGAMP were therefore formulated within acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) microparticles (MPs) of varying degradation profiles to examine the effect of differential vaccine delivery on humoral, cellular, and protective . All Ace-DEX MP vaccines containing M2e and cGAMP elicited potent humoral and cellular responses in vivo and offered substantial protection against a lethal influenza challenge, suggesting significant vaccine efficacy. Serum antibodies from Ace-DEX MP vaccinated mice also demonstrated cross reactivity against M2e sequences of various viral strains, which indicates the potential for broadly protective . Of all the formulations tested, the slowest-degrading M2e or cGAMP MPs elicited the greatest antibody production, cellular response, and protection against a viral challenge. This indicated the importance of flexible control over antigen and adjuvant delivery. Overall, robust immune responses, cross reactivity against multiple viral strains, and tunable delivery profiles make the Ace-DEX MP platform a powerful subunit vaccine delivery system.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of ET in systemic anthrax is unclear. Efferocytosis is a cAMP-sensitive, anti-inflammatory process of apoptotic cell engulfment, the inhibition of which may promote sepsis in systemic anthrax. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ET inhibits efferocytosis by primary human macrophages and evaluated the mechanisms of altered efferocytic signaling. ET, but not PA or EF alone, inhibited the efferocytosis of early apoptotic neutrophils (PMN) by primary human  macrophages (polarized with IL-4, IL-10, and/or dexamethasone) at concentrations relevant to those encountered in systemic infection. ET inhibited Protein S- and MFGE8-dependent efferocytosis initiated by signaling through MerTK and αVβ5 receptors, respectively. ET inhibited Rac1 activation as well as the phosphorylation of Rac1 and key activating sites of calcium calmodulin-dependent kinases CamK1α, CamK4, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, that were induced by the exposure of (Dex) macrophages to Protein S-opsonized apoptotic PMN.

Although this peptide has limited potency and low immunogenicity, the degree of M2e density has been shown to be a critical factor influencing the magnitude of epitope-specific responses. The aim of this study was to design a chimer protein consisting of three tandem repeats of M2e peptide sequence fused to the Leishmania major HSP70 gene and evaluate its characteristics and immunogenicity. The structure of the deduced protein and its stability, aliphatic index, biocomputed half-life and the anticipated immunogenicity were analyzed by bioinformatics software. The oligonucleotides encoding 3M2e and chimer 3M2e-HSP70 were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified. The immunogenicity of the purified recombinant proteins was preliminary examined in mouse model. It was predicted that fusion of HSP70 to the C-terminal of 3M2e peptide led to increased stability, hydropathicity, continuous B cell epitopes and antigenic propensity score of chimer protein. Also, the predominant 3M2e epitopes were not hidden in the chimer protein. The initial in vivo experiment showed that 3M2e-HSP chimer protein stimulates specific immune responses.

M1 macrophages are thought to be tumoricidal, but some studies report its pro-tumor role. The programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L) 1 expressed in HCC cells is a critical checkpoint molecule to mediate immune escape of HCC. The PD-L1 expression in HCC cells is inducible. In the present study, we ask whether M1 macrophages induce the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells. First, an association between M1 macrophage infiltration and PD-L1 expression in HCC tissues was determined by bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry experiments. The enrichment score of M1 macrophages was correlated to PD-L1 expression in 90 HCC samples from GEO database. Besides, infiltration of CD68+HLA-DR+ M1-like macrophages correlated with PD-L1 expression level in HCC cells. Moreover, M1-conditioned media was prepared from M1 macrophages derived from THP-1 cell, RAW264.7 cell or murine bone marrow. These supernatants induced expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the supernatants was identified to account for the inducible PD-L1 expression by siRNA assay and receptor blockade assay. Additionally, transcription factor p65 and IRF1 in the HCC cells were revealed by CHIP assay to mediate the inducible PD-L1 expression.

Though the exact etiology of rosacea remains elusive, accumulating evidence has highlighted the dysfunction of innate  and inflammation in rosacea pathogenesis. Disintegrin Metalloprotease ADAM-like Decysin-1 (ADAMDEC1) is an orphan ADAM-like metalloprotease which is believed to be closely related to inflammation.

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed co-localization of ADAMDEC1 and macrophages in patient and mouse biopsies. In cellular experiment, the expression of ADAMDEC1 was prominently elevated in M1 but not  macrophages. Knocking down of ADAMDEC1 significantly blunted M1 polarization in macrophages induced from human monocytes and THP-1 cell lines. Furthermore, silencing of Adamdec1 in LL-37-induced mouse model also suppressed the expression of M1 signature genes such as IL-6, iNOS and TNF-α, resulting in attenuated rosacea-like phenotype and inflammation.

Selective targeting of TAMs holds great potential to ameliorate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapy.

In this study, conventional bare liposomes, PEGylated liposomes, and mannosylated liposomes were developed and the cytotoxicity, cellular internalization, immunostimulatory activity, targeting efficiency, antitumor efficacy, and mechanism were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  All liposomes displayed an ideal particle size, good biocompatibility, and controlled release behavior. Mannosylated liposomes exhibited superior in vitro cellular internalization and tumor spheroid penetration with the aid of the mannose receptor-mediated TAMs-targeting effects. In particular, mannosylated liposomes promoted the polarization of both M0 and  to the M1 phenotype by enhancing the expression ratio of CD86/CD206 in vitro. Of note, mannosylated liposomes could inhibit G422 glioma tumor growth, which may be attributed to the polarization of TAMs, as evidenced by the reduction in expression level of the TAMs surface marker.  These results indicate the potential value of mannosylated liposomes in the design of a rational delivery system to enhance the antitumor immune efficacy of immunomodulators by inducing a shift from the  to the M1 phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180669>Long-Time Instead of Short-Time Exposure in Vitro and Administration in Vivo of Ochratoxin A Is Consistent in Immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium, contaminating in a wide variety of foods and feeds. Mycotoxins, including OTA, could cause immunosuppression in almost all previous studies in vivo. However, the vast majority of results in vitro showed that mycotoxins caused immunostimulation. Why the results of studies in vitro are contrary to studies in vivo is unknown. Our study aims to explore the underlying reason and mechanism of the paradoxical effect. In this study, porcine alveolar macrophage cell line 3D4/21 was chosen as an in vitro model and treated with 1.0 μg/mL OTA for different times. Some indexes, such as expression of inflammatory cytokines, migration, phagocytosis, macrophage polarization, autophagy-related proteins, and Akt1 phosphorylation, were detected. The results showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, migration, and phagocytosis were increased, with macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype at 24 h of OTA exposure. Surprisedly, anti-inflammatory cytokine expression was increased, cell phagocytosis and migration were decreased, and macrophage polarization was switched from M1 to  at 72 h of OTA exposure. Furthermore, we found that long-time exposure of OTA also suppressed autophagy, and the autophagy activator blocked the OTA-induced immunosuppression. Phosphorylation of Akt1 plays a positive role in autophagy inhibition. In conclusion, long-time instead of short-time exposure of OTA in vitro induced immunosuppression. The immunosuppression mechanism of OTA in vitro involved inhibition of autophagy through upregulating p-Akt1. Our results provide new insight into research on the mechanism of mycotoxin-induced immunosuppression in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604929>Influenza A virus  protein triggers mitochondrial DNA-mediated antiviral immune responses.</a></h2><p>Cytosolic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) activates cGAS-mediated antiviral immune responses, but the mechanism by which RNA viruses stimulate mtDNA release remains unknown. Here we show that viroporin activity of influenza virus  or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B protein triggers translocation of mtDNA into the cytosol in a MAVS-dependent manner. Although influenza virus-induced cytosolic mtDNA stimulates cGAS- and DDX41-dependent innate immune responses, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus associates with mtDNA to evade the STING-dependent antiviral . The STING-dependent antiviral signaling is amplified in neighboring cells through gap junctions. In addition, we find that STING-dependent recognition of influenza virus is essential for limiting virus replication in vivo. Our results show a mechanism by which influenza virus stimulates mtDNA release and highlight the importance of DNA sensing pathway in limiting influenza virus replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307695>Remodeling Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Neovascularization Overcomes EGFR -Associated Drug Resistance by PD-L1 Nanobody-Mediated Codelivery.</a></h2><p>Precision medicine has made a significant breakthrough in the past decade. The most representative success is the molecular targeting therapy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic drivers, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as first-line therapeutics for substituting chemotherapy. However, the rapidly developed TKI resistance invariably leads to unsustainable treatment. For example, gefitinib is the first choice for advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation, but most patients would soon develop secondary EGFR mutation and acquire gefitinib resistance. TKI resistance is a severe emergency issue to be solved in NSCLC, but there are a few investigations of nanomedicine reported to address this pressing problem. To overcome EGFR -associated drug resistance, a novel delivery and therapeutic strategy is developed. A PD-L1 nanobody is identified, and first used as a targeting ligand for liposomal codelivery. It is found that simvastatin/gefitinib combination nanomedicine can remodel the tumor microenvironment (e.g., neovascularization regulation, -macrophage repolarization, and innate ), and display the effectiveness of reversing the gefitinib resistance and enhancing the EGFR -mutated NSCLC treatment outcomes. The novel simvastatin-based nanomedicine provides a clinically translatable strategy for tackling the major problem in NSCLC treatment and demonstrates the promise of an old drug for new application.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present study, MVAIK/RSV/F and MVAIK/RSV/NP were simultaneously administered to cotton rats and immune responses and protective effects were compared with MVAIK/RSV/F alone. Sufficient neutralizing antibodies against RSV and RSV-specific CD8⁺/IFN-γ⁺ cells were observed after re-immunization with simultaneous administration. After the RSV challenge, CD8⁺/IFN-γ⁺ increased in spleen cells obtained from the simultaneous immunization group in response to F and NP peptides. Higher numbers of CD8⁺/IFN-γ⁺ and CD4⁺/IFN-γ⁺ cells were detected in lung tissues from the simultaneous immunization group after the RSV challenge. No detectable RSV was recovered from lung homogenates in the immunized groups.

Nevertheless, the role of PG2 in the modulation of anticancer immunogenicity and therapeutic response remains relatively underexplored and unclear.The present study investigates how and to what extent PG2 modulates cellular and biochemical components of the inflammatory cascade and enhances anticancer , as well as the therapeutic implication of these bio-events in patients with lung cancer.Herein, we demonstrated that PG2 significantly increased the M1/ macrophage polarization ratio in non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) H441 and H1299 cells. This PG2-induced preferential pharmacologic up-regulation of tumoral M1 population in vitro positively correlated with the downregulation of tumor-promoting IL-6 and IL-10 expression in NSCLC cell-conditioned medium, with concomitant marked inhibition of cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorsphere formation. Our ex vivo results, using clinical sample from our NSCLC cohort, demonstrated that PG2 also promoted the functional maturation of DCs with consequent enhancement of T cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. Consistent with the in vitro and ex vivo results, our in vivo studies showed that treatment with PG2 elicited significant time-dependent depletion of the tumor-associated  population, synergistically enhanced the anti--based anticancer effect of cisplatin, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in the NSCLC mice models. Moreover, in the presence of PG2, cisplatin-associated dyscrasia and weight-loss was markedly suppressed.These results do indicate a therapeutically-relevant role for PG2 in modulating the M1/ macrophage pool, facilitating DC maturation and synergistically enhancing the anticancer effect of conventional chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, thus laying the foundation for further exploration of the curative relevance of PG2 as surrogate immunotherapy and/or clinical feasibility of its use for maintenance therapy in patients with lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761134>Regulation of Type 2  in Myocardial Infarction.</a></h2><p>Type 2  participates in the pathogeneses of helminth infection and allergic diseases.

WSD-induced adipose inflammation might result from endoplasmic reticulum stress in lipid-overloaded adipocytes and/or dissemination of gut bacterial products, resulting in activation of innate immune signaling. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota, and its detection by innate immune signaling pathways, in WSD-induced adipose inflammation.Mice were fed grain-based chow or a WSD for 8 weeks, assessed metabolically, and intestinal and adipose tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Microbiota was ablated via antibiotics and use of gnotobiotic mice that completely lacked microbiota (germ-free mice) or had a low-complexity microbiota (altered Schaedler flora). Innate immune signaling was ablated by genetic deletion of Toll-like receptor signaling adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response 88.Ablation of microbiota via antibiotic, germ-free, or altered Schaedler flora approaches did not significantly impact WSD-induced adiposity, yet dramatically reduced WSD-induced adipose inflammation as assessed by macrophage populations and cytokine expression. Microbiota ablation also prevented colonic neutrophil and CD103 dendritic cell infiltration. Such reduced indices of inflammation correlated with protection against WSD-induced dysglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and liver dysfunction. Genetic deletion of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 also prevented WSD-induced adipose inflammation.These results indicate that adipose inflammation, and some aspects of metabolic syndrome, are not purely a consequence of diet-induced adiposity per se but, rather, may require disturbance of intestine-microbiota interactions and subsequent activation of innate .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

M1 macrophages are typically activated by lipopolysaccharide and produce proinflammatory cytokines. Conversely,  macrophages are activated by stimulation with interleukin 4 (IL)-4 and promote tissue remodeling and anti-inflammatory reactions. Recently, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of inflammation. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a PUFA, has anti-inflammatory effects on chronic inflammatory disease, but its role in macrophage polarization remains unclear. In this study, we clarified the effects of DHA on macrophage polarization using U937 cells. Treatment with DHA resulted in upregulation of  macrophage markers and increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines by U937 cells. IL-4, but not DHA, triggered phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). DHA enhanced the expression of krüppel-like factor-4 (KLF4), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization and increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK downregulated the expression of CD206 in DHA-treated U937 cells. Moreover, inhibitors of autophagy suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and the expression of CD206 in DHA-treated U937 cells. Expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, which is involved in autophagosome formation, was enhanced in DHA-treated U937 cells. Taken together, these results indicated that DHA enhanced the expression of  macrophage markers through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and autophagy, suggesting that DHA regulates  macrophage polarization and plays an important role in innate .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075351>Recombinant live attenuated influenza vaccine viruses carrying CD8 T-cell epitopes of respiratory syncytial virus protect mice against both pathogens without inflammatory disease.</a></h2><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory disease in young children, elderly and immunocompromised adults.

However, the involvement of innate  regulation in inflammation resolution and liver regeneration in DILI remains obscure. Herein, we identified the chemokine CCL5 as a central mediator of innate  regulation in the pathogenesis of DILI. First, we showed that serum and hepatic CCL5 levels are elevated in both DILI patients and an APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) mouse model. Interestingly, both nonparenchymal cells and stressed hepatocytes are cell sources of CCL5 induction in response to liver injury. Functional experiments showed that CCL5 deficiency has no effect on the early phase of AILI but promotes liver repair in the late phase mainly by promoting inflammation resolution and liver regeneration, which are associated with an increased number of hepatic  macrophages. Mechanistically, CCL5 can directly activate M1 polarization and impede  polarization through the CCR1- and CCR5-mediated activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. We then showed that CCL5 inhibition mediated by either a CCL5-neutralizing antibody or the antagonist Met-CCL5 can greatly alleviate liver injury and improve survival in an AILI mouse model. Our data demonstrate CCL5 induction during DILI, identify CCL5 as a novel innate  regulator in macrophage polarization, and suggest that CCL5 blockage is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DILI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797066>A novel CC chemokine ligand 2 like gene from ayu Plecoglossus altivelis is involved in the innate immune response against to Vibrio anguillarum.</a></h2><p>Chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), is one of the key chemokines that regulate migration and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages (MO/MФ) in mammals. However, the functional repertoire of fish CCL2 remains unclear. Here, we identified a cDNA sequence encoding a novel CCL2-like protein (PaCCL2L) in ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis. Sequence analysis revealed that PaCCL2L grouped with CCL2 homologs, and is most closely related to Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) homologs. PaCCL2 transcripts were expressed in all tested tissues from healthy ayu, with the highest level in the spleen. Upon Vibrio anguillarum infection, PaCCL2L transcripts increased significantly in tested tissues, including the liver, spleen, and head kidney. We then produced the recombinant PaCCL2L mature peptide (rPaCCL2L) by prokaryotic expression and generated the corresponding antibodies (anti-PaCCL2L). A significant increase in PaCCL2L protein and mRNA expression was observed in ayu MO/MФ following V. anguillarum challenge. Intraperitoneal injection of rPaCCL2L resulted in significantly improved survival and reduced tissue bacterial load in V. anguillarum-infected ayu. rPaCCL2L had a positive effect on the chemotaxis of MO/MΦ and neutrophils both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, rPaCCL2L exhibited a positive effect on the chemotaxis of LPS-stimulated MO/MΦ (M1 type) in vitro, whereas it exhibited no chemotaxis effect on cAMP-stimulated MO/MΦ ( type). In addition, rPaCCL2L treatment exhibited an enhanced effect on MO/MΦ phagocytosis, bacterial killing, respiratory burst, and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas anti-PaCCL2L treatment had an inhibitory effect. Our study demonstrates that PaCCL2L might play a role in the immune response of ayu against V. anguillarum infection through chemotactic recruitment and activation of MO/MΦ.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 105 recently weaned Angus x Hereford calves (75 steers and 30 heifers), originating from eight cow-calf operations, were obtained from an auction facility on day -2 and road transported (800 km; 12 h) to the experimental facility. Immediately after arrival on day -1, shrunk BW was recorded and calves were grouped with free-choice access to grass hay, mineral supplement, and water. On day 0, calves were ranked by sex, source, and shrunk BW, and allocated to one of 21 pens (5 calves/pen; being one or two heifers within each pen). Pens were assigned to receive a total mixed ration (TMR) and one of three treatments (as-fed basis): (1) 1 g/calf daily of MA (M1; n = 7), (2) 2 g/calf daily of MA (; n = 7), or (3) no MA supplementation (CON; n = 7). Calves received the TMR to yield 15% (as-fed basis) orts, and treatments were top-dressed from days 0 to 59. Calves were assessed for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) signs and TMR intake was recorded for each pen daily. Calves were vaccinated against BRD pathogens on days 0 and 21. Final shrunk BW was recorded on day 60, and blood samples were collected on days 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, 21, 28, 34, 45, and 59. ADG was greater (P = 0.03) in  vs. M1 and CON (1.53, 1.42, and 1.42 kg/day, respectively), and similar (P = 0.95) between M1 and CON calves. No treatment effects were detected for TMR intake (P = 0.52), whereas feed efficiency was greater (P ≤ 0.05) in  vs. M1 and CON calves (213, 200, and 204 g/kg, respectively) and similar (P = 0.40) between M1 and CON calves.

Gut microbiota is a key regulator of neurological inflammation. Nurturing with prebiotics is an effective microbiota manipulation that can regulate host  and cognition. The aim of the present study was to test whether administration of the prebiotic Bimuno® (galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS) mixture) could ameliorate POCD and attenuate surgery-induced neuroinflammation through the microbiota-brain-axis.Adult rats undergoing abdominal surgery under isoflurane anesthesia were fed with water or prebiotic B-GOS supplementation (15 g/L) for 3 weeks. Novel objective recognition task was employed for testing cognitive changes on postoperative day three. Expression of microglial marker Iba-1 in the hippocampus was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression levels of phenotypic gene markers of activated microglia (M1: iNOS, CD68, CD32; : Ym1, CD206, and SOCS3) in hippocampus were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Feces were collected for microbial community analysis.Rats exhibited an impairment in novel objective recognition 3 days after surgery compared with control rats (P < .01). In the hippocampus, expressions of Iba-1 and M1 markers of surgical rats were significantly upregulated. Similarly, expressions of SOCS3 and CD206 in the hippocampus were upregulated. Additionally, increasing levels of IL-6 and IL-4 were evident in the hippocampus. Administration of B-GOS significantly alleviated cognitive decline induced by surgery (P < .01). B-GOS-fed rats showed a significantly downregulated activation of microglia and expressions of M1-related genes and SOCS3 and IL-6.

Using quantitative proteomics, we identified that exosomes produced by hypoxic tumor cells are highly enriched in immunomodulatory proteins and chemokines including CSF-1, CCL2, FTH, FTL, and TGFβ. Modeling exosome effects on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, we observed a potent ability of these hypoxia-induced vesicles to influence macrophage recruitment and promote -like polarization both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, hypoxic, but not normoxic, tumor exosomes enhanced oxidative phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived macrophages via transfer of let-7a miRNA, resulting in suppression of the insulin-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

The viral M1 mRNA encodes the M1 matrix protein and is alternatively spliced into the  mRNA, which is translated into the  ion channel. These proteins have key functions in viral trafficking and budding. To uncover the NS1-BP structural and functional activities in splicing and nuclear export, we performed proteomics analysis of nuclear NS1-BP binding partners and showed its interaction with constituents of the splicing and mRNA export machineries. NS1-BP BTB domains form dimers in the crystal. Full-length NS1-BP is a dimer in solution and forms at least a dimer in cells. Mutations suggest that dimerization is important for splicing. The central BACK domain of NS1-BP interacts directly with splicing factors such as hnRNP K and PTBP1 and with the viral NS1 protein. The BACK domain is also the site for interactions with mRNA export factor Aly/REF and is required for viral M mRNA nuclear export. The crystal structure of the C-terminal Kelch domain shows that it forms a β-propeller fold, which is required for the splicing function of NS1-BP. This domain interacts with the polymerase II C-terminal domain and SART1, which are involved in recruitment of splicing factors and spliceosome assembly, respectively.

Humans fail to make a universally protective memory response to influenza A because of high mutation rates in the immune-dominant influenza epitopes. We seek the development of a universal influenza A vaccine. The extracellular domain of the -ion channel (M2e) is an ideal antigenic target, as it is highly conserved, has a low mutation rate, and is essential for viral entry and replication. Considering the potential of a universal influenza vaccine for lifelong protection, we aimed to examine this potential using a recently published gold nanoparticle M2e vaccine with CpG as an adjuvant (AuNP-M2e + sCpG). Intranasal vaccination induces an M2e-specific memory response, which is protective against lethal infection with H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 serotypes, in young BALB/c mice. Protection with AuNP-M2e + sCpG has been published up to 8 months after vaccination. However, the highest risk population during most influenza seasons is adults over 65 years old. Additionally, the efficacy of many vaccines decrease after aging and requiring booster vaccinations to remain effective.To determine if the AuNP-M2e + sCpG vaccine is a viable option as a universal vaccination capable of protection through geriatric age, we tested if the AuNP-M2e + sCpG vaccination loses efficacy after aging mice to geriatric age (over 18 months). Our data shows that mice aged 15 months after vaccination (~ 18-21 months old) retain significant M2e-specific antibody titers in total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b. These mice are significantly protected from lethal influenza challenge (H1N1, 8.3 PFU). Further, these antibody titers increase upon infection with influenza A and remain elevated for 3 months, suggesting the elderly mice retain effective M2e-specific memory B cells.Our results demonstrate that protective M2e-specific memory in mice developed at a young age can persist until geriatric age. Additionally, this memory is protective and M2e-specific B cells produced by vaccination with AuNP-M2e + sCpG are maintained and functional. If the results of this study persist in humans, they suggest that a universal influenza A vaccine could be administered early in life and maintain lifelong protection into geriatric age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30416507>The Pro-tumorigenic IL-33 Involved in Antitumor : A Yin and Yang Cytokine.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-33 (IL-33), considered as an alarmin released upon tissue stress or damage, is a member of the IL-1 family and binds the ST2 receptor. First described as a potent initiator of type 2 immune responses through the activation of T helper 2 (T2) cells and mast cells, IL-33 is now also known as an effective stimulator of T1 immune cells, natural killer (NK) cells, iNKT cells, and CD8 T lymphocytes. Moreover, IL-33 was shown to play an important role in several cancers due to its pro and anti-tumorigenic functions. Currently, IL-33 is a possible inducer and prognostic marker of cancer development with a direct effect on tumor cells promoting tumorigenesis, proliferation, survival, and metastasis. IL-33 also promotes tumor growth and metastasis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and inducing angiogenesis. IL-33 favors tumor progression through the immune system by inducing  macrophage polarization and tumor infiltration, and upon activation of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) or regulatory T cells. The anti-tumor functions of IL-33 also depend on infiltrated immune cells displaying T1 responses. This review therefore summarizes the dual role of this cytokine in cancer and suggests that new proposals for IL-33-based cancer immunotherapies should be considered with caution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685658>Enhancing the cross protective efficacy of live attenuated influenza virus vaccine by supplemented vaccination with  ectodomain virus-like particles.</a></h2><p>Current influenza vaccines including live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) provide suboptimal protection against drift and potential pandemic strains. We hypothesized that supplementing LAIV with a highly conserved antigenic target  ectodomain (M2e) would confer cross-protection by inducing humoral and cellular immune responses to conserved antigenic targets. Intranasal vaccination with LAIV (A/Netherlands/602/09, H1N1) supplemented with tandem repeat M2e containing virus-like particles (M2e5x VLP) induced M2e- and virus-specific antibodies. Upon heterosubtypic virus challenge, M2e5x VLP-supplemented LAIV vaccination of mice induced significantly improved cross protection by preventing weight loss and lowering lung viral titers. Further mechanistic studies on heterosubtypic  suggest that T cell responses to M2e and nucleoprotein as well as systemic and mucosal antibodies to M2e and viruses might be contributing to cross protection. Therefore, this study demonstrates a novel vaccination strategy to improve the cross protective efficacy of LAIV by supplementing with a conserved M2e antigenic target.Copyright © 2019.

Recent studies established obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) as NAFLD risk factors. Studies have ascertained that CIH is independently related to NAFLD. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) shows inconsistent results regarding its efficacy in improving NAFLD. Observational, longer duration CPAP therapy studies have shown positive outcomes, whereas shorter duration, randomized controlled trials have shown no benefit. A multifaceted approach to NAFLD management with sufficiently longer duration of CPAP therapy may be beneficial in patients with moderate to severe OSA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Maternal blood samples were also collected. Study B: data from previously-tested samples of TAs collected from preterm newborn infants were re-analyzed in the light of the findings in the new cohort.Study A: 39 preterm newborn infants were studied. A moderate correlation emerged between maternal WBCs and neutrophils and those of their newborn in the first 3 days of life. WBCs and neutrophils correlated in the newborn during the first 8 days of life. Decision rules based on birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) can be used to predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neutrophil levels were lower in the TAs from the newborn with the lowest GAs and BWs. Study B: after removing the effect of GA on BPD development, previously-tested newborn were matched by GA. Monocyte phenotype 1 (Mon1) levels were lower in the blood of newborn with BPD, associated with a higher ratio of Monocyte phenotype 3 (Mon3) to Mon1. Newborn infants from mothers with histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) had lower levels of classically-activated macrophages (M1) and higher levels of alternatively-activated macrophages () in their TAs than newborn infants from healthy mothers.Immune cell behavior in preterm newborn infants was examined in detail. Surprisingly, neutrophil levels were lower in TAs from the newborn with the lowest GA and BW, and no correlation emerged between the neutrophil and NET levels in TAs and the other variables measured. Interestingly, monocyte phenotype seemed to influence the onset of BPD. The rise in the ratio of Mon 3 to Mon 1 could contribute to endothelial dysfunction in BPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630452>Vaccine protection against Murid Herpesvirus-4 is maintained when the priming virus lacks known latency genes.</a></h2><p>γ-herpesviruses establish latent infections of lymphocytes and drive their proliferation, causing cancers and motivating a search for vaccines. Effective vaccination against Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4)-driven lymphoproliferation by latency-impaired mutant viruses suggests that lytic access to the latency reservoir is a viable target for control. However the vaccines retained the immunogenic MuHV-4  latency gene.

This protection was maintained also when the vaccine virus lacked both episome maintenance and the genomic region encompassing M1, , M3, M4 and ORF4. Therefore protection did not require  to known MuHV-4 latency genes. As the remaining vaccine virus genes have clear homologs in human γ-herpesviruses, this approach of deleting viral latency genes could also be applied to them, to generate safe and effective vaccines against human disease.© 2019 Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701767>Features of the functional activity of macrophage link of  with gastroesophageal reflux disease depending on the type of reluctate: in vitro model.</a></h2><p>A generalized analysis of changes in functional activity of macrophages on the basis of phagocytic activity, cytokine profile, changes in the level of expression of surface markers characteristic of pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotype of the cells when exposed to reluctate.Developed in vitro model of co-peritoneal macrophages of mice With57/BL6 (n=65) and reluctate patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; n=65) having different pH values (three group comparison). Took into account the standard criteria phagocytic ability (absorption Staphylococcus aureus 9198, light microscopy), secretory activity (cytokine profile Th1/Th2, flow cytometry) and receptor characterization of macrophages (expression of CD25/80/163/206, flow cytometry).The phagocytic activity of macrophages, calculated on the basis of the average number of bacteria ingested by one phagocyte, is not associated with the pH value of the added reluctate. It is established that the alkalinisation of reluctate leads to significant alteration in the expression of CD receptors - decrease M1 and increase . The index of total production of Th1/Тһ2 in groups progressively decreased with increasing pH of reluctate and amounted to 3.6 units in the group pH from 4.6 to 6.6; 2.8 units group a pH of 6.7-7.2 and 1.6 units in the group pH of 7.3 to 8.1, due to increased production of Th2 cytokines at offset reluctate pH to slightly alkaline side.

SSc-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) represents a common and early complication, being the leading cause of mortality. Monocytes/macrophages seem to have a key role in SSc-related ILD. Interestingly, the classically (M1) and alternatively () activated monocyte/macrophage phenotype categorization is currently under revision. Our aim was to evaluate if circulating monocyte/macrophage phenotype could be used as biomarker for lung involvement in SSc. To this purpose we developed a wide phenotype characterization of circulating monocyte/macrophage subsets in SSc patients and we evaluated possible relations with lung involvement parameter values.A single centre cross-sectional study was performed in fifty-five consecutive SSc patients, during the year 2017. All clinical and instrumental tests requested for SSc follow up and in particular, lung computed tomography (CT) scan, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), Doppler echocardiography with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) measurement, blood pro-hormone of brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) evaluation, were performed in each patient in a maximum one-month period. Flow cytometry characterization of circulating cells belonging to the monocyte/macrophage lineage was performed using specific M1 (CD80, CD86, TLR2 and TLR4) and  surface markers (CD204, CD163 and CD206). Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis.A higher percentage of circulating CD204CD163CD206TLR4CD80CD86 and CD14CD206CD163CD204TLR4CD80CD86 mixed M1/ monocyte/macrophage subsets, was identified to characterize patients affected by SSc-related ILD and higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Mixed M1/ monocyte/macrophage subset showed higher percentages in patients positive for anti-topoisomerase antibody, a known lung involvement predictor.The present study shows for the first time, through a wide flow cytometry surface marker analysis, that higher circulating mixed M1/ monocyte/macrophage cell percentages are associated with ILD, sPAP and anti-topoisomerase antibody positivity in SSc, opening the path for research on their possible role as pathogenic or biomarker elements for SSc lung involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334477>Cytokines produced by innate immune cells in IgG4-related disease.</a></h2><p>IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly defined multi-organ disease proposed by Japanese physicians.

How oncogenic signaling in GBM cells modulates the composition of the tumor microenvironment and its activation is unclear. We aimed to explore the potential local immunoregulatory function of ERK1/2 signaling in GBM. Using proteomic and transcriptomic data (RNA seq) available for GBM tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that GBM with high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 have increased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with a non-inflammatory  polarization. Using three human GBM cell lines in culture, we confirmed the existence of ERK1/2-dependent regulation of the production of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2/MCP1. In contrast with this positive regulation of TAM recruitment, we found no evidence of a direct effect of ERK1/2 signaling on two other important aspects of TAM regulation by GBM cells: (1) the expression of the immune checkpoint ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, expressed at high mRNA levels in GBM compared with other solid tumors; (2) the production of the tumor metabolite lactate recently reported to dampen tumor  by interacting with the receptor GPR65 present on the surface of TAM. Taken together, our observations suggest that ERK1/2 signaling regulates the recruitment of TAM in the GBM microenvironment. These findings highlight some potentially important particularities of the immune microenvironment in GBM and could provide an explanation for the recent observation that GBM with activated ERK1/2 signaling may respond better to anti-PD1 therapeutics.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741586>Influenza  protein regulates MAVS-mediated signaling pathway through interacting with MAVS and increasing ROS production.</a></h2><p>Influenza A virus can evade host innate immune response that is involved in several viral proteins with complicated mechanisms.

Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that autophagy regulates innate  by affecting M1/ polarization of microglia/macrophages. However, the role of interleukin-4 in microglial autophagy is unknown. In view of this, BV2 microglia were treated with 0, 10, 20 or 50 ng/mL interleukin-4 for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Subsequently, light chain 3-II and p62 protein expression levels were detected by western blot assay. BV2 microglia were incubated with interleukin-4 (20 ng/mL, experimental group), 3-methyladenine (500 μM, autophagy inhibitor, negative control group), rapamycin (100 nM, autophagy inductor, positive control group), 3-methyladenine + interleukin-4 (rescue group), or without treatment for 24 hours, and then exposed to amyloid-β (1 μM, model group) or vehicle control (control) for 24 hours. LC3-II and p62 protein expression levels were again detected by western blot assay. In addition, expression levels of multiple markers of M1 and  phenotype were assessed by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while intracellular and supernatant amyloid-β protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed that interleukin-4 induced microglial autophagic flux, most significantly at 20 ng/mL for 48 hours. Interleukin-4 pretreated microglia inhibited blockade of amyloid-β-induced autophagic flux, and promoted amyloid-β uptake and degradation partly through autophagic flux, but inhibited switching of amyloid-β-induced M1 phenotype independent on autophagic flux. These results indicate that interleukin-4 pretreated microglia increases uptake and degradation of amyloid-β in a process partly mediated by autophagy, which may play a protective role against Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524429>Distinct Migratory Properties of M1, , and Resident Macrophages Are Regulated by αβ and αβ Integrin-Mediated Adhesion.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is essential mechanism during the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The outcome of diseases depends on the balance between the migration/accumulation of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory () macrophages in damaged tissue. The mechanism of macrophage migration and subsequent accumulation is still not fully understood. Currently, the amoeboid adhesion-independent motility is considered essential for leukocyte migration in the three-dimensional environment. We challenge this hypothesis by studying the contribution of leukocyte adhesive receptors, integrins αβ, and αβ, to three-dimensional migration of M1-polarized, -polarized, and resident macrophages. Both integrins have a moderate expression on  macrophages, while αβ is upregulated on M1 and αβ demonstrates high expression on resident macrophages. The level of integrin expression determines its contribution to macrophage migration. Namely, intermediate expression supports macrophage migration, while a high integrin density inhibits it. Using  three-dimensional migration and  tracking of adoptively-transferred fluorescently-labeled macrophages during the resolution of inflammation, we found that strong adhesion of M1-activated macrophages translates to weak 3D migration, while moderate adhesion of -activated macrophages generates dynamic motility. Reduced migration of M1 macrophages depends on the high expression of αβ, since α-deficiency decreased M1 macrophage adhesion and improved migration in fibrin matrix and peritoneal tissue. Similarly, the high expression of αβ on resident macrophages prevents their amoeboid migration, which is markedly increased in α-deficient macrophages. In contrast, α- and α-knockouts decrease the migration of  macrophages, demonstrating that moderate integrin expression supports cell motility. The results were confirmed in a diet-induced diabetes model. α deficiency prevents the retention of inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue and improves metabolic parameters, while α deficiency does not affect macrophage accumulation. Summarizing, β integrin-mediated adhesion may inhibit amoeboid and mesenchymal macrophage migration or support mesenchymal migration in tissue, and, therefore, represents an important target to control inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30265772>Microenvironmental signals govern the cellular identity of testicular macrophages.</a></h2><p>Testicular macrophages (TM) comprise the largest immune cell population in the mammalian testis. They are characterized by a subdued proinflammatory response upon adequate stimulation, and a polarization toward the immunoregulatory and immunotolerant  phenotype. This enables them to play a relevant role in supporting the archetypical functions of the testis, namely spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. During infection, the characteristic blunted immune response of TM reflects the need for a delicate balance between a sufficiently strong reaction to counteract invading pathogens, and the prevention of excessive proinflammatory cytokine levels with the potential to disturb or destroy spermatogenesis. Local microenvironmental factors that determine the special phenotype of TM have just begun to be unraveled, and are discussed in this review.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308853>FuFangChangTai Decoction Activates Macrophages via Inducing Autophagy.</a></h2><p>The traditional Chinese medicine decoction FuFangChangTai (FFCT) has been used in the therapy of colon cancer clinically, yielding alleviated toxicity and enhanced . In our previous study, FFCT exerted its antitumor activity not only by inducing apoptosis but also by activating autophagy to eliminate tumor cells. However, its mechanism is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between macrophages activation and FFCT-induced autophagy. Results showed that FFCT could induce autophagy in colon cancer, as demonstrated by increased level of intracellular autophagy marker LC3 II in CT26.WT cells by fluorescence microscope and western blot assay. FFCT also facilitated numbers of vesicular bodies with bilayer membrane in CT26.WT cells, which were indicative of autophagosomes formation. Autophagosomes secreted by FFCT-treated CT26.WT cells can activate M1 type macrophages, accompanied with increased expression of costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 on the surface of RAW264.7 cells, and more inflammatory cytokines secretion, such as TNF-, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1. mRNA expressions of  macrophages markers, such as IL-10, CD206, Arg-1, and FIZZ-1, were downregulated. And this process helps regulate the polarization of macrophages and promote the immune response.

Macrophages undergo classical M1 pro-inflammatory or alternative  anti-inflammatory activation in response to tissue microenvironmental signals. These subsets of macrophages are characterised by their expression of cell surface markers, secreted cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional regulation is central to the polarisation of macrophages, and several major pathways have been described as essential to promote the expression of specific genes, which dictate the functional polarisation of macrophages.

These findings suggest that incorporating vitamin D into medical devices or scaffolds could positively modulate host immune response and prevent infections. In the current study, we evaluated host responses and endogenous antimicrobial peptide production using 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)-eluting radially aligned PCL nanofiber scaffolds in human immune system-engrafted mice. We transformed traditional 2D electrospun nanofiber membranes into radially aligned PCL nanofiber scaffolds using the concept of solid of revolution and an innovative gas-foaming technique. Such scaffolds can promote rapid cellular infiltration and neovascularization. The infiltrating immune cells within subcutaneously implanted 25(OH)D-containing scaffolds mainly consisted of human macrophages in the M1 phase (CCR7), mice macrophages in the  phase (CD206), and human cytotoxic T cells (CD8) other than few human T-helper cells (CD4). The 25(OH)D-eluting nanofiber scaffolds significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), while accelerating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) within the scaffolds. Additionally, we observed increased expression of human cathelicidin LL-37 within the 25(OH)D-eluting scaffolds, while no LL-37 expression was observed in the control. Together, these findings support further work in the design of vitamin D-eluting medical devices or scaffolds for modulating immune response and promoting antimicrobial peptide production. This could potentially reduce the inflammatory response, prevent infections, and eventually improve success rates of implants. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Transplant failure of medical devices, grafts, scaffolds, and tissue-engineered constructs due to inflammation and infection causes not only economic losses but also sufferings of second operation to the patient. Positive modulation of the host response to implants, scaffolds, and tissue-engineered constructs is likely to reduce the failure rate. Vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the immune response. It is able to not only reduce inflammation and induce endogenous antimicrobial peptide production but also prevent multidrug resistance and other side effects of traditional antibiotics. In this study, host responses to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)-eluting radially aligned PCL nanofiber scaffolds were evaluated in human immune system-engrafted mice. The 25(OH)D-eluting medical devices or scaffolds were able to modulate positive immune response and promote antimicrobial peptide production. This work presented an innate -enhancing approach for reducing the inflammatory response and preventing infections, likely resulting in improvement of success rates of implants.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

Alpha-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a synthetic glycolipid is presented to natural killer T (NKT) cells by most antigen-presenting cells through CD1d molecules leading to activation of NKT cells. However, the precise mechanisms of how α-GalCer-activated NKT regulate the polarization of the macrophages and effector T cells in the solid tumor are not studied adequately.We induced solid tumor in C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous injection of B16F10 cell line (1 X 10 cells) and monitored the tumor growth. Animals were given an intraperitoneal injection of α-GalCer (2 μg/injection) in 200 μl PBS on day + 1, + 5, + 10, + 15, and + 20 (with respect to tumor cell injection). Immune cells were characterized using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. NK cells, Gr1 cells, and F4/80 macrophages in the mice were depleted by intravenous injection of cell-specific antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA.Our results showed that intratumoral NKT cells have a lower frequency of CD69, CD25, CD122, and IFN-γR expression; produced less inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GM-CSF; higher frequency CD62L NKT cells; and also showed reduced proliferation as compared to the splenic NKT cells. Mice treated with α-GalCer showed a significantly increased frequency of IFN-γ-producing NKT cells, CD8 T cells, and effector Th1 cells. Depletion of NK cells in α-GalCer-treated mice showed a lower frequency of IFN-γ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in the tumor and prevented the α-GalCer-induced tumor growth. NKT cell activation with α-GalCer treatment significantly increased the iNOSCD206 M1-macrophages and reduced the iNOSCD206 -macrophages in the spleen and tumor, and depletion of F4/80 macrophages prevented the α-GalCer-induced reduction in the tumor growth.We showed that activation of NKT cell with α-GalCer modulates the frequency of M1-macrophages and effector Th1 cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues and tumor microenvironment and inhibit tumor growth. The finding suggests that activation of NKT cells with α-GalCer may provide an effective anti-cancer outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611307>Serum amyloid A-mediated inflammasome activation of microglial cells in cerebral ischemia.</a></h2><p>Serum Amyloid A (SAA) proteins are acute-phase reactant associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and that increase in the plasma 1000-fold during inflammation. Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate  and various disorders, however the precise mechanism eludes us. Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemiand our studies demonstrated that SAA deficient mice reduces inflammation and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3 which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose and time dependent fashion. Inhibition or knockout of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. -acetyl--cysteine and mito-TEMPO blocked the induction of IL-1β by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) with SAA treatment. In addition, inhibition of cathepsin B with different drugs or microglia from CatB deficient mice attenuated inflammasome activation. Our studies suggest that the impact of SAA on inflammasome stimulation is mediated in part by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor proteins 2 and 4. SAA induced inflammatory cytokines and an M1 phenotype in the microglial cells, while downregulating anti-inflammation  phenotype. These studies suggest that brain injury to can elicit a systemic inflammatory response mediated through SAA that contributes to the pathological outcomes.In the present study, SAA can induce that activation of the inflammasome in microglial cells and give rise to IL-1β release which can further inflammation in the brain following neurological diseases.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CHI3L1 and airway inflammation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.We measured YKL-40 levels in human nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory symptoms. Wild-type (WT) and BRP-39 knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with live RSV (A2 strain). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples were obtained on day 7 after inoculation to assess lung inflammation, airway reactivity, and expression of cytokines and BRP-39.In human subjects, YKL-40 and IL-13 levels in NPA were higher in children with RSV infection than in control subjects. Expression of BRP-39 and Th2 cytokines, IL-13 in particular, was increased following RSV infection in mice. Airway inflammation caused by RSV infection was reduced in BRP-39 KO mice as compared to WT mice. Th2 cytokine levels were not increased in the lungs of RSV-infected BRP-39 KO mice.

The effects of HyE-Ov were tested on human monocyte derived dendritic cells (DC), type-1 (M1) and type-2 macrophages () infected with M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), used as a model of persistent intracellular bacterium. DC, M1 and  treated with HyE-Ov significantly enhanced their mycobactericidal activity, which was associated with phagosomal acidification in M1 and  and increase of phagosomal, but not mitochondrial ROS production in M1, , and DC. Treatment of BCG-infected DC with HyE-Ov significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-12 production and increased TGF-β synthesis. Finally, experiments were repeated using eight different HPLC fractions of HyE-Ov. Results showed that the capability to activate anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory response is shared by different fractions, suggesting that diverse bioactive molecules are present within the hydroalcoholic extract. Altogether, these results show that HyE-Ov promotes anti-mycobacterial innate  and limits inflammatory response in vitro and suggest that this plant extract may be exploitable as phytocomplex or nutraceutical for novel host-directed therapeutic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231396>miRNAs Involved in M1/ Hyperpolarization Are Clustered and Coordinately Expressed in Alcoholic Hepatitis.</a></h2><p>The innate immune system, including monocytes/macrophages, is critical to the progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In response to chronic ethanol, Kupffer cells, the resident macrophage of livers, and peripheral monocytes become sensitized to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), express more pro-inflammatory cytokines and exhibit macrophage M1/ hyperpolarization. Since miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of M1/ polarization, we hypothesized that miRNAs regulating macrophage polarization would be dysregulated after chronic ethanol consumption. miRNA sequencing data from Kupffer cells isolated from rats fed an ethanol diet vs. control diet and qPCR data from PBMCs isolated from alcoholic hepatitis (AH) patients and healthy controls were used to assess the role of miRNAs in macrophage hyperpolarization in ALD. Differential expression analyses revealed 40 misregulated miRNAs in Kupffer cells from the chronic ethanol-fed rats compared to pair-fed controls. Nine of these miRNAs are known to be associated with macrophage polarization and consist of a mixture of M1- and -associated miRNAs, indicative of hyperpolarization. Twenty-three of the 40 differentially expressed miRNAs were localized to miRNA clusters throughout the genome. Correlation analyses revealed that miRNAs in three of these clusters were co-regulated and located within antisense non-coding RNAs. Similar to Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats, M1 and  polarization markers, as well as sensitivity to LPS, were elevated in PBMCs from AH patients compared to healthy controls. These increases were associated with an up-regulation of polarization-associated miRNAs, including miR-125a-5p, a miRNA associated with hyperpolarization. miR-125a-5p is clustered in the genome with other miRNAs inside a host gene, Spaca6, which was also upregulated in PBMCs, as well as isolated monocytes, from AH patients. Finally, correlation analyses revealed co-regulation of human polarization-associated miRNA clusters. While expression of polarization-associated miRNAs in clusters was upregulated in AH compared to healthy controls, co-regulation of the miRNAs within a cluster was independent of disease state. Together, these results reveal that global changes in miRNA regulation are associated with polarization phenotypes in Kupffer cells from rat after chronic ethanol as well as in PBMCs from patients with AH. Importantly, polarization-associated miRNAs were localized to coordinately regulated clusters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775350>Vaccine containing G protein fragment and recombinant baculovirus expressing  protein induces protective  to respiratory syncytial virus.</a></h2><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, asthma, and bronchiolitis in infants and elderly or immunocompromised individuals. An RSV vaccine has yet to be developed; only prophylactic anti-RSV antibody is commercially available. So, we investigated whether our vaccine candidate is able to induce type 1 CD4 T helper (Th1), CD8 T-cell responses, and protective  without vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) against RSV.We used RSV G protein fragment (Gcf A) with recombinant baculovirus capable of expressing the RSV  protein (Bac ) as a vaccine candidate, and injected this vaccine (Gcf A/Bac ) intramuscularly, and challenged with RSV intranasally into mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, plaque assay, and weight measurement were performed to confirm humoral , cellular , and protective .The Gcf A/Bac  formulation induced a stronger IgG response to Gcf A than Gcf A inoculation alone, and the ratio of IgG1/IgG2a indicated that the responses shifted predominantly to Th1. In addition, both RSV G-specific Th1 responses and RSV -specific CD8 T-cell responses were induced, and G protein-associated eosinophilic infiltration was suppressed compared to the control group. Moreover, the Gcf A/Bac  group showed effective protection after an RSV challenge.Bac  could serve as a vaccine with intrinsic adjuvant activity, and the Gcf A/Bac  shows promise as a vaccine candidate for inducing protective  without inciting VED.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743162>Prognostic Value of Macrophage Phenotypes in Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Assessed by Multiplex Immunohistochemistry.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are important inflammatory cells that regulate innate and adaptive  in cancer. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are thought to differentiate into two main phenotypes: proinflammatory M1 and protumorigenic . Currently, the prognostic impact of TAMs and their M1 and  phenotypes is unclear in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). The present study was set up to evaluate an approach for identifying common M1 and  macrophage markers and explore their clinical significance in NSCLC. Using multiplex chromogenic immunohistochemistry, tissue microarrays of 553 primary tumors and 143 paired metastatic lymph nodes of NSCLC specimens were stained to detect various putative macrophage phenotypes: M1 (HLA-DR/CD68),  (CD163/CD68),  (CD204/CD68), and pan-macrophage (CD68/CK). Correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between TAMs and adaptive/innate immune infiltrates. HLA-DR/CD68M1 TAM level significantly decreased from pathological stage I to III. In a compartment-specific correlation analysis, moderate to strong correlations were observed between both TAM subsets (M1 and ) with CD3-, CD8-, CD4-, and CD45RO-positive immune cells. Survival analyses, in both stromal and intratumoral compartments, revealed that high levels of HLA-DR/CD68M1 (stroma, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, P = .03; intratumor, HR = 0.7, P = .04), CD204 (stroma, HR = 0.7, P = .02; intratumor, HR = 0.6, P = .004), and CD68 (stroma, HR = 0.69, P = .02; intratumor, HR = 0.73, P = .04) infiltration were independently associated with improved NSCLC-specific survival. In lymph nodes, the intratumoral level of HLA-DR/CD68M1 was an independent positive prognostic indicator (Cox model, HR = 0.38, P = .001). In conclusion, high levels of M1, CD204, and CD68 macrophages are independent prognosticators of prolonged survival in NSCLC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mice with Treg cell-restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cell types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T cell secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty acid synthesis in immunosuppressive (-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained -like TAM metabolic fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival. SREBP1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that targeting Treg cells or their modulation of lipid metabolism in -like TAMs could improve cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In murine models of obesity, there is a shift in the inflammatory profile of the AT immune cells, with an accumulation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages that surround the expanding adipocyte. However, much less is known about the immune cell composition and how to best define AT macrophages in humans. . The goals of the current study were to determine the contribution of macrophages to the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in lean versus obese human visceral AT (VAT); examine the expression of common M1, , and pan macrophage markers; and determine the association of specific macrophage types with known biomarkers of obesity-related cardiometabolic disease. . VAT biopsies were obtained from obese ( = 50) and lean ( = 8) patients during elective surgery. Adipocytes and SVF were isolated, and the SVF was subjected to flow cytometry analyses. . Our results indicate that VAT macrophages are increased in obesity and associate with biomarkers of CVD but that many macrophages do not fall into currently defined M1/ classification system based on CD206 receptor expression levels. . VAT macrophages are increased in obese subjects, but the current markers used to define macrophage populations are inadequate to distinguish differences in human obesity. Further studies are needed to delineate the function of AT macrophages in the maintenance and progression of human AT inflammation in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537061>A Photoresponsive Hyaluronan Hydrogel Nanocomposite for Dynamic Macrophage Immunomodulation.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a predominant immune cell population that drive inflammatory responses and exhibit transitions in phenotype and function during tissue remodeling in disease and repair. Thus, engineering an immunomodulatory biomaterial has significant implications for resolving inflammation. Here, a biomimetic and photoresponsive hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel nanocomposite with tunable 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion sites for dynamic macrophage immunomodulation is engineered. Photodegradative alkoxylphenacyl-based polycarbonate (APP) nanocomposites are exploited to permit user-controlled Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) adhesive peptide release and conjugation to a HA-based ECM for real-time integrin activation of macrophages encapsulated in 3D HA-APP nanocomposite hydrogels. It is demonstrated that photocontrolled 3D ECM-RGD peptide conjugation can activate αvβ3 integrin of macrophages, and periodic αvβ3 integrin activation can enhance anti-inflammatory  macrophage polarization. Altogether, an emerging use of biomimetic, photoresponsive, and bioactive HA-APP nanocomposite hydrogel is highlighted to command 3D cell-ECM interactions for modulating macrophage polarization, which may shed light on cell-ECM interactions in innate  and inspire new biomaterial-based immunomodulatory therapies.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

They participate in the phagocytosis of biomaterial-derived particles, angiogenesis, recruitment of fibroblasts, and formation of granulation tissues. Most macrophage functions are achieved through the release of various cytokines and chemokines; the release profile of cytokines is dependent on the phenotype of macrophages, namely proinflammatory M1 or antiinflammatory . M1 and  macrophages coexist during an inflammatory phase, and the M1/ ratio is considered to be an important factor for wound-healing or tissue regeneration. This ratio depends on the chemical and physical properties of biomaterials. To obtain a favorable foreign body reaction to biomaterials, the phenotypes of the macrophages can be modulated by cytokines, antibodies, small chemicals, and microRNAs. Geometrical surface fabrication of biomaterials can also be used for modulating the phenotype of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178859>Macrophage Polarization: Different Gene Signatures in M1(LPS+) vs. Classically and (LPS-) vs. Alternatively Activated Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are found in tissues, body cavities, and mucosal surfaces. Most tissue macrophages are seeded in the early embryo before definitive hematopoiesis is established. Others are derived from blood monocytes. The macrophage lineage diversification and plasticity are key aspects of their functionality. Macrophages can also be generated from monocytes  and undergo classical (LPS+IFN-γ) or alternative (IL-4) activation. , macrophages with different polarization and different activation markers coexist in tissues. Certain mouse strains preferentially promote T-helper-1 (Th1) responses and others Th2 responses. Their macrophages preferentially induce iNOS or arginase and have been called M1 and , respectively. In many publications, M1 and classically activated and  and alternatively activated are used interchangeably. We tested whether this is justified by comparing the gene lists positively [M1(=LPS+)] or negatively [(=LPS-)] correlated with the ratio of  and  in transcriptomes of LPS-treated peritoneal macrophages with  classically (LPS, IFN-γ) vs. alternatively activated (IL-4) bone marrow derived macrophages, both from published datasets. Although there is some overlap between  M1(=LPS+) and  classically activated (LPS+IFN-γ) and  (=LPS-) and  alternatively activated macrophages, many more genes are regulated in opposite or unrelated ways. Thus, M1(=LPS+) macrophages are not equivalent to classically activated, and (=LPS-) macrophages are not equivalent to alternatively activated macrophages. This fundamental discrepancy explains why most surface markers identified on  generated macrophages do not translate to the  situation. Valid  M1/ surface markers remain to be discovered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261069>Presence of increased inflammatory infiltrates accompanied by activated dendritic cells in the left atrium in rheumatic heart disease.</a></h2><p>Left atrial (LA) structural remodelling develops in rheumatic heart disease (RHD) according to the disease severity of the mitral valve and the presence of atrial fibrillation. Sustained active inflammation has been previously reported in the LA of patients with RHD, suggesting a direct role of cell-mediated  in the pathogenesis of LA remodelling. Dendritic cells (DCs) have a major antigen-presenting role, and are known as crucial modulators of innate and adaptive . We investigated whether DCs are involved in the pathogenesis of LA remodelling in RHD.Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using antibodies to CD11c, CD209 and CD80 as markers of myeloid DCs, migratory-active DCs, mature DCs and infiltrated inflammatory cells including T lymphocytes (CD3) and M1 (CD68; pro-inflammatory profile) and  (CD163; pro-resolution profile) macrophages. Furthermore, tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that appears during ECM remodelling and inflammatory response, was examined. Infiltrated myeloid DCs, migratory-active DCs, mature DCs and other inflammatory infiltrates including T lymphocytes and M1 and  macrophages, were significantly higher in the RHD group than the non-RHD group. The positive area fraction for tenascin-C was significantly higher in the RHD group than in the non-RHD group.Our histological findings suggest that inflammation may persist long after a bout of rheumatic fever, ultimately leading to ECM remodelling. We identified and quantitatively assessed several subsets of DCs and other immunocompetent cells, and our results indicated that activation of DCs has some role in persistence of LA inflammation in patients with chronic RHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30508092>Metformin induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of an osteosarcoma: implications for metabolic reprogramming of myeloid cells and anti-tumor effects.</a></h2><p>CD11b+ myeloid subpopulations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), play crucial roles in the suppression of T-cell-mediated anti-tumor . Regulation of these cell types is a primary goal for achieving efficient cancer immunotherapy. We found that metformin (Met) induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of a K7M2neo osteosarcoma independent of T cells, as growth inhibition of K7M2neo was still observed in wild-type (WT) mice depleted of T cells by antibodies and in SCID; this contrasted with the effect of Met on Meth A fibrosarcoma, which was entirely T-cell-dependent. Moreover, the inhibitory effect seen in SCID was abrogated by anti-CD11b antibody injection. PMN-MDSCs were significantly reduced in both spleens and tumors following Met treatment. In TAMs, production of IL-12 and TNF-α, but not IL-10, became apparent, and elevation of MHC class II with reduction of CD206 was observed, indicating a shift from an - to M1-like phenotype via Met administration. Metabolically, Met treatment decreased basal respiration and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratio of CD11b+ cells in tumors, but not in the spleen. In addition, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and proton leakage in MDSCs and TAMs were consistently observed in tumors. Uptake of both 2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (2-NBDG) and BODIPY® decreased in MDSCs, but only BODIPY® incorporation was decreased in TAMs. Overall, our results suggest that Met redirects the metabolism of CD11b+ cells to lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) while elevating glycolysis, thereby pushing the microenvironment to a state that inhibits the growth of certain tumors.© The Author(s) 2018.

Polarized macrophages exhibit various levels of plasticity when /M(IL-4) macrophages are reprogrammed into an M1-like phenotype following treatment with IFNγ and/or LPS. At the same time, M1 macrophages are resistant to reprogramming in the presence of -like stimuli. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the macrophages polarization, plasticity of  macrophages, and lack of plasticity in M1 macrophages remain unknown. Here, we explored the role of Egr2 in the induction and maintenance of macrophage M1 and  polarization in the mouse  and  models of inflammation. Egr2 knockdown with siRNA treatment fail to upregulate either M1 or  markers upon stimulation, and the overexpression of Egr2 potentiated M1 or  marker expression following polarization. Polarisation with -like stimuli (IL-4 or IL-13) results in increased Egr2 expression, but macrophages stimulated with M1-like stimuli (IFNγ, LPS, IL-6, or TNF) exhibit a decrease in Egr2 expression. Egr2 was critical for the expression of transcription factors CEBPβ and PPARγ in  macrophages, and CEBPβ was highly expressed in M1-polarized macrophages. In siRNA knockdown studies the transcription factor CEBPβ was found to negatively regulate Egr2 expression and is likely to be responsible for the maintenance of the M1-like phenotype and lack plasticity. During thioglycolate-induced peritonitis, adoptively transferred macrophages with Egr2 knockdown failed to become activated as determined by upregulation of MHC class II and CD86. Thus, our study indicates that Egr2 expression is associated with the ability of unstimulated or  macrophages to respond to stimulation with inflammatory stimuli, while low levels of Egr2 expression is associated with non-responsiveness of macrophages to their activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738089>Highly immunogenic influenza virus-like particles containing B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) for multi-subtype vaccine development.</a></h2><p>Virus-like particle (VLP) technology is an attractive platform for the development of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Influenza VLPs can be obtained by the overexpression of HA, M1, NA, and/or  viral proteins in insect, mammalian, or plant cells. In this study, we reported to obtain highly immunogenic influenza VLPs by molecular incorporation with B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) or proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Since BAFF and APRIL act as homotrimers to interact with their receptors, we engineered the VLPs by direct fusion of BAFF or APRIL to the transmembrane anchored domain of H5HA gene. Results showed that immunizations with the HA-transmembrane anchored BAFF- or APRIL-VLPs only formulated in alum but not MPL adjuvant elicited significantly higher IgG titers in sera. However, only the BAFF-VLPs formulated in alum adjuvant elicited more broadly neutralizing antibodies against the homologous and two heterologous H5N1 clade/subclade viruses and conferred protective  against live virus challenges. As the multi-subtype influenza vaccines containing a variety of HA subtypes can confer broader protective , we also obtained multi-subtype H5H7 BAFF-VLPs and H1H5H7 BAFF-VLPs and demonstrated that these multi-subtype BAFF-VLPs were able to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against multiple HA subtypes. Our findings provided useful information for the development of highly immunogenic, multi-subtype influenza VLP vaccines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Macrophages are broadly classified into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, and  macrophages, which have selective anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic activities and are able to induce immunotolerance and angiogenesis. Based on these elements, the aim of our study was to evaluate CD14CD68CD197CD80 M1 and CD14CD68CD163CD206  macrophages in tissue samples from ovarian endometriomas of women affected by endometriosis at different stages of the disease. For each patient, we collected a biological sample of the cyst (ovarian endometriomas for cases and ovarian functional cyst for controls) during laparoscopy. We found that the number of both M1 and  macrophages was significantly higher in endometriosis group than controls, regardless of stage ( < .0001 for each stage versus controls). Moreover, our data analysis shows a trend in progressive decrease of M1 macrophages from stage I to stage IV; on the contrary,  macrophages show a specular trend compared to M1 macrophages, with a progressive increase from stage I to stage IV. This may contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the early stages of the disease, and to the pro-fibrotic activity of the advanced stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382053>[The Influence of , Nutrition, and Physical Function on the Onset of Pneumonia after Colorectal Cancer Resection].</a></h2><p>Four hundred and nineteen patients with colorectal cancer who underwent laparotomy were included in this study.

However, the effectiveness of these viruses depends significantly on their interactions with the host immune responses, both innate (e.g., macrophages, which accumulate in high numbers inside solid tumours) and adaptive (e.g., [Formula: see text] T cells). In this article, we consider a mathematical approach to investigate the possible outcomes of the complex interactions between two extreme types of macrophages (M1 and  cells), effector [Formula: see text] T cells and an oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), on the growth/elimination of B16F10 melanoma. We discuss, in terms of VSV, [Formula: see text] and macrophages levels, two different types of immune responses which could ensure tumour control and eventual elimination. We show that both innate and adaptive anti-tumour immune responses, as well as the oncolytic virus, could be very important in delaying tumour relapse and eventually eliminating the tumour. Overall this study supports the use mathematical modelling to increase our understanding of the complex immune interaction following oncolytic virotherapies.

In this study, we examined changes in the phagocytic response and chemokine production of resident peritoneal macrophages after mice had been housed under EE conditions for 6 or 8 weeks, and then explored the possibility that EE could cause a change in the macrophage phenotype by means of flow cytometry as well as quantitative RT-PCR. The percentages of EE macrophages phagocytosing S. aureus and apoptotic neutrophils were significantly larger than those of standard environment (SE) macrophages. After coculturing with S. aureus, EE macrophages tended to produce greater amounts of chemokines such as MIP-2, KC and MCP-1 than SE ones, although the increases for MIP-2 and KC were not statistically significant. As compared with SE macrophages, EE macrophages included more CD40-positive cells (M1 marker), and expressed more mRNAs of IL-6 (M1 marker) and IRF4 ( marker), and less mRNA of CD38 (M1 marker), suggesting either the possibility that EE macrophages are a mixed population of M1 and  macrophages or the possibility that they are a unique population with a mixed M1 and  macrophage phenotype.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, given the fundamental differences between mice and humans in tumor evolution, genetic heterogeneity, and , the function of MMLCs might be different in human tumors, especially during early stages of disease. Here, we studied MMLCs in early-stage human lung tumors and found that they consist of a mixture of classical tissue monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The TAMs coexpressed M1/ markers, as well as T cell coinhibitory and costimulatory receptors. Functionally, TAMs did not primarily suppress tumor-specific effector T cell responses, whereas tumor monocytes tended to be more T cell inhibitory. TAMs expressing relevant MHC class I/tumor peptide complexes were able to activate cognate effector T cells. Mechanistically, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on bystander TAMs, as opposed to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells, did not inhibit interactions between tumor-specific T cells and tumor targets. TAM-derived PD-L1 exerted a regulatory role only during the interaction of TAMs presenting relevant peptides with cognate effector T cells and thus may limit excessive activation of T cells and protect TAMs from killing by these T cells. These results suggest that the function of TAMs as primarily immunosuppressive cells might not fully apply to early-stage human lung cancer and might explain why some patients with strong PD-L1 positivity fail to respond to PD-L1 therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

We show here that macrophage polarization is deregulated in haemophilia in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and partially in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). As a result, haemophilia macrophages exhibit a specific impairment of M-CSF-mediated functions involved in wound healing such as clot invasion and phagocytosis. Haemophilia monocytes express reduced amounts of the receptors for M-CSF and GM-CSF, which correlates with a failure to express tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and CD163 in M-CSF-treated haemophilia macrophages and reduced expression of TNFα and CD206 after treatment with GM-CSF. Protein expression in response to M-CSF was regained with respect to CD163 and CD206 after embedding haemophilia monocytes in clotted plasma suggesting that a functioning coagulation system has positive effects on macrophage  polarization. Mimicking the functional deficits of haemophilia macrophages in normal macrophages was possible by adding leptin, which we found to be elevated in the blood of haemophilia patients, to a monocyte cell line. The increase of leptin occurred in conjunction with C-reactive protein in a body mass index-controlled cohort suggesting that haemophilia patients harbour chronic low-grade inflammation. Together, our data indicate that impaired clotting in haemophilia patients leads to increased inflammation and a deregulation in macrophage differentiation, which may explain the commonly observed deficits in wound healing and tissue regeneration.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218741>The human RNASET2 protein affects the polarization pattern of human macrophages in vitro.</a></h2><p>Macrophages represent key inflammatory cellular effectors of the innate immune response. Despite being widely acknowledged as professional phagocytes, the functional roles played by these cells have been progressively widened over the years to encompass regulation of the adaptive immune system, stimulation or suppression of cancer cell growth and tissue remodeling. These diverse functional features have led to the concept of "macrophage plasticity", i.e. the ability of these cells to express a wide range of phenotypes endowed with different functional roles. Several activation programs have been described for mammalian macrophages, based mainly on their differential transcriptional profiles. Based on established in vitro experimental conditions, many researchers currently refer to the M1 (or M1-like) and  (or -like) terms to describe the two extremes of a rather broad spectrum of polarization states that macrophages can experience in vivo. In light of the widely recognized opposite roles of M1-like and -like macrophages on cancer growth, and our largely incomplete knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of the M1-like versus -like balance within a tumor mass, we report here results from in vitro assays pointing at the human RNASET2 gene as a potential regulator of the balance between M1-like/-like macrophage polarization. Not only do our results confirm previous in vivo data, thus further supporting a role for this pleiotropic protein in the innate immune system, but they also define RNASET2 as a new molecular target with potential applications for in vivo reprogramming of macrophage polarization, an increasingly appraised anticancer strategy.Copyright © 2018 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Inflammation is closely correlated with , the same immune cell populations contributing to both inflammation and immune response. In the PDAC microenvironment, the inflammatory cell infiltrate is unbalanced towards an immunosuppressive phenotype, with a prevalence of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC),  polarized macrophages, and T, over M1 macrophages, dendritic cells, and effector CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T lymphocytes. The dynamic and continuously evolving cross-talk between inflammatory and cancer cells might be direct and contact-dependent, but it is mainly mediated by soluble and exosomes-carried cytokines. Among these, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) plays a relevant role in enhancing cancer risk, cancer growth, and cancer-associated cachexia. In this review, we describe the inflammatory cell types, the cytokines, and the mechanisms underlying PDAC risk, growth, and progression, with particular attention on TNFα, also in the light of the potential risks or benefits associated with anti-TNFα treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31272316>Combined Genetic Deletion of IL (Interleukin)-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 Does Not Affect Ischemic Brain Injury in Mice.</a></h2><p>Background and Purpose- After ischemic injury, microglia and infiltrated macrophages may acquire different polarization phenotypes promoting  and injury (M1) or repair and protection (). There is evidence that immunomodulation, via type 2 helper T-cells (Th2) cytokines, exerts neuroprotection after ischemia. We investigated the consequences of simultaneous genetic deletion of Th2 cytokines (IL [interleukin]-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13) on the histopathologic outcome, microglia and infiltrated macrophages markers, and ischemic microenvironment at different time points after ischemic injury in mice subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Methods- Wild-type and Th2 cytokine-deficient mice (4KO) were subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery by electrocoagulation and followed up to 5 weeks after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Neuropathologic outcome was assessed at 24 hours (n=6), 7 days (n=6), and 5 weeks (n=6-7) by examination of the ischemic lesion, neuronal count, microglia and infiltrated macrophages markers, brain atrophy, collagen deposition, and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) immunohistochemistry. Selected gene expression was investigated at 7 days (n=6). Results- 4KO mice showed no difference in lesion and neuronal count 7 days and up to 5 weeks after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery compared with wild type. Ischemic 4KO mice had lower CD16/32 expression at 24 hours, lower CD11b and CD16/32 expression at 7 days than wild type. They had higher CD206 expression at 24 hours, higher CD206 and arginase1 at 7 days, and increased mRNA for CXCL9 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 9) compared with wild type. Additional histopathologic analysis, including brain atrophy, gliotic scar, and collagenous scar confirmed no difference between genotypes at 5 weeks. Conclusions- This study casts light on the proposed neuroprotective function of Th2 cytokines, showing that combined IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 deletion does not affect the neuropathologic response to ischemic stroke in the subacute and chronic phases. Our findings indicate that Th2 cytokines are not an essential neuroimmunological cue able to drive the brain's ischemic outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428524>CCR5 status and metastatic progression in colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Multiple reports have highlighted the importance of the local immunological cellular composition (. the density of effector T cells and macrophage polarization state) in predicting clinical outcome in advanced metastatic stage of colorectal cancer. However, in spite of the general association between a high effector T cell density and improved outcome, our recent work has revealed a specific lymphocyte-driven cancer cell-supporting signal. Indeed, lymphocyte-derived CCL5 supports CCR5-positive tumor cell proliferation and thereby fosters tumor growth in metastatic liver lesions. Upon systematic analysis of CCR5 expression by tumor cells using immunohistochemistry, we observed that the intensity of CCR5 increases with primary tumor size and peaks in T4 tumors. In liver metastases however, though CCR5 expression intensity is globally heightened compared to primary tumors, alterations in the expression patterns appear, leading to "patchiness" of the stain. CCR5 patchiness is, therefore, a signature of liver metastases in our cohort ( = 97 specimens) and relates to globally decreased expression intensity, but does not influence the extent of the response to CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc in patients. Moreover, CCR5 patchiness relates to a poor immune landscape characterized by a low cytotoxic-to-regulatory T cell ratio at the invasive margin and enriched cellular and molecular markers of macrophage  polarization. Finally, because higher numbers of PD-1- and CTLA-4-positive cells surround tumors with patchy CCR5 expression, one can speculate that these tumors potentially respond to immune checkpoint blockade. This hypothesis is corroborated by the prolonged disease-free survival and disease-specific survival observed in patients with low gene expression of CCR5 in metastases from two publically available cohorts. These observations highlight the complex role of the CCL5-CCR5 axis in CRC metastatic progression and warrant further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110502>RNAseq Profiling of Leukocyte Populations in Zebrafish Larvae Reveals a  Chemokine Gene as a Marker of Macrophage Polarization During Mycobacterial Infection.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are phagocytic cells from the innate immune system, which forms the first line of host defense against invading pathogens. These highly dynamic immune cells can adopt specific functional phenotypes, with the pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory  polarization states as the two extremes. Recently, the process of macrophage polarization during inflammation has been visualized by real time imaging in larvae of the zebrafish. This model organism has also become widely used to study macrophage responses to microbial pathogens. To support the increasing use of zebrafish in macrophage biology, we set out to determine the complete transcriptome of zebrafish larval macrophages. We studied the specificity of the macrophage signature compared with other larval immune cells and the macrophage-specific expression changes upon infection. We made use of the well-established , and  fluorescent reporter lines to sort and sequence the transcriptome of larval macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphoid progenitor cells, respectively. Our results provide a complete dataset of genes expressed in these different immune cell types and highlight their similarities and differences. Major differences between the macrophage and neutrophil signatures were found within the families of proteinases. Furthermore, expression of genes involved in antigen presentation and processing was specifically detected in macrophages, while lymphoid progenitors showed expression of genes involved in macrophage activation. Comparison with datasets of  polarized human macrophages revealed that zebrafish macrophages express a strongly homologous gene set, comprising both M1 and  markers. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis of low numbers of macrophages infected by the intracellular pathogen  revealed that infected macrophages change their transcriptomic response by downregulation of -associated genes and overexpression of specific M1-associated genes. Among the infection-induced genes, a homolog of the human  chemokine gene, , stood out as the most strongly overexpressed M1 marker. Upregulation of  in -infected macrophages was found to require the function of Myd88, a critical adaptor molecule in the Toll-like and interleukin 1 receptor pathways that are central to pathogen recognition and activation of the innate immune response. Altogether, our data provide a valuable data mining resource to support infection and inflammation research in the zebrafish model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650518>Fumaric Acids Directly Influence Gene Expression of Neuroprotective Factors in Rodent Microglia.</a></h2><p>Dimethylfumarate (DMF) has been approved the for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The mode of action of DMF and its assumed active primary metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) is still not fully understood, notably for brain resident cells. Therefore we investigated potential direct effects of DMF and MMF on microglia and indirect effects on oligodendrocytes. Primary rat microglia were differentiated into M1-like, -like and M0 phenotypes and treated in vitro with DMF or MMF. The gene expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors such as growth factors (IGF-1), interleukins (IL-10, IL-1β), chemokines (CCl3, CXCL-10) as well as cytokines (TGF-1β, TNFα), iNOS, and the mannose receptor (MRC1) was examined by determining their transcription level with qPCR, and on the protein level by ELISA and FACS analysis. Furthermore, microglia function was determined by phagocytosis assays and indirect effects on oligodendroglial proliferation and differentiation. DMF treatment of M0 and M1-like polarized microglia demonstrated an upregulation of gene expression for IGF-1 and MRC1, but not on the protein level. While the phagocytic activity remained unchanged, DMF and MMF treated microglia supernatants led to an enhanced proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC). These results suggest that DMF has anti-inflammatory effects on microglia which may result in enhanced proliferation of OPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373678>Hydroxychloroquine induced lung cancer suppression by enhancing chemo-sensitization and promoting the transition of -TAMs to M1-like macrophages.</a></h2><p>Lysosome-associated agents have been implicated as possible chemo-sensitizers and immune regulators for cancer chemotherapy. We investigated the potential roles and mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with chemotherapy in lung cancer treatment.The effects of combined treatment on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were investigated using cell viability assays and animal models. The influence of HCQ on lysosomal pH was evaluated by lysosomal sensors and confocal microscopy. The effects of HCQ on the tumour immune microenvironment were analysed by flow cytometry.HCQ elevates the lysosomal pH of cancer cells to inactivate P-gp while increasing drug release from the lysosome into the nucleus. Furthermore, single HCQ therapy inhibits lung cancer by inducing macrophage-modulated anti-tumour CD8 T cell . Moreover, HCQ could promote the transition of  tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) into M1-like macrophages, leading to CD8 T cell infiltration into the tumour microenvironment.HCQ exerts anti-NSCLC cells effects by reversing the drug sequestration in lysosomes and enhancing the CD8 T cell immune response. These findings suggest that HCQ could act as a promising chemo-sensitizer and immune regulator for lung cancer chemotherapy in the clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692665>Macrophages: versatile players in renal inflammation and fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Macrophages have important roles in immune surveillance and in the maintenance of kidney homeostasis; their response to renal injury varies enormously depending on the nature and duration of the insult. Macrophages can adopt a variety of phenotypes: at one extreme, M1 pro-inflammatory cells contribute to infection clearance but can also promote renal injury; at the other extreme,  anti-inflammatory cells have a reparative phenotype and can contribute to the resolution phase of the response to injury. In addition, bone marrow monocytes can differentiate into myeloid-derived suppressor cells that can regulate T cell  in the kidney. However, macrophages can also promote renal fibrosis, a major driver of progression to end-stage renal disease, and the CD206 subset of  macrophages is strongly associated with renal fibrosis in both human and experimental diseases. Myofibroblasts are important contributors to renal fibrosis and recent studies provide evidence that macrophages recruited from the bone marrow can transition directly into myofibroblasts within the injured kidney. This process is termed macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) and is driven by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1)-Smad3 signalling via a Src-centric regulatory network. MMT may serve as a key checkpoint for the progression of chronic inflammation into pathogenic fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114572>RUTI Vaccination Enhances Inhibition of Mycobacterial Growth  and Induces a Shift of Monocyte Phenotype in Mice.</a></h2><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem and there is a dire need for an improved treatment. A strategy to combine vaccination with drug treatment, termed therapeutic vaccination, is expected to provide benefit in shortening treatment duration and augmenting treatment success rate. RUTI candidate vaccine has been specifically developed as a therapeutic vaccine for TB. The vaccine is shown to reduce bacillary load when administered after chemotherapy in murine and guinea pig models, and is also immunogenic when given to healthy adults and individuals with latent TB. In the absence of a validated correlate of vaccine-induced protection for TB vaccine testing, mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) has been developed as a comprehensive tool to evaluate vaccine potency . In this study, we investigated the potential of RUTI vaccine to control mycobacterial growth  and demonstrated the capacity of MGIA to aid the identification of essential immune mechanism. We found an association between the peak response of vaccine-induced growth inhibition and a shift in monocyte phenotype following RUTI vaccination in healthy mice. The vaccination significantly increased the frequency of non-classical Ly6C monocytes in the spleen after two doses of RUTI. Furthermore, mRNA expressions of Ly6C-related transcripts (Nr4a1, Itgax, Pparg, Bcl2) were upregulated at the peak vaccine response. This is the first time the impact of RUTI has been assessed on monocyte phenotype. Given that non-classical Ly6C monocytes are considered to play an anti-inflammatory role, our findings in conjunction with previous studies have demonstrated that RUTI could induce a balanced immune response, promoting an effective cell-mediated response whilst at the same time limiting excessive inflammation. On the other hand, the impact of RUTI on non-classical monocytes could also reflect its impact on trained innate  which warrants further investigation. In summary, we have demonstrated a novel mechanism of action of the RUTI vaccine, which suggests the importance of a balanced M1/ monocyte function in controlling mycobacterial infection. The MGIA could be used as a screening tool for therapeutic TB vaccine candidates and may aid the development of therapeutic vaccination regimens for TB in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885310>Intranasally administered polyethylenimine adjuvanted influenza  ectodomain induces partial protection against H9N2 influenza A virus infection in chickens.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate whether intranasally coadministered four tandem copies of extracellular domains of  (M2e) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), a mucosal adjuvant, can protect chickens against H9N2 influenza A virus infection. Groups of chickens were intranasally vaccinated with M2e plus PEI adjuvant, M2e alone or PEI adjuvant, and antibody (serum IgG and mucosal IgA) and cellular (CD4 T cells and IFN-γ levels) immune responses were measured post-vaccination. We demonstrated that the chickens vaccinated with M2e plus PEI adjuvant showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher M2e-specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA responses compared to the chickens that received either M2e alone or PEI adjuvant. The IgA responses measured in lungs were almost comparable to that of the serum IgG levels. Upon restimulation of the vaccinated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with M2e antigen, significantly (p < 0.05) higher IFN-γ levels were observed only in M2e plus PEI adjuvant vaccinated group. Lymphoproliferative and CD4 T cell responses, as measured by MTT-based assay and flow cytometry, respectively, were also observed significantly (p < 0.05) higher in M2e plus PEI adjuvant vaccinated chickens. On challenge with the H9N2 virus (10TCID) at 28 day post-vaccination, M2e plus PEI adjuvant vaccinated group exhibited lower lung inflammation and viral load compared to the chickens treated with either M2e alone or PEI adjuvant. In summary, we show that intranasally coadministered M2e and PEI adjuvant can elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and can reduce viremia levels in chickens post H9N2 infection in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The NLRP3 inflammasome mediates inflammation in several chronic diseases by processing the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18. In this study, we investigated whether MCC950, a recently-identified inhibitor of NLRP3 activity, reduces blood pressure (BP), renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension.C57BL6/J mice were made hypertensive by uninephrectomy and treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (2.4 mg/day, s.c.) and 0.9% NaCl in the drinking water (1K/DOCA/salt). Normotensive controls were uninephrectomized and received normal drinking water. Ten days later, mice were treated with MCC950 (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or vehicle (saline, s.c.) for up to 25 days. BP was monitored by tail-cuff or radiotelemetry; renal function by biochemical analysis of 24-h urine collections; and kidney inflammation/pathology was assessed by real-time PCR for inflammatory gene expression, flow cytometry for leucocyte influx, and Picrosirius red histology for collagen. Over the 10 days post-surgery, 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice became hypertensive, developed impaired renal function, and displayed elevated renal levels of inflammatory markers, collagen and immune cells. MCC950 treatment from day 10 attenuated 1K/DOCA/salt-induced increases in renal expression of inflammasome subunits (NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1) and inflammatory/injury markers (pro-IL-18, pro-IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, osteopontin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CCL2, vimentin), each by 25-40%. MCC950 reduced interstitial collagen and accumulation of certain leucocyte subsets in kidneys of 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice, including CD206+ (-like) macrophages and interferon-gamma-producing T cells. Finally, MCC950 partially reversed 1K/DOCA/salt-induced elevations in BP, urine output, osmolality, [Na+], and albuminuria (each by 20-25%). None of the above parameters were altered by MCC950 in normotensive mice.MCC950 was effective at reducing BP and limiting renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension. This study provides proof-of-concept that pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a viable anti-hypertensive strategy.© The Author(s) 2018.

However, what drives  polarization of TAMs and how TAMs suppress antitumor  within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain largely undefined. Using several murine tumor models, we showed that hedgehog (Hh) signaling in myeloid cells is critical for TAM  polarization and tumor growth. We also found that tumor cells secrete sonic hedgehog (SHH), an Hh ligand, and that tumor-derived SHH drives TAM  polarization. Furthermore, Hh-induced functional polarization in TAMs suppresses CD8+ T cell recruitment to the TME through the inhibition of CXCL9 and CXCL10 production by TAMs. Last, we demonstrated that Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) mediates Hh-dependent TAM  polarization and the immunosuppressive function. Collectively, these findings highlight a critical role for tumor-derived SHH in promoting TAM  polarization, a mechanism for TAM-mediated immunosuppression, and may provide insights into the design of new cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282524>Immunopathogenesis of Acute Kidney Injury.</a></h2><p>Pathophysiologically, the classification of acute kidney injury (AKI) can be divided into three categories: (1) prerenal, (2) intrinsic, and (3) postrenal. Emerging evidence supports the involvement of renal tubular epithelial cells and the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system in the pathogenesis of intrinsic AKI. Pro-inflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, hypoxia inducible factors, toll-like receptors, complement system, oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, cell death, resident renal dendritic cells, neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer T cells, cytokines, and secreted chemokines contribute to the immunopathogenesis of AKI. However, other immune cells and pathways such as  macrophages, regulatory T cells, progranulin, and autophagy exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and facilitate kidney tissue repair after AKI. Thus, therapies for AKI include agents such as anti-inflammatory (e.g., recombinant alkaline phosphatase), antioxidants (iron chelators), and apoptosis inhibitors. In preclinical toxicity studies, drug-induced kidney injury can be seen after exposure to a nephrotoxicant test article due to immune mechanisms and dysregulation of innate, and/or adaptive cellular . The focus of this review will be on intrinsic AKI, as it relates to the immune and renal systems cross talks focusing on the cellular and pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277479>Gene Expression Comparison between the Lymph Node-Positive and -Negative Reveals a Peculiar Immune Microenvironment Signature and a Theranostic Role for WNT Targeting in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Over the past several years there has been much debate with regards to the prognostic and clinical significance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with lymph nodes metastasis. The PDAC gene expression knowledge and the biologic alterations underlying the lymph node involvement convey a clinical implication in dealing with the theranostic window. To this end, we provide an original bioinformatic dissection of the gene expression differences of PDAC according to the nodal involvement from a large public available dataset. Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis from 143 RNA-seq patient's derived samples indicated that WNT increased activation and a peculiar immune microenvironment identify subjects with nodal involvement. In frame of this thinking, we validated the WNT pathway role in increasing the likelihood of lymphatic dissemination in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time in a PDAC model the potential therapeutic window that XAV-939-a specific WNT pathway inhibitor-has in re-educating a tumor-permissive immune system. Finally, we outline the potential implication on bystander molecular drivers exerted by WNT molecular inhibition, providing a picture of the proteomic oncogenic landscape changes elicited by XAV-939 on PDAC cells and their clinical implication. Our findings hold the promise to identify novel immune-based therapeutic strategies targeting WNT to enhance PDAC cytotoxicity and restore anti-PDAC  in node-positive disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31397016>Chitinase 3-like 1 drives allergic skin inflammation via Th2  and  macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by defective skin barrier and Th2 immune responses. Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), also known as breast regression protein 39 (BRP-39) in mice and human homologue YKL-40, plays important roles in Th2 inflammation and allergen sensitization. CHI3L1 has been implicated in a variety of diseases including asthma characterized by inflammation, apoptosis and tissue remodelling, but its role in AD remains elusive.The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CHI3L1 in the development and progression of AD.We investigated YKL-40 levels in the serum and skin of AD patients by ELISA and immunofluorescence, respectively. Using a murine model of AD induced by ovalbumin (OVA), we investigated Th2 immune responses,  macrophage activation and skin barrier gene expression using wild-type (WT) and BRP-39 null mutant (BRP-39 ) mice. YKL-40 level was significantly increased in serum of AD patients. In addition, both mRNA and protein expression levels of BRP-39 were higher in OVA-sensitized WT mice than in control mice. OVA-sensitized BRP-39 mice showed decreased epidermal thickness, lower total serum IgE, Th2 cytokine levels and CD4 effector T cell populations than OVA-sensitized WT mice. Induction of BRP-39 was dominant in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency was found to be involved in  macrophage activation. Consistently, the YKL-40 level in the skin of AD patients was higher than in normal subjects and it was expressed in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency attenuated dysregulation of skin barrier and tight junction genes.These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 mediates the development of AD induced by OVA, affecting Th2 inflammation,  macrophage activation and skin barrier function.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362639>Mixture of Two Lactobacillus plantarum Strains Modulates the Gut Microbiota Structure and Regulatory T Cell Response in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota has been linked to diet-induced obesity, and microorganisms that influence obesity have important health implications. In this study, the anti-obesity effects of two Lactobacillus plantarum strains (DSR  and DSR 920) isolated from kimchi are investigated.Mice are fed a normal or high-fat diet with or without DSR  and DSR 920 (DSR, 1 × 10 CFU d ) for 12 weeks. DSR improves the obesity state, as evidenced by the i) suppressed obesity-related markers, e.g., gains in body weight and fat mass, ii) reduced serum and liver triglyceride levels, iii) upregulated β-oxidation and downregulated lipogenesis-related genes in the liver, iv) reduced serum leptin levels, v) altered microbial communities, vi) increased regulatory T cell , and vii) suppressed inflammatory response. In addition, correlation analysis shows that Akkermansia muciniphila and the genus Anaerostipes, which are increased in the DSR group, are negatively correlated with obesity-related markers, but Mucispirillum schaedleri, which is increased in the high-fat-diet (HFD) group, is positively correlated with serum leptin level.Lactobacillus plantarum DSR  and DSR 920 are candidate probiotics for the prevention and amelioration of obesity.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ATC has a high prevalence of BRAF mutations and is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment; we previously demonstrated that the combination of BRAF inhibitor and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy synergistically reduce tumour volume in an immunocompetent mouse model of orthotopic ATC.We again utilised our mouse model of ATC to assess the combination of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 and anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody on survival, and performed immune cell profiling of lymphoid and myeloid-lineage cells during maximal treatment response and tumour regrowth.Combination therapy dramatically improved mouse survival. Maximal tumour reduction was associated with increases in the number and cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells and NK cells, as well as increases in mostly M1-polarised tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) and decreases in myeloid-derived suppressor-like cells. Regrowth of tumour occurred after 2-3 weeks of ongoing combination therapy, and was most significantly associated with decreased TAMs and a dramatic increase in -polarisation.Combination of PLX4720 and anti-PD-L1/PD-1 antibody dramatically reduced tumour volume, prolonged survival and improved the anti-tumour immune profile in murine ATC.

Herein, we report multidimensional, nuclear proteomic analyses of protein expression and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that control biological processes during M activation. For this, M were incubated with IFN-/LPS and IL-4, and their differentiation to proinflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2a, referred as  for simplicity throughtout the manuscript) phenotypes was confirmed by detection of CD64 and CD206 surface markers and TNF-, arginase I, and iNOS-dependent nitrite levels. We used a sequential method of organellar enrichment and labeling of nuclear fractions with BODIPY FL-maleimide fluorescence dye followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) to capture quantitative changes in abundance and S-nitrosylated (SNO) proteome signatures. Exact same gels were then labeled with Pro-Q Diamond to detect protein phosphorylation. MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis of the protein spots with fold change of ≥|1.5| in any of the groups yielded 229 identifications. We found that 145, 78, and 173 protein spots in M1 M and 105, 81, and 164 protein spots in  M were changed in abundance, S-nitrosylation, and phosphorylation, respectively, with respect to M0 controls (fold change: ≥|1.5|,  ≤ 0.05). Targeted analysis by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was performed to verify the differential abundance and phosphorylation levels of two of the proteins in M1 and  (vs. M0) M. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the nuclear proteome datasets showed that the abundance and posttranslational (SNO and Phosphor) modifications of the proteins predicted to be involved in cytoskeletal organization/cell movement, phagocytosis/endocytosis, and cell proliferation/cell death were differentially regulated with proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory activation of M.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30420269>Identification of MΦ specific POTEE expression: Its role in mTORC2 activation via protein-protein interaction in TAMs.</a></h2><p>POTE is known as cancer antigen, expressed in many cancers, along with very few normal tissues like prostate, ovary, testes and embryo.

In addition, expression level remains unaltered in MΦ subtypes M1 and  and MΦ subjected to various stresses, except MΦs treated with Hyp-CM where MΦs acquires properties of TAMs. In TAMs, POTEE was involved differential protein-protein interaction with mTOR, RICTOR, and Rad51 indicating its biological role in cell invasion through mTORC2 activation. siRNA mediated knockdown of POTEE suggests its importance in cell survival of MΦs as well as TAMs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

How differences in the acute immune response affect the CNS immune response is unknown. To address this question, we used two persistent Toxoplasma strains (type II and type III) and examined the CNS immune response at 21 days post infection (dpi). Contrary to acute infection studies, type III-infected mice had higher numbers of total CNS T cells and macrophages/microglia but fewer alternatively activated macrophages (M2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) than type II-infected mice. By profiling splenocytes at 5, 10, and 21 dpi, we determined that at 5 dpi type III-infected mice had more M2s while type II-infected mice had more pro-inflammatory macrophages and that these responses flipped over time. To test how these early differences influence the CNS immune response, we engineered the type III strain to lack ROP16 (IIIΔrop16), the polymorphic effector protein that drives the early type III-associated  response. IIIΔrop16-infected mice showed a type II-like neuroinflammatory response with fewer infiltrating T cells and macrophages/microglia and more M2s and an unexpectedly low CNS parasite burden. At 5 dpi, IIIΔrop16-infected mice showed a mixed inflammatory response with more pro-inflammatory macrophages, M2s, T effector cells, and Tregs, and decreased rates of infection of peritoneal exudative cells (PECs). These data suggested that type III parasites need the early ROP16-associated  response to avoid clearance, possibly by the -Related GTPases (IRGs), which are IFN-γ- dependent proteins essential for murine defenses against Toxoplasma. To test this possibility, we infected IRG-deficient mice and found that IIIΔrop16 parasites now maintained parental levels of PECs infection. Collectively, these studies suggest that, for the type III strain, rop16III plays a key role in parasite persistence and influences the subacute CNS immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30285855>Salmonella Gallinarum delivering M2eCD40L in protein and DNA formats acts as a bivalent vaccine against fowl typhoid and H9N2 infection in chickens.</a></h2><p>Fowl typhoid (FT), a septicemic disease caused by Salmonella Gallinarum (SG), and H9N2 influenza infection are two economically important diseases that affect poultry industry worldwide. Herein, we exploited a live attenuated SG mutant (JOL967) to deliver highly conserved extracellular domains of H9N2  (M2e) to induce protective  against both H9N2 infection and FT. To increase the immunogenicity of M2e, we physically linked it with CD40L and cloned the fusion gene into either prokaryotic constitutive expression vector pJHL65 or mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+. Then pJHL65-M2eCD40L or pcDNA-M2eCD40L recombinant plasmid was electroporated into JOL967 strain and the resultant clones were designated as JOL2074 and JOL2076, respectively. We demonstrated that the chickens vaccinated once orally with a co-mix of JOL2074 and JOL2076 strains elicited significantly (p < 0.05) higher M2e-specific humoral and cell-mediated  compared to JOL2074 alone vaccinated group. However, SG-specific immune responses were comparable in both the vaccination groups. On challenge with the virulent H9N2 virus (10TCID) at 28 day post-vaccination, chickens that received a co-mix of JOL2074 plus JOL2076 strains exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) lower lung inflammation and viral load in both lungs and cloacal samples than JOL2074 alone vaccinated group. Against challenge with the lethal wild-type SG, both the vaccination groups exhibited only 12.5% mortality compared to 75% mortality observed in the control group. In conclusion, we show that SG delivering M2eCD40L can act as a bivalent vaccine against FT and H9N2 infection and further studies are warranted to develop this SG-M2eCD40L vaccine as a broadly protective vaccine against avian influenza virus subtypes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p>Inflammation substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states,  macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor  is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444606>Melanoma-conditioned medium promotes cytotoxic immune responses by murine bone marrow-derived monocytes despite their expression of '' markers.</a></h2><p>Macrophages have been shown to infiltrate a wide range of malignancies and are often considered to promote tumour survival, growth and spread. However, the source and behaviour of discrete tumour-associated macrophage populations are still poorly understood. Here we show a novel method for the rational development of bone marrow-derived monocytes appropriate for the study of processes which involve the contribution of circulating inflammatory monocytes. We have shown that in response to tumour-conditioned medium, these cells upregulate CD206 and CD115, markers traditionally associated with -type macrophages. Treated cells show reduced capacity for cytokine secretion but significantly impact CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation and polarization. Coculture with conditioned bone marrow-derived monocytes significantly reduced CD4 T-cell proliferation but increased CD8 T-cell proliferation and granzyme B expression with significant induction of IFNγ secretion by both CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating that these cells may have a role in promoting anti-cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186834>Differential Activation of Fetal Hofbauer Cells in Primigravidas Is Associated with Decreased Birth Weight in Symptomatic Placental Malaria.</a></h2><p>Placental malaria is a leading global cause of low birth weight neonates, especially in first-time mothers. To better understand the role of innate  in placental malaria, we investigated the relationships between histopathological markers of placental malaria, fetal and maternal macrophage responses, and perinatal outcomes in a cross-sectional case control study of pregnant women presenting with symptomatic malaria at the time of delivery.Primigravidas showed increased hemozoin deposition in placental villi (=0.02), syncytiotrophoblasts (=0.01), and fetal Hofbauer cells (0.01). The percentage of hemozoin-positive villi negatively correlated with infant birth weight (regression coefficient [b] = -0.03 kg decrease in birth weight per % increase in hemozoin-positive villi, =0.035). Malaria-infected placentas showed a twofold increase in Hofbauer cells (<0.001) and maternal macrophages (<0.001). Placental malaria was associated with a threefold increase in the percentage of  maternal macrophages (19.2% vs 6.4%, =0.01). Primigravidas showed a significant decrease in the Hofbauer cell -percentage in placental malaria (92.7% vs. 97.0%, =0.04), which was predictive of infant birth weight (b=0.08 kg increase in birth weight per % increase in  Hofbauer cells, =0.001). There was no association between maternal macrophage response and infant birth weights.Placentas with malarial infection had increased numbers of fetal Hofbauer cells in the villous stroma and maternal macrophages in the intervillous space. In primigravidas, decreased anti-inflammatory -type Hofbauer cells were predictive of lower birth weight. -type maternal macrophages were increased in placental malaria, but there was no association with gravidity or birth weight. These results suggested a protective role of  Hofbauer cells in fetal growth restriction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606411>Kidney-Immune System Crosstalk in AKI.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) now is recognized as a systemic disease. It occurs frequently in critically ill patients and has profound effects on morbidity and mortality. Recent research efforts have shown a bidirectional interplay between AKI and the immune system. Both innate and adaptive immune responses mediate renal injury as well as recovery from AKI. Dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes all play specific roles in the development of AKI.  macrophages and regulatory T cells also are pivotal in controlling inflammation, tissue remodeling, and repair after AKI. Conversely, existing evidence also suggests that increased production and decreased clearance of cytokines as well as dysfunction of immune cells, in particular neutrophils, can contribute to immune dysfunction and impaired bacterial clearance during AKI. Clinical data indicate that AKI is a risk factor for infections after various forms of critical illness, including cardiac surgery, malignancies, or severe trauma. Available evidence does not suggest that standard renal replacement therapies improve outcome from AKI beyond control of fluid balance and azotemia. Thus, novel approaches likely will be necessary to prevent or treat AKI-induced dysregulation of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2018.

Brain-resident memory T cells (bT) are positioned to impart immediate defense against recurrent or reactivated infection. The cytokine and chemokine milieu present within a tissue is critical for T generation and retention; and reciprocal interactions exist between brain-resident glia and bT. High concentrations of TGF-β are found within brain and this cytokine has been shown to induce CD103 (integrin αeβ7) expression. The majority of T cells persisting within brain express CD103, which aids in retention through interaction with E-cadherin. Likewise, cytokines produced by T cells also modulate microglia. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 has been shown to preferentially polarize microglial cells toward an  phenotype, with a corresponding increase in E-cadherin expression. These findings demonstrate that the brain microenvironment, both during and following inflammation, prominently contributes to the role of CD103 in T cell persistence. Further evidence shows that microglia, and astrocytes, upregulate programmed death (PD) ligand 1 during neuroinflammation, likely to limit neuropathology, and the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway also aids in bT generation and retention. Upon reactivation of quiescent neurotropic viruses, bT may respond to small amounts of de novo-produced viral antigen by rapidly releasing IFN-γ, resulting in interferon-stimulated gene expression in surrounding glia, thereby amplifying activation of a small number of adaptive immune cells into an organ-wide innate antiviral response. While advantageous from an antiviral perspective; over time, recall response-driven, organ-wide innate immune activation likely has cumulative neurotoxic and neurocognitive consequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563569>Tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs) promote immunosuppression through induction of -like macrophages with increased expression of PD-L1.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) facilitate tumor progression via establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it is poorly understood how tumor cells could functionally modulate TAMs. Our previous work indicated that tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs), a type of LC3-II double-membrane extracellular vesicles (EVs) was sufficient to suppress anti-tumor immune responses by inducing IL-10-producing B cells and immune suppressive neutrophils. Here, we hypothesized that TRAPs may participate in regulating macrophage polarization.TRAPs isolated from multiple murine tumor cell lines and pleural effusions or ascites of cancer patients were incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and monocytes, respectively. Cellular phenotypes were examined by flow cytometry, ELISA and quantitative PCR. TRAPs treated BMDMs were tested for the ability to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro, and for promotion of tumor growth in vivo. Transwell chamber and neutralization antibodies were added to ascertain the inhibitory molecules expressed on BMDMs exposed to TRAPs. Knockout mice were used to identify the receptors responsible for TRAPs-induced BMDMs polarization and the signaling mechanism was examined by western blot. Autophagy-deficient tumors were profiled for phenotypic changes of TAMs and IFN-γ secretion of T cells by flow cytometry. The phenotype of monocytes from pleural effusions or ascites of cancer patients was assessed by flow cytometry.TRAPs converted macrophages into an immunosuppressive -like phenotype characterized by the expression of PD-L1 and IL-10. These macrophages inhibited the proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in vitro, and promoted tumor growth mainly through PD-L1 in vivo. TRAPs-induced macrophage polarization was dependent on TLR4-mediated MyD88-p38-STAT3 signaling. In vivo studies indicated that disruption of autophagosome formation in B16F10 cells by silencing the autophagy gene Beclin1 resulted in a remarkable delay in tumor growth, which was associated with reduced autophagosome secretion, TAMs reprogramming and enhanced T cell activation. Moreover, the levels of LC3B EVs appeared to correlate significantly with up-regulation of PD-L1 and IL-10 in matched monocytes from effusions or ascites of cancer patients, and TRAPs isolated from these samples could also polarize monocytes to an -like phenotype with increased expression of PD-L1, CD163 and IL-10, decreased expression of HLA-DR, and T cell-suppressive function.These findings suggest the TRAPs-PD-L1 axis as a major driver of immunosuppression in the TME by eliciting macrophage polarization towards an -like phenotype, and highlight the potential novel therapeutic approach of simultaneously targeting autophagy and PD-L1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30520685>Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii clinical isolates from Thailand display diverse phenotypic interactions with macrophages.</a></h2><p>Cryptococcus-macrophage interaction is crucial in the development of cryptococcocal diseases. C. neoformans and C. gattii are major pathogenic species that occupy different niches and cause different clinical manifestations. However, the differences of macrophage interaction among these species in affecting different disease outcomes and immune responses have not been clearly addressed. Here, we examined the macrophage uptake rates, intracellular loads and intracellular proliferation rates of C. neoformans and C. gattii clinical isolates from Thailand and analyzed the effect of those interactions on fungal burdens and host immune responses. C. neoformans isolates showed a higher phagocytosis rate but lower intracellular proliferation rate than C. gattii. Indeed, the high intracellular proliferation rate of C. gattii isolates did not influence the fungal burdens in lungs and brains of infected mice, whereas infection with high-uptake C. neoformans isolates resulted in significantly higher brain burdens that associated with reduced survival rate. Interestingly, alveolar macrophages of mice infected with high-uptake C. neoformans isolates showed distinct patterns of alternatively activated macrophage () gene expressions with higher Arg1, Fizz1, Il13 and lower Nos2, Ifng, Il6, Tnfa, Mcp1, csf2 and Ip10 transcripts. Corresponding to this finding, infection with high-uptake C. neoformans resulted in enhanced arginase enzyme activity, elevated IL-4 and IL-13 and lowered IL-17 in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Thus, our data suggest that the macrophage interaction with C. neoformans and C. gattii may affect different disease outcomes and the high phagocytosis rates of C. neoformans influence the induction of type-2 immune responses that support fungal dissemination and disease progression.

Tumor cells express CD47, which can interact with the macrophages' SIRP transmitting a "don't eat me" signal to macrophages. The expression of CD47 increases in various tumors to evade immune attack. However, the expression of CD47 in endometrial cancer (EC) and the role of CD47-SIRP in the TAMs which mediate the progression of EC remain unclear. Our study shows that there are increased TAMs in EC which dominantly consist of  macrophages and contribute to the progression of EC. We confirm that CD47 is highly expressed in EC tissue using the TCGA database, qPCR, and flow cytometry. Instead of directly promoting the apoptosis of EC cells, anti-CD47 blocking antibody promoted phagocytosis of EC cells by macrophages and the increased phagocytosis ability was mediated by  macrophages in a coculture assay. Besides, CD47 blockade inhibited the growth of the EC tumors  and increased the infiltration of macrophages with antitumor ability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings might assist in developing promising strategies that blocked the CD47-SIRPa interaction for EC therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296243>Intestinal dysbacteriosis-induced IL-25 promotes development of HCC via alternative activation of macrophages in tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota and the tumor microenvironment are thought to be critical factors that modulate the processes of liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interleukin-25 (IL-25) promotes type 2 immunity via alternative activation of macrophages, and is closely associated with -related diseases, even malignancies. However, it is not clear which role IL-25 plays in the development of HCC, and whether gut microbiota are involved.IL-25 was detected by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines were measured by RT-qPCR and WB. After co-culture with IL-25-stimulated macrophages, the cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT marker of HCC cell lines (MHCC97L and HepG2) were evaluated by Brdu proliferation, Transwell assays and WB. An antibody neutralization assay of chemokine CXCL10 was performed to confirm its role in HCC development. Furthermore, the effects of IL-25 in HCC were investigated in vivo. Dysbiosis of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and  percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut microbiota dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30245865>Evidence of a distinct group of Black African patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.</a></h2><p>The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs more frequently in patients of African descent with high morbidity and mortality. Current SLE diagnostic criteria including antinuclear antibody (ANA) reactivity are derived largely from non-African populations. This study characterises ANA reactivity patterns and relates them to SLE clinical presentation in Black African patients.Sera from Black participants (61 patients with SLE and 100 controls) aged 1-81 years were analysed for reactivity against the antigens: uridine 1-ribonuclear protein, Smith uridine-1-5 ribonuclear protein antigen, soluble substance-A, recombinant Ro-52, soluble substance-B, Scl-70, cytoplasmic histidyl-tRNA synthetase antigen, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), nucleosomes, ribonuclear P-protein, antimitochondrial antibody  (AMA-), histones, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), centromere protein B and polymyositis-sclerosis overlap antigen.A significantly higher proportion (97%) of the 61 patients with SLE had detectable autoantibody reactivity compared with 15% of the 100 controls (p<0.001). The highest frequencies of autoantibody reactivity in patients with SLE were against the dsDNA antigen (41%) and PCNA (54%). Anti-PCNA and anti-dsDNA reactivity were mutually exclusive (p<0.001) giving rise to two distinct groups of Black African patients with SLE. The first group (n=25) had reactivity profiles consistent with international standard SLE definitions, including anti-dsDNA reactivity, and was 13 times more likely to present with joint symptoms. The larger, second group (n=34), characterised by anti-PCNA and anti-AMA- reactivity, was nine times more likely to present with only cutaneous symptoms.Our study demonstrates a need to extend autoantibody panels to include anti-PCNA in the diagnostic process of Black African patients and further refine the predictive values of the reactivity to different antigens to differentiate SLE syndromes in African populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380805>Allergen presensitization drives an eosinophil-dependent arrest in lung-specific helminth development.</a></h2><p>This study investigates the relationship between helminth infection and allergic sensitization by assessing the influence of preexisting allergy on the outcome of helminth infections, rather than the more traditional approach in which the helminth infection precedes the onset of allergy. Here we used a murine model of house dust mite-induced (HDM-induced) allergic inflammation followed by Ascaris infection to demonstrate that allergic sensitization drives an eosinophil-rich pulmonary type 2 immune response (Th2 cells,  macrophages, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, IL-33, IL-4, IL-13, and mucus) that directly hinders larval development and reduces markedly the parasite burden in the lungs. This effect is dependent on the presence of eosinophils, as eosinophil-deficient mice were unable to limit parasite development or numbers. In vivo administration of neutralizing antibodies against CD4 prior to HDM sensitization significantly reduced eosinophils in the lungs, resulting in the reversal of the HDM-induced Ascaris larval killing. Our data suggest that HDM allergic sensitization drives a response that mimics a primary Ascaris infection, such that CD4+ Th2-mediated eosinophil-dependent helminth larval killing in the lung tissue occurs. This study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying tissue-specific responses that drive a protective response against the early stages of the helminths prior to their establishing long-lasting infections in the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071139>Microbial etiology of pneumonia in patients with decreased renal function.</a></h2><p>Patients with renal impairment have altered , which might cause vulnerability to specific pathogens and worsen pneumonia-related outcomes. Nonetheless, the microbiological features of pneumonia in patients with decreased renal function remain unknown.Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study enrolling adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia to assess this knowledge gap. The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and first sputum microbiology during hospitalization were used for statistical analyses.Overall, 1554 patients hospitalized with pneumonia (mean age, 76.1 ± 16.7) were included, and 162 patients had died at the end of hospitalization. The cutoff eGFR value predicting mortality was <55 mL/min/1.73 , which defined decreased renal function in this study. Patients with decreased renal function demonstrated a significantly higher risk of fungi and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. On the other hand, this group of patients showed significantly higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which associated with higher mortality. Additionally, patients with S. aureus had a significantly lower eGFR, lymphocyte count and a higher NLR.These findings suggested the altered  and vulnerability to S. aureus infection in patients with decreased renal function, which may be the underlying cause of worse outcomes of pneumonia in this group of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664693>Sterile particle-induced inflammation is mediated by macrophages releasing IL-33 through a Bruton's tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Initiation of the innate sterile inflammatory response that can develop in response to microparticle exposure is little understood. Here, we report that a potent type 2 immune response associated with the accumulation of neutrophils, eosinophils and alternatively activated () macrophages was observed in response to sterile microparticles similar in size to wear debris associated with prosthetic implants. Although elevations in interleukin-33 (IL-33) and type 2 cytokines occurred independently of caspase-1 inflammasome signalling, the response was dependent on Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). IL-33 was produced by macrophages and BTK-dependent expression of IL-33 by macrophages was sufficient to initiate the type 2 response. Analysis of inflammation in patient periprosthetic tissue also revealed type 2 responses under aseptic conditions in patients undergoing revision surgery. These findings indicate that microparticle-induced sterile inflammation is initiated by macrophages activated to produce IL-33.

Here, liver and intestinal tissues obtained from neonatal mice were minced, enzymatically digested, and incubated in RPMI1640-based media. In a 2-wk culture, spherical floating cells emerged on a fibroblastic sheet. These cells showed phagocytic activity and F4/80-CD11b-CD206-Arg1-iNOS-CD209a phenotype, suggesting that these cells are tissue-resident macrophages. These macrophages proliferated in the co-culture system in the presence of fibroblastic feeder cell layer and absence of supplemental cytokines; the co-culture system did not cause a significant change in the phenotype of cells grown in a 4-wk culture. On the feeder cells, macrophage density was approximately 1.5 × 10/cm and the doubling time was approximately 70 h.

Several of the changes we observed, including enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory genes and dysregulated UPR and metabolism genes were first observed in the liver followed by the pancreas. In the present study we investigated further early changes in hepatic innate  and metabolism in two models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), the BBdp rat and NOD mouse. There was a striking increase in lipid deposits in liver, particularly in neonatal BBdp rats, with a less striking but significant increase in neonatal NOD mice in association with dysregulated expression of lipid metabolism genes. This was associated with a decreased number of extramedullary hematopoietic clusters as well as CD68 macrophages in the liver of both models. In addition, PPARɣ and phosphorylated AMPKα protein were decreased in neonatal BBdp rats. BBdp rats displayed decreased expression of antimicrobial genes in neonates and decreased  genes at 30 days. This suggests hepatic steatosis could be a common early feature in development of T1D that impacts metabolic homeostasis and tolerogenic phenotype in the prediabetic liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937266>Tumors and Their Microenvironment Dual-Targeting Chemotherapy with Local Immune Adjuvant Therapy for Effective Antitumor  against Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy turns tumor cells into "tumor vaccines" by immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, it remains a challenge to exploit chemotherapy-induced "tumor vaccines" for solid cancer immunotherapy due to the inefficient effector T cells activation and tumor microenvironment immunosuppression. Here, a matrix metalloprotease 2 responsive liposome (PEG-FA-Lip) composed of cleavable PEG chains covering the folate (FA)-modified liposome is developed to deliver ICD inducer doxorubicin. In breast cancer-bearing mice, PEG-FA-Lip targets both 4T1 breast cancer cells and -tumor associated macrophages (-TAMs) via FA-receptor mediated endocytosis, resulting in abundant "tumor vaccines" and efficient elimination of -TAMs. The combination of local cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) therapy facilitates PEG-FA-Lip induced "tumor vaccines" to effectively arouse systematic effector T cells immune response through promoting dendritic cell maturation and immunostimulatory cytokines secretion. The simultaneous elimination of -TAMs ensures the activated effector T cells exert antitumor  within tumor via decreasing immunosuppressive cytokines secretion and tumor infiltration of Treg cells. After receiving the combined treatment, 30.1% of breast cancer-bearing mice (initial tumor volume > 100 mm) achieves the goal of tumor eradication. Remarkably, this combination therapy greatly inhibits lung metastasis and controls the growth of already metastasized breast cancers (initial tumor volume > 100 mm).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224437>Genomic Sequencing of High-Efficiency Transducing Streptococcal Bacteriophage A25: Consequences of Escape from Lysogeny.</a></h2><p>Lytic bacteriophage A25, which infects  and several related species, has been used to better understand phage-microbe interactions due to its ability to mediate high-efficiency transduction. Most of these studies, however, are decades old and were conducted prior to the advent of next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics. The aim of our study was to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of high-efficiency transduction through analysis of the A25 genome. We show here that phage A25 is related to a family of genome prophages and became a lytic phage following escape from lysogeny. A lambdoid-like residual lysogeny module consisting of an operator site with two promoters and a -like antirepressor gene was identified, but the genes for the cI-like repressor and integrase are missing. Additionally, the genetic organization of the A25 genome was found to be modular in nature and similar to that of many prophages of  as well as from other streptococcal species. A study of A25 homology to all annotated prophages within  revealed near identity within the remnant lysogeny module of the A25 phage genome to the corresponding regions in resident prophages of genome strains MGAS10270 (), MGAS315 (M3), MGAS10570 (M4), and STAB902 (M4). Host range studies of MGAS10270, MGAS315, and MGAS10750 demonstrated that these strains were resistant to A25 infection. The resistance mechanism of superinfection  was confirmed experimentally through complementation of the operator region and -like repressor from prophage MGAS10270.2 into susceptible strains SF370, CEM1Δ4 (SF370ΔSpyCIM1), and ATCC 12204, which rendered all three strains resistant to A25 infection.  prediction of packaging through homology analysis of the terminase large subunit from bacteriophages within the known packaging mechanism of Gram-positive bacteria as well as the evidence of terminally redundant and/or circularly permuted sequences suggested that A25 grouped with phages employing the less stringent -type packaging mechanisms, which likely explains the characteristic A25 high-efficiency transduction capabilities. Only a few examples of lytic phages appearing following loss of part or all of the lysogeny module have been reported previously, and the genetic mosaicism of A25 suggests that this event may not have been a recent one. However, the discovery that this lytic bacteriophage shares some of the genetic pool of  prophages emphasizes the importance of genetic and biological characterization of bacteriophages when selecting phages for therapeutics or disinfectants, as phage-phage and phage-microbe interactions can be complex, requiring more than just assessment of host range and carriage of toxoid or virulence genes. Bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) play an important role in the shaping of bacterial populations as well as the dissemination of bacterial genetic material to new strains, resulting in the spread of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes. This study identified the genetic origins of  phage A25 and uncovered the molecular mechanism employed to promote horizontal transfer of DNA by transduction to new strains of this bacterium as well as identified the basis for its host range.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647310>Identification of Cardiac MRI Thresholds for Risk Stratification in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Aims Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-shortening condition.

Results A right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted threshold of 227% or a left ventricular-end-diastolic-volume-index of 58ml/ identified patients at low (<5%) and high (>10%) risk of 1-year mortality. These metrics identified 63% and 34% of patients as low risk, respectively. A right ventricular ejection fraction >54%, 37-54% and <37% identified 21%, 43% and 36% of patients at low, intermediate and high-risk of 1-year mortality, respectively. At follow-up cardiac-MRI patients who improved to, or were maintained in a low risk group had a one-year mortality <5%. Right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted independently predicted outcome and when used in conjunction with the REVEAL 2.0 risk score calculator or a modified French Pulmonary Hypertension registry approach improved risk stratification for one-year mortality. Conclusion Cardiac-MRI can be used to risk stratify patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension using a threshold approach. Right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted can identify a high percentage of patients at low-risk of one-year mortality and when used in conjunction with current risk stratification approaches it can improve risk stratification. This study supports further evaluation of cardiac-MRI in risk stratification in PAH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating /M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut Microbiota Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and . Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Two members of the interferon regulatory factors family, IRF5 and IRF4, are known to promote M1 or  phenotype, respectively. Our study aimed to analyse the effectiveness of the  differentiation process in vitro (achieved by IL-4 stimulation) and its relationship to the stage of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) in juvenile patients. To identify the basic changes in  phenotype, we examined the expression of the surface CD206, CD14, CD86 molecules, intracellular IRF4 and IRF5 transcription factors as well as IL-10 and TNFα intracellular production. Ten newly diagnosed (ND-DM1) and ten long-standing (LS-DM1) patients were enrolled into the study. The control group consisted of six children. We observed a significantly higher number of unpolarised CD206CD14 cells in the  cultures of DM1 subjects when compared to healthy ones. Examined cells presented common features with M1 macrophages (high levels of the CD14/CD86/IRF5 markers); however, they were weak TNFα producers in ND-DM1 patients. For the first time, we have revealed dysregulated IRF4/IRF5 axis in the analysed subpopulation derived from diabetic patients. Additionally, monocytes of ND-DM1 children were still able to differentiate into regulatory IL-10  macrophages, while this process was highly limited in LS-DM1 patients. Summarising, we suggest that the  polarisation process is less effective in DM1 patients than in healthy subjects and it may vary depending on the stage of disease. It can be concluded that in vitro differentiated  macrophages may be used in the future as inflammatory inhibitors for adoptive therapy experiments in ND-DM1 subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859179>Pentraxin 3 deficiency protects from the metabolic inflammation associated to diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Low-grade chronic inflammation characterizes obesity and metabolic syndrome. Here, we aim at investigating the impact of the acute-phase protein long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on the immune-inflammatory response occurring during diet-induced obesity.PTX3 deficiency in mice fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks protects from weight gain and adipose tissue deposition in visceral and subcutaneous depots. This effect is not related to changes in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism but is associated with an improved immune cell phenotype in the adipose tissue of Ptx3 deficient animals, which is characterized by -macrophages polarization and increased angiogenesis. These findings are recapitulated in humans where carriers of a PTX3 haplotype (PTX3 h2/h2 haplotype), resulting in lower PTX3 plasma levels, presented with a reduced prevalence of obesity and decreased abdominal adiposity compared with non-carriers.Our results support a critical role for PTX3 in the onset of obesity by promoting inflammation and limiting adipose tissue vascularization and delineate PTX3 targeting as a valuable strategy for the treatment of adipose tissue-associated inflammatory response.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Adamantanes, also known as  channel blockers, are one of the two classes of Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-influenza drugs, although their use was discontinued due to prevalent drug resistance. Fast emergence of resistance to current anti-influenza drugs have raised an urgent need for developing new anti-influenza drugs against resistant forms of circulating viruses. Here we propose a simple theoretical criterion for fast virtual screening of molecular libraries for candidate anti-influenza ion channel inhibitors both for wild type and adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses. After  screening of drug space using the EIIP/AQVN filter and further filtering of drugs by ligand based virtual screening and molecular docking we propose the best candidate drugs as potential dual inhibitors of wild type and adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses. Finally, guanethidine, the best ranked drug selected from ligand-based virtual screening, was experimentally tested. The experimental results show measurable anti-influenza activity of guanethidine in cell culture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770245>The ATP-Binding Cassette Gene ABCF1 Functions as an E2 Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme Controlling Macrophage Polarization to Dampen Lethal Septic Shock.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a bi-phasic inflammatory disease that threatens approximately 30 million lives and claims over 14 million annually, yet little is known regarding the molecular switches and pathways that regulate this disease. Here, we have described ABCF1, an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) family member protein, which possesses an E2 ubiquitin enzyme activity, through which it controls the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4) mediated gram-negative insult by targeting key proteins for K63-polyubiquitination. Ubiquitination by ABCF1 shifts the inflammatory profile from an early phase MyD88-dependent to a late phase TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, thereby regulating TLR4 endocytosis and modulating macrophage polarization from M1 to  phase. Physiologically, ABCF1 regulates the shift from the inflammatory phase of sepsis to the endotoxin tolerance phase, and modulates cytokine storm and interferon-β (IFN-β)-dependent production by the immunotherapeutic mediator, SIRT1. Consequently, ABCF1 controls sepsis induced mortality by repressing hypotension-induced renal circulatory dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TAMs have become increasingly recognised as a cancer therapy target, such as in combination therapy with an  checkpoint inhibitor. However, the clinical and prognostic features of TAMs, and the relationship between TAMs and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), remain unexplored in oesophageal cancer.Using a non-biased database of 305 resected oesophageal cancer preparations, we evaluated the expression of two -like macrophage markers (CD163 and CD204) and PD-L1 on tumour cells by immunostaining. Through in vitro assays, we examined how TAMs influence phenotypic malignancy and PD-L1 expression.High density of CD163 (n = 160) or CD204 (n = 146) was associated with significantly worse overall survival than low expression (log rank P = 0.0025 and 0.018 for CD163 and CD204, respectively). The prognostic effect of TAMs was not significantly modified by any clinical factors (P > 0.05 for all interactions). High TAM density was significantly associated with increased PD-L1 expression. In in vitro assays, cell invasion and migration ability were significantly more upregulated in oesophageal cancer cell lines cocultured with activated macrophages than in control cell lines. Coculture with activated macrophages elevated the PD-L1 expression in cancer cells.High TAM density in oesophageal cancer tissues was associated with shorter survival, suggesting a prognostic biomarker role for TAMs. TAMs also increase PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Given the significant interest in cancer immunotherapies targeting TAMs and PD-L1, the current findings should have considerable clinical implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a surfactant-associated innate immune molecule, which is known to interact with a variety of pathogens, and display anti-microbial effects. SP-A, being a carbohydrate pattern recognition molecule, has a wide range of innate immune functions against respiratory pathogens, including influenza A virus (IAV). Some pandemic pH1N1 strains resist neutralization by SP-A due to differences in the N-glycosylation of viral hemagglutinin (HA). Here, we provide evidence, for the first time, that a recombinant form of human SP-A (rfhSP-A), composed of α-helical neck and carbohydrate recognition domains, can actually promote the IAV replication, as observed by an upregulation of M1 expression in lung epithelial cell line, A549, when challenged with pH1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes. rfhSP-A (10 μg/ml) bound neuraminidase (NA) (∼60 kDa), matrix protein 1 (M1) (∼25 kDa) and  (∼17 kDa) in a calcium dependent manner, as revealed by far western blotting, and direct binding ELISA. However, human full length native SP-A downregulated mRNA expression levels of M1 in A549 cells challenged with IAV subtypes. Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed that transcriptional levels of TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, IFN-α and RANTES were enhanced following rfhSP-A treatment by both IAV subtypes at 6 h post-IAV infection of A549 lung epithelial cells. In the case of full length SP-A treatment, mRNA expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were downregulated during the mid-to-late stage of IAV infection of A549 cells. Multiplex cytokine/chemokine array revealed enhanced levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α due to rfhSP-A treatment in the case of both IAV subtypes tested, while no significant effect was seen in the case of IL-12. Enhancement of IAV infection of pH1N1 and H3N2 subtypes by truncated rfhSP-A, concomitant with infection inhibition by full-length SP-A, appears to suggest that a complete SP-A molecule is required for protection against IAV. This is in contrast to a recombinant form of trimeric lectin domains of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) that acts as an entry inhibitor of IAV.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

A primary cause of influenza-associated death is secondary bacterial pneumonia. We have previously shown that influenza induces type I interferon (IFN)-mediated inhibition of Type 17 immune responses, resulting in exacerbation of bacterial burden during influenza and  super-infection. In this study, we investigated the role of STAT2 signaling during influenza and influenza-bacterial super-infection in mice. Influenza-infected   mice had increased morbidity, viral burden, and inflammation when compared to wild-type mice. Despite an exaggerated inflammatory response to influenza infection, we found increased bacterial control and survival in STAT2 deficient mice during influenza-MRSA super-infection compared to controls. Further, we found that increased bacterial clearance during influenza-MRSA super-infection is not due to rescue of Type 17 . Absence of STAT2 was associated with increased accumulation of M1,  and M1/ co-expressing macrophages during influenza-bacterial super-infection. Neutralization of IFNγ (M1) and/or Arginase 1 () impaired bacterial clearance in   mice during super-infection, demonstrating that pulmonary macrophages expressing a mixed M1/ phenotype promote bacterial control during influenza-bacterial super-infection. Together, these results suggest that the STAT2 signaling is involved in suppressing macrophage activation and bacterial control during influenza-bacterial super-infection. Further, these studies reveal novel mechanistic insight into the roles of macrophage subpopulations in pulmonary host defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282813>Immune Effector Functions of Human IgG2 Antibodies against EGFR.</a></h2><p>Three FDA-approved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, necitumumab) are clinically available to treat patients with different types of cancers. Interestingly, panitumumab is of human IgG2 isotype, which is often considered to have limited immune effector functions. Unexpectedly, our studies unraveled that human IgG2 antibodies against EGFR mediated effective CDC when combined with another noncross-blocking EGFR antibody. This second antibody could be of human IgG1 or IgG2 isotype. Furthermore, EGFR antibodies of human IgG2 isotype were highly potent in recruiting myeloid effector cells such as M1 macrophages and PMN for tumor cell killing by ADCC. Tumor cell killing by PMN was more effective with IgG2 than with IgG1 antibodies if tumor cells expressed lower levels of EGFR. Additionally, lower expression levels of the "don't eat me" molecule CD47 on tumor cells enabled ADCC also by  macrophages, and improved PMN and macrophage-mediated ADCC. A TCGA enquiry revealed broadly varying CD47 expression levels across different solid tumor types. Together, these results demonstrate that human IgG2 antibodies against EGFR can promote significant Fc-mediated effector functions, which may contribute to their clinical efficacy. The future challenge will be to identify clinical situations in which myeloid effector cells can optimally contribute to antibody efficacy.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616161>Efficacy of a new oncolytic adenovirus armed with IL-13 against oral carcinoma models.</a></h2><p>The efficacy of traditional therapies for oral carcinoma (OC) is limited. Oncolytic adenovirus, a novel strategy of cancer therapy, shows potential use in OC treatment. However, its clinical application is limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. Thus, this study aimed to examine the efficacy of a new modified adenovirus against OC in vitro and in vivo.A multiple modified adenovirus (MMAD) armed with IL-13 (MMAD-IL-13) was constructed, and its effect on Cal-27 cells was examined. The potency of MMAD-IL-13 was examined in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiment, CCK-8 kit was used to determine the IC50 of MMAD-IL-3 in OC cell lines. For in vivo experiment, Cal-27 xenograft models were used to determine the antitumor effect of MMAD-IL-13. Apoptosis was measured in Cal-27 cells by Western blotting assay.  response was detected in Cal-27 xenograft models 7 days after intratumoral injection with MMAD-IL-13. The potency of MMAD and MMAD-IL-13 was compared in Cal-27 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) models.MMAD-IL-13 was successfully constructed; the harvested virus could be replicated and they overexpressed human IL-13 in Cal-27 cells. Compared with MMAD, MMAD-IL-13 showed enhanced antitumor effect in vitro by inducing apoptosis and reducing percentage of  macrophages in tumor environment in vivo. MMAD-IL-13 also showed potent antitumor effect in Cal-27, SCC-4, and Tca8113 cells in vitro and in Cal-27 xenograft models in vivo. However, MMAD-IL13 did not harm normal human oral epithelial cells in vitro and exhibited no effect on body weight in Cal-27 xenograft models. In Cal-27 PBMC models, MMAD-IL-13 showed stronger antitumor effect than MMAD.A new oncolytic adenovirus carrying the human IL-13 gene was constructed. This virus effectively led to remission of tumor development and death of OC cells in vivo and in vitro, showing its potential as a clinical cancer therapy.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120887>Macrophage subsets exhibit distinct E. coli-LPS tolerisable cytokines associated with the negative regulators, IRAK-M and Tollip.</a></h2><p>Macrophages (Mϕs) play a central role in mucosal  by pathogen sensing and instruction of adaptive immune responses. Prior challenge to endotoxin can render Mφs refractory to secondary exposure, suppressing the inflammatory response. Previous studies demonstrated a differential subset-specific sensitivity to endotoxin tolerance (ET), mediated by LPS from the oral pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG). The aim of this study was to investigate ET mechanisms associated with Mφ subsets responding to entropathogenic E. coli K12-LPS. M1- and -like Mφs were generated in vitro from the THP-1 cell line by differentiation with PMA and Vitamin D3, respectively. This study investigated ET mechanisms induced in M1 and  Mφ subsets, by measuring modulation of expression by RT-PCR, secretion of cytokines by sandwich ELISA, LPS receptor, TLR4, as well as endogenous TLR inhibitors, IRAK-M and Tollip by Western blotting. In contrast to PG-LPS tolerisation, E. coli K12-LPS induced ET failed to exhibit a subset-specific response with respect to the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFα, whereas exhibited a differential response for IL-10 and IL-6. TNFα expression and secretion was significantly suppressed in both M1- and -like Mφs. IL-10 and IL-6, on the other hand, were suppressed in M1s and refractory to suppression in M2s. ET suppressed TLR4 mRNA, but not TLR4 protein, yet induced differential augmentation of the negative regulatory molecules, Tollip in M1 and IRAK-M in  Mφs. In conclusion, E. coli K12-LPS differentially tolerises Mφ subsets at the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines, associated with a subset-specific divergence in negative regulators and independent of TLR4 down-regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31057560>TonEBP Suppresses the HO-1 Gene by Blocking Recruitment of Nrf2 to Its Promoter.</a></h2><p>TonEBP is a key transcriptional activator in macrophages with an M1 phenotype. High expression of TonEBP is associated with many inflammatory diseases. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress-inducible protein, is induced by various oxidative and inflammatory signals, and its expression is regarded as an adaptive cellular response to inflammation and oxidative injury. Here, we show that TonEBP suppresses expression of HO-1 by blocking Nrf2 binding to the HO-1 promoter, thereby inducing polarization of macrophages to the M1 phenotype. Inhibition of HO-1 expression or activity significantly reduced the inhibitory responses on M1 phenotype and stimulatory effects on  phenotype by TonEBP knockdown. Additional experiments showed that HO-1 plays a role in the paracrine anti-inflammatory effects of TonEBP knockdown in macrophages. Identification of HO-1 as a downstream effector of TonEBP provides new possibilities for improved therapeutic approaches to inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967876>Preferential Infiltration of Unique Vγ9Jγ2-Vδ2 T Cells Into Glioblastoma Multiforme.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is clinically highly aggressive as a result of evolutionary dynamics induced by cross-talk between cancer cells and a heterogeneous group of immune cells in tumor microenvironment. The brain harbors limited numbers of immune cells with few lymphocytes and macrophages; thus, innate-like lymphocytes, such as γδ T cells, have important roles in antitumor . Here, we characterized GBM-infiltrating γδ T cells, which may have roles in regulating the GBM tumor microenvironment and cancer cell gene expression. V(D)J repertoires of tumor-infiltrating and blood-circulating γδ T cells from four patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing-based T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in addition to mutation and immune profiles in four GBM cases. In all tumor tissues, abundant innate and effector/memory lymphocytes were detected, accompanied by large numbers of tumor-associated macrophages and closely located tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells, which appear to have anti-tumor activity. The immune-related gene expression analysis using the TCGA database showed that the signature gene expression extent of γδ T cells were more associated with those of cytotoxic T and Th1 cells and M1 macrophages than those of Th2 cells and  macrophages. Although the most abundant γδ T cells were Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in both tumor tissues and blood, the repertoire of intratumoral Vγ9Vδ2 T cells was distinct from that of peripheral blood Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and was dominated by Vγ9Jγ2 sequences, not by canonical Vγ9JγP sequences that are mostly commonly found in blood γδ T cells. Collectively, unique GBM-specific TCR clonotypes were identified by comparing TCR repertoires of peripheral blood and intra-tumoral γδ T cells. These findings will be helpful for the elucidation of tumor-specific antigens and development of anticancer immunotherapies using tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562937>Divergent Roles of Kupffer Cell TLR2/3 Signaling in Alcoholic Liver Disease and the Protective Role of EGCG.</a></h2><p>Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR3 regulate hepatic  under pathological conditions, but their functions and potential drug targets in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remain poorly understood.ALD-associated liver injury were induced in TLR2 knockout (TLR2), TLR3, TLR2 bone marrow transplanted (BMT), TLR3 BMT, IL-10 mice, and their wild-type littermates through ethanol challenge with or without co-administered epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Moreover, Kupffer cells were depleted by GdCl injection to evaluate their pathogenic roles in ALD.We identified that deficiency of TLR2 and TLR3 significantly alleviated and aggravated ALD-induced liver injury, respectively. Mechanistically, Kupffer cell inactivation, M1 to  polarization, and IL-10 production via STAT3 activation contributed to hepatic protection mediated by concurrent TLR2 inhibition and TLR3 agonism. These findings were further confirmed in TLR2 and TLR3 BMT mice. We also identified a novel ALD-protective agent EGCG which directly interacted with Kupffer cell TLR2/3 to induce IL-10 production. Deficiency of IL-10 aggravated ALD injury and blunted EGCG-mediated hepatoprotection while depletion of Kupffer cells partially recovered liver injury but abolished EGCG's actions.Altogether, our results illustrate the divergent roles of Kupffer cells TLR2/3 in ALD progression via anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Reprogramming these TAMs toward an M1 phenotype could thwart their pro-cancer activities and unleash anti-tumor , but efforts to accomplish this are nonspecific and elicit systemic inflammation. Here we describe a targeted nanocarrier that can deliver in vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding M1-polarizing transcription factors to reprogram TAMs without causing systemic toxicity. We demonstrate in models of ovarian cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma that infusions of nanoparticles formulated with mRNAs encoding interferon regulatory factor 5 in combination with its activating kinase IKKβ reverse the immunosuppressive, tumor-supporting state of TAMs and reprogram them to a phenotype that induces anti-tumor  and promotes tumor regression. We further establish that these nanoreagents are safe for repeated dosing.

It is, therefore, particularly important to develop a universal vaccine against conserved proteins or conserved regions of the virus. In this study, we used N-terminal extracellular region of the influenza virus  protein (M2e) as the target antigen and constructed two optimized M2e DNA vaccines (p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e) with increased antigenic epitope density and enhanced antigen secretion. Both vaccines induced high M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice. These two vaccines also conferred protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 virus, with p-tPA-p3M2e being the most effective. In addition, p-tPA-p3M2e also showed cross-protection against different subtypes of the influenza virus (H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8) at varying rates (80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively). After passive immunization, M2e DNA vaccine-induced antibodies in the sera provided complete protection against homologous virus challenge. An analysis of the mechanism underlying this immunization-mediated protection indicates that M2e-specific IgG and T-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection and viral clearance. Taken together, our results indicate that this optimized M2e DNA vaccine is a promising candidate for the development of a universal, broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141689>Sterile Lung Inflammation Induced by Silica Exacerbates Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection via STING-Dependent Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Lung inflammation induced by silica impairs host control of tuberculosis, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that silica-driven exacerbation of M. tuberculosis infection associates with raised type 2 . Silica increases pulmonary Th2 cell and  macrophage responses, while reducing type 1  after M. tuberculosis infection. Silica induces lung damage that prompts extracellular self-DNA release and activates STING. This STING priming potentiates M. tuberculosis DNA sensing by and activation of cGAS/STING, which triggers enhanced type I interferon (IFNI) response and type 2 . cGAS-, STING-, and IFNAR-deficient mice are resistant to silica-induced exacerbation of M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, silica-induced self-DNA primes the host response to M. tuberculosis-derived nucleic acids, which increases type 2  while reducing type 1 , crucial for controlling M. tuberculosis infection.

Uni- and multivariable CKD odds ratios (OR) were calculated based on the D:A:D score that summarizes clinical CKD risk factors and a polygenic risk score that summarizes genetic information from 86613 single nucleotide polymorphisms..We included 743 cases (79% male; median age, 42 years; baseline eGFR 106 mL/min/1.73 ) with confirmed eGFR drop to <60 mL/min/1.73  (n=144) or ≥25% eGFR drop to <90 mL/min/1.73  (n=599), and 322 controls (eGFR drop <15%; 81% male; median age, 39 years, baseline eGFR 107 mL/min/1.73 ). Polygenic risk score and D:A:D score contributed to CKD. In multivariable analysis, CKD ORs were 2.13 (95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.97) in participants in the 4th (most unfavorable) vs. 1st (most favorable) genetic score quartile; 1.94 (1.37-2.65) in the 4th vs. 1st D:A:D score quartile; and 2.98 (2.02-4.66), 1.70 (1.29-2.29), and 1.83 (1.45-2.40), per 5-years exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, respectively. Participants in the 1st genetic score quartile had no increased CKD risk, even if they were in the 4th D:A:D score quartile.Genetic score increased CKD risk similar to clinical D:A:D score and potentially nephrotoxic antiretrovirals. Irrespective of D:A:D score, individuals with the most favorable genetic background may be protected against CKD.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we examined the expression of TLRs in salivary glands (SGs) from patients with IgG4-RD.SGs of 15 patients with IgG4-RD, 15 with Sjögren's syndrome (SS), 10 with chronic sialoadenitis and 10 healthy controls were examined histologically. Gene expression of TLR family (TLR1-TLR10) was analyzed by DNA microarray in submandibular glands (SMGs). Upregulation of TLRs was confirmed in SGs from patients with IgG4-RD. Finally, the phenotype of human TLR7 (huTlr7) transgenic (Tg) C57BL/6 mice before/after stimulation with TLR agonist was assessed.In patients with IgG4-RD, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were overexpressed. PCR validated the upregulation of TLR7 in IgG4-RD compared with the other groups. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed strong infiltration of TLR7-positive cells in the SGs of patients with IgG4-RD. Double immunohistochemical staining showed that TLR7 expression co-localized with CD163  macrophages. After in vitro stimulation with TLR7 agonist, CD163  macrophages were observed more production of IL-33, which is a Th2 activating cytokine. In huTlr7 Tg mice, the focus and fibrosis score in SMGs, pancreas, and lungs were significantly higher than those in wild-type mice (p<0.05). Moreover, the concentration of serum IgG, IgG1, and IL-33 in huTlr7 Tg mice was distinctly increased upon stimulation with TLR7 agonist (p<0.05).TLR7-expressing  macrophages may promote the activation of Th2 immune responses via IL-33 secretion in IgG4-RD.

In this study, we established a novel role for miR-92 and its associated gene networks in immunosuppression. CSCs were isolated from the B16-F10 murine melanoma cell line based on expression of the putative CSC marker CD133 (Prominin-1). CD133 cells were functionally distinct from CD133 cells and showed increased proliferation  and enhanced tumorigenesis . CD133 CSCs also exhibited a greater capacity to recruit immunosuppressive cell types during tumor formation, including FoxP3 Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and  macrophages. Using microarray technology, we identified several miRs that were significantly downregulated in CD133 cells compared with CD133 cells, including miR-92. Decreased expression of miR-92 in CSCs led to higher expression of target molecules integrin α and α subunits, which, in turn, enhanced TGFβ activation, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of SMAD2. CD133 cells transfected with miR-92a mimic and injected  showed significantly decreased tumor burden, which was associated with reduced immunosuppressive phenotype intratumorally. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas database of patients with melanoma, we also noted a positive correlation between integrin α and TGFβ1 expression levels and an inverse association between miR-92 expression and integrin alpha subunit expression. Collectively, this study suggests that a miR-92-driven signaling axis involving integrin activation of TGFβ in CSCs promotes enhanced tumorigenesis through induction of intratumoral immunosuppression. SIGNIFICANCE: CD133 cells play an active role in suppressing melanoma antitumor  by modulating miR-92, which increases influx of immunosuppressive cells and TGFβ1 expression.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705422>Itaconate: the poster child of metabolic reprogramming in macrophage function.</a></h2><p>Itaconate is one of the best examples of the consequences of metabolic reprogramming during . It is made by diverting aconitate away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle during inflammatory macrophage activation. The main reason macrophages exhibit this response currently appears to be for an anti-inflammatory effect, with itaconate connecting cell metabolism, oxidative and electrophilic stress responses and immune responses. A role for itaconate in the regulation of type I interferons during viral infection has also been described, as well as in  macrophage function under defined circumstances. Finally, macrophage-specific itaconate production has also been shown to have a pro-tumour effect. All of these studies point towards itaconate being a critical immunometabolite that could have far-reaching consequences for , host defence and tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30910350>Clinical implications of macrophage dysfunction in the development of osteoarthritis of the knee.</a></h2><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritic disease, leading to disability and impaired quality of life and no curative treatments exist. Increasing evidence indicates that low-grade inflammation plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of OA. In this review, we summarize emerging findings on the pathological roles of synovial macrophages, adipose tissue macrophages, and osteoclasts in OA and their potential clinical implications from cell biology to preclinical and preliminary clinical trials. The failure of synovial macrophages to transition from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  subtypes may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of synovitis in OA. M1 macrophages promote the inflammatory microenvironment and progression of OA through interactions with synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes, thus increasing the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases. Direct inhibition of M1 or promotion of  polarization may be useful therapeutic interventions. Adipose tissue macrophages present in the infrapatella fat pad (IPFP) were involved in the progression of obesity-induced OA, which contributed to changes in the integrity of the IPFP. Furthermore, macrophages and osteoclasts in the subchondral bone were involved in bone remodeling and pain through uncoupled osteoclast/osteoblast activity and increased nociceptive signaling. Growing evidence has indicated an important role for macrophage-mediated low-grade inflammation in OA. Fully understanding the link between macrophages and other cells in joints will provide new insights into OA disease modification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we modified the oncolytic group B adenovirus enadenotucirev to express a stroma-targeted bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). This BiTE bound fibroblast activation protein on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and CD3ε on T cells, leading to potent T-cell activation and fibroblast death. Treatment of fresh clinical biopsies, including malignant ascites and solid prostate cancer tissue, with FAP-BiTE-encoding virus induced activation of tumor-infiltrating PD1 T cells to kill CAFs. In ascites, this led to depletion of CAF-associated immunosuppressive factors, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased gene expression of markers of antigen presentation, T-cell function, and trafficking. -like ascites macrophages exhibited a proinflammatory repolarization, indicating spectrum-wide alteration of the tumor microenvironment. With this approach, we have actively killed both cancer cells and tumor fibroblasts, reversing CAF-mediated immunosuppression and yielding a potent single-agent therapeutic that is ready for clinical assessment. SIGNIFICANCE: An engineered oncolytic adenovirus that encodes a bispecific antibody combines direct virolysis with endogenous T-cell activation to attack stromal fibroblasts, providing a multimodal treatment strategy within a single therapeutic agent.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054870>DNA from virulent M. tuberculosis induces TNF-α production and autophagy in M1 polarized macrophages.</a></h2><p>The macrophage innate immune response is outlined through recognition of the components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DNA of M. tuberculosis (MtbDNA) is recognized by macrophages, but the implications of this recognition are poorly characterized. Stimulation of murine macrophages with MtbDNA induces autophagy, a process that promotes elimination of intracellular pathogens. However, it remains unknown whether this or other phenomena also occur in human cells. In this work, we studied the innate response profiles of human macrophages after stimulation with DNA from virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were polarized into M1 and  phenotypes and stimulated with MtbDNA. The plasma membrane markers of the phenotype, production of TNF-α, and induction of autophagy were evaluated. Our results indicate that MtbDNA induced phenotypical changes, the significant production of TNF-α, and autophagy confirmed by the augmented expression of  related GTPase M (IRGM) and autophagy related ATG16L1 genes in M1 macrophages, whereas  macrophages exhibited limited responses. In addition, MtbDNA activation was TLR-9-dependent. Although TLR-9 expression was similar between M1 and  macrophages, only M1 macrophages were fully responsive to MtbDNA. In conclusion, MtbDNA recognition enhanced the antimicrobial mechanisms of M1 macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although baicalin can induce  macrophage polarization, we still do not know the subtype of macrophages polarized by baicalin. In this study, we characterized that murine bone marrow derived macrophages induced by M-CSF can be further polarized into  phenotype by baicalin. The signatures of  macrophages for mRNA expression like interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), MERTK and PTX3 were up-regulated. Moreover, we observed the concomitantly decreasing of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-  ), interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), IL-6. In contrast,  macrophages polarized by IL-4 increased gene transcript of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and surface marker of CD206 indicates that their identity as  rather than  subtypes. Interestingly, the phagocytosis as well as efferocytosis activity were significantly enhanced in  macrophage polarized by baicalin and these capacities were associated with the expression of MERTK receptor. Finally, we conclude that baicalin induced  macrophages polarization with both elevations of efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30555483> β-Glucan Differentiates Human Monocytes Into a Specific Subset of Macrophages.</a></h2><p>β-Glucan derived from cell walls of  is a potent immune modulator. It has been shown to induce trained  in monocytes via epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming and to protect from lethal sepsis if applied prior to infection. Since β-glucan-trained monocytes have not been classified within the system of mononuclear phagocytes we analyzed these cells metabolically, phenotypically and functionally with a focus on monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and compared them with naïve monocytes and other types of monocyte-derived cells such as classically (M1) or alternatively () activated macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). We show that β-glucan inhibits spontaneous apoptosis of monocytes independent from autocrine or paracrine M-CSF release and stimulates monocyte differentiation into macrophages. β-Glucan-differentiated macrophages exhibit increased cell size and granularity and enhanced metabolic activity when compared to naïve monocytes. Although β-glucan-primed cells expressed markers of alternative activation and secreted higher levels of IL-10 after lipopolysaccharide (LPS), their capability to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and to kill bacteria was unaffected. Our data demonstrate that β-glucan priming induces a population of immune competent long-lived monocyte-derived macrophages that may be involved in immunoregulatory processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208190>Dudleya brittonii extract promotes survival rate and -like metabolic change in porcine 3D4/31 alveolar macrophages.</a></h2><p>Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, but studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking. Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment.3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes.This study provides new insights and directions for further researches relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31093687>Microglial priming of antigen presentation and adaptive stimulation in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>The prominent pathological consequences of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the misfolding and mis-sorting of two cellular proteins, amyloid-β and microtubule-associated protein Tau. The accumulation of toxic phosphorylated Tau inside the neurons induces the increased processing of amyloid-β-associated signaling cascade and vice versa. Neuroinflammation-driven synaptic depletion and cognitive decline are substantiated by the cross talk of activated microglia and astroglia, leading to neuron degeneration. Microglia are the brain-resident immune effectors that prove their diverse functions in maintaining CNS homeostasis via collaboration with astrocytes and T lymphocytes. Age-related senescence and chronic inflammation activate microglia with increased pro-inflammatory markers, oxidative damage and phagocytosis. But the improper processing of misfolded protein via lysosomal pathway destines the spreading of 'seed' constituents to the nearby healthy neurons. Primed microglia process and present self-antigen such as amyloid-β and modified Tau to the infiltrated T lymphocytes through MHC I/II molecules. After an effective conversation with CD4 T cells, microglial phenotype can be altered from pro-active M1 to neuro-protective  type, which corresponds to the tissue remodeling and homeostasis. In this review, we are focusing on the change in functionality of microglia from innate to adaptive immune response in the context of neuroprotection, which may help in the search of novel immune therapy in AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290778>Long-term desensitization for ABO-incompatible living related kidney transplantation recipients with high refractory and rebound anti-blood type antibody: case report.</a></h2><p>ABO-incompatible living related kidney transplantation (ABO-iLKT) has increased the possibilities for kidney transplantation in patients with end stage renal disease. Due to advancements in immunosuppressive agents and the identification of immunological conditions following ABO-iLKT, this transplantation technique has achieved the same success rate as ABO-compatible LKT. However, some patients continue to generate anti-blood type antibodies, despite conventional immunosuppressant treatment.A 60-year-old man was referred to our hospital for kidney transplantation. The proposed transplant was ABO incompatible, from a donor with blood-type A to a recipient with blood-type O. The recipient's anti-A blood-type IgG antibody titer was measured at 4096-fold dilution. Following desensitization therapy, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 750 mg/day for 3 months, intravenous Rituximab 200 mg, and two sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis, the anti-A blood-type IgG antibody titer decreased to only 516-fold dilution and did not meet our target of less than 128-fold dilution. MMF was thus continued for an additional 4 months and four additional sessions of plasmapheresis were undertaken. Following these interventions, antibody titers decreased to 128-fold dilution and ABO-iLKT was performed. Following transplant, antibody-mediated rejection was not observed and renal function was preserved. However, a post-operative renal biopsy 1.5 months later showed evidence of T-cell-mediated rejection IB. The patient was treated with steroids, with no increase in serum creatinine.Our findings suggest that the long-term single MMF desensitization therapy could be a suitable option for ABO-iLKT with high refractory and rebound anti-blood type antibody. Further studies are required to establish the optimal immunosuppression regimen to control B cell- mediated  in ABO-iLKT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191522>Notch Signaling Regulates Immune Responses in Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that can cause coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, depending on which arteries are affected. At the beginning of atherosclerosis plasma lipoproteins accumulate in the sub-endothelial space. In response, monocytes migrate from the circulation through the endothelium into the intima where they differentiate into macrophages. These early events trigger a complex immune response that eventually involves many cellular subtypes of both innate and adaptive immunity. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved cell signaling system that mediates cell-to-cell communication. Recent studies have revealed that Notch modulate atherosclerosis by controlling macrophages polarization into M1 or  subtypes. Furthermore, it is known that Notch signaling controls differentiation and activity of T-helper and cytotoxic T-cells in inflammatory diseases. In this review, we will discuss the role of Notch in modulating immunity in the context of atherosclerosis and whether targeting Notch may represent a therapeutic strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779113>Poly(I:C) stimulation is superior than Imiquimod to induce the antitumoral functional profile of tumor-conditioned macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophage plasticity is the ability of mononuclear phagocytes to change phenotype, function, and genetic reprogramming upon encounter of specific local stimuli. In the tumor microenvironment, Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) acquire an immune-suppressive and tumor-promoting phenotype. With the aim to re-educate TAMs to antitumor effectors, in this study, we used two immunestimulatory compounds: the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod (IMQ) and the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C). To better mimic in vitro the response of TAMs, we used Tumor-Conditioned Macrophages (TC-Mϕ) differentiated in the presence of tumor cell supernatants. Our results show that TC-Mϕ respond differently from conventional -polarized macrophages. Upon stimulation with IMQ, TC-Mϕ did not upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) molecules and unexpectedly expressed increased CD206. With both compounds, TC-Mϕ produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than  macrophages. IMQ and Poly(I:C) differed in the types of regulated genes and secreted mediators. Reflecting their signaling pathways, only IMQ significantly induced IL-1β and IL-6, while only Poly(I:C) stimulated CXCL10, and both upregulated CCL5. Of note, using a novel cytotoxicity assay, Poly(I:C), but not IMQ, was effective in triggering the cytotoxic activity of TC-Mϕ against cancer cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that Poly(I:C) stimulation of TC-Mϕ is superior than IMQ in terms of macrophage re-education toward antitumor effectors.© 2019 The Authors.

They are involved in various processes, such as phagocytosis, innate and adaptive immunity, proinflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory () activity, depending on the tissue microenvironment. They play a crucial role in pregnancy, and their dysfunction or alteration of polarity is involved in pregnancy disorders, like preeclampsia, recurrent spontaneous abortion, infertility, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm labor. About 50-60% of decidual leukocytes are natural killer (NK) cells followed by MФs (the second largest population). MФs are actively involved in trophoblast invasion, tissue and vascular remodeling during early pregnancy, besides their role as major antigen-presenting cells in the decidua. These cells have different phenotypes and polarities in different stages of pregnancy. They have also been observed to enhance tumor growth by their anti-inflammatory activity ( type) and prevent immunogenic rejection. Targeted alteration of polarity (M1- or vice versa) could be a major focus in the future treatment of pregnancy complications. This review is focused on the role of MФs in pregnancy, their involvement in pregnancy disorders, and decidual MФs as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of pregnancy complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501717>Evaluation of Protective  of Peptide Vaccines Composed of a 15-mer N-terminal Matrix Protein 2 and a Helper T-Cell Epitope Derived from Influenza A Virus.</a></h2><p>The matrix protein 2 of influenza A virus (IFAV) has a relatively conserved ectodomain (M2e) composed of 23 amino acids, and M2e-based vaccines have been suggested to induce broad protective  in mice. In this study, we investigated whether N-terminal sequence of M2e (nM2e)-based vaccines with more conserved nM2e could induce influenza viral neutralizing activity. We constructed linear peptide vaccines with an nM2e sequence for PR8 virus (nM2Pr) connected to a probable 17-mer IFAV-derived helper T-cell epitope (ThE: T1, T2, or T3) at its N- or C-terminus. The peptide vaccines induced significant production of nM2e Abs regardless of either type or location of the ThE-epitope in BALB/c mice, while only T3 was effective in C57BL/6 mice. The Abs against nM2Pr-T3 elicited broader binding affinities to the nM2e peptides derived from various IFAVs than those against T3-nM2Pr. In addition, the nM2e-based vaccines efficiently protected the immunized mice from the lethal challenge of PR8 virus. These results suggest that the more conserved nM2e without cysteine will be useful for development of universal peptide vaccines than M2e.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274167>Regulation of Macrophage Activation and Polarization by HCC-Derived Exosomal lncRNA TUC339.</a></h2><p>Exosomes released by cells can serve as vehicles for delivery of biological materials and signals. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nt, which roles are increasingly appreciated in various biological content. Tumor-derived exosomal lncRNAs have been implicated as signaling mediators to orchestrate cell function among neighbor tumor cells. However, the role of tumor-derived lncRNAs in cross-talk with environmental macrophages has yet to be explored. In this paper, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells⁻derived exosomes contain elevated levels of lncRNA TUC339 and that HCC-derived exosomes could be taken up by THP-1 cells. In seeking to dissect the biological function of tumor secreting TUC339 in macrophages, we applied loss-of-function and gain-of-function strategies. We observed increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increased co-stimulatory molecule expression, and enhanced phagocytosis upon suppression of TUC339 by siRNA in THP-1 cells, and the opposite effect upon over-expression of this lncRNA, which indicates that TUC339 was involved in the regulation of macrophage activation. Moreover, we detected an elevated level of TUC339 in M(IL-4) macrophages as compared to M(IFN-γ + LPS) macrophages and a down-regulation of TUC339 expression during M(IL-4)-to-M(IFN-γ + LPS) repolarization and vice versa. Furthermore, suppression of TUC339 in macrophages diminished the expression of M(IL-4) markers upon IL-4 treatment while overexpression of TUC339 in macrophages enhanced M(IL-4) markers upon IFN-γ + LPS treatment, which suggests a critical function of TUC339 in the regulation of macrophage M1/ polarization. Lastly, using microarray analysis, we identified cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, CXCR chemokine receptor binding, Toll-like receptor signaling, FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and cell proliferation are related with TUC339 function in macrophages. Our results provide evidence for a novel regulatory function of tumor-derived exosomal lncRNA TUC339 in environmental macrophages and shed light on the complicated interactions between tumor and immune cells through exosomal lncRNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897162>Inflammatory monocytes are detrimental to the host immune response during acute infection with Cryptococcus neoformans.</a></h2><p>Cryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of invasive fungal infections among immunocompromised patients. However, the cellular constituents of the innate immune response that promote clearance versus progression of infection upon respiratory acquisition of C. neoformans remain poorly defined. In this study, we found that during acute C. neoformans infection, CCR2+ Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes (IM) rapidly infiltrate the lungs and mediate fungal trafficking to lung-draining lymph nodes. Interestingly, this influx of IM is detrimental to the host, since ablating IM or impairing their recruitment to the lungs improves murine survival and reduces fungal proliferation and dissemination. Using a novel conditional gene deletion strategy, we determined that MHC class II expression by IM did not mediate their deleterious impact on the host. Furthermore, although ablation of IM reduced the number of lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and eosinophils in the lungs, the effects of IM were not dependent on these cells. We ascertained that IM in the lungs upregulated transcripts associated with alternatively activated () macrophages in response to C. neoformans, consistent with the model that IM assume a cellular phenotype that is permissive for fungal growth. We also determined that conditional knockout of the prototypical  marker arginase 1 in IM and deletion of the -associated transcription factor STAT6 were not sufficient to reverse the harmful effects of IM. Overall, our findings indicate that C. neoformans can subvert the fungicidal potential of IM to enable the progression of infection through a mechanism that is not dependent on lymphocyte priming, eosinophil recruitment, or downstream  macrophage polarization pathways. These results give us new insight into the plasticity of IM function during fungal infections and the level of control that C. neoformans can exert on host immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716717>p38MAPK/SGK1 signaling regulates macrophage polarization in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized with multifocal demyelination resulting from activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nerve system. Recent reports suggest that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) / serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling pathway contributes to the pathology of MS through regulation of . However, the role of this signaling pathway in MS-related macrophage activation and polarization has not been studied. Here, we used an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS to study the role of p38MAPK/SGK1 signaling in the macrophage polarization and its effects on the development and severity of EAE. Here, we found that p38MAPK/SGK1 signaling is required for IL4-induced  macrophage polarization in vitro. Chitin-induced  macrophage polarization reduces the severity of EAE in mice. Generation of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying sh-p38 or sh-SGK1 under the control of a CD68 promoter successfully knockdown p38 or SGK1 levels in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with AAV-sh-p38 or AAV-sh-SGK1 abolished the effects of Chitin on macrophage polarization and the severity of EAE. Thus, our data suggest that p38MAPK/SGK1 signaling induces  macrophage polarization, which reduces the severity of EAE, a model for MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060902>The Notch ligand DNER regulates macrophage IFNγ release in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide with no curative therapy. A non-canonical Notch ligand, DNER, has been recently identified in GWAS to associate with COPD severity, but its function and contribution to COPD is unknown.DNER localisation was assessed in lung tissue from healthy and COPD patients, and cigarette smoke (CS) exposed mice. Microarray analysis was performed on WT and DNER deficient M1 and  bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), and gene set enrichment undertaken. WT and DNER deficient mice were exposed to CS or filtered air for 3 day and 2 months to assess IFNγ-expressing macrophages and emphysema development. Notch and NFKB active subunits were quantified in WT and DNER deficient LPS-treated and untreated BMDM.Immunofluorescence staining revealed DNER localised to macrophages in lung tissue from COPD patients and mice. Human and murine macrophages showed enhanced DNER expression in response to inflammation. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory DNER deficient BMDMs exhibited impaired NICD1/NFKB dependent IFNγ signalling and reduced nuclear NICD1/NFKB translocation. Furthermore, decreased IFNγ production and Notch1 activation in recruited macrophages from CS exposed DNER deficient mice were observed, protecting against emphysema and lung dysfunction.DNER is a novel protein induced in COPD patients and 6 months CS-exposed mice that regulates IFNγ secretion via non-canonical Notch in pro-inflammatory recruited macrophages. These results provide a new pathway involved in COPD  that could contribute to the discovery of innovative therapeutic targets.This work was supported from the Helmholtz Alliance 'Aging and Metabolic Programming, AMPro'.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. We hypothesized that normal alveolar macrophage (AM) functions, which are central to maintaining lung immune homeostasis, are altered during pregnancy and that this dysregulation contributes to the increased inflammatory response to influenza virus infection.Time-mated BALB/c mice were infected with a low dose of H1N1 influenza A virus at gestation day 9.5. Inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were assessed by flow cytometry.Our findings confirm previous reports of increased severity of influenza virus infection in pregnant mice. The heightened inflammatory response detected in BAL fluid from infected pregnant mice was characterized by neutrophil-rich inflammation with concomitantly reduced numbers of AM, which were slower to return to baseline counts, compared with nonpregnant infected mice. The increased infection severity and inflammatory responses to influenza during pregnancy were associated with a pregnancy-induced shift in AM phenotype at homeostatic baseline, from the M1 (ie, classical activation) state toward the  (ie, alternative activation) state, as evidence by increased expression of CD301 and reduced levels of CCR7.These results show that pregnancy is associated with an alternatively activated phenotype of AM before infection, which may contribute to heightened disease severity.© The Author(s) 2018.

The targeting regulation of miR-217 on pro-inflammatory factor IL-6 was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and western-blot. ELISA assay was used to evaluate the secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 of cells. MiR-217 was found to be downregulated in ovarian cancerous tissues and cell lines. This downregulation correlated with an increased expression of the IL-6, Arg-1, CCR2, and CD206 gene. The overexpression of miR-217 in SKOV3 cells can inhibit the polarization of macrophages towards an -like phenotype. We also found that IL-6 was validated to induce  macrophage polarization and its secretion in SKOV-3 cells was inhibited by miR-217 directly. Moreover, we revealed that miR-217 suppressed  macrophage polarization partly thought JAK/STAT3 signal pathway. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-217 inhibits tumor-induced  macrophage polarization through targeting of IL-6 and regulation JAK3/STAT3 signaling pathway, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for treating ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634164>IL-16 regulates macrophage polarization as a target gene of mir-145-3p.</a></h2><p>Interleukin 16 is an immunomodulatory chemokine that signals through CD4 + T cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Its expression in immune-related cells enhances the antimicrobial effect and inhibits HIV replication in macrophages. However, the role of IL-16 in macrophage polarization is uncertain. Mir-145 was reported to regulate IL-10 expression by targeting histone deacetylase 11 and promotes alternatively activated macrophage () polarization. Mir-145 was also predicted to target IL-16 mRNA. We aimed to explore the roles of IL-16 and mir-145 in macrophage polarization and antimicrobial functions.THP1 monocytes were employed in this study, and their cell activity when incubated with different concentrations of IL-16 was evaluated using the CCK-8 cell counting kit. To obtain polarized macrophages, THP-1 cells were induced by IL-4 and IL-13 following PMA incubation ( polarized macrophages) or induced by IFN-gamma and LPS (M1 classical macrophage activation). The influence of IL-16 on macrophage phagocytosis was quantified by the amount of chicken red blood cell phagocytized. IL-16, IL-10 and miR-145 expression in THP1 monocytes and induced macrophages was quantified by quantitative PCR. The miR-145 and IL-16 targeting relationship was verified by the dual luciferase reporter assay. The influence of IL-16 and mir-145 on macrophage polarization was evaluated by M1 and  macrophage characterized marker gene expression.The M0 macrophage subtype was induced by PMA. The M1 and  subtypes of macrophage were successfully induced by M1- and -specific induction. M1 macrophages express higher levels of IL-16 than  macrophages but express lower levels of IL-10 and mir-145 than  cells. IL-16 with a concentration up to 150 ng/mL has no influence on THP-1 cell proliferation but improves macrophage phagocytosis ability with the down-expression of IL-10 and up-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1a and IL-6. Knockdown with its target siRNA is beneficial for macrophage maintenance but reduces phagocytosis ability. Mir-145 specifically targets the IL-16 3'UTR verified by the dual luciferase reporter assay. Mir-145 downregulates IL-16 expression and upregulates IL-10 expression, thereby promoting  macrophage polarization.IL-16 modulates macrophage polarization through regulating IL-10, IL-1a and IL-6 expression. Mir-145 is involved in  macrophage polarization by targeting IL-16 and enhancing IL-10 expression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this scenario, the cellular and molecular events that decide on implant success and tissue regeneration are played at the interface between the foreign body and the host inflammation, determined by innate and adaptive immune responses. To avoid adverse events, rather than the use of inert scaffolds, current state of the art points to the use of immunomodulatory biomaterials and their knowledge-based use to reduce neutrophil activation, and optimize M1 to  macrophage polarization, Th1 to Th2 lymphocyte switch, and Treg induction. Despite the fact that the field is still evolving and much remains to be accomplished, recent research breakthroughs have provided a broader insight on the correct choice of biomaterial physicochemical modifications to tune the reaction of the host immune system to implanted biomaterial and to favor integration and healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351434>New therapeutic strategies for IPF: Based on the "phagocytosis-secretion-immunization" network regulation mechanism of pulmonary macrophages.</a></h2><p>Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease of known and unknown etiology. Over the past decades, macrophages have been recognized to play a significant role in IPF pathogenesis. According to their anatomical loci, macrophages can be divided to alveolar macrophages (AMs) subtypes and interstitial macrophages subtypes (IMs) with different responsibility in the damage defense response. Depending on diverse chemokines and cytokines in local microenvironments, macrophages can be induced and polarized to either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated () phenotypes in different stages of . Therefore, we hypothesize that there is a "phagocytosis-secretion-immunization" network regulation of pulmonary macrophages related to a number of chemokines and cytokines. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the role of chemokines and cytokines involved in the "phagocytosis-secretion-immunization" network regulation mechanism of pulmonary macrophages, pointing toward novel therapeutic approaches based on the network target regulation in the field. Therapeutic strategies focused on modifying the chemokines, cytokines and the network are promising for the pharmacotherapy of IPF. Some Traditional Chinese medicines may have more superiorities in delaying the progression of pulmonary fibrosis for their multi-target activities of this network regulation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Several studies have shown that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of tumor stroma in GC, may have significant roles in GC progression and resistance to treatments. CAFs are a major source of various secreted molecules in the tumor microenvironment, which stimulate cancer cells and other noncancerous components of GC. Surprisingly, these factors could be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Cytokines, including interleukin-6 and interleukin-11, or growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor produced from CAFs, can directly activate GC cells and consequently lead to the development of an aggressive phenotype. Galectin-1 or hepatocyte growth factor can be involved in CAF-derived neovascularization in GC. In addition, recent studies showed that CAFs can affect tumor immunity through  polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. Finally, the current study aimed to introduce several inhibitory agents and evaluate their suppressive effects on CAFs in patients with GC progression. However, further studies are required to evaluate their safety and select appropriate patients for application in clinical settings.</p></html>
