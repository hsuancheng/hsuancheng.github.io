We present neutron scattering under pressure in a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet that has a quantum disorder in the low-pressure phase and a noncollinear structure in the high-pressure phase. The neutron spectrum continuously evolves through critical pressure; a single mode in the disordered state becomes soft with the pressure and it splits into gapless and gapped modes in the ordered phase. Extended spin-wave theory reveals that the longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of spins are hybridized in the modes because of noncollinearity, and previously unidentified magnetic excitations are formed. We report a new hybridization of the phase and amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter near a quantum critical point in a spontaneously symmetry-broken state.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, the general approach to achieve high piezoelectric properties by establishing morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) has limitation due to the weak anisotropy of the Gibbs free  profile at MPB region. Here, aliovalent Sm3+ doped 0.4Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-(0.6-x)PbZrO3-xPbTiO3 piezoelectric ceramics were fabricated by solid state method, where the optimized piezoelectric coefficient d33 = 910 pC/N, dielectric constant εr = 4090 and Curie temperature TC =184 °C, were obtained at x=0.352, being attributed to the synergistic contributions from the MPB and enhanced local structural heterogeneity. Rayleigh analysis was adopted to study the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in Sm-doped PMN-PZ-PT ceramics, where the extrinsic contribution was found to be on the order of 25-67% at 4 kV/cm. Of particular significance is that a large signal d33* = 820 pm/V (at 20 kV/cm) with minimal strain variation of % was achieved for composition of x=0.372 over temperature range of 20-160 °C, being superior to those previously reported piezoelectric ceramic materials. This work offers a good paradigm to simultaneously achieve high piezoelectric properties with good temperature stability in ferroelectric ceramics, which have great potential for piezoelectric application at elevated temperature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660605>Back to Basics: Laser Safety.</a></h2><p>Surgeons use lasers for a variety of inpatient and outpatient procedures.

Semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are co-dispersed in a liquid crystalline (LC) matrix and directed to form self-similar assemblies by leveraging the host's thermotropic phase transition. These co-assemblies, comprising 6 nm CdSe/ZnS QDs and -20 nm FeO MNPs, bridge nano- to micron length scales, and can be modulated in situ by applied magnetic fields <250 mT, resulting in an enhancement of QD photoluminescence (PL). This effect is reversible in co-assemblies with  and 10 nm MNPs but demonstrates hysteresis in those with 20 nm MNPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and  dispersive spectroscopy reveal that at the nanoscale, while the QDs are densely packed into the center of the co-assemblies, the MNPs are relatively uniformly dispersed through the cluster volume. Using Lorentz TEM, it is observed that MNPs suspended in LC rotate to align with the applied field, which is attributed to be the cause of the observed PL increase at the micro-scale. This study highlights the critical role of correlating multiscale spectroscopy and microscopy characterization in order to clarify how interactions at the nanoscale manifest in microscale functionality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669580>Ecological momentary assessment of the snacking environments of children from racially/ethnically diverse households.</a></h2><p>Children consume nearly one-third of their daily  intake as snacks (i.e., eating occasions that occur between meals); thus there is a growing interest in understanding what snacking occasions look like in the homes of young children. This study makes use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 1) examine differences in the contextual factors, including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and overall atmosphere, between meal and snack occasions; and 2) explore differences in the context of snacking occasions across children's gender and weight status. Data for the current study came from the Family Matters Study, which included 150 families with children aged -7 years old (n = 25 from each of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, White). Parents completed an 8-day EMA observation period, during which they were surveyed after each eating occasion with the study child; questions explored contextual factors including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and the overall atmosphere of each eating occasion. Differences between meals and snacks were observed; a smaller percentage of snacks (compared to meals) were prepared by the parent, consisted of only homemade food, and were planned ahead of time, as opposed to being served in response to a child's request. Snacks were more likely than other meals to be eaten on the couch and in the presence of a screen. Furthermore, important differences in snacking context were observed by child gender and weight status. Findings illuminate opportunities to improve children's overall dietary intake via interventions focused on improving the quality of foods served during snacks, as well as the contextual environment in which snacks are eaten.Copyright © 2019.

Participants were a sample of college-aged students (mean age = 20.1 (1.7) years; 13 females, 17 males). Participants completed six structured 10-minute exercise sessions on a treadmill with speeds ranging from 53.6 m·min to 187.7 m·min. Indirect calorimetry was used as the criterion. Participants wore the Apple Watch, LifeTrak, and Fitbit activity monitors on their wrists. Group-level agreement was examined using equivalence testing, relative agreement was examined using Spearman's rho, and individual-level agreement was examined using Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and Bland-Altman Plots. Activity monitor agreement with indirect calorimetry was supported using the Apple Watch at 160.9 m·min (Mean difference = -2.7 kcals, 90% C.I.: -8.3 kcals, 2.8 kcals; MAPE = 11.9%; r = 0.64) and 187.7 m·min (Mean difference = 3.7 kcals, 90% C.I.: -2.2 kcals, 9.7 kcals; MAPE = 10.7%; r = 0.72) and the Fitbit at 187.7 m·min (Mean difference = -0.2 kcals, 90% C.I.: -8.8 kcals, 8. kcals; MAPE = 20.1%; r = 0.44). No evidence for statistical equivalence was seen for the LifeTrak at any speed. Bland-Altman Plot Limits of Agreement were narrower for the Apple Series 1 Watch compared to other monitors, especially at slower treadmill speeds. The results support the utility of the Apple Series 1 Watch and Fitbit Charge HR for assessing  expenditure during specific treadmill running speeds in young adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668070>Viewpoint: Atomic-Scale Design Protocols toward , Electronic, Catalysis, and Sensing Applications.</a></h2><p>Nanostructured materials are essential building blocks for the fabrication of new devices for  harvesting/storage, sensing, catalysis, magnetic, and optoelectronic applications.

Hitherto, sorbents developed for this technology have exclusively been designed to perform one water harvesting cycle (WHC) per day, but the productivities attained with this approach cannot reasonably meet the rising demand for drinking water. This work shows that a microporous aluminum-based metal-organic framework, MOF-303, can perform an adsorption-desorption cycle within minutes under a mild temperature swing, which opens the way for high-productivity water harvesting through rapid, continuous WHCs. Additionally, the favorable dynamic water sorption properties of MOF-303 allow it to outperform other commercial sorbents displaying excellent steady-state characteristics under similar experimental conditions. Finally, these findings are implemented in a new water harvester capable of generating 1.3 L kg  day in an indoor arid environment (32% relative humidity, 27 °C) and 0.7 L kg  day in the Mojave Desert (in conditions as extreme as 10% RH, 27 °C), representing an improvement by 1 order of magnitude over previously reported devices. This study demonstrates that creating sorbents capable of rapid water sorption dynamics, rather than merely focusing on high water capacities, is crucial to reach water production on a scale matching human consumption.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668064>Transmission Electron Microscopy and Electron -Loss Spectroscopy Studies of Hole-Selective Molybdenum Oxide Contacts in Silicon Solar Cells.</a></h2><p>In this study, sub-stochiometric hole-selective molybdenum oxide (MoOx) contacts in crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells were investigated by a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and spatially-resolved electron -loss spectroscopy (SR-EELS). It was observed that a ≈ 4 nm SiOx interlayer grows at the MoOx/c-Si interface during the evaporation of MoOx over c-Si substrate. SR-EELS analyses revealed the presence of 1. nm diffused MoOx/ITO (indium tin oxide) interface in both as-deposited and annealed samples. Moreover, the presence of a 1 nm thin layer with a lower oxidation state of Mo was detected at SiOx/MoOx interface in as-deposited state which disappears upon annealing. Overall, it was evident that no hole-blocking interlayer is formed at MoOx/ITO interface during annealing and homogenization of the MoOx layer takes place during the annealing process. Furthermore, device simulations revealed that efficient hole collection is dependent on MoOx work function and that reduction in work function of MoOx results in loss of band bending and negatively impacts hole-selectivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Rate: A Case Study.</a></h2><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases oxygen consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on  expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670429>Polymorphous Luminescent Materials Based on 'T'-Shaped Molecules Bearing 4,7-Diphenylbenzo[c][1,2,]thiadiazole Skeletons: Effect of Substituents on the Photophysical Properties.</a></h2><p>Polymorphism, the intrinsic character of one chemical compound with at least two distinct phase arrangements, plays a very key role in the photophysical properties.

The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt ( µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, -dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance. Given the lack of known side effects of Pt, this study strengthens the candidacy of this natural phenol as an anti-obesity nutraceutical.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665018>A metabolic reconstruction of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112 and analysis of its potential as a cell factory.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative Lactic Acid Bacterium (LAB) that is commonly used for food fermentations and probiotic purposes. Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale metabolic models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational metabolic engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate metabolic model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the metabolism were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic pathways, the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathways, varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these pathways result in different  yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these pathways in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central metabolism demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general metabolic engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict metabolic behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672362>Arsenic enrichment in groundwater and associated health risk in Bari doab region of Indus basin, Punjab, India.</a></h2><p>Contaminated groundwater is considered as one of the most important pathways of human exposure to the geogenic contaminants. Present study has been conducted in a part of Indus basin to investigate the presence and spatial distribution of arsenic (As) and other trace metals in groundwater. The As concentration varies from bdl-255.6 μg/L and 24.6% of the 73 collected groundwater samples have As above world health organization (WHO) guideline of 10 μg/L. High concentration of As is found along the newer alluvium of Ravi River. As is found with high bicarbonate (HCO) and Iron (Fe) and low nitrate (NO) indicating reductive dissolution of Fe bearing minerals. However, silicate weathering along with high sulphate (SO) and positive oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) indicates mixed redox conditions. Weathering of minerals along with other major hydrogeochemical process are responsible for composition of groundwater. With 31.% of the samples, sodium bicarbonate (Na-HCO) is the major water facies followed by magnesium bicarbonate (Mg-HCO) in 30% of samples. As, Fe and other trace metals including copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn) were used to calculate the health risk for children and adults in the region. Out of 73 samples, 58% has high Fe, 32.8% has high Zn, and 4.1% has high Cd which are above the prescribed limits of WHO guidelines. Health risk of the population has been assessed using chronic dose index (CDI), hazardous quotients (HQ) and hazardous index (HI) for children and adults. The mean CDI values follows the order as Fe > Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Cd, while the HQ values indicates high As hazards for both children and adults. 43.8% of the groundwater samples have high HI for adults, however, 49.3% has high HI for children indicating higher risk for children compared to adults. A large-scale testing should be prioritized to test the wells for As and other trace metals in the study region to reduce health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the major challenges for Li-O2 batteries is the high charge overpotential, which results in a low  efficiency. In this work size-selected subnanometer Ir clusters are used to investigate cathode materials that can help control lithium superoxide formation during discharge, which has good electronic conductivity needed for low charge potentials. It is found that Ir particles can lead to lithium superoxide formation as the discharge product with Ir particle sizes of ~1. nm giving the lowest charge potentials. During discharge these 1. nm Ir nanoparticles surprisingly evolve to larger ones while incorporating Li to form core-shell structures with Ir3Li shells, which probably act as templates for growth of lithium superoxide during discharge. Various characterization techniques including DEMS, Raman, titration, and HRTEM are used to characterize the LiO2 discharge product and the evolution of the Ir nanoparticles. Density functional calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism for formation of the core-shell Ir3Li particles.

In a validated setup, a cyclic loading protocol was applied with increasing axial force (750 cycles, 250-750 N) followed by load to failure. Construct survival,  absorbed, construct stiffness, and load to failure were assessed. Descriptive and opto-metric methods were used to describe the mode of failure.All constructs failed with loads below 1500 N. With regard to  absorbed until failure, the ANTE group resisted to 3.763 × 10 N*cycles (range 3.760 × 10-3.763 × 10) and the RETRO group to 3.762 × 10 N*cycles (range 3.761 × 10-3.765 × 10; p = 1.0). The load to failure was 1254 N (range 977-1299) in the ANTE group and 1234 N (range 1087-1456) in the RETRO group (p = 1.0). Construct stiffness with 250 N was not different between the two groups (ANTE 192 N/mm vs. RETRO 215 N/mm, p = 0.486). In all samples, the mode of failure was a transiliac fracture with screw breakout due to rotation of the pubic fragment around the axis of the screw with a range of rotational motion [ROM] during cyclic testing of 0.96° in one ANTE sample and 0.82° in one RETRO sample for 750 N, and ROM at failure of 2.53° in one ANTE sample and 2.23° in one RETRO sample.

The evaluation of sound was performed using evolutionary spectral analysis on the program MATLAB. Parameters such as sound type, amplitude, duration, and  were evaluated in a time-frequency analysis. Changes in mean amplitude levels of opening/closing TMJ sounds before therapy and 6 weeks after insertion of splints were compared using paired-samples t test. The level of significance was set at %.The patients showed a decrease in the mean amplitude and  values of opening/closing sounds after 6 weeks of ARS use (P < .05). According to evolutionary spectral analysis, the use of ARS was efficient for 7 of 19 right joints (37%) and 11 of 25 left joints (44%).The results suggest that the use of 6-week ARS reduced amplitude and  parameters of TMJ sounds; however, it did not completely eliminate TMJ sounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670940>Self-Assembled Conductive Metal-Oxide Nanofiber Interface for Stable Li-Metal Anode.</a></h2><p>Li-metal anodes promise to build high--storage systems, but they suffer safety problems from severe dendrite growth. Here, we develop a thin and conformal hybrid ionic & electronic conducting metal-oxide nanofiber interface to stabilize Li-anodes without forming dendrites. The thin ionic-conductive Li0.33La0.56TiO3 (LLTO) nanofiber film is first fabricated by electrospinning followed by pyrolysis. After connecting with the electrolytes-wetted Li-metal anodes, due to the self-driven chemical reactions, LLTO is reduced and a hybrid conducting interface is developed. The interface can act as a reservoir to redistribute the nonuniform Li-ion flux above the anode surface, and reduce the driving force of dendrite formation by leveling electric potential distribution, enabling a stable Li plating-stripping with a low overpotential of 80 mV over 800 h at a high current of  mA/cm2. More practically, the Li-LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells deliver a high capacity of 147 mA h/g at 1 C with a Coulombic efficiency of 99% over 150 cycles, offering prospects to achieve reliable Li-metal batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670015>Tannic acid modified MoS nanosheet membranes with superior water flux and ion/dye rejection.</a></h2><p>-efficient membranes are urgently needed for water desalination and separation due to ever-increasing demand for fresh water. However, it is extremely challenging to increase membrane water flux and simultaneously achieve high rejection rates of cations or organic dyes. Herein, we report a tannic acid (TA) assisted exfoliation method to fabricate TA-modified MoS (TAMoS) nanosheets with high production yield (90 ± %). The TAMoS nanosheets membranes show excellent non-swelling stability in water. It is found that a hybrid membrane with 1 wt% of TAMoS in MoS nanosheets demonstrates overall better performance than pure MoS and TAMoS membrane. Such a hybrid membrane with a thickness of  µm shows fast water flux at around 32 L m h (LMH) and >97% rejection of various cations under static diffusion mode. Under vacuum-driven filtration condition, the as-prepared hybrid membrane demonstrates ultrafast water flux of 15,000 ± 100 L/(m h bar) and 99.87 ± 0.1% rejection of multiple model organic dyes. To the best of our knowledge, the above performances are superior to those of all MoS-based membranes reported previously in terms of water flux and ion/dye rejection. This work represents a leap forward towards the practical applications of 2D TAMoS membranes in various engineering and environmental areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, methods to recover these reservoirs efficiently are of importance to guarantee  supply. Here we report our novel stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of indigenous bacterial communities with changes in water cut in reservoirs by high-throughput sequencing technology, and reveal the mechanism and characteristics of the crude oil biotreatment under different crude oil-water ratio conditions and the optimum activation time of indigenous functional microbial groups in reservoirs. The indigenous microbial metabolism products were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that Acinetobacter (47.1%) and Pseudomones (19.8%) were the main functional genus of crude oil degradation at the optimal activation time, and can reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 8.33 to .75 mPa·s. The dominant bacteria genus for oil recovery after activation of the production fluids was similar to those in the reservoirs with water cut of 60-80%. Furthermore seven mechanism pathways of enhancing oil recovery by the synergistic of functional microbial groups and their metabolites under different water cut conditions in low permeability reservoirs have been established.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661440>Modelling gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment: when current knowledge needs to encounter engineering practice and vice versa.</a></h2><p>Gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment processes has received considerable attention over the last decades from both academia and industry. Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant  expenditure, acid-base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for oxygen mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of oxygen and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670203>Rheology improvement in an osmotic membrane bioreactor for waste sludge anaerobic digestion and the implication on agitation  consumption.</a></h2><p>Sludge rheology is an essential factor for anaerobic digestion (AD) processes to control the agitation  consumption. In this study, the sludge rheology was characterized for an osmotic membrane bioreactor and a conventional sludge anaerobic digestion reactor as the solid content being increased from 3.-3.7% to 7.-7.7%. The flow curves were fitted using different rheological models and the mechanism was discussed. The sludge from the osmotic membrane bioreactor exhibited obviously better rheological properties than that of the conventional reactor at a solid content of 7.-7.7%. Larger particles induced by less negative zeta potential and higher extracellular polymeric substances, together with the higher conductivity resulted by reverse salt flux in the osmotic membrane bioreactor, improved the sludge rheology due to reduced interactions between particles. As a result, the agitation  consumption of the osmotic membrane bioreactor can save up to 34-39% compared with the conventional one at total solid content of 7.-7.7%.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

First, four types of parameters were calculated, namely, the geometric parameters (7), electronic parameters (), physical and chemical parameters (8), and spectral parameters (7), but the physical and chemical parameters heat of formation (HF) and critical volume (CV) were excluded after the establishment of the 2D-QSAR model. Then, after PCA, it was found that the first principal component represented the main driving factors affecting the molecular genetic toxicity of FQs. In addition, after comprehensive analysis of the factor loading of the first, second, and third principal components, seven parameters affecting the genotoxicity of the FQs were screened out, namely, total  (TE), critical temperature (CT), and molecular weight (Mol Wt) (increased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs) and steric parameter (MR), quadrupole moment Q (Q), quadrupole moment Q (Q), and boiling point (BP) (decreased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs); the above key parameters were also verified by sensitivity analysis. The obtained rules could be used to determine the substitution sites and the substitution groups associated with higher genotoxicity in the process of FQ modification, and these rules agreed well with the hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) model. Finally, it was also found through SPSS analysis that the parameters screened in this paper were significantly correlated with FQ derivatives' genetic toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668060>Bicomponent-random Approach to Synthesis of Donor Polymers for Efficient All-Polymer Solar Cells Processed from A Green Solvent.</a></h2><p>.All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) can offer unique merits of high morphological stability to thermal and mechanical stress. To realize its full potential as flexible or wearable devices, it is highly desirable that the all-PSCs can be fabricated from green solvent with simple post-treatment to avoid thermal annealing on flexible substrate. This proposed a severely challenge on material design to tune their properties with suitable solubility, aggregation, and morphology. To address this challenge, here, a simple bicomponent-random approach on a D-A-type polymer donor was developed by just varying the D-A molar ratio. Under this approach, a series of new random polymers PBDTa-TPDb with different molar ratio of D component of 2D-benzo[1,2-b:4,-b']dithiophene (BDT) and A component of thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) were designed and synthesized. The  levels, light absorption, solubility and packing structure of random donors PBDTa-TPDb were found to vary substantially with the various D-A molar ratio. The devices based PBDTa-TPDb/P(NDI2HD-T) were fabricated to explore the synergistic effects of processing solvent and composition of D-A-type random polymers. The results show that nanoscale morphology, balanced miscibility/crystallinity of blend and photovoltaic properties could be rationally optimized by tuning the composition of random donors. As a result, as-cast all-PSC based optimal donor PBDT5-TPD4 achieves a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.20% processed from green solvent, which performs better than that based reference polymer (PCE: 6.41%). This efficiency is the highest value for all-PSCs from BDT-TPD-based donors. Moreover, the optimized devices exhibited relatively insensitive to the thickness of the active layer and good stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667409>Optimization of the antioxidant-rich xanthone extract from mangosteen (.) pericarp via microwave-assisted extraction.</a></h2><p>Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant properties of xanthone extract from mangosteen pericarp via microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). The MAE extraction conditions to obtain optimum antioxidant-rich xanthone extract were at 2.24 min of irradiation time, 25 mL/g of solvent-to-solid ratio and 71% of ethanol concentration. The predicted results for four responses were as follows; 320.31 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract, 83.63% and 93.77% inhibition (DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays), and 144.56 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract (FRAP, Ferric reducing antioxidant power). The predicted and actual values were statistically insignificant ( > 0.05). Therefore, these results confirmed that the examined model was acceptable and relevant. MAE led to a slightly similar antioxidant capacity and a higher extraction of α-mangostin, a major xanthone of mangosteen pericarp as compared to water bath-maceration technique.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662407>Access to maternal healthcare services among Indigenous women in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, accessing maternal healthcare services (MHC) by Indigenous women in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh.This was a cross-sectional survey among Indigenous women of reproductive age.Two upazillas (subdistricts) of Khagrachhari hill district of the CHT.Indigenous women (15-49 years) within 36 months of delivery were surveyed about accessing MHC services (antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care) for their last pregnancy and delivery.The primary outcome for this analysis is the prevalence of accessing any MHC service and secondary outcome is factors associated with access to MHC services for Indigenous women during their last pregnancy and childbirth.Of 438 Indigenous women (220 Chakma, 100 Marma, 118 Tripura) who participated, 75% were aged 16-30 years. With an 89% response rate, a total of 258 (59%) women reported accessing at least one MHC service (Chakma 51.6%, Marma 28%, Tripura 20.%; p=<0.001). Independent factors associated with accessing MHC after adjusting for clustering were attending secondary school and above (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.9); knowledge about nearest health facilities (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8) and knowledge of pregnancy-related complications (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1. to .8).Findings suggest that the prevalence of accessing MHC services is lower among Indigenous women in the CHT compared with national average. MHC access may be improved through better education and awareness raising of local services.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

The number of conversions is determined from the number of 511 keV photons originating from positron annihilation corrected for the annihilation of positrons in flight. Emission of annihilation photons was determined from the measurements of 511 keV full- peak on two calibrated high-purity germanium detectors. The measurements were performed with two sources of a different construction. The first source was a 1 ml ampoule filled with Sr-90 solution (in equilibrium with Y-90) with an activity of 38.041 MBq inserted into an aluminum absorber. The other source was the evaporation residue of the Sr-90 solution (in equilibrium with Y-90) in a polyethylene absorber. In both cases, the annihilation of positrons occurred in the source materials. The efficiency of 511 keV photon detection was determined by Monte Carlo calculation, where the source was defined as a theoretical continuous positron spectrum with a maximum  of 738 keV. The branching ratio related to the internal pair production during Y-90 decay was determined to be (3.26 ± 0.04) × 10 pairs/decay.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In order to evaluate its feasibility for wetland plants treatment, hydrochars from different wetland plants were produced at different temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C, and 260 °C) and characterized, and the transformation of P was investigated. In comparison with wetland plant derived biochars, the derived hydrochars had a moderate pH (.0-7.7), more oxygen-containing groups, and higher  density (18.0-27.1 MJ kg). These properties were affected by hydrothermal temperature and feedstock choice. In contrast to high water-soluble P in biomass (71.0-73.2% of total P), more recalcitrant P species formed in hydrochars, implying that HTC treatment could achieve P immobilization and reduce P leaching loss. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicated that monoester-P and soluble orthophosphate were transformed to insoluble orthophosphate during the HTC treatment. Therefore, HTC is a promising treatment technique for wetland plants to produce valuable char with P reclamation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The strongest borazine-benzene stacking was found in a parallel-displaced geometry, with a CCSD(T)/CBS interaction  of -3.46 kcal mol-1. The strongest borazine-borazine stacking has a sandwich geometry, with a CCSD(T)/CBS interaction  of -3.57 kcal mol-1. The study showed that borazine forms significant stacking interactions at large horizontal displacements (over 4.

The strength of interactions and their geometrical preferences can be rationalized by observing the electrostatic potentials of borazine and benzene, which is in agreement with SAPT analysis showing that electrostatics is the most important  component for borazine stacking. All the interactions found in crystal structures of borazine and related compounds were identified either as potential curve minima or the geometries obtained from their optimizations.

The custom-designed monolayer electrolyte consists of cobalt crown ether phthalocyanine and lithium ions, which are positioned by field-effect at either the surface of the WSe channel or an h-BN capping layer to achieve '1' or '0', respectively. Bistability in the monolayer electrolyte memory is significantly improved by the h-BN cap, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing enhanced trapping of Li near h-BN due to a ~1.34 eV increase in the absolute value of the adsorption  compared to vacuum. The threshold voltage shift between the two states corresponds to a change in charge density of ~ 2. × 10 cm, and an  ratio exceeding 10 at a back gate voltage of 0 V. The  ratio remains stable after 1000 cycles and the retention time for each state exceeds 6 hours (max measured). When the write time approaches 1 ms, the on/off ratio remains > 10, showing that monolayer electrolyte-gated, 2D non-volatile FET can respond on timescales similar to existing flash memory.

This has not been expected since the twin boundary  of pure Al is very high. TEM methods were used to analyze deposited Al and its nanoscaled twins. DFT methods confirmed that the influence of the substrate is limited to the layers close to the interface. Our findings are different from those achieved by sputtering of Al coatings restricted to a thickness less than 100 nm with twins dominated by epitaxial effects. We propose that in the case of electrodeposition, a high density of twins arises because of fast nucleation and is additionally promoted by a monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen originating from water impurities. Therefore, electrodeposition is a viable approach for tailoring the structure and properties of thicker, deposited Al coatings reinforced by twins.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In this work, 2D gallium oxides and chalcogenides (GaX) derived Janus monolayers Ga2XY (X/Y = O, S, Se, and Te) were designed. Our first-principles calculations showed that apart from Ga2OTe, all the monolayers are thermodynamically, dynamically and mechanically stable. These monolayers are demonstrated to be semiconductors with the band gaps in a wide range of 1.00 - 3.24 eV. The calculated in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of Janus monolayers (d11 = 3.09-.67 pm/V) are demonstrably enhanced with respect to the pristine monolayers (d11 = 0.41-3.04 pm/V). Meanwhile, the yielding additional out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients range from 0.11 to 0.34 pm/V. Interestingly, O-participated Janus monolayers display distinctive properties: dipole direction flipping from O to S/Se, high stabilities and moderate direct-band-gaps. Particularly, Ga2OSe monolayer was found to have the largest piezoelectric coefficient of .67 pm/V, which can be ascribed to the highly imbalanced charge distribution on O and Se as well as the largest bond length differences between Ga-O and Ga-Se. Our study revealed that the Janus Ga2XY monolayers, especially O-related systems, could be pretty promising as candidates in optoelectronic, piezoelectric sensors and  conversion devices.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674607>A water-stable zinc(ii)-organic framework as a multiresponsive luminescent sensor for toxic heavy metal cations, oxyanions and organochlorine pesticides in aqueous solution.</a></h2><p>A novel metal-organic framework with the formula [Zn3(DDB)(DPE)]·H2O (1) (H5DDB = 3,-di(2',4'-dicarboxylphenyl)benzoic acid and DPE = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene) has been solvothermally synthesized by employing a rigid carboxylate ligand H5DDB to assemble with Zn(ii) ions in the presence of a flexible bis(pyridyl) linker DPE. The Zn-MOF is a 3D framework with six-nuclear clusters and possesses remarkable water stability and pH stability. Interestingly, complex 1 can sensitively and selectively sense Fe(iii), Cr(iii), Cr(vi), Mn(vii) and the pesticide 2,6-Dich-4-NA with low detection limits in aqueous solution. Moreover, complex 1 also exhibits selectivity for 2,6-Dich-4-NA detection in real samples including carrot, grape and nectarine extracts, and its detection ability is almost unchanged in the presence of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The possible mechanisms of luminescence quenching have been explained by the weak affinity of nitrogen atoms, resonance  transfer, and photoinduced electron transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a MOF-based multiresponsive fluorescent probe for the simultaneous detection of Fe(iii), Cr(iii/vi), Mn(vii) and the pesticide 2,6-Dich-4-NA in aqueous solution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657747>Effect of a gradually increasing temperature on the behavioural and physiological response of juvenile Hippocampus erectus: Thermal preference, tolerance,  balance and growth.</a></h2><p>The physiological and behavioural responses of ectotherms to temperature is strongly dependent on the individuals' previous thermal history. Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every  days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial  balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36. ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of  assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher  efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Well-documented in terrestrial settings, priming effects describe stimulated heterotrophic microbial activity and decomposition of recalcitrant carbon by additions of labile carbon. In aquatic settings, algae produce labile exudates which may elicit priming during organic matter decomposition, yet the directions and mechanisms of aquatic priming effects remain poorly tested. 2. We tested algal-induced priming during decomposition of two leaf species of contrasting recalcitrance,  and , in experimental streams under light or dark conditions. We measured litter-associated algal, bacterial, and fungal biomass and activity, stoichiometry, and litter decomposition rates over 43 days. 3. Light increased algal biomass and production rates and increased bacterial abundance 141-733% and fungal production rates 20-157%. Incubations with a photosynthesis inhibitor established that algal activity directly stimulated fungal production rates in the short-term. 4. Algal-stimulated fungal production rates on both leaf species were not coupled to long-term increases in fungal biomass accrual or litter decomposition rates, which were 154-157% and 164-455% greater in the dark, respectively. The similar patterns on fast- vs. slow-decomposing  and , respectively, indicated that substrate recalcitrance may not mediate priming strength or direction. . In this example of negative priming, periphytic algae decoupled fungal activity from decomposition, likely by providing labile carbon invested toward greater fungal growth and reproduction instead of recalcitrant carbon degradation. If common, algal-induced negative priming could stimulate heterotrophy reliant on labile carbon yet suppress decomposition of recalcitrant carbon, modifying  and nutrients available to upper trophic levels and enhancing organic carbon storage or export in well-lit aquatic habitats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673020>3D Porous Graphene Based Aerogel for Electromagnetic Applications.</a></h2><p>Lightweight multifunctional electromagnetic (EM) absorbing materials with outstanding thermal properties, chemical resistance and mechanical stability are crucial for space, aerospace and electronic devices and packaging. Therefore, 3D porous graphene aerogels are attracting ever growing interest. In this paper we present a cost effective lightweight 3D porous graphene-based aerogel for EM wave absorption, constituted by a poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and we show that the thermal, electrical, mechanical properties of the aerogel can be tuned through the proper selection of the processing temperature, controlled either at 65 °C or 85 °C. The produced GNP-filled aerogels are characterized by exceptional EM properties, allowing the production of absorbers with 9.2 GHz and 6.4 GHz qualified bandwidths with reflection coefficients below -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively. Moreover, such aerogels show exceptional thermal conductivities without any appreciable volume change after temperature variations. Finally, depending on the process parameters, it is shown the possibility to obtain water repellent aerogel composites, thus preventing their EM and thermal properties from being affected by environmental humidity and allowing the realization of EM absorber with a stable response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663569>Daily consumption of fruit-flavored yoghurt enriched with vitamins B contributes to lower  intake and body weight reduction, in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Yoghurt naturally contains vitamins of B-complex which play a central role in  metabolism. This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on body weight management and glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non-fat yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined. Dietary assessments were also performed. At the end of the intervention, body weight and BMI were reduced in the VY group (86. ± 3.1 vs. 87.7 ± 3.0 kg, and 29.2 ± 1.0 vs. 29.6 ± 0.9 kg m-2, respectively, P < 0.05) and dietary intake was lower compared to the CY group (7277.6 ± 332.6 vs. 9918.2 ± 612.1 kJ day-1, P < 0.05). HbA1c was marginally reduced in the VY group (6.2 ± 0.2 vs. 6.4 ± 0.3%, P = 0.08), concentrations of B1, B2 and B6 were increased (63.8 ± .6 vs. 52.8 ± 1.7 μg L-1, P = 0.09, 9.2 ± 1. vs. 6.9 ± 1.4 μg L-1, P < 0.05 and 23.0 ± 2.8 vs. 14.9 ± 1.2 μg L-1, P < 0.05, respectively) and a trend towards reduced homocysteine concentrations was observed (16.9 ± 1.7 vs. 18.3 ± 2.0 μmol L-1, P = 0.06).

The purpose of the current study was to: i) evaluate the incidence of HKs and concussions and ii) identify potential risk factors of concussions in sparring taekwondo.A post-match, interview-based prospective cohort study was conducted with 145 sparring taekwondo athletes (12-16 years of age) who: i) competed at a 2018 sparring- Taekwondo tournament and ii) received a valid HK during competition. Incidence rates of HKs and concussions were estimated; possible risk factors or prognosticators of concussions were also analyzed using the chi-square test and binary logistic analysis.Incidence rates of HKs and concussions were 133. (95% CI: 113.3-153.8) and 41.4 (95% CI: 29.6-53.3) per 1000 athlete-exposures, respectively. The binary logistic model revealed that athletes with no prior concussion history were less likely to experience a concussion (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7).Although the incidence rates of HKs and concussions are considerably high, they are not increased compared with the results of pre-2009 studies. Therefore, the new competition rule relating to HKs did not appear to increase the incidence rates of HKs or concussions in our research participants.

This may result from altered  metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

Body composition (via dual- x-ray absorptiometry), physical performance [via Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)], and balance [via Four-Square Step test (FSS) and posturography] were examined. Falls in the past year and fractures in the past  years were self-reported. Osteosarcopenia was defined as (1) low bone mineral density (BMD) [T score <-1 standard deviation (SD)] combined with sarcopenia and (2) osteoporosis (BMD T score ≤-2. SD) combined with severe sarcopenia. For sarcopenia, we employed the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP1), the revised criteria (EWGSOP2), and that of the Foundation for the National Institutes for Health (FNIH). Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression tests were used for statistical analysis.Osteosarcopenia was associated with worse SPPB, TUG, FSS, limit of stability, and falls and fractures history. Additionally, osteosarcopenia (using the severe sarcopenia classification) conferred an increased rate of falls [odds ratios (ORs) from 2.83 to 3.63; P < .05 for all] and fractures (ORs from 3.86 to 4.38; P < .05 for all) when employing the EWGSOP2 and FNIH definitions, respectively.Compared with the nonosteosarcopenic group, those with osteosarcopenia had greater impairment of physical performance and balance. The EWGSOP2 and FNIH criteria resulted in the strongest associations with physical performance and self-reported falls and fractures.Copyright © 2019 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

The objective of this study was to determine the main sources of added sugars in the Argentine diet and to determine the proportional  contribution of each of them. The sample consisted of 1266 individuals, representative of the country's urban population from 15 to 65 years old, stratified by region, age, gender and socio-economic level. Two 24-hour intake records and one socio-economic questionnaire were carried out. Among the total food and beverages consumed, 26.9% of added sugars was contributed by soft drinks and 23.8% by infusions. The third place, with 15.4%, was obtained by baked goods (bread, cookies, etc.) and the fourth, with 12%, from ready-to-prepare juices, ahead of sweets, candies and dairy products. Men, compared to women, consumed significantly more added sugars in soft drinks (32.6 vs. 22.1%) and women more in infusions (25.% vs. 21.8%), baked goods, sugar and honey. The lower income population consumed significantly more sugar in infusions at the expense of "mate" (21.4 vs. 7 g/day) and no differences were observed in the consumption of soft drinks by socio-economic level (32.9 vs. 34.4 g/day).

They provide a unique opportunity to control  and charge dynamics via the independent tunability of the  levels within the perovskite and the organic spacer for various optoelectronic applications. In the perovskite layer alone, one can replace the Pb (Sn), the halide (X=I,Br,Cl), the organic component, and the number of layers between the organic spacer layers. In addition, there are many possibilities for organic spacer layers between the perovskite layers, making it difficult for experimental methods to comprehensively explore such extensive combinatorial space. Of particular technological interest is alignment of electronic levels between the perovskite layer and the organic spacer layer, leading to desired transfer of  or charge carriers between perovskite and organic components. For example, as band edge absorption is almost entirely attributed to the perovskite layer, one way to demonstrate  transfer is to observe triplet emission from organic spacers. State-of-the-art computational chemistry tools can be used to predict the properties of many stoichiometries in search for LHOPs that have the most promising electronic structure features. In this first principles study, we survey a group of π-conjugated organic spacer candidates for use in triplet light emitting LHOPs. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT, we calculate the first singlet (S) and triplet (T) excitation  in the ground-state geometry and the first triplet excitation  in the excited triplet state relaxed geometry (T*). By comparing these energies to the known lowest exciton  level of PbX perovskite layers (X=I, Br, Cl), organic spacer and perovskite layer pairings can be identified for possible transfer of Wannier excitons from the inorganic perovskite lattice to spin-triplet Frenkel excitons located on the organic cation. We successfully identify ten organic spacer candidates for possible pairing with perovskite layers of specific halide composition to achieve triplet light emission across the visible  range. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that finite temperatures and perovskite environment have little influence on the excitation energies of the two common organic spacers naphthylethylammonium (NEA) and phenelethylammonium (PEA). We find significant thermal broadening up to 0. eV of the optical excitation energies appearing due to finite temperature effects. The findings herein provide insights into alignment of electronic levels of conjugated organic spacer with perovskite layer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673627>A 2-yr, School-Based Resistance Exercise Pilot Program Increases Bone Accrual in Adolescent Girls.</a></h2><p>The current analysis evaluates cumulative benefits after year two (Y2) of a school-based resistance training intervention.Adolescent girls were enrolled and measured at the beginning of 6 grade (baseline, BL) and again at 1 follow-up (FU1: Y1 end) and 2 follow-up (FU2: Y2 end). School gym classes met alternate school days. Site 1 had standard gym classes (CON). Site 2 gym classes included 8-12 minutes of resistance training (INT); INT girls were categorized based on observed participation effort and time (LO, HI). Measurements included: 1) height and weight; 2) questionnaires to assess extracurricular exercise and diet (calcium, vitamin D); 3) dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy). Whole body less head (SUB) scans yielded bone mineral content (BMC) and body composition. Lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck (FN) scans yielded BMC and areal bone mineral density (BMD); radius scans yielded ultradistal and 1/3 BMD.

In this work, (1-x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xNaTaO3 ((1-x)BNT-xNT, x=0~0.30) lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramics are developed for capacitor applications. The x=0.20 ceramic exhibits superior thermal stability of discharged  density (WD) with a variation of less than 10% in an ultra-wide temperature range of -50~300 °C, showing a significant advantage compared with previously reported ceramic systems. The WD reaches 4.21 J/cm3 under 38 kV/mm at room temperature. Besides, a record high of power density (PD~89. MW/cm3) in BNT-based ceramics is also achieved in x=0.20 ceramic with an excellent temperature insensitivity within 25~160 oC. The x=0.20 ceramic is indicated to be an ergodic relaxor ferroelectric with coexisted R3c nanodomains and P4bm polar nanoregions at room temperature, greatly contributing to inducing large maximum polarization, maintaining low remnant polarization, and thus achieving high WD and PD. Furthermore, the diffuse phase transition from R3c to P4bm phase on heating is considered to be responsible for the superior thermal stability of the high WD and PD.

The organics transformation and  production potential in A-stage were explored. The developed A-stage process was demonstrated to be more effective for organics recovery compared to that operated with aeration (53.82% versus 40.94%), despite its relatively low total COD removal efficiency (54.3% versus 63.% with aeration).

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±.9yrs, BMI: 29.±.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily  expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

Such a method normally uses fluorescent proteins or chemical labeling methods which are often only accessible to surface exposed residues and risk disturbing target protein structures. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic incorporation of a synthetic fluorescent amino acid, L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Cou), and natural endogenous fluorophore Tryptophan (Trp) residues of a protein, could serve as an efficient FRET pair to monitor protein interactions, using the signaling transducer β-arrestin-1 as a model system. We used this technology to record the dynamic spectra in both binding and competition experiments of β-arrestin-1, the contribution of each specific phosphate in ternary complex formation, in a rapid and efficient manner. The determined Kd value for the association between the active arres-tin and Fab30 is 0.68 μM in the three components interaction system. Moreover, we were able to determine the contributions of the site 3 phospho-site and the site 6 phospho-site binding each contributed to the high affinity ternary complex assem-bling as 2.7 folds and 15. folds respectively, which were never determined before. These results thus highlighted the poten-tial usage of this new method in measurement of the allosteric induced enhanced affinity with small amount proteins and in a fast manner and in a complex system. Collectively, our newly developed Trp : Cou FRET system based on genetic expan-sion technology has extended the molecular toolboxes available for biochemical and structural biology studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665682>Sedimentary DNA reveals over 150 years of ecosystem change by human activities in Lake Chao, China.</a></h2><p>Understanding the extent and directionality of the impact of human activities on ecosystems is directly related to their management and protection. However, the lack of historical data limits our understanding of ecosystem changes with long-term exposure to human activities. Recently, lake sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) has become a powerful tool for revealing changes in ecosystems at the century and millennium scales. Here, we used sedDNA to reveal the dynamic of the microbial community (including bacteria and micro-eukaryotes) in Lake Chao over the past 150 years, and further explored the effects of long-term nutrient and heavy metal loads on these communities. Our data show that nutrient and heavy metal loads in Lake Chao have increased by ca. 2 to 4-fold since the 1960s. In response, the community structure, diversity, and ecological network of bacteria and micro-eukaryotes changed significantly during the 1960s, the 1980s and the 2010s. Importantly, community structure was more sensitive to human activities than diversity. We also found that the relative abundance of some taxa associated with nitrification and algal blooms (e.g., taxa in Nitrospira sp., Peridinales) has increased ca. 100-fold since the 1960s. Nutrient could better explain the variation in the bacterial community (ca. twice as much as heavy metal), while heavy metal explained micro-eukaryotes better (ca. 3 or -fold as much as nutrient). In particular, based on parsimonious models from distance-based linear model (distLM), we further identified that Pb is the key factor affecting the bacterial and micro-eukaryotes community in Lake Chao in addition to nutrient. Our study reveals the impacts of long-term human activities on lake ecosystems from multiple perspectives of nutrient and heavy metal loads, community structure, diversity and ecological network, these findings will contribute to the management and conservation of lakes in the future.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To evaluate academic medical institutions' support for team science in the context of researchers' career development, we measured the value placed on team science and specificity of guidance provided for documenting team science contributions in the promotion and tenure (P&T) documents of Colleges/Schools of Medicine (CoMs) in the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences' Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program.We reviewed complete P&T documents from 57 of 63 CTSA CoMs to identify career paths defined by three dimensions: academic rank (associate versus full professor), tenure eligibility (tenure track versus not), and role (research, clinical, education, and administrative), and we rated team science value and documentation guidance for each path. Multilevel models were estimated to compare team science value and documentation guidance as a function of the three career path dimensions while accounting for the clustered data ( = 357 career paths within 57 CoMs).Team science value was greater for associate than full professors, non-tenure-eligible versus tenure-eligible positions, and roles prioritizing clinical, education, and administrative responsibilities versus those prioritizing research. Guidance for documenting team science achievements was more explicit for roles that prioritized research.Although P&T policies at most CTSA institutions express value for team science, inconsistent within-institutional patterns of recognition and reward across career paths may have implications for researchers' involvement in team science. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and for P&T policies that promote team science.© The Association for Clinical and Translational Science 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671635>Oscillating U-Shaped Body for Underwater Piezoelectric  Harvester Power Optimization.</a></h2><p>Vibration  harvesting (VeH) techniques by means of intentionally designed mechanisms have been used in the last decade for frequency bandwidth improvement under excitation for adequately high-vibration amplitudes. Oil, gas, and water are vital resources that are usually transported by extensive pipe networks. Therefore, wireless self-powered sensors are a sustainable choice to monitor in-pipe system applications. The mechanism, which is intended for water pipes with diameters of 2- inches, contains a piezoelectric beam assembled to the oscillating body. A novel U-shaped geometry of an underwater  harvester has been designed and implemented. Then, the results have been compared with the traditional circular cylinder shape. At first, a numerical study has been carried at Reynolds numbers Re = 3000, 6000, 9000, and 12,000 in order to capture as much as kinetic  from the water flow. Consequently, unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)-based simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamic forces under different conditions. In addition, an Adaptive Differential Evolution (JADE) multivariable optimization algorithm has been implemented for the optimal design of the harvester and the maximization of the power extracted from it. The results show that the U-shaped geometry can extract more power from the kinetic  of the fluid than the traditional circular cylinder harvester under the same conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666981>Reverse diauxie phenotype in  biofilm revealed by exometabolomics and label-free proteomics.</a></h2><p>Microorganisms enhance fitness by prioritizing catabolism of available carbon sources using a process known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Planktonically grown  is known to prioritize the consumption of organic acids including lactic acid over catabolism of glucose using a CCR strategy termed "reverse diauxie."  is an opportunistic pathogen with well-documented biofilm phenotypes that are distinct from its planktonic phenotypes. Reverse diauxie has been described in planktonic cultures, but it has not been documented explicitly in  biofilms. Here a combination of exometabolomics and label-free proteomics was used to analyze planktonic and biofilm phenotypes for reverse diauxie.  biofilm cultures preferentially consumed lactic acid over glucose, and in addition, the cultures catabolized the substrates completely and did not exhibit the acetate secreting "overflow" metabolism that is typical of many model microorganisms. The biofilm phenotype was enabled by changes in protein abundances, including lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, GTP cyclohydrolase, L-ornithine N()-monooxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. These results are noteworthy because reverse diauxie-mediated catabolism of organic acids necessitates a terminal electron acceptor like O, which is typically in low supply in biofilms due to diffusion limitation. Label-free proteomics identified dozens of proteins associated with biofilm formation including 16 that have not been previously reported, highlighting both the advantages of the methodology utilized here and the complexity of the proteomic adaptation for  biofilms. Documenting the reverse diauxic phenotype in  biofilms is foundational for understanding cellular nutrient and  fluxes, which ultimately control growth and virulence.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668764>Robustness of an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor for low strength and salinity wastewater treatment at ambient to winter temperatures.</a></h2><p>Acclimation performances and characteristics of aerobic granular sludge to salt and temperature were investigated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) performing simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal (SNDPR). The aerobic granular SNDPR system was firstly subjected to low salinity (0.%, w/v) at moderate temperature (> 15 ℃) and subsequent low temperature (< 15 ℃). The shock loading of salinity temporarily deteriorated biological phosphorus removal, while dual stresses of salinity and low temperature induced temporary inhibition on both nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Both salinity and low temperature stimulated the settleability of aerobic granules, accompanied with decreased ratios of protein to polysaccharide (PN/PS). Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that salinity rarely affected bacterial richness, but significantly decreased the diversity. Whereas low temperature strengthened both bacterial richness and diversity. Phyla Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and their sub-groups acted as the main halophilic bacteria while Proteobacteria was also psychrophilic. The functional bacteria such as nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and phosphorus removal bacteria exhibited greater tolerance to salt and low temperature than glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs). Overall, the present study demonstrated the resilience and robustness of aerobic granular sludge toward salinity and low temperature, which could aid the knowledge of saline wastewater treatment by aerobic granular sludge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It also compared the results from common practices of biogas flaring and conventional management. The analysis was based on one ton of pig manure in 4 systems: two with  production, one with biogas flaring, and the last one conventional management. The use of biogas for electricity production combined with composting techniques generated the lowest net impacts on climate change of 272 kg COeq and photochemical oxidation of 0.056 kg ethylene eq, while the biogas flaring registered impacts of 344 kg COeq and 0.095 kg ethylene eq. The systems with  production had environmental benefits on fossil resources depletion by avoiding the consumption of -863 MJ and -1608 MJ, but systems that burned biogas required fossil fuel consumption of 246 MJ from the grid. The conventional management generated the greatest environmental impacts, with eutrophication being the most important negative effect due to the manure discharge into water bodies (.97 kg POeq). Sensitivity analysis shown that  production could generate greater impacts on global warming compared to the case in which manure was used directly in crop fields, if emissions from unintentional releases and a poor digestate management are not avoided. Results are relevant for developing countries in which processes are carried out in rural and semi-industrial areas with lack of technical knowledge and economic resources.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, its electron ionization properties are of major interest and essential for the comparison with other molecular targets containing its elemental structure. 2-Nitroimidazole (2NI) contains the imidazole ring together with nitrogen dioxide bound to the C2 position, making it a radiosensitizing compound in hypoxic tumors. In the present study, we investigated electron ionization of IMI and 2NI and determined the mass spectra, the ionization energies, and appearance energies of the most abundant fragment cations. The experiments were complemented by quantum chemical calculations on the thermodynamic thresholds and potential  surfaces, with particular attention to the calculated transition states for the most important dissociation reactions. In the case of IMI, substantially lower threshold values (up to ~ 1. eV) were obtained in the present work compared to the only available previous electron ionization study. Closer agreement was found with recent photon ionization values, albeit the general trend of slightly higher values for the case of electron ionization. The only exception for imidazole was found in the molecular cation at m/z 40 which is tentatively assigned to the quasi-linear HCCNH/ HCNCH. Electron ionization of 2NI leads to analogous fragment cations as in imidazole, yet different dissociation pathways must be operative due to the presence of the NO group. Regarding the potential radiosensitization properties of 2NI, electron ionization is characterized by dominant parent cation formation and release of the neutral NO radical.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669903>Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation denitrifying (SAD) in an innovative three-stage process for -efficient mature landfill leachate treatment with external sludge reduction.</a></h2><p>High-loaded ammonia and low-strength organics mature landfill leachate is not effectively treated by conventional biological processes. Herein, an innovative solution was proposed using a three-stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying (SAD) process. Firstly, ammonia (1760 ± 126 mg N/L) in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). Next, 93% PN-SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge (WAS; MLSS = 23057 ± 6014 mg/L) were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification (IFD-SBR). Finally, ammonia (101.4 ± 13.8 mg N/L) released by fermentation in the IFD-SBR and residual 7% nitrite in the PN-SBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in the SAD up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (SAD-UASB). In addition, NO-N generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification (PD) and reused as substrate for anammox. A satisfactory total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (98.3%), external sludge reduction rate (2. kg/m d) and effluent TN concentration (16.7 mg/L) were achieved after long-term operation (280 days). The IFD-SBR and SAD-UASB contributed to 81.9% and 12.3% nitrogen removal, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria (1.% Candidatus Brocadia) cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria (4.3% Thauera) in SAD-UASB, and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83.1% during significant stability of anammox and 9.2% during the denitrification process, respectively. The three-stage SAD process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25.4% less oxygen, 100% organic matter savings and 47.9% less external sludge than traditional biological processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the wetting phenomena on ideal micropatterned surfaces consisting of straight micro-pillars at different pillar dimensions and spacings (The word "ideal" refers to being chemically homogeneous and free of submicron-scale roughness all over the micropatterned surface). Two modeling approaches are used: 1) a thermodynamic approach analyzing the Gibbs  of the droplet-solid-gas system, and 2) a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach studying the three-dimensional dynamic wetting process to validate the results of the first approach. The thermodynamic approach incorporates three creative sub-models proposed in this paper: i) a sagging model explaining the pillar edge effect, ii) a touchdown model transitioning the droplet's partial penetrating condition toward its full penetrating condition, i.e. the Wenzel state, and iii) a liquid-volume model dynamically computing the liquid volume in-between the pillar valleys while in the partial penetrating condition or in the Wenzel state. The results of the thermodynamic approach reveal 1) a small  barrier between the Cassie and Wenzel states, 2) no partial penetration and sagging of the liquid in the Cassie state on the ideal straight micro-pillared surface, and (3) that the apparent contact angle in the most stable Wenzel state can be º or more lower than than the prediction of the Wenzel equation when the pillar height is equal or greater than 75 µm. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the theoretical explanation of this Wenzel deviation on micropatterned surfaces for the first time in the literature. Utilizing the state-of-the-art continuum model developed by the authors in previous studies, the CFD approach investigates the same wetting conditions, and confirms the same findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675654>Storage systems for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) installations: Environmental profile and other aspects.</a></h2><p>In recent years there has been an increasing interest in Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (BIPVT) systems since they produce clean  and replace conventional building envelope materials. By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable , the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, façade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from .9 to 11.7 GJ and from 0.3 to 1.0 t CO. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed. The contribution of the present article to the existing literature is associated with the fact that it presents a critical review about storage devices in the case of BIPV and BIPVT applications, by placing emphasis on the environmental profile of certain storage materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The CH2CCH3 radicals were generated by 193-nm photodissociation of 2-chloropropene and 2-bromopropene precursors. The H-atom photofragment yield spectra from both precursors revealed a broad feature peaking near 232 nm. The translational  distributions of the H + C3H4 products peaked around 7-8 kcal/mol and extended close to the maximum excess . The fraction of the total available  released as products' translation was nearly a constant (~ 0.16 using the 2-chloropropene precursor and ~ 0.18 using the 2-bromopropene precursor) in the wavelength range of 224-248 nm. The angular distribution of the H-atom product was isotropic. Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations were performed on the ground-state potential  surface of CH2CCH3 for its decomposition at a 124 kcal/mol excitation  (equivalent to 230 nm photolysis photon ). The calculations yielded branching ratios for different dissociation product channels, 32% H + allene, 35% H + propyne, 0.% H + cyclopropene, and 32% methyl + acetylene. The experimental and QCT translational  distributions of the H-atom loss channels qualitatively agreed, consistent with the main H-atom product channels being the H + allene and H + propyne dissociations. The time scale of the 2-propenyl dissociation on the ground electronic state was calculated to be ~ 2 ps, smaller compared to that of the overall UV photodissociation (> 10 ps, implied based on the isotropic H-atom product angular distribution). The mechanism of the UV photodissociation of 2-propenyl is consistent with unimolecular dissociation proceeding on the ground state after internal conversion of the electronic excited states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661541>Longitudinal changes in nutritional parameters and resting  expenditure in end-stage renal disease.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the nutritional status, resting  expenditure, caloric and protein intake, and evolution of biochemical parameters in three stages of chronic kidney disease: pre-dialytic, at the beginning of the dialysis treatment, and 30 days after starting treatment.The chi-square and Student's t tests were used to compare the variables, and analysis of repeated measurements was used to compare the data obtained in the three moments evaluated.

The performance of the RAOC in 1,4-dioxane removal was compared to that of a TiO slurry reactor by evaluating the removal efficiencies in pure water (PW) and the BTLL. In the TiO slurry reactor, 1,4-dioxane was hardly degraded in the BTLL during 66 h of treatment because of strong inhibition by coexisting substances in the BTLL. In contrast, the RAOC successfully removed 1,4-dioxane from the BTLL by 89% through adsorption and by 81% through photocatalysis during treatment for 66 h. The ratio of the rate constants for degrading 1,4-dioxane in the BTLL and PW by the RAOC was two orders of magnitude higher than that for a TiO slurry reactor. This shows that the RAOC greatly mitigated the inhibition by coexisting substances in the BTLL. The electrical  required for 1,4-dioxane degradation in the BTLL by the RAOC was much lower than that required for degradation by the TiO slurry reactor. The results show that the RAOC equipped with AC/TiO composite sheets effectively removed 1,4-dioxane from BTLL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To uncover the genetic background of the ability of microaerobic toluene degradation in Z. oleivorans, the whole-genome sequence of the type strain Buc was revealed. Metatranscriptomic sequence reads, originated from a previous SIP study on microaerobic toluene degradation, were mapped on the genome. The genome (.68 Mb) had a mean G + C content of 62.%, 5005 protein coding gene sequences and 80 RNA genes. Annotation predicted that 66 genes were involved in the metabolism of aromatic compounds. Genome analysis revealed the presence of a cluster with genes coding for a multicomponent phenol-hydroxylase system and a complete catechol meta-cleavage pathway. Another cluster flanked by mobile-element protein coding genes coded a partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway including a subfamily I.2.C-type extradiol dioxygenase. Analysis of metatranscriptomic data of a microaerobic toluene-degrading enrichment, containing Z .  oleivorans as an active-toluene degrader revealed that a toluene dioxygenase-like enzyme was responsible for the ring-hydroxylation, while enzymes of the partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway coding cluster were responsible for further degradation of the aromatic ring under microaerobic conditions. This further advances our understanding of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation between fully oxic and strictly anoxic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660716>Confinement-Induced Giant Spin-Orbit-Coupled Magnetic Moment of Co Nanoclusters in TiO2 Films.</a></h2><p>High magnetization materials are in great demand for the fabrication of advanced multifunctional magnetic devices. Notwithstanding this demand, the development of new materials with these attributes has been relatively slow. In this work, we propose a new strategy to achieve high magnetic moments above room temperature. Our materials engineering approach invoked the embedding of magnetic nanoclusters in an oxide matrix. By precisely controlling pulsed laser deposition parameters, Co nanoclusters are formed in a  at.% Co-TiO2 film. The presence of these nanoclusters was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy,  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure. The film exhibits a very high saturation magnetization of 99 emu/cm3. Detailed studies using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism confirm that Co has an enhanced magnetic moment of 3. B/atom, whilst the Ti and O also contribute to the magnetic moments. First principles calculations supported our hypothesis that the metallic Co nanoclusters surrounded by a TiO2 matrix can exhibit both large spin and orbital moments. Moreover, a quantum confinement effect results in a high Curie temperature for the embedded Co nanoclusters. These findings reveal that 1-2 nm nanoclusters that are quantum confined can exhibit very large magnetic moments above room temperature, representing a promising advance for the design of new high magnetization materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671747>Integrated Process for Sequential Extraction of Bioactive Phenolic Compounds and Proteins from Mill and Field Olive Leaves and Effects on the Lignocellulosic Profile.</a></h2><p>The extraction of bioactive compounds in a biorefinery context could be a way to valorize agri-food byproducts, but there is a remaining part that also requires attention. Therefore, in this work the integrated extraction of phenolic compounds, including the bioactive oleuropein, and proteins from olive mill leaves was addressed following three schemes, including the use of ultrasound. This affected the total phenolic content (4475.-6166.9 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g), oleuropein content (675.3-1790.0 mg/100 g), and antioxidant activity (18,234.3-25,459.0 µmol trolox equivalents/100 g). No effect was observed on either the protein recovery or the content of sugars and lignin in the extraction residues. Concerning the recovery of proteins, three operational parameters were evaluated by response surface methodology. The optimum (63.1%) was achieved using NaOH 0.7 M at 100 °C for 240 min. Then, the selected scheme was applied to olive leaves from the field, observing differences in the content of some of the studied components. It also changed the lignocellulosic profile of the extraction residues of both leaf types, which were enriched in cellulose. Overall, these results could be useful to diversify the valorization chain in the olive sector.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658882>Impact of peripheral mutations on the access channels of human cytochrome P450 1A2.</a></h2><p>As an important member of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, human CYP1A2 is associated with the metabolism of caffeine and melatonin and the activation of precarcinogens. Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the metabolism of -10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate metabolism. To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on lipid membranes. Free  calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. It is hoped that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667316>Spatio-temporal dataset of building occupants.</a></h2><p>The paper presents spatio-temporal dataset of building occupants captured using 200 Bluetooth Low  (BLE) beacons installed on different locations in two buildings.

One limitation of gatifloxacin is its relatively poor corneal penetration, and the increase of its trans-corneal delivery would be beneficial to reduce the amount or frequency of daily dose. In this study, ultrasound treatment was applied to enhance the trans-corneal delivery of gatifloxacin without damage. Experiments were conducted on mouse eyes in ex vivo and in vivo conditions. Ultrasound waves with 1 MHz in frequency, 1.3 W/cm in intensity were applied onto the mouse cornea for  minutes, and then gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution was instilled and left there for 10 minutes. 3D gatifloxacin distribution in the cornea was measured by two-photon microscopy (TPM) imaging based on its intrinsic fluorescence. Longitudinal TPM imaging of ultrasound treated mouse corneas showed the increase of initial gatifloxacin intensities on the corneal surface compared to untreated mouse corneas by 67%, and then the increased gatifloxacin delivery into the cornea from the surface at later time. The delivered gatifloxacin in the corneal epithelium stayed longer in the ultrasound treated corneas than in the untreated corneas. The enhanced trans-corneal delivery and extended stay of gatifloxacin in the mouse cornea by ultrasound treatment could be beneficial for therapeutic effects. This study demonstrated the detail process of enhanced trans-corneal gatifloxacin delivery by ultrasound treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664421>Ultrasound power and irrigation volume in different lens opacity grades: comparison of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and conventional phacoemulsification.</a></h2><p>To compare the amount of ultrasound  and irrigation volume in conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery versus femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification at different nuclear-cortical cataract grades.This was a prospective, consecutive, investigator-masked nonrandomized parallel cohort study.

In peripheral areas of the infarct, the penumbra, damage is initially reversible, and neuronal activity is typically reduced due to ischemia-induced synaptic failure. There is limited understanding of factors governing neuronal recovery or the transition to irreversible damage. Neuronal activity has been shown to be crucial for survival. Consequently, hypoxia induced neuronal inactivity may contribute to cell death, and activation of penumbral neurons possibly improves survival. Adversely, activation increases ATP demand, and a balance should be found between the available  and sufficient activity. Approach- We monitored activity and viability of neurons in an in vitro model of the penumbra, consisting of (rat) neuronal networks on micro electrode arrays (MEAs) under controlled hypoxic conditions. We tested effects of optogenetic and electrical activation during hypoxia. Main results- Mild stimulation yielded significantly better recovery of activity immediately after re-oxygenation, compared with no stimulation, and a 60-70% higher survival rate after  days. Stronger stimulation was not associated with better recovery than no stimulation, suggesting that beneficial effects depend on a delicate balance between sufficient activity and available . Significance- We show that mild activation during hypoxia/ ischemia is beneficial for cell survival in an in vitro model of the penumbra. This finding opposes the current common belief that suppression of neuronal activity is the cornerstone of neuroprotection during cerebral ischemia, and may open new possibilities for the treatment of secondary brain damage after stroke.Creative Commons Attribution license.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659763>Ambiguity and contradiction: the outlines of Jung's dialectics.</a></h2><p>This essay explores Jung's thinking strategies, argumentation patterns, and concept formation processes, and reveals how they distinguish his work from normal present-day science. Jung doesn't much appreciate the law of noncontradiction, which is a cornerstone of classical logic, and he doesn't refrain from using openly ambiguous theoretical terms. It will be pointed out that not only specific archetypes, but the notion of archetype itself, as well as other of Jung's theoretical notions (, including libidinal , polarity, integration, wholeness, instinct, symbol, and so on), are consciously ambiguous and thus potentially contradictory. It is shown that this kind of dialectic research strategy and related contradiction-tolerant and ambiguity-tolerant methods connect his work to Post-Kantian German Idealism, Schelling's and Schopenhauer's philosophy in particular. However, it was Hegel who, in his Science of Logic, presented a systematic overview of such dialectic principles of reasoning, which were, in the 19 century, widely applied by German philosophers, theologians, and other scholars. Unfortunately, Jung decided not to study Hegel, but, instead, wrote derogatorily of his work. It will be argued that a Jungian who wants to be conscious of her own argumentation strategies and methods of concept formation should study Hegel's complex and sophisticated dialectical logic. In addition, it is suggested that Jungian depth psychology might help us to amend the phenomenological deficits of Hegel's system by providing it with a primal experiential source. This is needed because Hegel's Geist, due to its intellectual emphasis, is a self-conscious conceptual totality which advances progressively from stage to stage by guiding itself with the help of dialectical reason (Vernunft). It will be shown that if enriched with a proper kind of experiential givenness, which includes the Jungian unconsciousness (with libidinal , instincts, and archetypes), Hegelian metaphysics would be able to embrace a seriously aconceptual or preconceptual dimension. Aconceptual experience, which is, for Jung, mainly the instinctual layer of archetypes, remains essentially inaccessible, not only for normal scientific concepts, but for the concepts of any form of dialectics as well.© 2019, The Society of Analytical Psychology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659818>Microstructure and compression resistance of bean goose (Anser fabalis) feather shaft.</a></h2><p>The bean goose Anser fabalis, noted for its excellent flying ability, has feathers composed of keratinized products derived from epidermal cells, which play a crucial role in flight. The feather shaft is an important connective unit, made of a lightweight material, which also contributes to aiding flight. The shaft can withstand loads from different directions and has outstanding compression resistance. In this study, the microstructure and composition of the A. fabalis feather shaft were observed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and its compression resistance was studied by compression testing. The results indicated that the mechanical property of the shaft is related to its microstructure. Compression testing verified that the primary feathers had the strongest mechanical properties, followed by the secondaries, and finally the alulae. Under the same conditions, the specific  absorption of the three feather types was .96, .02, and 3.17 J/g, respectively. With increasing moisture content, the rachis was softened and the  absorption was reduced. At low moisture content, the specific  absorption of the primaries was reduced to 1.03 J/g, that of the secondaries was reduced to 1.72 J/g, and that of the alulae to 0.39 J/g. The feather shafts have the advantage of light weight while maintaining the required mechanical properties. These results provide a theoretical and experimental basis for crashworthiness in bionic designs based on the requirements of light weight.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668390>Rfx6 promotes the differentiation of peptide-secreting enteroendocrine cells while repressing genetic programs controlling serotonin production.</a></h2><p>Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the gastro-intestinal tract sense gut luminal factors and release peptide hormones or serotonin (-HT) to coordinate  uptake and storage. Our goal is to decipher the gene regulatory networks controlling EECs specification from enteroendocrine progenitors. In this context, we studied the role of the transcription factor Rfx6 which had been identified as the cause of Mitchell-Riley syndrome, characterized by neonatal diabetes and congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. We previously reported that Rfx6 was essential for pancreatic beta cell development and function; however, the role of Rfx6 in EECs differentiation remained to be elucidated.We examined the molecular, cellular, and metabolic consequences of constitutive and conditional deletion of Rfx6 in the embryonic and adult mouse intestine. We performed single cell and bulk RNA-Seq to characterize EECs diversity and identify Rfx6-regulated genes.Rfx6 is expressed in the gut endoderm; later, it is turned on in, and restricted to, enteroendocrine progenitors and persists in hormone-positive EECs. In the embryonic intestine, the constitutive lack of Rfx6 leads to gastric heterotopia, suggesting a role in the maintenance of intestinal identity. In the absence of intestinal Rfx6, EECs differentiation is severely impaired both in the embryo and adult. However, the number of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and mucosal -HT content are increased. Concomitantly, Neurog3-positive enteroendocrine progenitors accumulate. Combined analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data revealed that enteroendocrine progenitors differentiate in two main cell trajectories, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells and the Peptidergic Enteroendocrine (PE) cells, the differentiation programs of which are differentially regulated by Rfx6. Rfx6 operates upstream of Arx, Pax6 and Isl1 to trigger the differentiation of peptidergic EECs such as GIP-, GLP-1-, or CCK-secreting cells. On the contrary, Rfx6 represses Lmx1a and Tph1, two genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis. Finally, we identified transcriptional changes uncovering adaptive responses to the prolonged lack of enteroendocrine hormones and leading to malabsorption and lower food efficiency ratio in Rfx6-deficient mouse intestine.These studies identify Rfx6 as an essential transcriptional regulator of EECs specification and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of intestinal failures in human RFX6-deficiencies such as Mitchell-Riley syndrome.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Lowered levels of resilience, compassion fatigue and decreased empathy are significant predictors of burnout in nurses. Enhanced levels of resilience are associated with improved empathic responses and overall emotional well-being. Nurses who work in high stress environments often exhibit compassion fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorders that may reduce their ability to function effectively. Because tDCS has been used successfully in a number of chronic disease conditions, it would seem that there is potential for it to be useful in a broader context. The treatment with tDCS may be a potential strategy for improving resilience and eliminating chronic stress responses. A timed series counterbalanced research design was used for the study. Participants completed 18 sessions of tDCS over a six week period. They also completed a resilience, compassion fatigue, stress and empathy scale before and after each tDCS administration. A repeated measure analysis was used to determine if tDCS had an impact on scale scores. The analysis showed that tDCS amperage had significant positive effects on empathy. On the outcomes of resilience, compassion fatigue and stress, tDCS did not produce any significant changes. This research provides a new approach to compassion fatigue, an old problem with caregivers. Notably, when implemented with individuals experiencing problems that involve apathy or indifference, tDCS is a non-effortful intervention that offers a pathway that may improve symptoms and does not require extensive outlays of physical or mental .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667511>Methodological error in measurement of  expenditure by the doubly labeled water method: much ado about nothing?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660726>Poly (vinylene carbonate)-Based Composite Polymer Electrolyte with Enhanced Interfacial Stability to Realize High Performance Room-Temperature Solid-State Sodium Batteries.</a></h2><p>Polymer electrolytes are considered as promising candidates to power a multitude of high safety level and high  density solid-state batteries. However, commercial applications of polymer electrolyte-based solid-state batteries are still significantly limited by the low room-temperature ionic conductivity, poor mechanical properties as well as weak interfacial stability between electrode and electrolyte, especially for room-temperature solid-state batteries. In this study, a novel poly (vinylene carbonate)-based composite polymer electrolyte (PVC-CPE) prepared by a facile in situ solidification method, is reported for the first time to realize high performances of solid-state sodium batteries at room temperature. This in situ solidified PVC-CPE possesses superior room-temperature ionic conductivity (0.12 mS cm-1), high Na+ transference number (t_(〖Na〗^+ )= 0.60), wide electrochemical window (up to .3 V, vs. Na+/Na) and enhanced electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability. Notably, the composite cathode NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (c-NFM) is designed through in situ growth of polymer electrolyte inside the electrode to decrease interfacial resistance and facilitate effective ion transport in electrode/electrolyte interfaces. It is demonstrated that the solid-state c-NFM/PVC-CPE/Na battery assembled by one-step in situ solidification method exhibits remarkably enhanced cell performances at room temperature compared with a reference NFM/PVC-CPE/Na assembled through a conventional ex situ method. The battery delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 104.2 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of about 86.8% after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, and superior rate performance with discharge specific capacity of 80.2 mAh g-1 at 1 C.

The foods were grouped and classified as "healthy" and "unhealthy" eating markers. The association between the sociodemographic variables and the groups formed was examined by Poisson Regression. Two food groups were formed: "healthy" and "unhealthy". The caloric intake of ultra-processed foods was lower in the "healthy" group (20.%) than in the "unhealthy" group (24.1%; P = 0.043). The multivariate model showed that private school children (PR = 1.25, P <0.001), who did not receive Bolsa Familia (PR = 1.13, P = 0.036) and had working mothers (PR = 1.38, P <0.001) had increased probability of unhealthy food consumption. Ultra-processed food intake was associated with greater purchasing power of families of prepubertal children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674625>Modified potential for atomistic simulation of the growth of carbon materials from binary alloy catalysts.</a></h2><p>A new hybrid bond order potential has been developed and implemented to describe carbon-bimetallic alloy interactions, which are involved in the catalytic growth of carbon materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes on the surface of binary alloy catalysts. In carefully adjusting the parameters, the potential  fitting correlated with the results calculated from the density functional theory (DFT) method leads to a high quality empirical force field with an average error of <4.% only. With the PES accuracy, in total 16 (n,m) have been successfully obtained from the MD trajectories in this work, and the structural evolution including random chirality and diameter formation has been identified. The newly modified force field is expected to be useful for modelling the spontaneous growth of carbon materials, particularly tubes on binary alloy clusters, giving an idea of how these C-C, C-M, and M-M interactions affect the growth behavior of carbon nanotubes. In addition, the new FF is only valid for liquid alloy nanoparticles at this time, but the use of solid alloy nanocatalysts with the new FF can be further employed for 2-D material growth such as graphene layer growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671629>The Effects of Aluminum-Nitride Nano-Fillers on the Mechanical, Electrical, and Thermal Properties of High Temperature Vulcanized Silicon Rubber for High-Voltage Outdoor Insulator Applications.</a></h2><p>AlN nanoparticles were added into commercial high-temperature-vulcanized silicon rubber composites, which were designed for high-voltage outdoor insulator applications. The composites were systematically studied with respect to their mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. The thermal conductivity was found to increase greatly (>100%) even at low fractions of the AlN fillers. The electrical breakdown strength of the composites was not considerably affected by the AlN filler, while the dielectric constants and dielectric loss were found to be increased with AlN filler ratios. At higher doping levels above  wt% (~2. vol%), electrical tracking performance was improved. The AlN filler increased the tensile strength as well as the hardness of the composites, and decreased their flexibility. The hydrophobic properties of the composites were also studied through the measurements of temperature-dependent contact angle. It was shown that at a doping level of 1 wt%, a maximum contact angle was observed around 108°. Theoretical models were used to explain and understand the measurement results. Our results show that the AlN nanofillers are helpful in improving the overall performances of silicon rubber composite insulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672446>Predictive value of gastrointestinal hormones on weight loss.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery leads to profound and sustainable weight loss. Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in  and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = ) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Filamentous bacterial cells could represent a possible strategy to increase PHA yield, since more abundant PHA inclusions can be stored in elongated than in rod-shaped cells. At first, we determined the optimal batch culture conditions to induce filamentation in Pseudomonas mediterranea CFBP-5447T, using glutamine, glycerol, glucose, and sodium octanoate, as the sole carbon source, at low- (100 rpm) or high- (250 rpm) shaking speeds. Successively, a fermentative process was set up using glutamine in a co-metabolic strategy with glycerol, and the PHAs production was compared in rod-shaped and filamentous cells. High glutamine concentrations (from 28 to 56 mM) were able to induce alone filamentation, whereas at lower glutamine concentrations (-10 mM), the shaking speeds became critical to allow or not filamentous phenotype. PHA granule production was higher in filamentous than in rod-shaped cells, when glycerol (46.6 mM) was added to glutamine ( mM) in co-metabolism, and fermentation was performed at a low-shaking speed. After extraction and precipitation, PHA yield was about two times higher in filamentous than that rod-shaped cells. Our results provide new insights into filament-inducing conditions and indicate a potential use of filamentous P. mediterranea CFBP-5447T cells to increase PHA yield. These findings could have great advantages in PHAs recovering during downstream processes, since the harvesting of elongated cells is much less time-consuming and  expensive than required with rod-shaped cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658721>Studying the Ring-Opening Polymerization of 1,-Dioxepan-2-one with Organocatalysts.</a></h2><p>Three different organocatalysts, namely, 1--butyl-4,4,4-tris(dimethylamino)-2,2-bis[tris (dimethylamino) phosphoranylidenamino]-2Λ,4Λ-catenadi(phosphazene) (-BuP), 1,,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec--ene (TBD) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), have been used as 1,-dioxepan-2-one (DXO) ring-opening polymerization (ROP) catalysts at varied reaction conditions.

This study aimed to evaluate supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance in newly weaned pigs. Fifty newly weaned pigs (19-d-old, 25 barrows and 25 gilts, 4.76 ± 0.42 kg BW) were individually housed and allotted to  treatments with increasing nucleotide supplementation (0, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mg/kg) based on a randomized complete block design with the initial BW and sex as blocks. Dietary nucleotides were provided from YT500 (Hinabiotech, Guangzhou, China). Pigs were fed for 21 d based on 2 phases (Phase 1: 11 d and Phase 2: 10 d) and experimental diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements suggested by NRC (2012). Feed intake and BW were recorded. Titanium oxide (0.4%) was added as an indigestible marker from d 17. Plasma collected on d 18 was used to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Pigs were euthanized on d 21 to collect tissues to evaluate TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, morphology, and crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Ileal digesta were collected to measure ileal nutrient digestibility. Data were analyzed using contrasts in the MIXED procedure of SAS. Nucleotide supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI in phase 1. Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ADG in Phase 1, whereas increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and tended to increase (P = 0.082) ADG in overall. Increasing nucleotide supplementation changed (quadratic, P < 0.05) villus height-crypt ratio (at 247 mg/kg) and decreased (linear, P < 0.05) crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Increasing nucleotide supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) jejunal IL-6 (at 50 and 150 mg/kg) and tended to change (quadratic, P = 0.074) plasma MDA (at 231 mg/kg). Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ileal digestibility of  and ether extract. In conclusion, nucleotide supplementation at a range of 50 to 250 mg/kg in the diets seems to be beneficial to newly weaned pigs by enhancing growth performance possibly due to reduced intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress as well as improved intestinal villi structure and  digestibility.© The Author(s) 2019.

A systematic strategy was used to search the health science, social science and marketing databases to identify peer-reviewed literature on food and non-alcoholic beverage company sponsorship of sport published in English from 2015 to 2019.Sixteen discrete studies were identified: six content analyses, two qualitative studies, four cross-sectional surveys and four experimental studies. Findings indicate sports sponsorship is widely used to promote unhealthy foods through professional and community sport, prompting increased awareness and preference for sponsor products. Most studies assessed self-reported responses to sponsorship, with a lack of behavioural data on food purchasing and consumption. Sports sponsorship by unhealthy food brands achieves vast population reach and exposure, promoting increased brand awareness and preference for sponsor products. Research is needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between food and beverage sponsorship and  intake. Research evaluating the efficacy of strategies to reduce spectator's exposure to unhealthy sports sponsorship is also needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673771>Prevalence of inadequate intake of folate after mandatory fortification: results from the first National Dietary Survey in Brazil.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of folate inadequacy (POFI) according to life stage, socio-economic status, and geographical regions after the mandatory fortification of wheat and maize flour in Brazil.This was a population-based study. Data from two non-consecutive food records from the National Dietary Survey/Household Budget Survey 2008-2009 were used to estimate the usual dietary folate intake in µg dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variance and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method was used to calculate the POFI. The survey included 32,749 individuals, 15,700 males and 17,049 females, over 10 years old. Pregnant women, lactating women, and individuals with unreliable  intake data were excluded.Overall POFI was 31.% and mean dietary folate intake was 411.1 µg DFE. The lowest POFI occurred in the youngest age group of 10-13 years in both sexes, while the highest POFI was observed in the group ≥ 71 years. In women of childbearing age, POFI was around 32%. The lowest income strata had the highest POFI. The most developed regions (South and Southeast) had the lowest POFI compared to less developed regions.Our data show that folate inadequacy is still prevalent in Brazil mainly in low-income groups and less developed regions. Actions need to be taken to ensure that women of childbearing age, who presented a high prevalence of inadequate folate intake, achieve the recommended daily intake of 400 µg DFEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658292>Thermogravimetric analysis of the co-combustion of coal and polyvinyl chloride.</a></h2><p>Coal gangue has the shortcomings of low calorific value and refractory burnout, while polyvinyl chloride has the advantages of a long combustion process and high calorific value. In order to make up for these shortcomings of coal gangue, the possibility of a treatment method based on co-combustion of coal gangue with polyvinyl chloride, which can be centrally recovered from municipal solid waste, is proposed. In order to analyze the combustion effect of a mixture of these two substances, experimental samples were prepared by mixing these two substances in three different ratios, and they were tested by thermogravimetric analysis. The experimental results were compared, analyzed and evaluated. The effects of the proportion of polyvinyl chloride in the mixture on the temperature parameters, activation , and interaction during co-combustion were analyzed. In order to analyze the interaction during co-combustion of the two, a coupling analysis method for mixed combustion is presented, and the effectiveness of this method is verified by comparing with the correlation analysis results of co-combustion. The results show that co-combustion can mitigate the ignition difficulty and burnout of coal gangue. When the proportion of polyvinyl chloride in the mixture was increased from 20% to 80%, the maximum weightlessness rate of the first stage rapidly increased from 4.%/min to 15.6%/min; however, that of the second stage slowly increased from 3.7%/min to 4.2%/min. A 20% proportion of polyvinyl chloride showed the most significant promotion of co-combustion, with a maximum coupling coefficient of 0.00318, which was 1.11 and 1.35 times greater than that of 50% and 80% proportions, respectively. Co-combustion can reduce the activation  of coal gangue during the initial and end stages. Therefore, co-combustion is helpful to improve the problems of low calorific value and refractory burnout of coal gangue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670318>Layered HTiO/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as a novel cathode for rechargeable magnesium batteries.</a></h2><p>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are promising devices for  storage owing to their high volumetric  density and high safety, but they still suffer from the lack of suitable cathodes.

However, the molecular and biochemical changes due to moist snuff consumption relative to smoking remain incompletely understood. We previously reported that smokers (SMK) exhibit elevated oxidative stress and inflammation relative to moist snuff consumers (MSC) and non-tobacco consumers (NTC), based on metabolomic profiling data of saliva, plasma, and urine from MSC, SMK, and NTC. In this study, we investigated the effects of tobacco consumption on additional metabolic pathways using pathway-based analysis tools. To this end, metabolic pathway enrichment analysis and topology analysis were performed through pair-wise comparisons of global metabolomic profiles of SMK, MSC, and NTC. The analyses identified >8 significantly perturbed metabolic pathways in SMK compared with NTC and MSC in all 3 matrices. Among these differentially enriched pathways, perturbations of caffeine metabolism,  metabolism, and arginine metabolism were mostly observed. In comparison, fewer enriched metabolic pathways were identified in MSC compared with NTC ( in plasma, none in urine and saliva). This is consistent with our transcriptomics profiling results that show no significant differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression between MSC and NTC. These findings, taken together with our previous biochemical, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analysis results, provide a better understanding of the relative changes in healthy tobacco consumers, and demonstrate that chronic cigarette smoking, relative to the use of smokeless tobacco, results in more pronounced biological changes, which could culminate in smoking-related diseases.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663628>When not to rely on Boltzmann populations. Automated CASE-3D structure elucidation of hyacinthacines through chemical shift differences.</a></h2><p>An Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) procedure (CASE-3D) has been successfully applied to the NMR based configurational assignment of reported hyacinthacines (1-3,-8), recently target of configurational analysis using the popular DP4+ methodology. The present analysis makes use of reported  H and  C shifts and, in some particular cases, a few  J couplings. The difficulty in proper computational prediction of relative energies, in molecules capable of inter-molecular hydrogen bonding, introduces large errors in the prediction of conformationally averaged NMR properties in methods based on Boltzmann averaging such as DP4 or DP4+. In contrast CASE-3D conformational amplitudes are free parameters in the model. Here we show that the CASE-3D conformational model selection strategy, when combined with a larger  cutoff in the molecular-modelling conformational exploration, was sufficient to correctly assign the relative configuration in five of seven cases. Introduction of more information, either by supplementing  H and  C data with a few J-couplings, or using a cutoff based on computed DFT energies for the definition of the conformational ensembles, allowed the safe assignment of configuration for all compounds.This article is protected by copyright.

The sorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy,  dispersive spectroscopy, Zeta-potential, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The extraction parameters (extraction time, ionic strength, desorption conditions) were optimized. The adsorption mechanism was evaluated utilizing FT-IR spectra. Under optimum conditions, satisfactory analytical performances were achieved, which included high precision (1.33-9.62%), low limits of detection (0.19-3.54 μg L ) and wide linear range (2.-500 μg L ) for the analysis of the acaricides. Moreover, the proposed method proved highly effective for the determination of acaricides in tea samples, with the relative recoveries in the range of 65.20-108.13% and RSDs < 9.87%.

In a first step, both previous parameters were estimated under 1.52 bar and various acoustic frequencies ranging from 20 to 1000 kHz in function of normalized time. The results showed that the average number density of bubbles, varying within the interval 2.810-1.4 × 10 bubbles dm, follows a clear monotonous evolving trend as the frequency increases, while the average void fraction, comprised between 9.05 × 10 and 1.95 × 10, demonstrates no dependency of acoustic conditions.

The paper describes the development of an improved magnetic material with increased stability, thanks to a two-step covering of the magnetic core, for the enrichment of phosphopeptides in biological samples. Four materials were prepared featuring a polymeric shell with tunable hydrophilicity, obtained by "grafting from" polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate with 0-8.3% of polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA), the latter used to modulate the hydrophilicity of the material surface. Finally, the materials were functionalized with iminodiacetic acid for Ti ion immobilization. The materials were analyzed for their composition by a combination of CHN elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, also hyphenated to gas chromatography and mass spectrometric detection. Surface characteristics were evaluated by water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive X-ray spectrometry. These materials were applied to the enrichment of phosphopeptides from yeast protein digests. Peptides were identified by proteomics techniques using nano-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Qualitatively the peptides identified by the four systems were comparable, with 1606-1693 phosphopeptide identifications and a selectivity of 47-54% for all materials. The physico-chemical features of the identified peptides were also the same for the four materials. In particular, the grand average of hydropathy index values indicated that the enriched phosphopeptides were hydrophilic (ca. 90%), and only some co-enriched non-phosphorylated peptides were hydrophobic (21-28%), regardless of the material used for enrichment. Peptides had a pI ≤ 7, which indicated a well-known bias for acidic peptides binding, attributed to the interaction with the metal center itself. The results indicated that the enrichment of phosphopeptides and the co-enrichment of non-phosphorylated peptides is mainly driven by interactions with Ti and does not depend on the amount of PEGMA chains in the polymer shell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667700>Capacitation IVM improves cumulus function and oocyte quality in minimally stimulated mice.</a></h2><p>Oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) is a patient-friendly reproductive technology but lower success rates than IVF have limited its uptake. Capacitation-IVM (CAPA-IVM) is an innovative new IVM system currently undergoing clinical evaluation. This study aimed to determine temporal effects of the pre-IVM phase of CAPA-IVM on cumulus function and oocyte developmental competence in mildly-stimulated mice.Immature cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) derived from mildly stimulated (23 h PMSG) 28-day-old mice underwent pre-IVM for 0-24 h in medium containing c-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), E, FSH and insulin, prior to IVM (CAPA-IVM). The effect of pre-IVM duration on cumulus cell function and embryo development post-CAPA-IVM/IVF was assessed.Day 6 blastocyst rate increased incrementally with increasing pre-IVM duration: 40.6 ± 2.0%, 45.8 ± 1.2%, 52.2 ± 3.%, 53.3 ± .9%, and 59.9 ± 2.% for 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h pre-IVM, respectively (P < 0.01). DNA content/COC, a measure of cumulus cell proliferation, was significantly higher with 24 h pre-IVM group compared to 0, 2, or 6 h pre-IVM (P < 0.001). Pre-IVM for 24 h significantly increased cumulus expansion and mRNA expression of matrix genes Has2 and Tnfaip6 and Areg relative to no pre-IVM control (P < 0.01). Cumulus-oocyte gap-junctional communication (GJC) was maintained throughout 24 h pre-IVM (P < 0.0001), and GJC loss was slowed during the subsequent IVM phase, whilst meiotic resumption was accelerated (P < 0.05). Pre-IVM increased COC ATP and ADP content (P < 0.05), but not AMP, ATP/ADP, and  charge.The pre-IVM phase of CAPA-IVM improves the quality of IVM oocytes in a temporally dependent manner and significantly influences cumulus cell function including increased cell proliferation, cumulus expansion, and prolonged cumulus-oocyte GJC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670283>Adrenergic receptor beta-3 rs4994 (T>C) and liver X receptor alpha rs12221497 (G>A) polymorphism in Pakistanis with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to determine the association of adrenergic receptor beta-3 (ADRB3) rs4994 T>C and liver X receptor alpha (LXR-α) rs12221497 G>A polymorphism with metabolic syndrome (Met S) and the related traits in Pakistanis. Patients of Met S were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetic Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, over the time span of 6 months from July to December 2016. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADRB3 was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and of LXR-α by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of TT variant of ADRB3 T>C in Met S was 69 (34.%) and in controls 89 (44.%), frequency of TC 103 (51.%) and 96 (48%), and of CC 28 (14%) and 15 (7.%), respectively. In the recessive model (CC: TT + TC), CC genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.027; odds ratio [OR] = 2.09; confidence interval [CI] =1.08-4.03) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. The frequency of GG variant of LXR-α G>A in Met S was 35 (17.%) and in controls 15 (7.%), GA 129 (64.%) and 137 (68.%), and AA 36 (18%) and 48 (24%), respectively.

Experimental characterization and theoretical simulation show that strongly coupled plasmonic nanostructure of Au-nanochain give rise to highly intensive electromagnetic field.

The multistep operation tends to incur high costs and are  intensive due to longer process operations. This research work applies the combination of radicals from hydrogen peroxide with an organic solvent as a chemical pretreatment method for disrupting the cell wall of microalgae and simultaneously extracting lipids from the biomass in a one-step biphasic solution.Several parameters which can affect the biphasic system were analyzed: contact time, volume of solvent, volume ratio, type of organic solvent, biomass amount and concentration of solvents, to extract the highest amount of lipids from microalgae. The results were optimized and up to 83.% of lipid recovery yield and 94.6% of enhancement was successfully achieved. The results obtain from GC-FID were similar to the analysis of triglyceride lipid standard.The profound hybrid biphasic system shows great potential to radically disrupt the cell wall of microalgae and instantaneously extract lipids in a single-step approach. The lipids extracted were tested to for its comparability to biodiesel performance.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668383>Metformin prevents the pathological browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Browning, the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to a beige phenotype, has gained interest as a strategy to induce weight loss and improve insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to  wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular  sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Methods included questionnaires regarding socio-demographic characteristics, food security, diet (two non-consecutive 24-h recalls), and physical activity (PA). Anthropometric data included height, weight, and waist circumference. Data analysis covered descriptive statistics, multivariate linear and logistic regression. : Sample showed 75% prevalence of overweight and obesity, while 87% of households reported some level of HFI. Mild HFI resulted in five times more probability of farm workers' obesity (OR = .18, 95% CI: 1.37-19.58). However, there was a protective effect of HFI for obesity among men (OR 0.089, 95% CI: 0.01-0.58) in a context of intense labor-related PA. : There is a difference by gender in the relationship of HFI with obesity prevalence related perhaps to the  expenditure of male agricultural migrant workers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664552>-dependent effect trial of photobiomodulation on blood pressure in hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>The main purpose of this work was to construct an -dependent response curve of photobiomodulation on arterial pressure in hypertension animal model. To reach this objective, we have used a two-kidney one clip (2K-1C) rat model.

In this demonstration, we show potential applications of cellulose-nanocrystal (CNC)-filled polymer for enhancing color uniformity of white LEDs. The excellent optical diffusion capability provided by CNC and the mechanical flexibility offered by the polymer matrix render it a highly efficient color mixer. The CNC-filled polymer was applied on the outer surface of a conventional white LED module to enhance both color and illumination uniformities. It reduced 71.4% of angular color deviation and improved illumination uniformity by 35.% while maintaining over 85% of light  transmission. We also demonstrate that for a specific application purpose, such as downlight illumination, one can simultaneously achieve high color uniformity and downlight illumination with reduced glare by constructing the CNC-filled polymer into a CNC-doped lens. In this case, a 0.03%-CNC-filled lens can reduce angular color deviation by 74.0% and achieve a light  transmission of 85.%.

However, the safety issue induced by uncontrollable dendrite growth hinders the commercialization of Li anode. Herein, self-supported three-dimensional flexible carbon cloth covered with lithiophilic silicon nanowire array is constructed as host for loading of molten Li to achieve the C/SiNW/Li composite anode. The electrode component of carbon cloth provides the flexible and conductive substrate to accommodate the volume change during the stripping/plating of Li and facilitate more efficient electrons transport, while silicon nanowires improve the wettability of carbon host to liquefied Li and render uniform Li deposition on the surface of composite electrode. The as-prepared C/SiNW/Li composite anode exhibits enhanced cycling stability with low hysteresis of 40 mV for more than 200 h and better rate tolerance even current density up to  mA cm-2. When coupling with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, the full cells using C/SiNW/Li composite anode demonstrate remarkable electrochemical performance with exceptional rate performance up to 10 C as well as stable long-term cycling (the capacity retention of 62 % at  C-rate over 2000 cycles), which is much higher than the cells with pure Li anode.

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the  balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight,  balance (food intake,  expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, ) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis. C2CD5 represent a new target and pathway that could be targeted in Obesity.Copyright © 2019.

As a source of sustainable , biodiesel turns out to be the best alternative to petro fuels. In this context, nonedible oil-producing seeds might be a potential source for biodiesel production owing to their environment-friendly nature and cost-effectiveness. The current study, consequently, deals with the investigation and identification of micro-morphological characters between six novel nonedible oil-bearing seeds employing scanning electron microscopy as possible biodiesel feed-stocks. Light microscopic examinations show that seed size varies from 0.3 to 1.3 cm in width and 0. to 1. cm in. Additionally, a large difference in seed color ranges from dark brown, black, and various shades of light brown was also witnessed. The FFA content of the seeds ranges in 0.3-4.1 mg KOH/g, and the seed oil content fall in 30-65% (w/w) range. SEM-mediated seed ultrastructure investigations displays greater variation in seed size, shape, color, periclinal wall shape, and sculpturing and so on. All the seeds differ from rounded, ovoid, ovate, oblong, flattened, and elliptical shape. Greater variation in seed wall structure has been seen from angular, entire, irregular, straight, elongated, smooth, and polygonal. The periclinal wall arrangements show alteration from flat, depressed, elevated, smooth, pentagonal, bullate, and coarse seed margins. The results obtained from the current study suggest that scanning electron microscopy could be a beneficial tool in vitalizing the hidden micromorphological characters among various nonedible oil producing seeds, which eventually helps in exploration, correct identification, seed classification, and authentication in future.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675460>Calculating dose from a 2. MV imaging beam using a commercial treatment planning system.</a></h2><p>Patient dose from 2. MV images on the TrueBeam linear accelerator is not easily quantified, primarily because this beam  is not normally modeled by commercial treatment planning systems.

Calculated doses with both algorithms agreed with the measurement data to within the following criteria recommended for conventional therapeutic MV beams: 2% local dose-difference in the high-dose region, 3% global difference in the low-dose region, 3 mm distance to agreement in the penumbra, and a gamma pass rate of >95% for 3%/3 mm criteria. Acuros was able to accurately calculate dose through cork and bone-equivalent heterogeneities. AAA was able to accurately calculate dose through the bone-equivalent heterogeneity but did not pass within the recommended criteria for the cork heterogeneity.

Two aspects of RF were analyzed, beam  dependence and surface dose determination.The measurements done at the surface or near the radiation source are done without charged electronic equilibrium and also have contribution of electron contamination. The detectors used for these measurements should not alter the dose to the target. To counteract these dosimetric problems it is proposed to do the measurements with radiochromic films which are thin detectors and have tissue equivalent properties.The measurements were done using a Novalis linear accelerator (LINAC) with nominal  of 6 MV. To determine the surface dose, the total scatter factors (TSF) of three different field sizes were measured in a water phantom at  cm depth.  dependence of EBT3 was studied at three different depths, using a solid water phantom. The surface measurements were done with the RF for the same field sizes of the TSF measurements. The value of the percentage depth dose was calculated normalizing the doses measured in the RF with the LINAC output, at  cm depth, and the TSF.The radiochromic films showed almost  independence, the differences between the curves are 1.7% and 1.8% for the 1. cm and 10 cm depth, respectively. The percentage depth doses values at the surface measured for the 10 cm × 10 cm,  cm ×  cm and 1 cm × 1 cm were 26.1 ± 1.3%, 21.3 ± 2.4% and 20.2 ± 2.6%, respectively.The RF-EBT3 seems to be a detector suitable for measurements of the dose at the surface.

Our first-principles simulations suggest that NP stability at high temperature is governed by both geometric constraints and the roughness of the energetic landscape. Calculated adatom migration paths across the zeolite surface and desorption paths from the supported NPs lend insight to the modified OR sintering processes with the emergence of different binding configurations as the aluminum concentration increases from pristine to heavily-doped ZSM-.

Removal of 1,4-dioxane by a bio-zeolite (Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190-bioaugmented ZSM-) in the presence of several chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) was superior to removal by adsorption using abiotic zeolite. Mixtures containing 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), were an exception and completely inhibited the bio-zeolite system. Specific adsorption characteristics were studied using adsorption isotherms in single- and bi-solute systems accompanied by Polanyi-theory based Dubinin-Ashtakhov (DA) modeling. Adsorption behavior was examined using characteristic  (Ea/H) from modified DA models and molecular dynamics simulations. While the tight-fit of 1,4-dioxane in the hydrophobic channels of ZSM- appears to drive 1,4-dioxane adsorption, the greater hydrophobicity of trichloroethene and cis-1,2-dichloroethene cause them to have a greater affinity over 1,4-dioxane for adsorption sites on the zeolite. 1,4-Dioxane was desorbed and displaced by CVOCs, except 1,1-DCE due to its low Ea/H value, explaining why bio-zeolite only biodegraded 1,4-dioxane in 1,1-DCE-free CVOC mixtures.

Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult metabolism. All these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult metabolism has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting metabolic rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory metabolic rate, measured in cold challenging condition, °C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an -saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.© 2019.

The specific objectives were to (i) investigate the major AhR-active fractions of organic extracts of sediments by using H4IIE-luc in vitro bioassay (4 h and 72 h exposures), (ii) quantify known AhR agonists, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and styrene oligomers (SOs), (iii) identify unknown AhR agonists by use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOFMS), and (iv) determine contributions of AhR agonists to total potencies measured by use of the bioassay. FSA was conducted on fractions F2.6 and F2.7 (aromatics with log K -7) in extracts of sediment from Siheung Creek (industrial area). Those fractions exhibited significant AhR-mediated potency as well as relatively great concentrations of PAHs and SOs. FSA detected 461 and 449 compounds in F2.6 and F2.7, respectively. Of these, five tentative candidates of AhR agonist were selected based on NIST library matching, aromatic structures and numbers of rings, and available standards. Benz[b]anthracene, 11H-benzo[a]fluorene, and 4,-methanochrysene exhibited significant AhR-mediated potency in the H4IIE-luc bioassay, and relative potencies of these compounds were determined. Potency balance analysis demonstrated that these three newly identified AhR agonists explained 1.1% to 67% of total induced AhR-mediated potencies of samples, which were particularly great for industrial sediments.

Their Dy(iii) centers are six and seven-coordinated in octahedral and pentagonal-bipyramidal coordination geometries, respectively. Their structural difference is caused by the additional coordinated water molecule in the equatorial positions of complex 2 in comparison with that of complex 1. The well designed semi-rigid ligand contributes significantly to the low coordination numbers of Dy(iii) ions in the two title complexes, as well as to their structural difference. Magnetic investigations revealed that complexes 1 and 2 are both field-induced single-ion magnets (SIMs) with their effective  barriers being 22.9(6) and 153.9() K, respectively.

The biosynthetic machinery responsible for the production of these secondary metabolites (SMs) (also called natural products) is often encoded by collocated groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). High-throughput genome sequencing of both isolates and metagenomic samples combined with the development of specialized computational workflows is enabling systematic identification of BGCs and the discovery of novel SMs. In order to advance exploration of microbial secondary metabolism and its diversity, we developed the largest publicly available database of predicted BGCs combined with experimentally verified BGCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc-public). Here we describe the first major content update of the IMG-ABC knowledgebase, since its initial release in 2015, refreshing the BGC prediction pipeline with the latest version of antiSMASH (v5) as well as presenting the data in the context of underlying environmental metadata sourced from GOLD (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/).

Differentiation is associated with dynamic epigenetic alteration and transcriptional change, while self-renewal depends on maintaining the genome DNA accurately. Genome stability of PSCs is strictly regulated to maintain pluripotency. However, the DNA damage response (DDR) mechanism in PSCs is still unclear. There is accumulating evidence that genome stability and pluripotency are regulated by a transcriptional change in undifferentiated and differentiated states. iPSCs are ideal for analyzing transcriptional regulation during reprogramming and differentiation. This study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional alteration surrounding genome stability maintenance, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis in fibroblasts, iPSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from iPSCs as differentiated cells. After ionizing radiation exposure, foci for the DNA double-stranded break marker γ-H2AX increased, peaking at 0. h in all cells (>90%), decreasing after 4 h in fibroblasts (32.3%) and NPCs (22.3%), but still remaining at 52.% (NB1RGB C2 clone) and 54.7% (201B7 cells) in iPSCs. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected, indicating that iPSCs' apoptosis increases. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed high expression of apoptosis genes (TP53, CASP3 and BID) in iPSCs. Results suggested that increased apoptosis activity maintains accurate, undifferentiated genome DNA in the cell population.© The Author(s) 2019.

Each ribonucleoprotein complex comprises specific rRNAs and ribosomal proteins that are organized into functional domains. The RNA exosome complex plays a crucial role as one of the pre-60S-processing factors, because it is the RNase responsible for processing the 7S pre-rRNA to the mature .8S rRNA. The yeast pre-60S assembly factor Nop53 has previously been shown to associate with the nucleoplasmic pre-60S in a region containing the "foot" structure assembled around the 3' end of the 7S pre-rRNA. Nop53 interacts with 25S rRNA and with several 60S assembly factors, including the RNA exosome, specifically, with its catalytic subunit Rrp6 and with the exosome-associated RNA helicase Mtr4. Nop53 is therefore considered the adaptor responsible for recruiting the exosome complex for 7S processing. Here, using proteomics-based approaches in budding yeast to analyze the effects of Nop53 on the exosome interactome, we found that the exosome binds pre-ribosomal complexes early during the ribosome maturation pathway. We also identified interactions through which Nop53 modulates exosome activity in the context of 60S maturation and provide evidence that in addition to recruiting the exosome, Nop53 may also be important for positioning the exosome during 7S processing. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the exosome is recruited much earlier during ribosome assembly than previously thought, suggesting the existence of additional interactions that remain to be described.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662351>Ultra-processed foods and excessive free sugar intake in the UK: a nationally representative cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>To describe dietary sources of free sugars in different age groups of the UK population considering food groups classified according to the NOVA system and to estimate the proportion of excessive free sugars that could potentially be avoided by reducing consumption of their main sources.Cross-sectional data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008-2014) were analysed. Food items collected using a 4-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system.9364 individuals aged 1. years and above.Average dietary content of free sugars and proportion of individuals consuming more than 10% of total  from free sugars.Poisson regression was used to estimate the associations between each of the NOVA food group and intake of free sugars. We estimated the per cent reduction in prevalence of excessive free sugar intake from eliminating ultra-processed foods and table sugar. Analyses were stratified by age group and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, survey year, region and equivalised household income (sterling pounds).Ultra-processed foods account for 56.8% of total  intake and 64.7% of total free sugars in the UK diet. Free sugars represent 12.4% of total  intake, and 61.3% of the sample exceeded the recommended limit of 10%  from free sugars. This percentage was higher among children (74.9%) and adolescents (82.9%). Prevalence of excessive free sugar intake increased linearly across quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption for all age groups, except among the elderly. Eliminating ultra-processed foods could potentially reduce the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake by 47%.Our findings suggest that actions to reduce the ultra-processed food consumption generally rich in free sugars could lead to substantial public health benefits.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Maize is both a genetic model for grass species and a potential source of lignocellulosic biomass from crop residues. Genetic improvement of maize for its utility as a bioenergy feedstock depends on identification of the specific gene family members expressed during secondary wall development in stems.High-throughput sequencing of transcripts expressed in developing rind tissues of stem internodes provided a comprehensive inventory of cell wall-related genes in maize (Zea mays, cultivar B73). Of 1239 of these genes, 854 were expressed among the internodes at ≥95 reads per 20 M, and 693 of them at ≥500 reads per 20 M. Grasses have cell wall compositions distinct from non-commelinid species; only one-quarter of maize cell wall-related genes expressed in stems were putatively orthologous with those of the eudicot Arabidopsis. Using a slope-metric algorithm, five distinct patterns for sub-sets of co-expressed genes were defined across a time course of stem development. For the subset of genes associated with secondary wall formation, fifteen sequence motifs were found in promoter regions. The same members of gene families were often expressed in two maize inbreds, B73 and Mo17, but levels of gene expression between them varied, with 30% of all genes exhibiting at least a -fold difference at any stage. Although presence-absence and copy-number variation might account for much of these differences, fold-changes of expression of a CADa and a FLA11 gene were attributed to polymorphisms in promoter response elements.Large genetic variation in maize as a species precludes the extrapolation of cell wall-related gene expression networks even from one common inbred line to another. Elucidation of genotype-specific expression patterns and their regulatory controls will be needed for association panels of inbreds and landraces to fully exploit genetic variation in maize and other bioenergy grass species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670740>Linear-shaped Ln and Ln clusters constructed by a polydentate Schiff base ligand and a β-diketone co-ligand: structures, fluorescence properties, magnetic refrigeration and single-molecule magnet behavior.</a></h2><p>Herein, ten new linear-shaped LnIII4 and LnIII6 clusters, with the formula [Ln4(acac)6L2(CH3O)2(CH3OH)4]·xCH3OH (Ln = Nd (1), Sm (2), Eu (3), Gd (4), Tb (), Dy (6), and Tm (8), Hacac = acetylacetone), [Ln6(acac)4L4(CH3O)6]·xCH3OH (Er (7) and Yb (9)), and [Lu4(acac)6L2(OH)2]·2CH2Cl2 (10), based on a polydentate Schiff base ligand, H2L, and a β-diketone co-ligand were successfully synthesized and structurally characterized.

A challenge for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) processes is to realize these features in solid materials without undesired phase segregation and detrimental dye aggregation. To achieve this, we combine a palladium porphyrin sensitizer and a 9,10-diphenylanthracene annihilator within a crystalline mesoporous metal-organic framework using an inverted design. In this modular TTA system, the framework walls constitute the fixed sensitizer, while caprylic acid coats the channels providing a solvent-like environment for the mobile annihilator in the channel.

Glutaminolysis is the metabolic process deployed by many aggressive cancers such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Imaging the metabolic pathways of L-glutamine could provide more insights into tumor biology. Reliable and reproducible automated synthesis of [C]L-glutamine PET (Positron Emission Tomography) radiotracer is critical for these studies.[C]L-Glutamine ([C]L-Gln) was reliably and reproducibly synthesized. The automated process involves cleaning and drying of the synthesis module, azeotropic drying of crown ether and cesium bicarbonate, conversion of [C]CO to [C] CsCN, incorporation of [C] CN into the starting material, and hydrolysis and deprotection of the corresponding [C] nitrile to yield [C]L-glutamine. Starting with approximately 1 Ci of [C] cesium cyanide ([C]CsCN), 47-77 mCi (n = 4) of the final product, [C]L-Gln, was obtained after sterile filtration. The radiochemical purity of the final product was > 90% with almost exclusively L-glutamine isomer. The yield of [C]L-Gln was 43-52% (n = 4), decay corrected to end of [C] CsCN trapping in the reaction vessel.All the steps including drying of the mixture of base and crown ether, preparation of [C] cyanide, radiochemical synthesis and formulation were accomplished on a single synthesis unit.

Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are classified as slow-adapting (SA) or rapid-adapting (RA) based on whether or not they spike repetitively during sustained tactile stimulation; the former are subclassified as type 1 or 2 based on the regularity of their spiking. Recording  from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice, we observed irregular- and regular-spiking units consistent with SA1 and SA2 LTMRs, but some units, which we labeled "semi-regular", did not fit cleanly into the existing classification scheme. Analysis of their spiking revealed integer-multiple patterning - spike trains comprised a fundamental interspike interval and multiples thereof. Integer-multiple-patterned spiking was reproduced by randomly removing spikes from an otherwise regular spike train, suggesting that semi-regular units represent SA2 units in which some spikes are "missing". We hypothesized that missing spikes arose from intermittent failure of spikes to initiate or to propagate. Intermittent failure of spike initiation was ruled out by several observations: integer-multiple-patterned spiking was not induced by intradermal lidocaine, was independent of stimulus modality (mechanical vs. optogenetic), and could not be reproduced in a conductance-based model neuron given constant input. On the other hand, integer-multiple-patterned spiking was induced by application of lidocaine to the DRG, thus pinpointing intermittent failure of spike propagation as the basis for integer-multiple-patterned spiking. In fact, half of all SA2 units exhibited some missing spikes, mostly at low rate (<%), which suggests that axons are efficient in using the lowest safety factor capable of producing near-perfect propagation reliability.The impedance mismatch at axon branch points can impede spike propagation. Reliability of spike propagation across branch points remains an open question, and is especially important for primary afferents whose spikes must cross a T-junction in order to reach the CNS. Past research on propagation reliability has relied almost entirely on simulations and  experiments. Here, recording , we linked a distinctive pattern of spiking to the intermittent failure of spike propagation at the T-junction. The rarity of failures argues that safety factor is high under physiological conditions, yet the occurrence of such failures argues that safety factor is  high enough to ensure -perfect reliability, consistent with a good balance between propagation reliability and  efficiency.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667348>Observation of a transition between dynamical phases in a quantum degenerate Fermi gas.</a></h2><p>A proposed paradigm for out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is that an analog of quantum phase transitions exists between parameter regimes of qualitatively distinct time-dependent behavior. Here, we present evidence of such a transition between dynamical phases in a cold-atom quantum simulator of the collective Heisenberg model. Our simulator encodes spin in the hyperfine states of ultracold fermionic potassium. Atoms are pinned in a network of single-particle modes, whose spatial extent emulates the long-range interactions of traditional quantum magnets. We find that below a critical interaction strength, magnetization of an initially polarized fermionic gas decays quickly, while above the transition point, the magnetization becomes long-lived because of an  gap that protects against dephasing by the inhomogeneous axial field. Our quantum simulation reveals a nonequilibrium transition predicted to exist but not yet directly observed in quenched s-wave superconductors.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Initially, the as-received SCBA was re-burned using rotary (continuous) and muffle (batch) kilns, both at 600 °C for 1 h. Next, the resulting ash was ground in a closed-circuit ball mill with an air classifier system to obtain a product with 50% passing particle size of approximately 10 μm (SCBA600). SCBA600 was then characterized in terms of oxide composition, loss on ignition, density, specific surface area, and pozzolanic activity. A hydration study was carried out using isothermal calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Additionally, the performance of SCBA600 in mortars was evaluated by axial compression tests. The combination of recalcination at 600 °C, low- ultrafine grinding of the material and classification resulted in pozzolanic SCBA. The results also showed that including SCBA600 in cement mortars reduced total accumulated heat and portlandite content in cement-based pastes, in addition to refining pore structure and significantly increasing compressive strength after 3 days of curing.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667374>Quantitative evaluation of the surface stability and morphological changes of CuO particles.</a></h2><p>CuO low-index surfaces periodic models have been simulated based on density functional theory.

In northwestern Iberia, D. acuminata has a long growing season, from spring to early autumn, and populations develop as soon as shallow stratification forms when the upwelling season begins. In contrast, D. acuta blooms in late summer, when the depth of the pycnocline is maximal and upwelling pulses are moderate. In situ observations on the hydrodynamic regimes during the two windows of opportunity for Dinophysis species led us to hypothesize that D. acuta should be more sensitive to turbulence than D. acuminata. To test this hypothesis, we studied the response of D. acuminata and D. acuta to three realistic turbulence levels low (LT), ε ≈ 10 m s; medium (MT), ε ≈ 10  m s and high (HT), ε ≈ 10 m sgenerated by Turbogen, a highly reproducible, computer-controlled system. Cells of both species exposed to LT and MT grew at rates similar to the controls. Marked differences were found in the response to HT: D. acuminata grew slowly after an initial lag phase, whereas D. acuta cell numbers declined. Results from this study support the hypothesis that turbulence may play a role in shaping the spatio-temporal distribution of individual species of Dinophysis. We also hypothesize that, in addition to cell disturbance affecting division, sustained high shear generated by microturbulence may cause a decline in Dinophysis numbers due to decreased densities of ciliate prey.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate  restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of  Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least  years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%)  restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%)  restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate  restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6. to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -. kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe  restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate  restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate  restriction.

All basal diets consisted of cereals, soybean meal, skim milk powder and premixes according to recommendations (no growth promoters or enzymes). For Trial 1, piglets from 16 litters (50% male-castrated, 50% female) were assigned to three treatment groups ( = 16) in a completely randomised block design. Groups received either 2.% supplementation with sun dried (SD) or drum dried (DD)  powder or 2.% of diatomaceous earth (control). For Trial 2, piglets from 12 litters received either % of diatomaceous earth (control) or one of three mixtures of diatomaceous earth + DD  powder (3.3%+1.7%, 1.7%+3.3% or 0.0%+%;  = 12). Data collection included zootechnical performance, faecal consistency, blood plasma urea (Trial 1 and 2) and ATTD (Trial 2). Metabolisable  (ME) of DD  and diets in Trial 2 was estimated using digestible nutrients. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA (treatment, block) and mixed linear regression. During both trials,  at dosages ≥2.% significantly reduced feed:gain ratio compared to control ( ≤ 0.0001, = 0.01 for Trial 1, Trial 2) irrespective of the drying method. ATTD from Trial 2 significantly increased digestibilities of dry matter (DM) and crude ash (CA) ( ≤ 0.01) and significantly decreased digestibilities of organic matter and crude fibre in animals fed ≥3.33% DD  ( = 0.01). Fractional digestibility of the DD  resulted in limited ME of ~9.3 ± 2. MJ/kg DM. Dietary conversion ratios of ME and digestible DM of DD  diets from Trial 2 decreased linearly with increasing algal supplementation (R = 0.93, 0.94 and  = 0.002, 0.002 for MCR, DCR). In conclusion, dried  powder was included up to % into diets without impairing zootechnical performance. The improved feed conversion in the presence of  was partly due to slightly higher ME within the algae diets compared to control. However, piglets receiving  during Trial 2 needed significantly lower dietary ME and digestible DM to maintain growth performance. Thus,  exerted a performance enhancing effect on weaned piglets.

We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of acid catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose.In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after 2 h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic acids. At 120 °C, pH 0., and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations).Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h2><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH .The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately  times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH  was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH ) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670970>Side Chain Optimization Remarkably Enhances the In Vivo Stability of 18F-Labeled Glutamine for Tumor Imaging.</a></h2><p>Similar to glycolysis, glutaminolysis acts as a vital  source in tumor cells, providing building blocks for the metabolic needs of tumor cells. To capture glutaminolysis in tumors, 18F-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln) and 18F-fluoroboronoglutamine ([18F]FBQ) have been successfully developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, but these two molecules are lack of stability, resulting in undesired yet significant bone uptake. In this study, we found that [18F]FBQ-C2 is a stable Gln PET tracer by adding two more methylene groups to the side chain of [18F]FBQ. [18F]FBQ-C2 was synthesized with a good radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35% and over 98% radiochemical purity. [18F]FBQ-C2 showed extreme stability in vitro, and no defluorination was observed after 2 hours in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C. The competitive inhibition assay results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 enters cells via system ASC and N, similar to natural glutamine, and can be transported by tumor-overexpressed ASCT2. PET imaging and biodistribution results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 is stable in vivo with low bone uptake (0.81±0.20%ID/g) and can be cleared rapidly from most tissues. Dynamic scan and pharmacokinetic studies using BGC823-xenograft-bearing mice revealed that [18F]FBQ-C2 accumulates specifically in tumors, with a longer half-life (101.18±6.50 min) in tumor tissues than in other tissues (52.70±12.44 min in muscle). Biodistribution exhibits a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (4.8±1.7 for muscle, 2.±1.0 for the stomach, 2.2±0.9 for the liver and 17.8±8.4 for the brain). In conclusion, [18F]FBQ-C2 can be used to perform high-contrast Gln imaging of tumors and can serve as a PET tracer for clinical research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663059>Recombinant protein expression in biofilms.</a></h2><p>Biofilm research is usually focused on the prevention or control of biofilm formation. Recently, the significance of the biofilm mode of growth in biotechnological applications received increased attention. Since biofilm reactors show many advantages over suspended cell reactors, especially in their higher biomass density and operational stability, bacterial biofilms have emerged as an interesting approach for the expression of specific proteins. Despite the potential of biofilm systems, recombinant protein production using biofilms has been scarcely investigated for the past 25 years. Our group has demonstrated that  biofilms were able to produce a model recombinant protein, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), at much higher levels than their planktonic counterparts. Even without optimization of cultivation conditions, an attractive productivity was obtained, indicating that biofilm cultures can be used as an alternative form of high cell density cultivation (HCDC).  remains one of the favorite hosts for recombinant protein production and it has been successfully used in metabolic engineering for the synthesis of high value products. This review presents the advantages and concerns of using biofilms for the production of recombinant proteins and summarizes the different biofilm systems which have been described for this purpose. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the four microbial hosts tested for recombinant protein production in biofilms (two bacteria and two filamentous fungi) are also discussed.© 2019 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663298>Dietary intake of people with dementia on acute hospital wards.</a></h2><p>The aim of this service evaluation was to understand the factors affecting meal provision on a dementia ward and assess whether meals-based dietary intake met estimated mean  requirement and reference nutrient intake (RNI). A mixed-methods approach was adopted: 1. Mapping the dietary intake for a cohort ( n =6) of inpatients with advanced dementia over a period of four consecutive days. 2. Semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of the professionals ( n =) involved. Two of the participants' four-day mean intakes did not meet their estimated  requirement based on meal provision. All participants apart from one met the target of 0.75g of protein per kg body weight per day for the general population. Several of the nutrients consumed were at or exceeded the RNI for adults of this age, although participants' mean dietary vitamin D intake was substantially below the RNI for the general population. The themes included communication, time pressure and the continuity of service provision. The meals provided were nutritionally sound. Individuals' nutritional status was improved through staff supporting them with eating. The contribution of drinks and snacks to nutrient intake warrants further exploration. Effective communication between food providers and ward areas is important. Mealtimes should reflect patient need - for example, having the main meal in the evening and a lighter option at lunch. This does not clash with the benefits of a flexible breakfast time.© 2019 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, its practical application is still seriously limited by the modest cycling and rate performances. Herein, we first report a facile design to scalably synthesize the unique one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous ZnMnO 3 nanorods (ZMO-NRs) composed of nanoscale particles (~11 nm). The 1D mesoporous structure and nanoscale building blocks of the ZMO-NRs effectively promote the transport of ions/electrons, accommodate severe volume changes, and expose more active sites for lithium storage. Benefiting from these appealing structural merits, the obtained ZMO-NRs anode exhibits excellent rate behavior (~454 mAh g -1 at 2 A g - 1 ) and ultra-long term cyclic performance (~949.7 mAh g - 1 even over 500 cycles at 0. A g - 1 ) for efficient lithium storage. Besides, the LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 //ZMO-NRs full cell presents a practical  density (~192.2 Wh kg -1 ) and impressive cyclability with ~91% of capacity retention over 110 cycles.

Herein, a self-template strategy based on Ni-Co-glycerates is developed to prepare bimetallic Ni-Co-P microflowers with ultrathin nanosheet arrays. The highly porous core-shell structure gives rise to affluent mass transfer channels and availably prevents the aggregation of nanosheets, while the ultrathin nanosheets are favorable for producing abundant active sites.

Thermal annealing and antisolvent treatments are usually executed in order to promote the crystallization and film quality of perovskites, which add complexity to the device fabrication process. Here, the Cesium-based 2D/3D perovskite was prepared by introducing an ammonium halide benzamidine hydrochloride (BMCl) as the additive. By further introducing an appropriate amount of MABr and PbBr2, BM2(Cs1-xMAxPbBr3)n-1PbBr4 crystals can be formed rapidly without any additional treatments, whilst inhibiting the formation of unfavorable Cs4PbBr6 phase. The optimized 2D/3D perovskite based LEDs achieved a maximum luminance of 12367 Cd/m2, current efficiency of 17.4 Cd/A, and EQE of .2%.

However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and obesity.In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study 2; n = 51) weight loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a -min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first -min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE). Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study 2 participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), -min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated measures ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ±  kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the -min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast  min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and obesity. However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid metabolism. Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an  expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658597>Potential Application of Graphene/Antimonene Herterostructure as an Anode for Li-Ion Batteries: A First-Principles Study.</a></h2><p>To suppress the volume expansion and thus improve the performance of antimonene as a promising anode for lithium-ion batteries, we have systematically studied the stability, structural and electronic properties of the antimonene capped with graphene (G/Sb heterostructure) upon the intercalation and diffusion of Li atoms by first-principles calculations based on van der Waals (vdW) corrected density functional theory. G/Sb exhibits higher Young's modulus (armchair: 145.20, zigzag: 144.36 N m) and improved electrical conductivity (bandgap of 0.03 eV) compared with those of antimonene. Li favors incorporating into the interlayer region of G/Sb rather than the outside surfaces of graphene and antimonene of G/Sb heterostructure, which is caused by the synergistic effect. The in-plane lattice constants of G/Sb heterostructure expand only around 4.%, and the interlayer distance of G/Sb increases slightly (0.22 Å) at the case of fully lithiation, which indicates that the capping of graphene on antimonene can effectively suppress the volumetric expansion during the charging process. Additionally, the hybrid G/Sb heterostructure has little influence on the migration behaviors of Li on the outside of graphene and Sb surfaces compared with their free-standing monolayers. However, the migration  barrier for Li diffusion in the interlayer region (about 0.59 eV) is significantly affected by the geometry structure, which can be reduced to 0.34 eV simply by increasing the interlayer distance. The higher theoretical specific capacity (369.03 mAh g vs 208 mAh g for antimonene monolayer) and suitable open circuit voltage (from 0.11 V to 0.89 V) of G/Sb heterostructure are beneficial for anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. The above results reveal that G/Sb heterostructure may be an ideal candidate of anode for high recycling-rate and portable lithium-ion batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670421>Carbon Tunneling in the Automerization of Cyclo[18]Carbon.</a></h2><p>Cyclo[18]carbon (C18), a recently synthesized carbon allotrope, was found to have a polyynic ground state structure with D9h symmetry and formally alternating single and triple bonds. Yet, under less influencing experimental conditions this molecule might undergo an automerization reaction between its two degenerate geometries via a cumulenic (non-alternating, adjacent double bonds) D18h transition state. Herein we discuss the role of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in this degenerate reaction. Our computations predict that at the experimental temperature ( K) the reaction in gas phase is completely driven by an extremely rapid heavy atom tunneling (k = 2.1 × 108 s-1). Even when approaching room temperature, the QMT rate is still an order of magnitude faster than the semi-classical one. We propose an experimental test to support our prediction, by measuring a characteristic tunneling  splitting within the radio wave region. Additionally, we examine the role of QMT in other hypothetical C4n+2 carbon clusters.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The formation, crystal chemistry, and physical properties of UNiB and NbNiB [ternary derivatives of the cubic CrC-type (116, 3̅)] have been studied; the formation of the hypothetical "UNiB" and "NbNiB" has been disproved. UNiB [ = 10.6701(2) Å] crystallizes in the ordered WCrC-type, whereas NbNiB [ = 10.5842(1) Å] adopts the MgNiB-type. Ni in UNiB can be substituted by U, leading to the solid solution UNiB (0 ≤  ≤ 0.3); oppositely, Nb in NbNiB is partially replaced by Ni, forming the solution NbNiB (0 ≤  ≤ 0.), none of them reaching the limit corresponding to the hypothetically ordered "UNiB" and "NbNiB". These results prompted us to investigate quaternary compounds UNbNiB and UNbNiB: strong competition in the occupancy of the 4 and 8 sites by U, Nb, and Ni atoms has been observed, with the 4 site occupied by U/Ni atoms only and the 8 site filled by U/Nb atoms only. UNiB, UNiB, and NbNiB are Pauli paramagnets. Interestingly, NbNiB shows ferromagnetism with  ≈ 11 K; the Curie-Weiss fit gives an effective magnetic moment of 2.78 μ/Ni, suggesting that all Ni atoms in the formula unit contribute to the total magnetic moment. The () data at 2 K further corroborate the ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation moment of 10 μ/fu (≈0.49 μ/Ni). The magnetic moment of Ni at the 4 site induces a moment in all of the Ni atoms of the whole unit cell (32 and 48 sites), with all atoms ordering ferromagnetically at 11 K.

While great strides have been made in EM data collection and data processing, sample preparation is still performed using decades-old techniques. Those sample preparation methods rely on extensive macroscale purification and concentration to achieve homogeneity suitable for high-resolution analyses. Noting that relatively few bioparticles are needed to generate high-quality protein structures, this work uses microfluidics that can accurately and precisely manipulate and deliver bioparticles to grids for imaging. The use of microfluidics enables isolation, purification, and concentration of specific target proteins at these small scales and does so in a relatively short period of time (minutes). These capabilities enable imaging of more dilute solutions and obtaining pure protein images from mixtures. In this system, spatially isolated, purified, and concentrated proteins are transferred directly onto electron microscopy grids for imaging. The processing enables imaging of more dilute solutions, as low as  × 10 g/ml, with small total amounts of protein (<400 pg, 900 amol). These levels may be achieved with mixtures and, as proof-of-principle, imaging of one protein from a mixture of two proteins is demonstrated.Copyright © 2019 Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667429>Survey and analysis of the quantitative methods used in electricity research on GCC countries: 1983-2018.</a></h2><p>This study provides a systematic analysis of research on the electricity sector in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the period 1983-2018.

Heat stress resulted in immediate reductions in dark-adapted photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (F/F), net assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g), and enhancement of stress volatile emissions, including enhanced emissions of green leaf volatiles (GLV), mono- and sesquiterpenes, light weight oxygenated volatile organic compounds (LOC), geranyl-geranyl diphosphate pathway volatiles (GGDP), saturated aldehydes, and benzenoids, with partial recovery by day . Changes in stress-induced volatiles were always less in leaves inoculated with B. linens RS16. However, net assimilation rate was enhanced by bacterial inoculation only in the 37 °C treatment and overall reduction of isoprene emissions was observed in bacterially-treated leaves. Principal component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that different stress applications influenced specific volatile organic compounds. In addition, changes in the expression analysis of heat shock protein 70 gene (DnaK) gene in B. linens RS16 upon exposure to higher temperatures further indicated that B. linens RS16 has developed its own heat resistance mechanism to survive under higher temperature regimes. Taken together, this study demonstrates that foliar application of ACC deaminase containing PGPB can ameliorate heat stress effects in realistic biological settings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Muscle force imbalance is the primary cause of such deformity. Many diseases can lead to muscle force imbalance, such as tethered cord syndrome, cerebral palsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and trauma. At present, many surgical treatments are available for cavovarus foot. For older children, priority should be given to midfoot osteotomy and fusion. Since complications such as abnormal foot length, foot stiffness, and abnormal gait tend to develop postoperatively, it is important to preserve the joints and correct the deformity as much as possible. Adequate soft tissue release and muscle balance are the keys to correcting the deformity and avoiding its postoperative recurrence.To assess the efficacy of soft tissue release combined with joint-sparing osteotomy in the treatment of cavovarus foot deformity in older children.The clinical data of 21 older children with cavovarus foot deformity (28 feet) who were treated surgically at the Ninth Department of Orthopedics of Jizhong  Xingtai Mining Group General Hospital from November 2014 to July 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 14 years old, with an average age of 12.46 ± 1.20 years. Their main clinical manifestations were deformity, pain, and gait abnormality. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, electromyographic examination, weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of the feet, and the Coleman block test. Surgical procedures including metatarsal fascia release, Achilles tendon or medial gastrocnemius lengthening, "V"-shaped osteotomy on the dorsal side of the metatarsal base, opening medial cuneiform wedge osteotomy, closing cuboid osteotomy, anterior transfer of the posterior tibial tendon, peroneus longus-to-brevis transfer, and calcaneal sliding osteotomy to correct hindfoot varus deformity were performed. After surgery, long leg plaster casts were applied, the plaster casts were removed 6 wk later, Kirschner wires were removed, and functional exercise was initiated. The patients began weight-bearing walk 3 mo after surgery. Therapeutic effects were evaluated using the Wicart grading system, and Meary's angles and Hibbs' angles were measured based on X-ray images obtained preoperatively and at last follow-up to assess their changes.The patients were followed for 6 to 32 mo, with an average follow-up period of 17.68 ± 6.290 mo. Bone healing at the osteotomy site was achieved at 3 mo in all cases. According to the Wicart grading system, very good results were achieved in 18 feet, good in 7, and fair in 3, with a very good/good rate of 89.3%. At last follow-up, mean Meary's angle was 6.36° ± 1.810°, and mean Hibbs' angle was 160.21° ± 4.167°, both of which were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (24.11° ± 2.948° and 135.86° ± .345°, respectively;  < 0.001 for both). No complications such as infection, skin necrosis, or bone nonunion occurred.Soft tissue release combined with joint-sparing osteotomy has appreciated efficacy in the treatment of cavovarus foot deformity in older children.©The Author(s) 2019.

To determine SLN protein expression in human skeletal muscle and its relationship with adiposity, resting  expenditure (REE), and performance, SLN was assessed by Western blot in 199 biopsies from two previous studies. In one study, 15 overweight volunteers underwent a pre-test followed by four days of caloric restriction and exercise (45min one-arm cranking + 8h walking), and three days on a control diet. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the trained and non-exercised deltoid, and vastus lateralis (VL). In another study, 16 men performed seven sessions of 4-6x30-sec all-out sprints on the cycle ergometer with both limbs, and their VL and triceps brachii biopsied pre- and post-training. SLN expression was two-fold and 44% higher in the VL than in the deltoids and triceps brachii, respectively. SLN was associated neither with adiposity nor REE, and was not altered by a severe  deficit (,500 kcal/d). SLN and cortisol changes after the  deficit were correlated (r=0.38, P=0.039). SLN was not altered by low-intensity exercise in the overweight subjects, whereas it was reduced after sprint training in the other group. The changes in SLN with sprint training were inversely associated with the changes in gross efficiency (r=-0.59, P=0.016). No association was observed between aerobic or anaerobic performance and SLN expression. In conclusion, sarcolipin appears to play no role in regulating the fat mass of men. Sprint training reduces sarcolipin expression, which may improve muscle efficiency.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Herein, the Lewis acidic yttria hollow spheres (YHS) are rationally designed as both sulfur immobilizer and catalyst of polysulfides conversion for the application of advanced Li-S batteries. It has been found that the Lewis acidic yttria can effectively capture the Lewis basic polysulfides and thus mitigate the shuttle effect of polysulfides; besides, yttria shows the enhanced catalytic activity for the kinetics of inter-conversion reaction from polysulfides to Li2S. As a result, either as a sulfur host or as the separator coating, yttria can play an important role in realizing high initial discharge capacity and good capacity retention for Li-S batteries. Especially, the Li-S battery with YHS@C/S cathode and YHS/CNT-0.6 modified separator (2.1 mg cm-2 sulfur loading) shows a high specific capacity of 912. mAh g-1 at 0.5C. After 200 cycles, the capacity of the Li-S battery can keep as high as 842.3 mAh g-1, and the capacity fading rate is only 0.038% per cycle. When the sulfur areal loading is increased to 4.24 mg cm-2, it can still maintain a considerable areal capacity of 3.79 mAh cm-2. Therefore, the strategy of the synergy effect for polysulfides confinement and catalytic conversion reaction can provide a significant exploration for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666871>Excited state dynamics for visible-light sensitization of a photochromic benzil-subsituted phenoxyl-imidazolyl radical.</a></h2><p>Visible-light sensitized photoswitches have been paid particular attention in the fields of life sciences and materials science because long-wavelength light reduces photodegradation, transmits deep inside of matters, and achieves the selective excitation in condensed systems. Among various photoswitch molecules, the phenoxyl-imidazolyl radical complex (PIC) is a recently developed thermally reversible photochromic molecule whose thermal back reaction can be tuned from tens of nanoseconds to tens of seconds by rational design of the molecular structure. While the wide range of tunability of the switching speed of PIC opened up various potential applications, no photosensitivity to visible light limits its applications. In this study, we synthesized a visible-light sensitized PIC derivative conjugated with a benzil unit. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzil unit acts as a singlet photosensitizer for PIC by the Dexter-type  transfer. Visible-light sensitized photochromic reactions of PIC are important for expanding the versatility of potential applications to life sciences and materials science.Copyright © 2019, Kobayashi et al.; licensee Beilstein-Institut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664928>Changes in serum albumin and other nutritional markers when using sucroferric oxyhydroxide as phosphate binder among hemodialysis patients: a historical cohort study.</a></h2><p>Elevated serum phosphorus concentrations are common among maintenance hemodialysis patients. Protein is a major source of dietary phosphate, but restriction of protein intake can result in hypoalbuminemia and protein- wasting. We hypothesized that sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SO), a potent phosphate binder with a low pill burden, may reduce serum phosphorus levels in hemodialysis patients with hypoalbuminemia without adversely impacting albumin levels or dietary intake of protein.We retrospectively examined de-identified data from 79 adult, in-center hemodialysis patients with baseline hypoalbuminemia (≤ 3. g/dL) switched to SO as part of routine clinical care for at least 1 year. Temporal changes (3-month intervals from baseline through Q4) in phosphate binder pill burden, serum phosphorous levels, nutritional markers, and equilibrated Kt/V were analyzed. Data from a matched reference group of non-hypoalbuminemic patients (N = 79) switched to SO were also examined.SO therapy was associated with a mean reduction of 45.7 and 45.1% in daily phosphate binder pill burden, and a mean reduction of 0.4 mg/dL and 0.51 mg/dL in serum phosphorus levels for the hypoalbuminemic and non-hypoalbuminemic patients, respectively. Hypoalbuminemic patients demonstrated significant increases in mean serum albumin levels from 3.50 mg/dL at baseline to 3.69, 3.74, 3.70, and 3.69 mg/dL during Q1 through Q4, respectively (P < 0.0001), whereas serum albumin levels remained unchanged in the non-hypoalbuminemic group.Both hypoalbuminemic and non-hypoalbuminemic patients switching to SO exhibited significant reductions in serum phosphorus concentrations and daily phosphate binder pill burden. Among hypoalbuminemic patients, the initiation of SO therapy was also associated with increases in serum albumin, suggesting therapy may have allowed patients to increase their dietary intake of protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661677>Functionalized single-walled carbon-nanotube-blended P3HT-based high performance memory behavior thin-film transistors devices.</a></h2><p>We report on the fabrication and transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) blended with P3HT (poly 3-hexyl thiophene-2, -diyl). The composite is used as a hybrid organic active channel transistor. The performances of the fabricated devices were investigated as a function of the SWCNTs loads in the composite, and their response evaluated under white light illumination. Our results show that for SWCNT loads ≤ 1. wt. %, all the devices behave as p-type transistors, exhibiting excellent performance, with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104 and a maximum on-state current (Ion) exceeding 80 μA. Moreover, compared with pristine transistors with a P3HT channel, the Hall mobility of these hybrid TFTs was found to increase by more than one order of magnitude, i.e. increasing from 0.062 to 1.54 cm2/V.s. Finally, under light illumination, the transfer characteristics (i.e. IDS as a function of VGS) were found to systematically undergo a typical shift together with a fully-reversible memory behavior.

The intravitreous injection of VEGF antibodies has been reported to be an effective treatment to relieve symptoms of WAMD. However, the limitations of this treatment are high costs and invasiveness. For this reason, oral delivery route can be considered as a cost-effective way and the safest method to deliver drug molecules to the eyes. Accordingly, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was included in the oral formulation as the potential substance for the cure of WAMD in the animal model. Various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects, have been reported for UDCA and recent reports support the effects of UDCA in ocular treatment. However, due to poor water solubility and low pKa (around .0), it has been challenging to formulate aqueous solution of UDCA in the neutral pH range. In the present study, we confirmed the aqueous solubility of the oral UDCA formulation and performed a preclinical study, including pharmacokinetic profiling and WAMD model efficacy study in mice after oral administration of the drug solution. The results demonstrated that the formulation improved bioavailability of UDCA and efficiently delivered UDCA to the eye tissues after oral absorption. UDCA formulation was found to have inhibitory effects of choroidal neovascularization with a functional recovery in mice retinas. Taken together, our results suggest that the oral UDCA formulation could be used as a potent supplement for the cure of WAMD and related retinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662197>Biomechanical effects of passive hip springs during walking.</a></h2><p>Passive spring-like structures can store and return  during cyclic movements and thereby reduce the energetic cost of locomotion. That makes them important components of the human body and wearable assistive devices alike. This study investigates how springs placed anteriorly across the hip joint affect leg joint angles and powers, and leg muscle activities during level walking at 0. to 2.1 m/s. We hypothesized that the anterior hip springs (I) load hip extension, (II) support hip flexion and (III) affect ankle muscle activity and dynamics during walking. Effects at the ankle were expected because hip and ankle redistribute segmental power in concert to achieve forward progression. We observed that the participants' contribution to hip power did not increase during hip extension as the spring stored . Simultaneously, the activities of plantarflexor muscles that modulate  storage in the Achilles tendon were reduced by 28% (gastrocnemius medialis) and 9% (soleus). As the spring returned  with the onset of hip flexion, the participants' contribution to hip power was reduced by as much as 23%. Soleus activity before push-off increased by up to 9%. Instead of loading hip extension, anterior hip springs seem to store and return parts of the  normally exchanged with the Achilles tendon. Thereby, the springs support hip flexion but may reduce elastic  storage in and hence recoil from the Achilles tendon. This interaction should be considered during the design and simulation of wearable assistive devices as it might - depending on user characteristics - enhance or diminish their overall functionality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, epidemiological studies have found this consumption to be associated with increased hazards, such as binge drinking, increased alcohol-related harm and risk of developing alcohol use disorder. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear, but much attention has been attributed to caffeine. However, taurine, another common ingredient in  drinks, has also been associated with the dopamine elevating properties of ethanol, and may in this respect contribute to the increased liability associated with the mixture of alcohol and  drinks. In the present study we measured locomotor activity, a phenomenon previously linked to the dopamine activating and reinforcing properties of the drug, following acute systemic administration with caffeine (1, , 15, 30 mg/kg), taurine (30, 60, 300, 600 mg/kg) and ethanol (1.75, 2., 3.25 g/kg), alone or in combination. We found that ethanol and caffeine, but not taurine, increased locomotion compared to vehicle. In addition, when combined with ethanol, caffeine, but not taurine, increased the locomotor stimulatory effect of ethanol. Furthermore, the combination of caffeine and taurine were able to further enhance the ethanol-induced locomotor response. Eleven days of intermittent caffeine exposure produced a sensitized response to the caffeine-induced locomotion, but did not alter the additive effect produced by the combination of caffeine and taurine on ethanol-induced locomotion. Based on the present study we suggest that the combination of caffeine and taurine, at a specific dose range, enhances the locomotor stimulatory properties of ethanol, a phenomenon previously linked to the reinforcing properties of the drug.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

All athletes were selected from the French National Institute of Sports and Physical Education . Ultrasound measurements were made with a sonographic US BOX at the mid-thigh level. We developed a multi -linear model of body fat estimation from ultrasound and anthropometric dimensions (height, weight, waist circumference) using the DXA reference method. A cross-validation study was then performed with this linear regression on 62 males athletes proportionally stratified across the sports.The best accuracy of BF was obtained using a multi-linear model from ultrasonic and anthropometric measurements with a concordance correlation pc = 0.941. This model was then used to estimate BF on the 62 males athletes. The concordance correlation pc= 0.931 and SEE =1.60. The 95% limits of agreement for individual BF% were [-4.1;3.6%] with symmetrically distributed deviations.Comparing to DXA, ultrasonic and anthropometric measurements are both accurate techniques to estimates BF%.

Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total  and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth weight compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or 2 years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Thus, toluene removal from air is necessary. To solve the problem of reducing high toluene concentrations with a short gas retention time (GRT), a quorum-sensing molecule [N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone] (OHL) was added to a biotrickling filter (BTF). In this study, a BTF was used to treat synthetic and natural waste gases containing toluene. An extensive analysis was performed to understand the removal efficiency, removal characteristics, and bacterial community of the BTF. The addition of 20 μM OHL to the BTF significantly improved toluene removal, and more than 99.2% toluene removal was achieved at a GRT of 0. min when natural waste gas containing toluene (590-1020 ppm or 2.21-3.83 g m) was introduced. The maximum inlet load for toluene was 337.9 g m h. Moreover, the BTF exhibited satisfactory adaptability to shock loading and shutdown operations. Pseudomonadaceae (33.0%) and Comamonadaceae (26.3%) were predominant bacteria in the system after a 98-day operation. These bacteria were responsible for toluene degradation. The optimal moisture content and low pressure drop for system operations demonstrated that the BTF was  and cost efficient.

Criterion (A) was redefined in DSM-, adding increased  or activity in addition to mood change. We sought to investigate the effect of adding increased  or activity to criterion (A) for the diagnosis of hypomania/mania and, thus, bipolar disorder.This analysis of prospectively collected data from the Bipolar Collaborative Network (1995-2002) includes 907 DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed bipolar outpatients (14,306 visits). The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was administered monthly and used to define DSM-IV and DSM- criterion (A) fulfillment during a hypomanic/manic visit.Patients were adults (median age = 40; IQR, 33-49), and over half (56%) were women. Median number of contributed visits was 10 (IQR, 4-23). Applying DSM- criterion (A) reduced the number of patients experiencing a hypomanic/manic visit by 34%, compared to DSM-IV. Visits fulfilling DSM- criterion (A) had higher odds of experiencing elevated levels of all other mania symptoms, compared to fulfilling DSM-IV criterion (A) only. Association between individual symptoms was strongest with mood elevation and  or activity (OR [95% CL] = 8.65, [7.91, 9.47]).The 34% reduction in the number of patients being diagnosed with a hypomanic/manic visit shows that the impact of applying DSM- criterion (A) is substantial. Fewer hypomanic/manic episodes may be diagnosed by the stricter DSM- criterion (A), but the episodes diagnosed are likely to be more severe. The DSM- criteria may in general prevent overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder but possibly at the cost of underdiagnosing hypomanic/manic episodes.© Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668069>Rational Design of Rhodium-Iridium Alloy Nanoparticles as Highly Active Catalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution.</a></h2><p>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal for renewable  conversion and storage devices, such as water electrolyzers and rechargeable metal-air batteries. However, rational design of electrocatalysts with suitably high efficiencies and stabilities in strongly acidic electrolytes remains a significant challenge. Here, we show the first demonstration of sub-10 nm, composition-tunable Rh-Ir alloy nanoparticles (NPs) prepared using a scalable microwave-assisted method as superior acidic OER catalysts. The OER activities showed a volcano-shaped dependence on Ir composition, with Ir-rich NPs (Ir ≥51%) achieving better OER performance than pure Ir NPs, as reflected by lower overpotentials and higher mass activities. Most significantly, Rh22Ir78 NPs achieved a maximum mass activity of 1.17 A·mg-1Ir at a 300 mV overpotential in 0. M H2SO4, which corresponds to a 3-fold enhancement relative to pure Ir NPs, making it one of the most active reported OER catalysts under acidic conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that owing to the synergy of ensemble and electronic effects by alloying a small amount of Rh with Ir, the binding  difference of the O and OOH intermediates is reduced, leading to faster kinetics and enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, Rh-Ir alloy NPs demonstrated excellent durability in strongly acidic electrolyte. This work not only provides fundamental understandings relating to composition-electrochemical performance relationships but also opens new avenues for the rational design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts for applications in acidic media.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666324>Structure of a Tc holotoxin pore provides insights into the translocation mechanism.</a></h2><p>Tc toxins are modular toxin systems of insect and human pathogenic bacteria. They are composed of a 1.4-MDa pentameric membrane translocator (TcA) and a 250-kDa cocoon (TcB and TcC) encapsulating the 30-kDa toxic enzyme (C terminus of TcC). Binding of Tc toxins to target cells and a pH shift trigger the conformational transition from the soluble prepore state to the membrane-embedded pore. Subsequently, the toxic enzyme is translocated and released into the cytoplasm. A high-resolution structure of a holotoxin embedded in membranes is missing, leaving open the question of whether TcB-TcC has an influence on the conformational transition of TcA. Here we show in atomic detail a fully assembled 1.7-MDa Tc holotoxin complex from  in the membrane. We find that the  TcA protomers conformationally adapt to fit around the cocoon during the prepore-to-pore transition. The architecture of the Tc toxin complex allows TcB-TcC to bind to an already membrane-embedded TcA pore to form a holotoxin. Importantly, assembly of the holotoxin at the membrane results in spontaneous translocation of the toxic enzyme, indicating that this process is not driven by a proton gradient or other  source. Mammalian lipids with zwitterionic head groups are preferred over other lipids for the integration of Tc toxins. In a nontoxic Tc toxin variant, we can visualize part of the translocating toxic enzyme, which transiently interacts with alternating negative charges and hydrophobic stretches of the translocation channel, providing insights into the mechanism of action of Tc toxins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling,  metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers.

Herein, we propose a strategy to suppress the sponge-like Li deposition by plating Li metal on aluminum nitride (AlN)-modified substrates. For a practical Li deposition of 4 mAh cm on a AlN-modified copper (Cu) electrode, the roughness and thickness of the as-deposited Li layer are only ∼10% and ∼50% of those for the Li layer deposited on bare Cu. Only based on the compacted Li deposition layer without any other protective remedies, the AlN-modified Cu electrode could provide a Li cycling life of  times longer than that on bare Cu, and an AlN-modified carbon felt was proved as an efficient interlayer to boost the cycling stability of Li||LiFePO batteries. These results demonstrate the high importance of suppressing the sponge-like Li deposition for high  density LMBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665374>Japanese Structure Survey of Radiation Oncology in 2011.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the evolving structure of radiation oncology in Japan in terms of equipment, personnel, patient load and geographic distribution to identify and overcome any existing limitations. From March 2012 to August 2015, the Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology conducted a questionnaire based on the Japanese national structure survey of radiation oncology in 2011. Data were analyzed based on the institutional stratification by the annual number of new patients treated with radiotherapy per institution. The estimated annual numbers of new and total (new plus repeat) patients treated with radiation were 211 000 and 250 000, respectively. Additionally, the estimated cancer incidence was 851 537 cases with approximately 24.8% of all newly diagnosed patients being treated with radiation. The types and numbers of treatment devices actually used included linear accelerator (LINAC; n = 836), telecobalt (n = 3), Gamma Knife (n = 46), 60Co remote afterloading system (RALS; n = 24), and 192Ir RALS (n = 125). The LINAC system used dual- functions in 619 units, 3D conformal radiotherapy functions in 719 and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) functions in 412. There were 756 JRS or JASTRO-certified radiation oncologists, 1018. full-time equivalent (FTE) radiation oncologists, 2026.7 FTE radiotherapy technologists, 149.1 FTE medical physicists, 141. FTE radiotherapy quality managers and 716.3 FTE nurses. The frequency of IMRT use significantly increased during this time. To conclude, although there was a shortage of personnel in 2011, the Japanese structure of radiation oncology has clearly improved in terms of equipment and utility.© The Author(s) 2019.

Cells of strain M8-2 were aerobic, Gram-stain-negative and curved-rod-shaped (0.2-0. µm wide and 0.7-1.9 µm long). Strain M8-2 grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 6.-7. and in the presence of 0.-1.0 % (w/v) NaCl. MK-7 was the sole isoprenoid quinone. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified polar lipid. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0. Phylogenetic analysis based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain M8-2 belonged to the genus Algoriphagus and was closely related to Algoriphagus aquatilis A8-7, Algoriphagus boseongensis BS-R1, Algoriphagus aquaeductus T4, Algoriphagus olei CC-Hsuan-617, Algoriphagusshivajiensis NIO-S3 and Algoriphagus mannitolivorans DSM 15301 with sequence similarities of 96.6-97.4 %. Results of average nucleotide identity (<75 %) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (<19 %) studies showed that M8-2 was distinct from its phylogenetic relatives. Based on the results of tests for acid production, the predominant cellular fatty acid composition, the DNA G+C content and phylogenetic position, a novel species in the genus Algoriphagus, with the name Algoriphagussanaruensis sp. nov., is proposed for strain M8-2 (=JCM 31446=LMG 29969).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667403>Valorization of coal fired-fly ash for potential heavy metal removal from the single and multi-contaminated system.</a></h2><p>In this study, adsorption of three different heavy metals i.e. cadmium (Cd (II)), copper (Cu (II)) and nickel (Ni (II)) was carried out in single and multi-contaminated system using coal-fired fly ash (CFFA). Initially, for the single contaminated system, various physical process parameters were selected for optimization by deploying Box-Behnken design of experiments. Further, the evaluation of CFFA for removal of heavy metals in a multi-component system from aqueous solution was performed by employing Plackett-Burman design of experiments with all the three heavy metals at two different levels by varying their initial concentration (10-50 mg L). In both the aforementioned cases, CFFA showed its great potential for heavy metal removal, i.e. single and multi-component system and followed the order: Cu (II) > Ni (II) > Cd (II). Further, FTIR study confirmed the involvement of amide, aldehyde, alkoxy, alkanes, and alkene groups for heavy metal adsorption by CFFA.© 2019 The Authors.</p></html>
