In China, quite a few of Citrus are cultivated in acidic soils (pH < 5.0). 'Xuegan' (Citrus sinensis) and 'Sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) (C. sinensis were more tolerant to low pH than C. grandis) seedlings were irrigated daily with nutrient solution at a pH of 2.5, 3 or 5 for nine months. Thereafter, we examined low pH effects on growth, and superoxide anion production rate (SAP), malondialdehyde (MDA), MG, antioxidants, and enzymes related to ROS and MG detoxification in roots and leaves in order to (a) test the hypothesis that low pH affected ROS and MG metabolisms more in roots than those of leaves, and (b) understand the roles of ROS and MG metabolisms in Citrus low pH-tolerance and -toxicity.Compared with control, most of the physiological parameters related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greatly altered at pH 2.5, but almost unaffected at pH 3. In addition to decreased root growth, many fibrous roots became rotten and died at pH 2.5. pH 2.5-induced changes in SAP, the levels of MDA, MG and antioxidants, and the activities of most enzymes related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greater in roots than those of leaves. Impairment of root ascorbate metabolism was the most serious, especially in C. grandis roots. pH 2.5-induced increases in MDA and MG levels in roots and leaves, decreases in the ratios of ascorbate/(ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) in roots and leaves and of reduced glutathione/(reduced+oxidized glutathione) in roots were greater in C. grandis than those in C. sinensis.Low pH affected MG and ROS metabolisms more in roots than those in leaves. The most seriously impaired ascorbate metabolism in roots was suggested to play a role in low pH-induced root death and growth inhibition. Low pH-treated C. sinensis roots and leaves had higher capacity to maintain a balance between ROS and MG production and their removal via detoxification systems than low pH-treated C. grandis ones, thus contribute to the higher acid-tolerance of C. sinensis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690051>Oxidative Stress Markers to Investigate the Effects of Hyperoxia in Anesthesia.</a></h2><p> (O) is commonly used in clinical practice to prevent or treat hypoxia, but if used in excess (hyperoxia), it may act as toxic. O toxicity arises from the enhanced formation of Reactive  Species (ROS) that exceed the antioxidant defenses and generate oxidative stress. In this study, we aimed at assessing whether an elevated fraction of inspired  (FiO) during and after general anesthesia may contribute to the unbalancing of the pro-oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium. We measured five oxidative stress biomarkers in blood samples from patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, randomly assigned to FiO = 0.40 vs. 0.80: hydroperoxides, antioxidants, nitrates and nitrites (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathionyl hemoglobin (HbSSG). The MDA concentration was significantly higher 24 h after surgery, and the body antioxidant defense lower, in the FiO = 0.80 group with respect to both the FiO = 0.40 group and the baseline values ( ≤ 0.05, Student's -test). HbSSG in red blood cells was also higher in the FiO = 0.80 group at the end of the surgery. NO was higher in the FiO = 0.80 group than the FiO = 0.40 group at t = 2 h after surgery. MDA, the main end product of the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids directly influenced by FiO, may represent the best marker to assess the pro-oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium after surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687920>Hemodynamic Responses of the Placenta and Brain to Maternal Hyperoxia in Fetuses with Congenital Heart Disease by Using Blood -Level Dependent MRI.</a></h2><p>Background Impaired brain development in fetuses with congenital heart disease (CHD) may result from inadequate cerebral  supply in utero. Purpose To test whether fetal cerebral oxygenation can be increased by maternal  administration, effects of maternal hyperoxia on blood oxygenation of the placenta and fetal brain were examined by using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, BOLD MRI was performed in 86 fetuses (56 healthy fetuses and 30 fetuses diagnosed with CHD) between 22 and 39 weeks gestational age (GA) from May 2015 to December 2017, with the following study design: phase I, 2-minute resting state at baseline (room air); phase II, 6-minute maternal hyperoxia with 100% ; and phase III, 5.6-minute return to resting state. After motion correction, the signals were averaged over the placenta and fetal brain and converted to the change in R2* (ΔR2*). Fetuses with CHD were categorized into those with a single ventricle (SV) or two ventricles (TVs) and those with aortic obstruction (AO) or non-AO. Data were analyzed by using generalized linear mixed models controlling for GA and sex. Results Placental ΔR2* increased during maternal hyperoxia in healthy fetuses and fetuses with CHD, but it was higher in SV CHD (mean ΔR2*, 1.3 sec ± 0.1 [standard error;  < .01], 1.9 sec ± 0.2 [ < .01], and 1.0 sec ± 0.3 [ < .01], respectively, for control fetuses, fetuses with SV CHD, and fetuses with TV CHD). Placental ΔR2* during maternal hyperoxia changed with GA in healthy control fetuses and fetuses with SV or AO CHD (ΔR2* per week, 0.1 sec ± 0 [ < .01], 0.2 sec ± 0 [ = .01], and 0.2 sec ± 0 [ = .01], respectively), but not in fetuses with CHD and TV or non-AO. Fetal brain ΔR2* was constant across all phases in healthy control fetuses and fetuses with TV CHD but increased during maternal hyperoxia in fetuses with SV or AO CHD (mean ΔR2*, 0.7 sec ± 0.2 [ = .01] and 0.5 sec ± 0.2 [ = .02], respectively). Conclusion Six minutes of maternal hyperoxia increased placental oxygenation in healthy fetuses and fetuses with congenital heart disease, and it selectively increased cerebral blood oxygenation in fetuses with single ventricle or aortic obstruction.© RSNA, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690284>Efficiency and safety of phenylephrine and tropicamide used in premature retinopathy: a prospective observational study.</a></h2><p>To determine effects and side effects of topical application of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 0.5% combination in preterm infants.In this prospective observational study, 60 infants undergoing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening were prospectively observed. Pupillary diameter, blood pressure, heart rate, and  saturation were monitored before and after up to 24 h during ROP screening examinations.The mean pupillary diameter 1 h after the instillation of drops was 5.58 ± 0.75 mm for both eyes.

This was a secondary analysis of physical activity data for patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards. Physical activity data, collected with a wireless patch sensor, was operationalized as time spent lying, sitting/standing, and walking. Barriers to physical activity included patients' pain levels, the use of urinary catheters, intravenous tubing,  lines, drains, and level of dependence. Regression analysis explored the relationship between physical activity and barriers to physical activity. Physical activity data were collected in 39 patients (aged 27-88, mean 54 years) during hospital stay. Patients were admitted for a median of 10 d (interquartile range [IQR]: 7-15 d). These patients were lying for a median of 12.1 h (7.6-17.7), sitting/standing 11.8 h (6.3-15.7), and walking 0.1 h (0-0.3) per day. Time lying during the day related to pain levels (β = 0.4 h per unit increase in pain,  < 0.01) and drain use (β = 3.1 h,  < 0.01). Patients spent the most time during the hospital stay lying in bed. Improved pain management and decreased drain use may be worth exploring to increase inpatient physical activity.Implications for rehabilitationContinuous monitoring of physical activity in patients during hospital stay is an important tool for health care professionals to improve multidisciplinary care and rehabilitation.Health care professionals should be aware of the necessity of adequate pain management and critically review the use of drains in order to improve physical activity of patients during hospital stay.Patients need extra support of health care professionals to increase physical activity during consecutive days of their hospital stay.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of Obesity And Civilization Diseases.</a></h2><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive  species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695471>Linagliptin Inhibits Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation Concentration-Dependently And -Independently.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, prevent inflammation. However, the in vitro effects of linagliptin are unclear. Moreover, although linagliptin inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, the anti-inflammatory effects of linagliptin in this context are not concentration-dependent. In the absence of LPS-binding protein (LBP), the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS involve pathways other than the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 pathway. Here, we aimed to determine the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of linagliptin in an experimental model in which LBP was added to the medium.Human U937 monocytes were cultured at 1 × 10 cells/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium and differentiated into macrophages using phorbol myristate acetate. All processes were carried out in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 48 hrs of culture, we replaced the medium and pretreated the cells with 100, 250, 500, or 2500 nM linagliptin for 1 hr. We exchanged the medium again, and the cells were treated with 1 ng/mL LPS with or without 100, 250, 500, or 2500 nM linagliptin. Interleukin (IL)-6 and LBP in the supernatant, nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65 in the nucleus, and reactive  species (ROS) in the cells, as important markers of the mechanism of inflammation induction by LPS, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.Linagliptin significantly prevented LPS-stimulated IL-6 production and intranuclear NF-κB/p65 levels in a concentration-dependent manner. LPS-induced intracellular ROS levels were significantly decreased by linagliptin at all concentrations. LBP levels were markedly higher in FBS-containing medium than in medium without FBS. However, LBP levels did not change following administration of linagliptin and/or LPS.Concentration-dependent and -independent inflammatory suppression was observed following linagliptin treatment in the context of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Thus, our findings suggested that linagliptin induced two different mechanisms to repress inflammation, i.e., TLR4-dependent and -independent mechanisms.© 2019 Sato et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696622>Tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) exhibits immunotoxicity in murine macrophages.</a></h2><p>Tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) has been linked to endocrine disruption, hepatotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. However, its immunotoxicity remains largely unknown. In the present study, RAW 264.7 cells, mouse macrophage cell line, were exposed to TBECH. MTT assays showed that TBECH significantly enhanced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in RAW 264.7 cells. The mRNA expression of some proapoptotic genes was upregulated by TBECH. Accordingly, TBECH elevated caspase-3 activity. In addition, TBECH upregualted the mRNA levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas it downregulated LPS-stimulated mRNA expression of these cytokines. Moreover, TBECH downregulated the mRNA expression of selected antigen presenting-related genes. Furthermore, TBECH increased reactive  species level, reduced glutathione content and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and upregulated the mRNA expression of selected oxidative stress-related genes. The obtained data demonstrated that TBECH exhibits immunotoxicity in macrophages, and will help to evaluate its health risks.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689461>Inflammation-triggered local drug release ameliorates colitis by inhibiting dendritic cell migration and Th1/Th17 differentiation.</a></h2><p>Enteric-coated formulations using Eudragit® polymers have been extensively used for delivering drugs to the lower gastrointestinal tract. However, these drug-delivery systems cannot accurately deliver the therapeutic cargoes to colon because of early degradation of the polymers at alkaline pH of the small intestine. Here, we describe a precise method of delivering drugs to inflammation sites in colon using an oral drug delivery system. Tacrolimus (FK506)-loaded microspheres were prepared using a thioketal-based polymer that releases drug in response to reactive  species (ROS), which are abundantly produced at the sites of inflammation in acute colitis. Orally-administered FK506-loaded thioketal microspheres (FK506-TKM) led to substantial accumulation of FK506 in inflamed colon and effectively alleviated dextran-sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. At the molecular level, FK506-TKM significantly inhibited infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes in colon and differentiation of CD4 T cells to Th1 and Th17 cells in colon-draining mesenteric lymph nodes via restricting dendritic cell migration from colon. Our findings indicate orally-administered thioketal-based drug delivery system as a promising means of treating acute inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019.

While avoiding hypoxaemia has long been a goal of critical care practitioners, less attention has been paid to the potential hazard related to excessive hyperoxia.To evaluate the impact of early hyperoxia exposure among critically ill patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit for acute heart failure.In this preliminary study conducted in a Parisian intensive care unit, we assessed patients with acute heart failure admitted with pulmonary congestion and treated with  therapy from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. The hyperoxia group was defined by having at least one partial pressure of  measurement>100mmHg on the first day following admission to the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were 30-day unplanned hospital admissions, occurrence of infections and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay.Seventy-five patients were included. Forty-three patients (57.3%) presented hyperoxia, whereas 32 patients (42.7%) did not (control group). The baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The primary endpoint was not statistically different between the two groups (14.0% in the hyperoxia group vs 18.8% in the control group; P=0.85). The secondary endpoints were also not significantly different between the two groups. In the multivariable analysis, hyperoxia was not associated with increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.24-2.41).In patients referred to an intensive care unit for acute heart failure, we did not find any difference in outcomes according to the presence of hyperoxia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Previously, we reported that astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has protective effects against the oxidative stress of DCM. This study aimed to determine the effect of APS on the oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in H9C2 cells.Rat H9C2 cells were cultured in vitro and randomly divided into the control group, HG group, APS-HG group, siRNASOD2 group, and APS-siRNASOD2 group. The cellular ultrastructure was measured by transmission electron microscopy. Cell apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining. Levels of reactive  species (ROS) were detected by a quantitative fluorescence assay (DHE). 8-OH-dG and nitrotyrosine, the indicators of oxidative stress injury, were detected by immunohistochemistry. A PCR array was used to evaluate the expression levels of 84 oxidative stress genes in cultured cells, and the PCR array results were partially verified by Western blot.APS treatment protected the H9C2 cell ultrastructure, reduced the level of cell apoptosis, inhibited cellular ROS production, and reduced the levels of oxidative stress injury indicators 8-OH-dG and nitrotyrosine in high glucose-induced or SOD2-silenced H9C2 cells. It also altered oxidative stress-related genes at the mRNA and protein levels.APS may improve antioxidant capacity and inhibit oxidative stress injury in high glucose induced H9C2 cells.© 2019 Sun et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692484>Thymosin β4 prevents -glucose deprivation/reperfusion-induced injury in rat cortical neurons.</a></h2><p>This study investigated whether thymosin (T) β4 protects against -glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in rat cortical neurons, as well as the underlying mechanisms.Primary rat cortical neurons were transfected with Tβ4 overexpression plasmid; the transfection efficiency was confirmed by detecting Tβ4 expression by fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The OGD/R model was established and apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. Structural changes in the endoplasmic reticulum were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78, C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were determined by Western blotting. The effect of Tβ4 on OGD/R injury was evaluated by adding exogenous Tβ4 to neuronal cultures.Cortical neurons were identified by the expression of neuron-specific enolase. In OGD/R cells, the rate of apoptosis was increased and GRP78, CHOP, and Bax were upregulated whereas Bcl-2 was downregulated relative to the control group. These effects were reversed by Tβ4 overexpression. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was observed in the OGD/R group, but this was abolished in neurons overexpressing Tβ4. The protective effect of Tβ4 against OGD/R injury was also demonstrated in cells treated with exogenous Tβ4 (10 ng/mL), which blocked OGD/R-induced apoptosis by inhibiting ER stress-related and pro-apoptotic protein expression.Tβ4 prevents OGD/R-induced ER stress-dependent apoptosis in cortical neurons, and is a potential treatment for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692282>Excess postexercise  consumption decreases with swimming duration in a labriform fish: Integrating aerobic and anaerobic metabolism across time.</a></h2><p>Many vertebrate animals employ anaerobic pathways during high-speed exercise, even if it imposes an energetic cost during postexercise recovery, expressed as excess postexercise  consumption (EPOC). In ectotherms such a fish, the initial anaerobic contribution to exercise is often substantial. Even so, fish may recover from anaerobic pathways as swimming exercise ensues and aerobic metabolism stabilizes, thus total energetic costs of exercise could depend on swimming duration and subsequent physiological recovery. To test this hypothesis, we examined EPOC in striped surfperch (Embiotoca lateralis) that swam at high speeds (3.25 L s ) during randomly ordered 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min exercise periods. We found that EPOC was highest after the 2-min period (20.9 mg O  kg ) and lowest after the 20-min period (13.6 mg O  kg ), indicating that recovery from anaerobic pathways improved with exercise duration. Remarkably, EPOC for the 2-min period accounted for 72% of the total O consumption, whereas EPOC for the 20-min period only accounted for 14%. Thus, the data revealed a striking decline in the total cost of transport from 0.772 to 0.226 mg O ·kg ·m during 2- and 20-min periods, respectively. Our study is the first to combine anaerobic and aerobic swimming costs to demonstrate an effect of swimming duration on EPOC in fish.

These networks contribute to the promotion of age-associated cardiovascular diseases of oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, their inhibition delays the onset of these cardiovascular diseases as well as senescence and aging. In this review we focus on whether the (a) ASK1-signalosome, a major center of distribution of reactive  species (ROS)-mediated stress signals, plays a role in the promotion of cardiovascular diseases of oxidative stress and inflammation; (b) The ASK1-signalosome links ROS signals generated by dysfunctional mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes to the p38 MAPK stress response pathway; (c) the pathway contributes to the sensitivity and vulnerability of aged tissues to diseases of oxidative stress; and (d) the importance of inhibitors of these pathways to the development of cardioprotection and pharmaceutical interventions. We propose that the ASK1-signalosome regulates the progression of cardiovascular diseases. The resultant attenuation of the physiological characteristics of cardiomyopathies and aging by inhibition of the ASK1-signalosome network lends support to this conclusion. Importantly the ROS-mediated activation of the ASK1-signalosome p38 MAPK pathway suggests it is a major center of dissemination of the ROS signals that promote senescence, aging and cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacological intervention is, therefore, feasible through the continued identification of potent, non-toxic small molecule inhibitors of either ASK1 or p38 MAPK activity.

Mesoporous anatase TiO (MT) films were first synthesized on bamboo via a hydrothermal method. Then, Ag NPs with a 5.3 nm mean diameter were incorporated into the pore channels of optimal MT/bamboo (MTB) samples at room temperature without the addition of reducing agents, such that the Ag NPs were almost entirely embedded into the MT films. Our analysis indicated that the solubilized lignin from bamboo, which is rich in -containing functional groups, serves as a green reductant for reducing the Ag(NH) ions to Ag NPs. Antifungal experiments with  under dark conditions highlighted that the antifungal activity of the Ag/MT/bamboo samples were greater than those of naked bamboo, MTB, and Ag/bamboo, suggesting that these hybrid nanomaterials produce a synergistic antifungal effect that is unrelated to photoactivity. The inhibition of  effectively followed a similar trend. This newly developed bamboo protection method may provide a sustainable, eco-friendly, and efficient method for enhancing the antifungal characteristics of traditional bamboo, having the potential to prolong the service life of bamboo materials, particularly under dark conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689675>Biocompatibility and hemocompatibility of hydrothermally derived reduced graphene oxide using soluble starch as a reducing agent.</a></h2><p>Graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) have many applications as biomedical materials in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. We report on the preparation of starch-(functionalized) reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (SRGO) using soluble starch as a reducing agent in a hydrothermal method, and their in vitro interactions with human skin fibroblasts and red blood cells (RBCs). Our results indicate that soluble SRGO nanosheets were prepared using graphene oxide (GO) as a raw material. SRGO-1 and -10, which were prepared using different concentrations of soluble starch after hydrothermal treatment, were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and showed a peak shift at 260 nm corresponding to the deoxygenation of GO and restoration of the conjugated aromatic structure. Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements were used to determine Z-average sizes and surface charges of GO and SRGOs. X-ray diffractometry, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy revealed the progressive elimination of labile  functional groups during hydrothermal treatment and restoration of the π-conjugated network. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed de-oxidation of SRGOs, which had high carbon to  ratios (C/O) as compared with GO. Interactions of SRGO-1 and -10 with skin fibroblasts showed excellent biocompatibility even at a concentration of 200 μg/ml with cell viabilities up to 88% and 90%, respectively, whereas notable cytotoxicity was observed for GO at 20 μg/ml. Similarly, SRGO-1 and -10 did not exhibit toxicity to RBCs compared to GO. Biofilm formation and metabolic activities of biofilm by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus were also evaluated using a crystal violet and a tetrazolium reduction assay, respectively. The described hydrothermal method used to synthesize SRGO provides a cheap, facile, and environmentally friendly means of producing water-dispersible, biocompatible and hemocompatible reduced GOs for the fabrication of novel GBNs for various biomedical applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Active DNA demethylation involves TET-mediated stepwise oxidation of mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine (fC), or 5-carboxylcytosine (caC), excision of fC or caC by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), and subsequent base excision repair. Many elements of this essential process are poorly defined, including TDG excision of caC. To address this problem, we solved high-resolution struc-tures of human TDG bound to DNA with cadC (5-carboxyl-2΄-deoxycytidine) flipped into its active site. The structures unveil detailed enzyme-substrate interactions that mediate recognition and removal of caC, many involving water molecules. Importantly, two water molecules contact a carboxylate  of caC and are poised to facilitate acid-catalyzed caC excision. Moreover, a substrate-dependent conformational change in TDG modulates the hydrogen bond interactions for one of these waters, enabling productive interaction with caC. An Asn residue (N191) that is critical for caC excision is found to contact N3 and N4 of caC, suggesting a mechanism for acid-catalyzed base excision that features an N3-protonated form of caC but would be ineffective for C, mC, or hmC. We also investigated another Asn residue (N140) that is catalytically essential and strictly conserved in the TDG-MUG enzyme family. A structure of N140A-TDG bound to cadC DNA provides the first high-resolution insight into how enzyme-substrate interactions, including water molecules, are impacted by depleting the conserved Asn, informing its role in binding and addition of the nucleophilic water molecule.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694368>Flow-encoded  control to track the time-dependence of molecular changes induced by static or cycling hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Detecting the effects of low  on cell function is often dependent on monitoring the expression of a number of hypoxia markers. The time dependence of the appearance and stability of these markers varies between cell lines. Assessing cellular marker dynamics is also critical to determining how quickly cells respond to transient changes in  levels that occurs with cycling hypoxia. We fabricated a manifold designed to use flow-encoding to produce sequential changes in gas mixtures delivered to a permeable-bottom 96-well plate. We show how this manifold and plate design can be used to expose cells to either static or cycling hypoxic conditions for eight different time periods thereby facilitating the study of the time-response of cells to altered  environments. Using this device, we monitored the time-dependence of molecular changes in human PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma and Caco-2 colon adenocarcinoma cells exposed to increasing periods of static or cycling hypoxia. Using immunohistochemistry, both cell lines show detectable levels of the marker protein hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) after 3 h of exposure to static hypoxia. Cycling hypoxia increased the expression level of HIF-1α compared to static hypoxia. Both static and cycling hypoxia also increased glucose uptake and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. This new device offers a facile screening approach to determine the kinetics of cellular alterations under varying  conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694396>HBO Promotes the Differentiation of Neural Stem Cells via Interactions Between the Wnt3/β-Catenin and BMP2 Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Hyperbaric  (HBO) therapy may promote neurological recovery from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, the therapeutic effects of HBO and its associated mechanisms remain unknown. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) play important roles in mammalian nervous system development. The present study examined whether HBO stimulates the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and its effect on Wnt3/β-catenin and BMP2 signaling pathways. We showed HBO treatment (2 ATA, 60 min) promoted differentiation of NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes . In addition, rat hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) tissue extracts also promoted the differentiation of NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes, with the advantage of reducing the number of astrocytes. These effects were most pronounced when these two were combined together. In addition, the expression of Wnt3a, BMP2, and β-catenin nuclear proteins were increased after HBO treatment. However, blockade of Wnt/β-catenin or BMP signaling inhibited NSC differentiation and reduced the expression of Wnt3a, BMP2, and β-catenin nuclear proteins. In conclusion, HBO promotes differentiation of NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes and reduced the number of astrocytes  possibly through regulation of Wnt3/β-catenin and BMP2 signaling pathways. HBO may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HIE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692917>Identifying circRNA-associated-ceRNA networks in retinal neovascularization in mice.</a></h2><p>Retinal neovascularization is a complication which caused human vision loss severely. It has been shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential roles in gene regulation. However, circRNA expression profile and the underlying mechanisms in retinal neovascular diseases remain unclear. In the present study, we identified altered circRNAs in the retinas of -induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model by microarray profiling. Microarray analysis revealed that 539 circRNAs were significantly altered in OIR retinas compared with controls. Among them, 185 up-regulated and 354 down-regulated circRNAs were identified. The expression levels of 4 altered circRNAs including mmu_circRNA_002573, mmu_circRNA_011180, mmu_circRNA_016108 and mmu_circRNA_22546 were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analysis with validated circRNAs such as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks with Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis demonstrated that qRT-PCR validated circRNAs were associated with cellular process, cell part and phosphoric ester hydrolase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that MAPK signaling pathway and renin-angiotensin system were related to validated circRNAs, suggesting these pathways may participate in pathological angiogenesis. The results together suggested that circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in OIR retinas and may play potential roles in retinal neovascular diseases.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690331>High-flow nasal cannula  therapy versus conventional  therapy in patients after planned extubation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690286>Clinical and morphological effects of hyperbaric  therapy in patients with interstitial cystitis associated with fibromyalgia.</a></h2><p>Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a debilitating disorder of the bladder, with a multifactorial and poorly understood origin dealing with microcirculation repeated damages.

Both these conditions have a high incidence of conventional therapeutic failure, but recent literature suggests a significant beneficial response to Hyperbaric  Therapy (HBOT). With this study, this study we evaluated the effects of HBOT on quality of life, symptoms, urodynamic parameters, and cystoscopic examination of patients suffering from both IC and FM.We structured an observational clinical trial design with repeated measures (questionnaires, urodynamic test, and cystoscopy) conducted before and 6 months after a therapeutic protocol with hyperbaric  for the treatment of patients suffering from both IC and FM. Patients were exposed to breathing 100%  at 2 atm absolute (ATA) in a multiplace pressure chamber for 90 min using an oro-nasal mask. Patients undertook a cycle of 20 sessions for 5 days per week, and a second cycle of 20 sessions after 1 week of suspension.Twelve patients completed the protocol. Changes after HBOT were not significant, except for hydrodistension tolerance (mean pre-treatment: 409.2 ml; mean post-treatment: 489.2 ml; p < 0.05). A regression of petechiae and Hunner's ulcers was also noted 6 months after the completion of HBOT.Our study showed no improvement of symptoms, quality of life, and urodynamic parameters, except for hydrodistension, and a slight improvement in cystoscopic pattern. However, to date, we could not demonstrate the significance of overall results to justify the use of HBOT alone in patients with IC and FM.

The aim of this prospective observational study was to find the incidence rate as well as possible risk factors of POCD in RARC with cerebral  monitoring.Patients who underwent RARC and open abdominal surgery in horizontal positioning were included. Preoperative and postoperative arterial blood gas (ABG), S-100β, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cognitive dysfunction scales were tested. Also, we used Z score to analyze and comprehensively evaluate POCD. Measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), end-tidal CO (etCO), and cerebral  were immediately obtained after different time points during the surgery.Here, 24 and 23 patients were included in the RARC group and in the control group, respectively. The incidence of POCD didn't have significant difference in RARC group (45.8%), in contrast to the control group (26.1%). The laboratory tests of s100β and CRP between two groups didn't contain significant difference as well. As duration of Trendelenburg and pneumoperitoneum prolonged, the cerebral  saturation in the RARC group increased, which didn't cause excessive perfusion nevertheless (rSO<75%). We compared laboratory tests, age, education status, blood loss, and fluid input between POCD and non-POCD patients.

The present study sought to investigate the effect of quercetin in rats with complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis. Animals were divided into control/saline, control/quercetin (5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg) arthritis/saline, and arthritis/quercetin (5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg); the treatments were administered for 45 days. Biochemical, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity parameters were evaluated. All doses of quercetin reduced the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and reactive  species; however, only treatment with 25 or 50 mg/kg increased catalase activity. Total thiol and reduced glutathione levels were not significantly affected by the induction nor by the treatments.

The optimized strategy presented extracts with the extraction yield up to 21.19% with a significantly higher antioxidant ability, compared with the one without SS pretreatment. Further investigation proved that the SS suppressed the polyphenol oxidase activity of the TPs extract. The ability to scavenge the free radicals were compared in mouse liver mitochondria. Mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cardiolipin peroxidation, and respiratory chain complex (RCC) I-V activities were also evaluated as the index of the mitochondrial oxidative damage. The study supports evidence that the TPs extract exhibited significant protection against oxidative damage on mitochondrial. Furthermore, the effect of TPs on antioxidant ability in zebrafish embryo was evaluated. After TPs pretreatment for 1 day, zebrafish embryos showed a significantly higher survival rate as well as heart rate when facing the oxidative stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Polyphenols from tea leaves have been viewed as an antioxidant additive in food, mainly due to the ability of scavenging free radicals and reactive  species. The results of this study suggest that the SS pretreatment could be used as an efficient method to extract TPs from the tea waste for the prevention of oxidative damage in the mouse liver mitochondria and zebrafish embryos.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687715>A smart nanoprobe based on a gadolinium complex encapsulated by ZIF-8 with enhanced room temperature phosphorescence for synchronous  sensing and photodynamic therapy.</a></h2><p>The phosphorescence lifetime approach based on the room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) property has received considerable attention in recent years due to its excellent performance in the precise measurement of .

Some of the lipid oxidation products only influence the quality of meat but others are implicated to various diseases and human health. Therefore, prevention of lipid oxidation in meat is important for meat quality and for human health as well. The imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants that favors oxidants in the biological system is called oxidative stress in the body. Although the body is equipped with defense enzymes and antioxidant compounds, there are many sources of oxidants or free radicals that can destroy the oxidants/antioxidants balance.

The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a metabolic chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for metabolic data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h  consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass ( = -0.249,  = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele 1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C ( = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion, EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689671>Response of phosphorus fractionation in lake sediments to anthropogenic activities in China.</a></h2><p>In this study, geochemical fractionation is used to establish the relationship between sediment phosphorus (P) pools and anthropogenic activities based on the dated sediment from a suite of lakes in China. Our extraction results showed that the inorganic P fractions, including Ca-P (46% of TP) and Fe/Al-P (24%), constitute most of the P in sediments. Soil erosion dynamics and geographic location are the dominant factors controlling the historical distribution and partitioning of Ca-P in sediments, while over the last few decades, industrial and domestic effluents were the leading factor controlling Fe/Al-P. The organic P (P) fractions, NaHCO-P, HCl-P, and Ful-P accounted for only 11%, 16% and 12% of P on average, respectively, whereas Hum-P and Res-P made up the dominant P fraction (59%) and were the main factors controlling P dynamics due to fertilizer and livestock breeding. Thus, the historical fraction of P in the sediment core can be used as an indicator of anthropogenic activities. Ca-P decreased in the top layers of the cores because of the implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation Law in China since 1991. However, Fe/Al-P and P continuously increased in the lakes from the economic backward area over the last few decades, which is largely due to enhanced point sources of pollution and an increase in the intensity of agricultural practices. As a potential P source, the massive accumulation of Fe/Al-P and P would be released into the overlying water to further facilitate eutrophication via increasing pH and alkaline phosphatase and decreasing in the dissolved  concentration. Therefore, in order to control eutrophication more effectively and efficiently, it is essential that the accumulation of sediment Fe/Al-P and P be decreased immediately and domestic wastewater, poultry excreta, and fertilizer loss must be more carefully controlled, especially in economically backward areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, effects of storage of hatching eggs interact with the breeder age. The aim of this review was to investigate how this interaction between storage duration and breeder age affects egg, embryo, hatchling and chicken characteristics. Prolonged storage resulted in a reduction in egg quality in both young and old breeders. This reduction was more pronounced in young flocks than in older flocks. For example, albumen pH increased more after 8 days of storage in younger flocks than in older flocks. Additionally, the embryonic morphological stage appears to increase as well with storage duration, but this increase is again more pronounced in younger flocks than in older flocks. Short storage (<7 days) seems to increase hatchability of eggs from young breeders, probably as a result of albumen liquefaction with consequently better  availability for the embryo. However, long storage (>7 days) resulted in a decline in hatchability, which was stronger in older breeders than in younger breeders. Prolonged storage duration resulted in lower chicken quality in both young and old breeders, but interaction between storage duration and breeder age on multiple chicken quality parameters is not clear. Based on this review, it can be concluded that (a) Short storage can improve hatchability of eggs from young breeders, but not from older breeders. (b) Negative impact of long storage appears to be lower with young breeders than with old breeders.(c) Adapted storage conditions related to the age of breeders might be an option to reduce negative effects of prolonged storage on hatching egg quality and chicken quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695110>Production of reactive species in alginate hydrogels for cold atmospheric plasma-based therapies.</a></h2><p>In the last years, great advances have been made in therapies based in cold atmospheric plasmas (CAP). CAP generate reactive  and nitrogen species (RONS) which can be transferred to liquids. These CAP activated liquids display the same biological efficacy (i.e. on killing cancer cells) as CAP themselves, opening the door for minimally invasive therapies. However, injection of a liquid in the body results in fast diffusion due to extracellular fluids and blood flow. Therefore, the development of efficient vehicles which allow local confinement and delivery of RONS to the diseased site is a fundamental requirement. In this work, we investigate the generation of RONS (HO, NO, short-lived RONS) in alginate hydrogels by comparing two atmospheric pressure plasma jets: kINPen and a helium needle, at a range of plasma treatment conditions (time, gas flow, distance to the sample). The physic-chemical properties of the hydrogels remain unchanged by the plasma treatment, while the hydrogel shows several-fold larger capacity for generation of RONS than a typical isotonic saline solution. Part of the RONS are quickly released to a receptor media, so special attention has to be put on the design of hydrogels with in-situ crosslinking. Remarkably, the hydrogels show capacity for sustained release of the RONS. The plasma-treated hydrogels remain fully biocompatible (due the fact that the species generated by plasma are previously washed away), indicating that no cytotoxic modifications have occurred on the polymer. Moreover, the RONS generated in alginate solutions showed cytotoxic potential towards bone cancer cells.

Here, our aim was to investigate the potential use of Se (0, 5 and 10 μM) in alleviating the Cr toxicity (0, 100 and 200 μM) in Brassica napus L. Results delineated that Se-supplementation notably recovered the Cr-phytotoxicity by reducing the Cr accumulation in plant tissues and boosted the inhibition in plant growth and biomass. Under Cr stress, the exogenously applied Se significantly recovered the impairment in photosynthesis related parameters (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and photochemical efficiency of photosystem II), and counteracted the reduction in nutrients uptake and improved the essential amino acids (EAAs) levels. In addition, Se activated the antioxidants enzymes included in AsA-GSH cycle (SOD, CAT, APX, GR, DHAR, MDHAR, GSH, and AsA) and glyoxalase (Gly) system (Gly I and Gly II) and minimized the excessive generation of reactive  species (ROS) and methylglyoxal (MG) contents in response to Cr stress. In a nutshell, Se (more effective at 5 μM) alleviated the Cr and MG induced phytotoxicity and oxidative damages by minimizing their (Cr and MG) accumulation and enhanced the plant growth, nutrients element level, nutrition quality by improving EAAs, antioxidant and Gly system. By considering the above-mentioned biomarkers, the addition of exogenous Se in Cr polluted soils might be effective approach to decrease the Cr uptake and its linked phytotoxicity in B. napus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The role of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in PCD during lace plant leaf development is currently unknown. Hsp70 amounts were measured throughout lace plant leaf development, and the results indicate that it is highest before and during PCD. Increased Hsp70 amounts correlate with raised anthocyanin content and caspase-like protease (CLP) activity. To investigate the effects of Hsp70 on leaf development, whole plants were treated with either of the known regulators of PCD [reactive  species (ROS) or antioxidants] or an Hsp70 inhibitor, chlorophenylethynylsulfonamide (PES-Cl). ROS treatment significantly increased Hsp70 2-fold and CLP activity in early developing leaves, but no change in anthocyanin and the number of perforations formed was observed. Antioxidant treatment significantly decreased Hsp70, anthocyanin, and CLP activity in early leaves, resulting in the fewest perforations. PES-Cl (25 μM) treatment significantly increased Hsp70 4-fold in early leaves, while anthocyanin, superoxide, and CLP activity significantly declined, leading to fewer perforations. Results show that significantly increased (4-fold) or decreased Hsp70 amounts lead to lower anthocyanin and CLP activity, inhibiting PCD induction. Our data support the hypothesis that Hsp70 plays a role in regulating PCD at a threshold in lace plant leaf development. Hsp70 affects anthocyanin content and caspase-like protease activity, and helps regulate PCD during the remodelling of leaves of lace plant, Aponogeton madagascariensis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Considering the imitations in the reconstructive surgeries in restoring tissue loss and deficiency, stem cell-based therapy, in particular, has been expected to pave the way for a new solution to the regenerative approaches. Limitations in the reconstructive surgeries in restoring tissue loss and deficiency have paved the way for new regenerative approaches. Among them, adipose-derived stem/progenitor cells (ADSCs)-based therapy could be the most promising clue, since ADSCs have pluripotent differentiation capabilities not only in adipocytes but also in a variety of cell types. Accumulating evidences have indicated that the unfavorable development of adipose-tissue damage, namely, lipodystrophy, is a systemic complication, which is closely related to metabolic abnormality. Considering ADSC-based regenerative medicine should be applied for the treatment of lipodystrophy, it is inevitable to ascertain whether the ADSCs obtained from the patients with lipodystrophy are capable of being used. It will be very promising and realistic if this concept is applied to lipoatrophy; one form of lipodystrophies that deteriorates the patients' quality of life because of excessive loss of soft tissue in the exposed areas such as face and extremities. Since lipodystrophy is frequently observed in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the present study aims to examine the biological potentials of ADSCs isolated from the HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy associated with the HAART treatment. Growth properties, adipogenic differentiation, and mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production were examined in ADSCs from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Our results clearly demonstrated that ADSCs from both patients showed indistinguishable growth properties and potentials for adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Thus, although the number of cases were limited, ADSCs isolated from the patients with lipodystrophy retain sufficient physiological and biological activity for the reconstitution of adipose-tissue, suggesting that ADSCs from the patients with lipodystrophy could be used for autologous ADSC-based regenerative therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694192>The Role of Inflammasome-Dependent and Inflammasome-Independent NLRP3 in the Kidney.</a></h2><p>Cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) forms an inflammasome with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and pro-caspase-1, which is followed by the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1 and ultimately the activation of IL-1β and IL-18 and induction of pyroptosis in immune cells. NLRP3 activation in kidney diseases aggravates inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, and this effect is abrogated by genetic or pharmacologic deletion of NLRP3. Inflammasome-dependent NLRP3 mediates the progression of kidney diseases by escalating the inflammatory response in immune cells and the cross-talk between immune cells and renal nonimmune cells. However, recent studies have suggested that NLRP3 has several inflammasome-independent functions in the kidney. Inflammasome-independent NLRP3 regulates apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells by interacting with mitochondria and mediating mitochondrial reactive  species production and mitophagy. This review will summarize the mechanisms by which NLRP3 functions in the kidney in both inflammasome-dependent and inflammasome-independent ways and the role of NLRP3 and NLRP3 inhibitors in kidney diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692285>Nanocarriers in photodynamic therapy-in vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive technique which has proven to be successful in the treatment of several types of tumors. This relatively simple method exploits three inseparable elements: phototoxic compound (photosensitizer [PS]), light source, and . Upon irradiation by light with specified wavelength, PS generates reactive  species, which starts the cascade of reactions leading to cell death. The positive therapeutic outcome of PDT may be limited due to several aspects, including low water solubility of PSs, hampering their effective administration and blood circulation, as well as low tumor specificity, inefficient cellular uptake and activation energies requiring prolonged illumination times. One of the promising approaches to overcome these obstacles involves the use of carrier systems modulating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the PSs. In the present review, we summarized current in vitro and in vivo studies regarding the use of nanoparticles as potential delivery devices for PSs to enhance their cellular uptake and cytotoxic properties, and thus-the therapeutic outcome of PDT.

Yet comprehensive reviews on the medical geology of SUGEs are still lacking. The current paper posits that TGCs occur widely in SUGEs, and pose human health risks. The objectives of the review are to: (1) highlight the nature, occurrence and behaviour of TGCs associated with SUGEs; (2) discuss the human intake pathways and health risks of TGCs; (4) identify the key risk factors predisposing human health to TGCs particularly in Africa; and (5) highlight key knowledge gaps and future research directions. TGCs of human health concern in SUGEs include chrysotile asbestos, toxic metals (Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, Zn, Co), and rare earth elements. Human intake of TGCs occur via inhalation, and ingestion of contaminated drinking water, wild foods, medicinal plants, animal foods, and geophagic earths. Occupational exposure may occur in the mining, milling, sculpturing, engraving, and carving industries. African populations are particularly at high risk due to: (1) widespread consumption of wild foods, medicinal plants, untreated drinking water, and geophagic earths; (2) weak and poorly enforced environmental, occupational, and public health regulations; and (3) lack of human health surveillance systems. Human health risks of chrysotile include asbestosis, cancers, and mesothelioma. Toxic metals are redox active, thus generate reactive  species causing oxidative stress. Dietary intake of iron and geophagy may increase the iron overload among native Africans who are genetically predisposed to such health risks. Synergistic interactions among TGCs particularly chrysotile and toxic metals may have adverse human health effects. The occurrence of SUGEs, coupled with the several risk factors in Africa, provides a unique and ideal setting for investigating the relationships between TGCs and human health risks. A conceptual framework for human health risk assessment and mitigation, and future research direction are highlighted.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Substituting noble metal-based electrocatalysts by decidedly effective and low-cost  metal-based  electrocatalysts is imperative for the commercial application of these technologies. Herein, we present a novel strategy to fabricate selenized and phosphorized porous cobalt-nickel oxide microcubes through sacrificial ZnO sphere template and employed it as OER electrocatalyst. The selenized samples manifest desirable and robust OER performance, with comparable overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 (312 mV) as RuO2 (308 mV) and better activity when the current reaches 13.7 mA cm -2 . The phosphorized samples exhibit core-shell structure with low-crystalline oxides inside amorphous phosphides, which ensures superior activity towards RuO2 with the same overpotential (at 10 mA cm -2 ) yet lower Tafel slope.

Preservation solutions were first developed to maximize cold static preservation, which includes the addition of several chemical compounds. The next chapter of organ preservation comes with the perfusion machine, where mechanical devices provide continuous flow and oxygenation ex vivo to the organs being preserved. In the addition of inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibitors of the proteasome, mesenchymal stem cells began being used 13 years ago to prevent or diminish the organ's injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells (e.g., bone marrow stem cells, adipose derived stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells) have proven to be powerful tools in repairing damaged organs.

Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer and ATP-dependent potassium channel opener that was developed as an inodilating drug for the treatment of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Differently from other more widely used inotropic agents, levosimendan has some exclusive characteristics, in terms of mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamic profile, and hemodynamic effects. This may have important clinical implications. In particular, in patients with acute ventricular dysfunction or in patients with pre-existing severe ventricular impairment undergoing planned myocardial stress, the administration of levosimendan before the onset of overt symptoms or before cardiovascular therapeutic procedures may have the potential to bridge the patient through the critical phase. In this review, we will focus on the rationale, the existing experimental data, and the emerging clinical experience supporting an early, even preventive use of levosimendan in severe ventricular dysfunction, beyond its recognized indications.© Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The intubated, ventilated patient's inspired and expired fractions of O2 and CO2 (FiO2, FeO2, FiCO2 and FeCO2) are monitored in the operating room and can be used to calculate RER.To investigating the ability of the RER to predict postoperative complications.An observational, prospective study.Two French university hospitals between March 2017 and September 2018.A total of 110 patients undergoing noncardiac high-risk surgery.The RER was calculated as (FeCO2 - FiCO2)/(FiO2 - FeO2) at five time points during the operation. The primary endpoint was at the end of the surgery. The secondary endpoints were systemic oxygenation indices (pCO2 gap, pCO2 gap/arteriovenous difference in O2 ratio, central venous  saturation) and the arterial lactate level at the end of the surgery. Complications were classified according to the European Peri-operative Clinical Outcome definitions.Postoperative complications occurred in 35 patients (34%). The median [interquartile range] RER at the end of surgery was significantly greater in the subgroup with complications, 1.06 [0.84 to 1.35] than in the subgroup without complications, 0.81 [0.75 to 0.91], and correlated significantly with the arterial lactate (r = 0.31, P < 0.001) and VO2 (r = -0.23, P = 0.001).

The best cut-off for the RER was 0.94, with a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI 68 to 88).As a putative noninvasive marker of tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, the RER can be used to predict complications following high-risk surgery.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694527>Transcriptome analysis reveals a positive effect of brassinosteroids on the photosynthetic capacity of wucai under low temperature.</a></h2><p>Brassinosteroids (BRs) have a positive effect on many processes during plant growth and development, and in response to various abiotic stressors. Low-temperature (LT) stress constricts the geographic distribution, growth, and development of wucai (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis var. rosularis Tsen). However, there is little information on the global gene expression of BRs under LT stress in wucai. In this study, the molecular roles of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) after exogenously application, were explored by RNA sequencing under LT conditions.According to the Gene Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, photosynthesis was significantly enriched after spraying EBR under LT. The transcripts encoding the photosystem II (PSII) -evolving enhancer protein, photosystem I (PSI) subunit, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes I and II, and ferredoxin were up-regulated after the application of EBR. Transcripts encoding several key enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were also up-regulated, accompanied by significant differences in the contents of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-proto IX), protochlorophyllide (Pchl), and photosynthetic pigments. Notably, transcriptional and physiological analyses revealed that under LT stress, plant responses to EBR involved a major reorientation of photosynthesis, as well as porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.This study explored the role of EBR as an LT stress tolerance mechanism in wucai. At the transcription level, LT tolerance manifests as an enhancement of photosynthesis, and the amelioration of porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691463>Pre-treatments enhance the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells in liver diseases.</a></h2><p>Liver diseases caused by viral infection, alcohol abuse and metabolic disorders can progress to end-stage liver failure, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, which are a growing cause of death worldwide. Although liver transplantation and hepatocyte transplantation are useful strategies to promote liver regeneration, they are limited by scarce sources of organs and hepatocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) restore liver injury after hepatogenic differentiation and exert immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, antioxidative stress and antiapoptotic effects on liver cells in vivo. After isolation and culture in vitro, MSCs are faced with nutrient and  deprivation, and external growth factors maintain MSC capacities for further applications. In addition, MSCs are placed in a harsh microenvironment, and anoikis and inflammation after transplantation in vivo significantly decrease their regenerative capacity. Pre-treatment with chemical agents, hypoxia, an inflammatory microenvironment and gene modification can protect MSCs against injury, and pre-treated MSCs show improved hepatogenic differentiation, homing capacity, survival and paracrine effects in vitro and in vivo in regard to attenuating liver injury. In this review, we mainly focus on pre-treatments and the underlying mechanisms for improving the therapeutic effects of MSCs in various liver diseases. Thus, we provide evidence for the development of MSC-based cell therapy to prevent acute or chronic liver injury.

Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control, HFD (high fat diet), OX (0.75% ethylene glycol), and HFD + OX (combined model) Changes in basal O levels were evaluated by chemiluminescence in renal interlobar arteries and renal cortex. Furthermore, the effect of different inhibitors on NADPH-stimulated O generation was assessed in renal cortex. Oxidative stress sources, and local inflammatory mediators, were also determined, in parallel, by RT-PCR, and correlated with measures of renal function, urinary biochemistry, and renal structure. Rats from the HFD group developed overweight without lipid profile alteration. Tubular deposits of crystals were seen in OX and severely enhanced in HFD + OX groups along with a significantly higher impairment of renal function. Basal oxidative stress was increased in renal cortex of OX rats and in renal arteries of HFD rats, while animals from the combined HFD + OX group exhibited the highest levels of oxidative stress in renal cortex, derived from xanthine oxidase and COX-2. NADPH oxidase-dependent O generation was elevated in renal cortex of the OX group and markedly enhanced in the HFD + OX rats, and associated to an up-regulation of Nox1 and a down-regulation of Nox4 expression. High levels of oxidative stress in the kidney, of OX and HFD + OX groups were also associated to an inflammatory response mediated by an elevation of TNFα, COX-2, NFκB1 MCP-1, and OPN. Oxidative stress is a key pathogenic factor in renal disease associated to hyperoxaluria and a common link underlying the exacerbated inflammatory response and kidney injury found under conditions of both obesity and hyperoxaluria.

However, the role of GPX2 in cervical cancer is unclear. In this study, we identified the role of GPX2 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines.The basal mRNA and protein expression of GPX2 in cervical cancer cells and a series of key molecules in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and WNT/β-catenin pathways were examined via real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays. The biological phenotype of the cervical cancer cell lines was detected by the cloning formation and transwell assays, and intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels were detected by flow cytometry. Finally, the GPX2 expression level in 100 clinical cervical tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry.We found that GPX2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal individuals and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of cervical cancer cells, and this promotion correlated with the activation of EMT and WNT/β-catenin signaling in vitro. GPX2 was determined to reduce apoptotic damage by reducing hydroperoxides. According to the characteristics and verification of GPX2, this series of phenotypes is clearly related to oxidative stress in cells. Furthermore, we verified that GPX2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues and promoted the metastasis of cervical cancer.In summary, we found that GPX2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer cells and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of cervical cancer by affecting oxidative stress.

A second facet of natural ability is how rapidly an individual adapts to training; this is termed trainability. A third facet is the upper limit achievable after years of prolonged intense training; this represents both intrinsic ability and also trainability. There are other features of natural ability to consider, for example body size, because some events, sports, or positions favor participants of different sizes.

The kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) forms the enzymatic core of the highly conserved mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is a key inhibitor of autophagy, yet the function of mTORC2 in autophagy is controversial. We here show that inactivation of mTORC2 and its direct target serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK-1) potently induces autophagy and the autophagic degradation of mitochondria in C. elegans. Enhanced autophagy in mTORC2- or SGK-1-deficient animals contributes to their developmental and reproductive defects and is independent of the canonical SGK-1 effector DAF-16/FOXO. Importantly, we find that inactivation of mTORC2-SGK-1 signaling impairs mitochondrial homeostasis and triggers an increased release of mitochondria-derived reactive  species (mtROS) to induce autophagy. Thus, mitochondrial stress couples reduced mTORC2 activity to enhanced autophagic turnover.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Based on recent studies demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and immune responses are correlated, the current study sought to determine whether MCT oil controls inflammatory responses through modulation of mitochondria using both in vitro and in vivo models. The mitochondrial metabolic phenotypes of macrophages were assessed according to  consumption rate (OCR). Inflammatory responses were assessed for production of cytokines and expression of activation markers. MCT oil was more rapidly oxidized as observed by increased OCR in macrophages. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was down-regulated and anti-inflammatory cytokine was elevated by MCT oil. In addition, classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 markers were reciprocally regulated by MCT intervention. Overall, up-regulated β-oxidation by MCT contributes to the anti-inflammatory M2-like status of macrophages, which may aid in the dietary prevention and/or amelioration of inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687612>Lactate measurements accurately predicts 1-week mortality in emergency department patients with acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Studies on prognostic indicators in patients with acute kidney injury are limited.

The electron beam irradiation experiment shows that Ni in LiNiO2 has much lower threshold energy for displacement than Co in LiCoO2, which is supported by the DFT calculations predicting that Ni has lower migration energy. The transition metal ions are reduced from oxidation state of +3 to +2 during migration from their original positions to the lithium sites, and Ni is more easily reduced than Co because of its electronic configuration. In addition, the high-energy electron beam induces  release, which is another symptom of degradation of materials that occurs more strongly in Ni-containing materials with ion displacement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692431>Novel findings and therapeutic targets on cardioprotection of ischemia/reperfusion injury in STEMI.</a></h2><p>Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. A large number of STEMI patients after the infarction gradually develop heart failure due to the infarcted myocardium. Timely reperfusion is essential to salvage ischemic myocardium from the infarction, but the restoration of coronary blood flow in the infarct-related artery itself induces myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte death, known as ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). The factors contributing to IRI in STEMI are complex, and microvascular obstruction, inflammation, release of reactive  species, myocardial stunning, and activation of myocardial cell death are involved. Therefore, additional cardioprotection is required to prevent the heart from IRI. Although many mechanical conditioning procedures and pharmacological agents have been identified as effective cardioprotective approaches in animal studies, their translation into the clinical practice has been relatively disappointing due to a variety of reasons. With new emerging data on cardioprotection in STEMI over the past few years, it is mandatory to reevaluate the effectiveness of "old" cardioprotective interventions and highlight the novel therapeutic targets and new treatment strategies of cardioprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692343>Si-H Bond Activation with Bullock's Cationic Tungsten(II) Catalyst: CO as Cooperating Ligand.</a></h2><p>An in-depth investigation of the reaction of tertiary hydrosilanes with [CpW(CO)2(IMes)]+[B(C6F5)4]- reveals a fundamentally new Si-H bond activation mode. Unlike the originally proposed oxidative addition of the Si-H bond to the tungsten(II) center, there is strong experimental and NMR spectroscopic evidence for the involvement of one of the CO ligands of the cationic complex in the Si-H bond breaking event. The Si-H bond is heterolytically cleaved to form a tungsten(II) hydride and a silylium ion, which is stabilized by one of the CO ligands. This reactive hydrosilane adduct was eventually isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Quantum-chemical calculations support a cooperative mechanism but a stepwise process consisting of oxidative addition and subsequent tungsten-to- silyl migration in the tungsten(IV) silyl hydride is also energetically feasible. However, our combined spectroscopic and computational analysis favors the cooperative pathway. The newly identified hydrosilane adduct is the key intermediate of Bullock's ionic carbonyl hydrosilylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694915>Pannexin 1 mediates ferroptosis that contributes to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.</a></h2><p>Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant problem in perioperativemedicine related to oxidative programmed cell death. However, the role of ferroptosis,a newly discovered form of oxidative cell death, has not been evaluated widely.Panx1, an ATP-releasing pathway family, has anti-inflammatory effects during kidneyinjury. Here, we demonstrated that panx1 deletion protected against renal IRI byregulating ferroptotic cell death. In panx1 knockout mice subjected to renal IRI,decreased plasma creatinine, MDA contents in kidney tissue, and tubular cell death(decreased TUNEL positive renal tubular cells) were found compared to those inpanx1 wild type (wt) mice. In cultured human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells, erastin inducedferroptotic lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation were significantly attenuated bysilencing panx1 expression. Moreover, panx1 silencing significantly modulatedferroptosis related protein expression. Furthermore, Panx1 deletion induced theexpression of a cytoprotective chaperone, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), andmodulated the MAPK/ERK pathway. In this study, we first discovered that panx1deletion protects against renal IRI by attenuating MAPK/ERK activation and inducingHO-1 expression in a ferroptotic way. Our findings provide new insights tounderstand the mechanism of panx1 in ferroptotic cell death and highlight a newtherapeutic target for acute kidney injury(AKI) treatment during the perioperativeperiod.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691474>Ultra-small 2D CoxZn2-x(benzimidazole)4 MOF nanosheets and their derived Co nanodots@Co-N-codoped graphene for efficient  reduction reaction.</a></h2><p>The development of non-precious metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) with efficient metal utilization and abundant active sites toward the  reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, ultra-small 2D CoxZn2-xBIM4 bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (~2 nm thick) are synthesized by a novel bottom-up strategy, which are then thermally converted to a core-shell structure of sub-5 nm Co nanodots (NDs) wrapped by 2 to 5 layers of Co-N-codoped graphene (Co@FLG). The size of the Co NDs in the Co@FLG could be precisely controlled by the Co:Zn ratio in the CoxZn2-xBIM4 nanosheet. The optimized Co@FLG, as an ORR electrocatalyst, exhibits an excellent half-wave potential of 0.841 V vs. RHE, a high limiting current density of 6.42 mA cm-2, and great stability in alkaline electrolyte. The Co@FLG also possesses great ORR performance in neutral electrolyte as well as in Mg-air batteries. The experimental studies and DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of the Co@FLG is mainly attributed to its great O2 absorptivity endowed by the abundant Co-Nx and pyridinic-N in the FLG shell and the strong electron-donating ability from the Co ND core to the FLG shell to elevate the eg-orbital energy of Co(II) and lower the activation energy for breaking the O=O/O-O bonds.

Similar diets can also lead to similar gut microbial communities within host species levels. Giant pandas () and red pandas () have had long-term and stable bamboo diets, and seem well adapted to this highly fibrous diet. When compared to the gut microbiomes of Père David's deer (), humans, cheetah (), black-backed jackal (), and black bear (), giant panda gut microbiomes have high variation in the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Clostridiaceae, and are somewhat unstable. This high instability and dissimilarity may reflect an unstable gut environment, perturbation or selective pressure because of their carnivorous gastrointestinal system. A short digestive tract, brief digestion time and fast intestinal peristalsis may result in higher  concentrations that select for the growth of aerobes and facultative anaerobes in giant pandas. Potential selection of high proportion of Pseudomonadaceae in giant panda (GP-HP) and red panda gut microbiomes may arise because of their postulated ability to degrade secondary compounds (e.g., cyanide compounds and aromatic compounds). However, high proportion of Clostridiaceae (GP-HF) may focus on cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. Thus, GP-HP and GP-HF groups have high dissimilarity on the functional level. These findings show that long-term similarities in diet do not always lead to similar or stable gut microbial system within the same host species and that other factors can drive the selection of gut taxa.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694905>MET Inhibition Elicits PGC1α-Dependent Metabolic Reprogramming in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>The receptor kinase c-MET has emerged as a target for glioblastoma therapy. However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor metabolism involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1α in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacological (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-Glucose, U-13C-Glutamine and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative metabolism, which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of mitochondria and production of reactive  species (ROS). Genetic interference with PGC1α rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CREB regulates the expression of PGC1α in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and beta-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity. Collectively, we have unraveled the mechanistic underpinnings of c-MET inhibition and identified novel combination therapies that may enhance its therapeutic efficacy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691896>The impact of calcium peroxide on groundwater bacterial diversity during naphthalene removal by permeable reactive barrier (PRB).</a></h2><p>-releasing compounds (ORCs) have recently gained much attention in contaminated groundwater remediation. We investigated the impact of calcium peroxide nanoparticles on the groundwater indigenous bacteria in a bioremediation process by permeable reactive barrier (PRB). Three sand-packed columns were applied, including (1) control column (fresh groundwater), (2) natural remediation column (contaminated groundwater), and (3) biostimulation column (contaminated groundwater amended with CaO). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria constituted the main phyla among the identified isolates. According to the results of next-generation sequencing, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum (81% relative abundance) in the natural remediation condition. But, it was declined to 38.1% in the biostimulation column. Meanwhile, the abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased to 25.9% and 15.4%, respectively, by exposing the groundwater microbial structure to CaO nanoparticles. Furthermore, orders Chlamydiales, Nitrospirales, and Oceanospirillales existing in the control column were detected in the presence of naphthalene. Shannon index was 4.32 for the control column samples, while it was reduced to 2.73 and 2.00 in the natural and biostimulation columns, respectively. Therefore, the present study provides a considerable insight into the impact of ORCs on the groundwater microbial community during the bioremediation process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690381>Acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus).</a></h2><p>Acute severe asthma, formerly known as status asthmaticus, is defined as severe asthma unresponsive to repeated courses of beta-agonist therapy. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate recognition and treatment. Albuterol in combination with ipratropium bromide in the emergency department (ED) has been shown to decrease the time spent in the ED and the hospitalization rates. The benefits of ipratropium are not sustained after admission to the hospital. Oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients with acute severe asthma as early as possible because clinical benefits may not occur for a minimum of 6 to 12 hours. Viral respiratory infections are a common trigger for acute asthma; other causes include medical nonadherence, allergen exposure (especially pets and mold [e.g., Alternaria species]) in individuals who are severely atopic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory exposure in patients with aspirin allergy, irritant inhalation (e.g., smoke, paint), exercise, and insufficient use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids. The patient's history should focus on the acute assessment of asthma control and morbidity, including current use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids; the number of hospitalizations, ED visits, intensive care unit admissions, and intubations; the frequency of albuterol use; the presence of nighttime symptoms; activity intolerance; current medications; exposure to allergens; and other significant medical conditions. Severe airflow obstruction may be predicted by accessory muscle use, difficulty speaking, refusal to recline < 30°, a pulse of >120 beats/min, and decreased breath sounds. More objective measures of airway obstruction  peak flow or forced expiratory volume in 1 second and pulse oximetry before  administration usually are helpful.

Arterial blood gases, dyspnea and comfort were recorded. Inspiratory effort was estimated by esophageal pressure (PES) swings. PES simplified pressure-time product and transpulmonary pressure swings were measured.As compared to HFNC, helmet NIV increased PaO2/FiO2 (median [interquartile range]: 255 mmHg [140-299] vs. 138 [101-172], p=0.001) and lowered inspiratory effort (7 cmH2O [4-11] vs. 15 [8-19], p=0.001) in all patients. Inspiratory effort-reduction by NIV was linearly related to inspiratory effort during HFNC (r=0.84, p<0.001).

Higher transpulmonary pressure swings during NIV were associated with subsequent need for intubation.As compared to HFNC in hypoxemic respiratory failure, helmet NIV improves oxygenation, reduces dyspnea, inspiratory effort and simplified pressure-time product, with similar transpulmonary pressure swings, PaCO2 and comfort.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695560>Ginseng extracts modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics of live cardiomyoblasts: a functional comparison of different extraction solvents.</a></h2><p>The root of , a member of Araliaceae family, has been used as herbal medicine and functional food in Asia for thousands of years. According to Traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng is the most widely used "Qi-invigorating" herbs, which provides tonic and preventive effects by resisting oxidative stress, influencing energy metabolism, and improving mitochondrial function. Very few reports have systematically measured cell mitochondrial bioenergetics after ginseng treatment.Here, H9C2 cell line, a rat cardiomyoblast, was treated with ginseng extracts having extracted using solvents of different polarity, i.e., water, 50% ethanol, and 90% ethanol, and subsequently, the  consumption rate in healthy and -butyl hydroperoxide-treated live cultures was determined by Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.The 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng possessed the strongest antioxidative and tonic activities to mitochondrial respiration and therefore provided the best protective effects to H9C2 cardiomyocytes. By increasing the spare respiratory capacity of stressed H9C2 cells up to three-folds of that of healthy cells, the 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng greatly improved the tolerance of myocardial cells to oxidative damage.These results demonstrated that the low polarity extracts of ginseng could be the best extract, as compared with others, in regulating the  consumption rate of cultured cardiomyocytes during mitochondrial respiration.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691289>Physiological basis of brief vigorous exercise to improve health.</a></h2><p>This review considers the physiological basis of brief vigorous exercise to improve health, with a focus on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and glycemic control, and the potential underlying mechanisms involved. We defined 'brief' as a protocol lasting ≤15 min including warm-up, cool-down, and recovery, and involving a total of ≤5 min of 'vigorous' exercise, which was classified as meeting or exceeding the lower end of the range for this relative intensity per criteria from the American College of Sports Medicine. The physiological mechanisms responsible for the increase in CRF, as measured by maximal  update (VO ), after brief vigorous exercise are unclear, and likely depend on various factors including the specific nature of the intervention as well as the time course of the response. Limited available evidence suggests the potential for an increased  extraction by active muscle (i.e. greater arterio-venous  difference), since an increase in VO has been reported after several weeks of brief vigorous exercise despite no measurable change in cardiac output. Emerging evidence indicates that brief vigorous exercise can improve glycemic control, suggesting that this type of exercise could potentially play a role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. The acute response is not well characterized but several studies have shown that several weeks brief vigorous exercise improves estimates of insulin sensitivity as determined by various methods including by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The physiological mechanisms underlying improved CRF and glycemic control after brief vigorous exercise, and broader impact on health, remain fruitful areas of investigation.

It can be a devastating diagnosis and can cause a life-threatening compromise to the cardiac, respiratory, or cerebrovascular system. It is a rare complication of central venous vascular access manipulation. A cerebral air embolism can lead to acute ischemic and cerebral oedema, which mimics other stroke syndromes, but the acute treatment differs, with prompt administration of hyperbaric  therapy being the mainstay of treatment. A 59-year-old male became acutely unresponsive followed by the emergence of evolving neurology with fixed gaze palsy and a dense 0/5 left-sided hemiparesis. This occurred shortly after a right internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) was removed (against protocol) during inspiration and sitting upright. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed air in the right internal jugular vein, as well as intraparenchymal air. Treatment with hyperbaric  was instituted within six hours. There was an excellent recovery of neurologic function, with power improving to 4+/5 over the course of the following week. Clinical staff need to be aware of the policy for central line removal, as well as having a high index of suspicion for air embolism in patients with evolving neurology immediately post-line removal.

However, there is a lack of research on the development of ROS-generating nanosystems that combine endogenous and exogenous ROS to enhance oxidative stress-mediated cancer cell death.  A ROS-generating agent based on polymer-modified zinc peroxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was presented, which simultaneously delivered exogenous HO and Zn capable of amplifying endogenous ROS production for synergistic cancer therapy.  After internalization into tumor cells, ZnO NPs underwent decomposition in response to mild acidic pH, resulting in controlled release of HO and Zn. Intriguingly, Zn could increase the production of mitochondrial O· and HO by inhibiting the electron transport chain, and thus exerted anticancer effect in a synergistic manner with the exogenously released HO to promote cancer cell killing. Furthermore, ZnO NPs were doped with manganese  cation exchange, making them an activatable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent.

To date, the genetic mechanisms of rapeseed' interactions with S. sclerotiorum are not fully understood, and molecular-based breeding is still the most effective control strategy for this disease. Here, Arabidopsis thaliana GDSL1 was characterized as an extracellular GDSL lipase gene functioning in Sclerotinia resistance. Loss of AtGDSL1 function resulted in enhanced susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum. Conversely, overexpression of AtGDSL1 in B. napus enhanced resistance, which was associated with increased reactive  species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA) levels, and reduced jasmonic acid levels. In addition, AtGDSL1 can cause an increase in lipid precursor phosphatidic acid levels, which may lead to the activation of downstream ROS/SA defense-related pathways. However, the rapeseed BnGDSL1 with highest sequence similarity to AtGDSL1 had no effect on SSR resistance. A candidate gene association study revealed that only one AtGDSL1 homolog from rapeseed, BnaC07g35650D (BnGLIP1), significantly contributed to resistance traits in a natural B. napus population, and the resistance function was also confirmed by a transient expression assay in tobacco leaves. Moreover, genomic analyses revealed that BnGLIP1 locus was embedded in a selected region associated with SSR-resistance during the breeding process, and its elite allele type belonged to a minor allele in the population. Thus, BnGLIP1 is the functional equivalent of AtGDSL1 and has a broad application in rapeseed S. sclerotiorum-resistance breeding.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective action of BDNF overexpression in hippocampal neurons against injury under ischemia-like conditions ( and glucose deprivation) and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (GluTox). The overexpression of BDNF was reached by the transduction of cell cultures with the adeno-associated (AAV)-Syn-BDNF-EGFP virus construct. Neuroprotective effects were mediated by Ca-dependent BDNF release followed by activation of the neuroprotective signaling cascades and changes of the gene expression. Thus, BDNF overexpression modulates Ca homeostasis in cells, preventing Ca overload and initiation of apoptotic and necrotic processes. Antiapoptotic effect of BDNF overexpression is mediated via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and changing the expression of PI3K, HIF-1, Src, and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. On the contrary, the decrease of expression of proapoptotic proteins such as Jun, Mapk8, Caspase-3, and an inflammatory cytokine IL-1β was observed. These changes of expression were accompanied by the decrease of quantity of IL-1β receptors and the level of TNFα in cells in control, as well as 24 hours after OGD. Besides, BDNF overexpression changes the expression of GABA(B) receptors. Also, the expression of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits was altered towards a change in the conductivity of the receptors for Ca. Thus, our results demonstrate that neuronal BDNF overexpression reveals complex neuroprotective effect on the neurons and astrocytes under OGD and GluTox via inhibition of Ca-responses and regulation of gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691539>Changes in the blood redox balance during a simulated duathlon race and its relationship with athletic performance.</a></h2><p>The duathlon is an endurance multisport event that consists of sequential running, cycling, and further running. Imbalance in the redox homeostasis is associated with fatigued status and underperformance in various sports; however, there are no corresponding reports regarding the duathlon. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in the blood redox balance during a simulated duathlon race and to determine the relationship between performance and the redox balance. Eight male triathletes participated in a simulated race, consisting of a 5-km run, 30 km cycling, and a further 5-km run, with 5 min rest between two parts to collect the blood samples. The serum levels of reactive  metabolites (d-ROMs) and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) were measured and BAP/d-ROMs ratio and oxidative stress index (OSI) were calculated. The d-ROMs levels after the first Run were significantly increased compared with the levels observed before the race. Moreover, BAP levels increased significantly over the race. The BAP/d-ROMs ratio also gradually increased through the race, while the OSI was gradually decreased. In addition, a significant relationship was observed only between d-ROMs levels after the first Run and the first Run performance. These results suggest that the redox balance shifts toward reduction (antioxidation) during the duathlon race and increased oxidant potential levels are negatively correlated with performance in the early stages of the race.© 2019 The Authors.

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) is a unique NLR with regulatory and anti-inflammatory functions resulting in protection from IBD in mouse models. NX-13 is an orally active, gut-restricted novel drug candidate that selectively targets and activates the NLRX1 pathway locally in the gut. In vitro and in vivo efficacy of NLRX1 activation by NX-13 was examined. Oral treatment with NX-13 alleviates disease severity, colonic leukocytic infiltration, and cytokine markers of inflammation in three mouse models of IBD (dextran sulfate sodium, Mdr1a, and CD45RB adoptive transfer). Treatment of naive CD4 T cells with NX-13 in vitro decreases differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets with increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased NF-κB activation and reactive  species. With stimulation by PMA/ionomycin, TNF-α, or HO, PBMCs from ulcerative colitis patients treated with NX-13 had decreased NF-κB activity, TNF-α and IFN-γ CD4 T cells and overall production of IL-6, MCP1, and IL-8. NX-13 activates NLRX1 to mediate a resistance to both inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress in mouse models and human primary cells from ulcerative colitis patients with effects on NF-κB activity and oxidative phosphorylation.

Conventional approaches to incorporate  defects mainly rely on reducing the  partial pressure for the removal of product to change the equilibrium position. However, directly affecting reactants to shift the reaction toward generating  vacancies is lacking and to fill this blank in synthetic methodology is very challenging. Here, a strategy is demonstrated to create  vacancies through making the reaction energetically more favorable via applying interfacial strain on reactants by coating, using TiO (B) as a model system. Geometrical phase analysis and density functional theory simulations verify that the formation energy of  vacancies is largely decreased under external strain. Benefiting from these, the obtained -deficient TiO (B) exhibits impressively high level of capacitive charge storage, e.g., ≈53% at 0.5 mV s , far surpassing the ≈31% of the unmodified counterpart. Meanwhile, the modified electrode shows significantly enhanced rate capability delivering a capacity of 112 mAh g at 20 C (≈6.7 A g ), ≈30% higher than air-annealed TiO and comparable to vacuum-calcined TiO . This work heralds a new paradigm of mechanical manipulation of materials through interfacial control for rational defect engineering.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This experiment was conducted to evaluate whether increasing the  level or administration of a probiotic could improve mortality and immune response of chickens at high altitude (2,986 m above the sea level). One-d-old chickens were randomly allocated to 1 of 6 treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. The first factor was the  level (low and high), while the second factor was the diet (basal diet, basal diet containing aureomycin, and basal diet plus L. plantarum). Increasing the  level significantly reduced the mortality and improved immune responses. The levels of IgA, IgG, IL-10 and anti-BSA antibodies were significantly higher, while IL-1β, LITAF were significantly lower in chickens reared in the high- room. In the low- room, L. plantarum significantly decreased the mortality of chickens compared with the other 2 groups. Moreover, L. plantarum significantly increased the levels of IgA, anti-BSA antibodies, IL-10 and decreased IL-1β, LITAF compared with the control group. These results demonstrated that increasing  level or administration of L. plantarum can improve health status of chickens in high altitude regions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688644>Evaluation of Early Submaximal Exercise Tolerance in Adolescents with Symptomatic Sport-related Concussion.</a></h2><p>To compare the cardiorespiratory response to a graded aerobic exercise challenge between adolescents with symptomatic sport-related concussion (SSRC) and healthy control subjects.A quasi-experimental non-randomized study at a multi-disciplinary pediatric concussion program was conducted. Thirty-four adolescents with SSRC (19 males and 15 females) and 40 healthy control subjects (13 males and 27 females) completed Buffalo Concussion Treadmill testing (BCTT) until either symptom exacerbation or volitional fatigue. Main outcome measures included heart rate (HR),  consumption (V˙O2), carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2), and minute ventilation (V˙E) at rest and at test termination, and change from rest in variables (ΔHR, ΔV˙O2, ΔV˙CO2, and ΔV˙E) during the first 5 stages of the BCTT. Main outcomes were analyzed using three-way mixed model ANOVAs, with group status (control vs. SSRC) and sex (male vs. female) as between-subjects factors, and time (BCTT stage) as the within-subjects factor.No group differences in resting HR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), ΔV˙O2, V˙CO2, and V˙E were observed. During the first 5 stages of the BCTT, no group differences in ΔV˙O2, V˙CO2, and V˙E were observed, however SSRC patients demonstrated higher ratings of perceived exertion (p < .0005) compared to control subjects. No sex-based differences were observed among SSRC patients on measures collected at rest and during early stages of BCTT.Although SSRC patients exhibited higher ratings of perceived exertion during a graded aerobic exercise challenge, no differences in cardiorespiratory response were observed compared to control subjects exercising at equivalent workloads. Further work is needed to elucidate the physiological mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance following SSRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693927>Phytoestrogen coumestrol attenuates brain mitochondrial dysfunction and long-term cognitive deficits following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.</a></h2><p>Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia (HI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is frequently associated with short and long-term neurologic and cognitive impairments. The HI injury causes mitochondrial damage leading to increased production of reactive  species (ROS). Phytoestrogens are non-steroidal plant substances structurally and functionally similar to estrogen. Coumestrol is a potent isoflavonoid with a protective effect against ischemic brain damage in adult rats. Our aim was to determine if coumestrol treatment following neonatal HI attenuates the long-term cognitive deficits induced by neonatal HI, as well as to investigate one possible mechanism underlying its potential effect.On the 7th postnatal day, male Wistar rats were submitted to the Levine-Rice HI model. Intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg of coumestrol, or vehicle, were administered immediately pre-hypoxia or 3 hours post-hypoxia. At 12 hours after HI the mitochondrial status and ROS levels were determined. At 60th postnatal day the cognitive deficits were revealed in the Morris water maze reference and working spatial memories. Following behavioral analysis, histological assessment was performed and reactive astrogliosis was measured by GFAP expression.Results demonstrate that both pre- and post-HI administration of coumestrol were able to counteract the long-term cognitive and morphological impairments caused by HI, as well as to block the late reactive astrogliosis. The pre-HI administration of coumestrol was able to prevent the early mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus of injured rat pups.Present data suggest that coumestrol exerts protection against experimental neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia through, at least in part, early modulation of mitochondrial function.Copyright © 2019.

The dysfunctional tumor vasculature limits the efficiency of oxygenation and drug delivery to reduce treatment outcome. A concept of tumor vascular normalization (VN), which inhibits angiogenesis to improve vessel maturity, blood perfusion, and oxygenation, has been demonstrated under the anti-angiogenic therapy. The efficiency of drug delivery and penetration is increased by enhancing perfusion and reducing interstitial fluid pressure during the time window of VN. However, anti-angiogenic agents only induce transient VN and then prune vessels to aggravate tumor hypoxia. To repair tumor vessels without altering vessel density, we proposed to induce tumor VN by local  release via  microbubbles with ultrasound. With tumor perfusion enhancement under ultrasound contrast imaging tracing, the time window of VN was defined as 2-8 days after a single  microbubble treatment. The enhanced tumor oxygenation after  microbubble treatment inhibited hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway to improve the morphology and function of tumor vasculature. The pericyte coverage and Hoechst penetration of tumor vessels increased without any changes to the vessel density. Finally, the intratumoral accumulation of anti-cancer drug doxorubicin could be increased 3-4 folds during tumor VN. These findings demonstrate that regulating tumor oxygenation by  microbubbles could normalize dysfunctional vessels to enhance vascular maturity, blood perfusion, and drug penetration. Furthermore, ultrasound perfusion imaging provides a simple and non-invasive way to detect the VN time window, which increases the feasibility of VN in clinical cancer applications.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695748> exhibiting a modified route for uptake and catabolism of glycerol forms significant amounts of ethanol from this carbon source considered as 'non-fermentable'.</a></h2><p>Due to its inevitable formation during biodiesel production and its relatively high degree of reduction, glycerol is an attractive carbon source for microbial fermentation processes. However, glycerol is catabolized in a fully respiratory manner by the eukaryotic platform organism . We previously engineered   strains to favor fermentative metabolism of glycerol by replacing the native FAD-dependent glycerol catabolic pathway with the NAD-dependent 'DHA pathway'. In addition, a heterologous aquaglyceroporin (Fps1 homolog) was expressed to facilitate glycerol uptake. The current study was launched to scrutinize the formation of 's natural fermentation product ethanol from glycerol caused by the conducted genetic modifications. This understanding is supposed to facilitate future engineering of this yeast for fermenting glycerol into valuable products more reduced than ethanol.A strain solely exhibiting the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement produced ethanol at concentrations close to the detection limit. The expression of the heterologous aquaglyceroporin caused significant ethanol production (8.5 g L from 51.5 g L glycerol consumed) in a strain catabolizing glycerol via the DHA pathway but not in the wild-type background. A reduction of  availability in the shake flask cultures further increased the ethanol titer up to 15.7 g L (from 45 g L glycerol consumed).The increased yield of cytosolic NADH caused by the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement seems to be a minimal requirement for the occurrence of alcoholic fermentation in   growing in synthetic glycerol medium. The remarkable metabolic switch to ethanol formation in the DHA pathway strain with the heterologous aquaglyceroporin supports the assumption of a much stronger influx of glycerol accompanied by an increased rate of cytosolic NADH production via the DHA pathway. The fact that a reduction of  supply increases ethanol production in DHA pathway strains is in line with the hypothesis that a major part of glycerol in normal shake flask cultures still enters the catabolism in a respiratory manner.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692345>Persulfurated Coronene and Its Chalcogenide Analogues: Insight into Effects of the Peripheral Substitution.</a></h2><p>The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods have been used to investigate the persulfurated coronene (PSC) and its chalcogenide analogues (POC and PSeC), derived from the substitution of sulfur, , and selenium for all hydrogen atoms in coronene, respectively. The presence of peripheral S-S in PSC results in a σ-type lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the dark low-lying states (S1 ∼ S15). The peripheral S-S bond is responsible for its electron capture, which maintains a planar configuration of the singly and doubly negative-charged PSC. POC is predicted to have the most stable saddle-shaped structure with the C=O group, and its bowl-shaped isomer with the O-O moiety is less stable by 279.2 kcal/mol energetically. PSeC has similar electronic and structural features with PSC, but its dimer is predicted to have much better hole mobility, compared to PSC. The present results indicate that the chalcogenide substitution at the periphery of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may remarkably change their electronic and spectroscopic properties as well as the carrier transport behavior of their molecular materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695628>A Single Simulated Heliox Dive Modifies Endothelial Function in the Vascular Wall of ApoE Knockout Male Rats More Than Females.</a></h2><p>The number of divers is rising every year, including an increasing number of aging persons with impaired endothelial function and concomitant atherosclerosis. While diving is an independent modulator of endothelial function, little is known about how diving affects already impaired endothelium. In this study, we questioned whether diving exposure leads to further damage of an already impaired endothelium.A total of 5 male and 5 female ApoE knockout (KO) rats were exposed to simulated diving to an absolute pressure of 600 kPa in heliox gas (80% helium, 20% ) for 1 h in a dry pressure chamber. 10 ApoE KO rats (5 males, 5 females) and 8 male Sprague-Dawley rats served as controls. Endothelial function was examined  by isometric myography of pulmonary and mesenteric arteries. Lipid peroxidation in blood plasma, heart and lung tissue was used as measures of oxidative stress. Expression and phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase were quantified by Western blot.A single simulated dive was found to induce endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary arteries of ApoE KO rats, and this was more profound in male than female rats. Endothelial dysfunction in males was associated with changing in production or bioavailability of NO; while in female pulmonary arteries an imbalance in prostanoid signaling was observed. No effect of diving was found on mesenteric arteries from rats of either sex. Our findings suggest that changes in endothelial dysfunction were specific for pulmonary circulation. In future, human translation of these findings may suggest caution for divers who are elderly or have prior reduced endothelial function.Copyright © 2019 Berenji Ardestani, Matchkov, Eftedal and Pedersen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688648>Baseline and Exercise Predictors of VO2peak in Systolic Heart Failure Patients: Results from SMARTEX-HF.</a></h2><p>To investigate baseline, exercise testing, and exercise training-mediated predictors of change in peak  uptake (VO2peak) from baseline to 12-week follow-up (ΔVO2peak) in a post-hoc analysis from the SMARTEX Heart Failure trial.We studied 215 patients with heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35%, and NYHA class II-III, who were randomized to either supervised high intensity interval training (HIIT) with exercise target intensity 90-95% of peak heart rate (HRpeak), supervised moderate continuous training (MCT) with target intensity 60-70% of HRpeak, or who received a recommendation of regular exercise on their own (RRE). Predictors of ΔVO2peak were assessed in two models; A logistic regression model comparing highest and lowest tertile (baseline parameters) and a multivariate linear regression model (test/training/clinical parameters).The change in VO2peak in response to the interventions (ΔVO2peak) varied substantially, from -8.50 to +11.30 mL·kg·min. Baseline NYHA (class II gave higher odds vs III, odds ratio (OR) 7.1 (2.0, 24.9), p=0.002), LVEF OR per % 1.1 (1.0, 1.2), p = 0.005), age (OR per 10 years 0.5 (0.3, 0.8)), p=0.003) were associated with ΔVO2peak.In the multivariate linear regression, 34% of the variability in [INCREMENT]VO2peak was explained by the increase in exercise training workload, [INCREMENT]HRpeak between baseline and 12-wk post-testing, age, and ever having smoked.Exercise training response (ΔVO2peak) correlated negatively with age, LVEF and NYHA class.

PLAC1 siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation (P < .001), the migration (P < .001) and invasion (P < .001) of trophoblasts, but increased the apoptosis (P = .004 for Swan-71; P = .031 for Jar).The expression of PLAC1 was declined in preeclampsia and this inhibited the function of trophoblast, suggesting PLAC1 may play a role in the development of preeclampsia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696099>Increasing Respiratory Effort With 100%  During Resuscitation of Preterm Rabbits at Birth.</a></h2><p> Spontaneous breathing is essential for successful non-invasive respiratory support delivered by a facemask at birth. As hypoxia is a potent inhibitor of spontaneous breathing, initiating respiratory support with a high fraction of inspired O may reduce the risk of hypoxia and increase respiratory effort at birth.  Preterm rabbit kittens (29 days gestation, term ~32 days) were delivered and randomized to receive continuous positive airway pressure with either 21% ( = 12) or 100% O ( = 8) via a facemask. If apnea occurred, intermittent positive pressure ventilation (iPPV) was applied with either 21% or 100% O in kittens who started in 21% O, and remained at 100% O for kittens who started the experiment in 100% O. Respiratory rate (breaths per minute, bpm) and variability in inter-breath interval (%) were measured from esophageal pressure recordings and functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured from synchrotron phase-contrast X-ray images.  Initially, kittens receiving 21% O had a significantly lower respiratory rate and higher variability in inter-breath interval, indicating a less stable breathing pattern than kittens starting in 100% O [median (IQR) respiratory rate: 16 (4-28) vs. 38 (29-46) bpm,  = 0.001; variability in inter-breath interval: 33.3% (17.2-50.1%) vs. 27.5% (18.6-36.3%),  = 0.009]. Apnea that required iPPV, was more frequently observed in kittens in whom resuscitation was started with 21% compared to 100% O (11/12 vs. 1/8,  = 0.001). After recovering from apnea, respiratory rate was significantly lower and variability in inter-breath interval was significantly higher in kittens who received iPPV with 21% compared to 100% O. FRC was not different between study groups at both timepoints.  Initiating resuscitation with 100% O resulted in increased respiratory activity and stability, thereby reducing the risk of apnea and need for iPPV after birth. Further studies in human preterm infants are mandatory to confirm the benefit of this approach in terms of oxygenation. In addition, the ability to avoid hyperoxia after initiation of resuscitation with 100% , using a titration protocol based on  saturation, needs to be clarified.Copyright © 2019 Dekker, Hooper, Croughan, Crossley, Wallace, McGillick, DeKoninck, Thio, Martherus, Ruben, Roehr, Cramer, Flemmer, Croton, te Pas and Kitchen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690173>Dysregulation of TFEB contributes to Manganese-induced Autophagic Failure and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological and clinical studies have long shown that exposure to high levels of heavy metals are associated with increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. It is widely accepted that autophagic dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders; however, the role of heavy metals in regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy is unclear. Here, we show that manganese (Mn) induces a decline in nuclear localization of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, leading to autophagic dysfunction in astrocytes of mouse striatum. We further show that Mn exposure suppresses autophagic-lysosomal degradation of mitochondria and induces accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria. Activation of autophagy by rapamycin or TFEB overexpression ameliorates Mn-induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and reactive  species (ROS) generation in astrocytes, suggesting a causal relation between autophagic failure and mitochondrial dysfunction in Mn toxicity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Mn inhibits TFEB activity, leading to impaired autophagy that is causally related to mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for Mn in dysregulation of autophagy and identify TFEB as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate Mn toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690614>Long-Term Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation Cough Assistance in Neuromuscular Disease: Patterns of Use and Lessons for Application.</a></h2><p>Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) devices increase expiratory air flow and thereby promote increased cough peak flow (CPF) in conjunction with a cough. There is little research looking at long-term use of MI-E in subjects with neuromuscular disease (NMD), and no long-term study has reported CPF, MI-E device settings, and adherence.We evaluated 181 patient records (130 adults, 51 children) of individuals who received a MI-E device from our center between February 2014 and February 2018. Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 27 (14-51) y. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were the 3 most common diagnoses.MI-E devices were provided to the weakest subjects with a CPF < 160 L/min. Median (IQR) settings were insufflation, 25 (23-30) cm HO, exsufflation -35 (-30 to -40) cm HO, insufflation time 1.5 (1.3-1.7) s, exsufflation time 1.8 (1.5-2.0) s, and pause 1.5 (1.3-2.0) s. The inspiratory flow profile was set to high in all subjects, and no subject used supplemental  with the MI-E device. When comparing insufflation pressures to exsufflation pressures, a greater negative pressure was used relative to positive pressure ( < .001). When comparing insufflation to exsufflation time, there was a significantly longer exsufflation duration ( < .001). Median (IQR) CPF at the start of MI-E was 60 (10-100) L/min. There was no correlation between either insufflation or exsufflation pressures and CPF. Median (IQR) usage for the group was 60% (13.5-100%) of days for the total days. Subjects with tracheostomies or SMA type I had the greatest adherence to treatment. Median (IQR) duration of MI-E use was 17 (8.5-32) months. Ninety-six percent of subjects were receiving ventilatory support.Greater exsufflation pressures than insufflation pressures, together with a shorter insufflation time than exsufflation time, were used. Predicting good adherence among the subjects was difficult.

Insight into factors associated with the pathogenesis of BPD is key to improving its prevention and treatment.To perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression of clinical studies exploring the association between chorioamnionitis (CA) and BPD in preterm infants.PubMed and Embase were searched without language restriction (last search, October 1, 2018). Key search terms included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chorioamnionitis, and risk factors.Included studies were peer-reviewed studies examining preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) or very low-birth-weight (<1500 g) infants and reporting primary data that could be used to measure the association between exposure to CA and the development of BPD.The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline was followed. Data were independently extracted by 2 researchers. A random-effects model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies was studied using multivariate, random-effects metaregression analysis.The primary outcome was BPD, defined as supplemental  requirement on postnatal day 28 (BPD28) or at the postmenstrual age of 36 weeks (BPD36). Covariates considered as potential confounders included differences between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and rates of early- and late-onset sepsis.A total of 3170 potentially relevant studies were found, of which 158 met the inclusion criteria (244 096 preterm infants, 20 971 CA cases, and 24 335 BPD cases). Meta-analysis showed that CA exposure was significantly associated with BPD28 (65 studies; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.88-2.86; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 84%; P < .001) and BPD36 (108 studies; OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 63%; P < .001). The association between CA and BPD remained significant for both clinical and histologic CA. In addition, significant differences were found between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, birth weight, odds of being small for gestational age, exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and early- and late-onset sepsis. Chorioamnionitis was not significantly associated with RDS (48 studies; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.34; P = .24; heterogeneity: I2 = 90%; P < .001), but multivariate metaregression analysis with backward elimination revealed that a model combining the difference in gestational age and the odds of RDS was associated with 64% of the variance in the association between CA and BPD36 across studies.The results of this study confirm that among preterm infants, exposure to CA is associated with a higher risk of developing BPD, but this association may be modulated by gestational age and risk of RDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691326>Pumping new life into old ideas: Preservation and rehabilitation of the liver using ex situ machine perfusion.</a></h2><p>Recent advances in machine perfusion technology have reinvigorated the field of liver transplantation with the possibilities of vastly improving the efficiency and safety of the life-saving procedure.

While venous air embolism is commonly reported, arterial air embolism is rare. Even a minor injury to the chest along with positive-pressure ventilation can cause SAAE. Small amounts of air may cause neurological or cardiac symptoms depending on the affected arteries, while massive embolism can result in fatal cardiovascular collapse. We discuss the various causes of SAAE, including trauma, computed tomography-guided lung biopsy, and various intervention procedures such as mechanical circulatory support device implantation, coronary catheterization, and atrial fibrillation repair. SAAE diagnosis can be overlooked because its symptoms are not specific, and confirmation of the presence of air in the arterial system is difficult. Although computed tomography is the optimal imaging tool for diagnosis, patient instability and resuscitation often precludes its use.

In the past decades, melatonin has been considered to be used in the treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM). This is due to a functional inter-relationship between melatonin and insulin. Elevated oxidative stress is a feature found in DM associated with diabetic neuropathy (DN), retinopathy (DR), nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. Reactive  species (ROS) and nitrogen oxidative species (NOS) are usually produced in massive amounts via glucose and lipid peroxidation, and this leads to diabetic complications. At the molecular level, ROS causes damage to the biomolecules and triggers apoptosis. Melatonin, as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenger, ameliorates oxidative stress caused by ROS and NOS. Besides that, melatonin administration is proven to bring other anti-DM effects such as reducing cellular apoptosis and promoting the production of antioxidants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689144>EFFECTS OF CONDITIONED MEDIA FROM MURINE LUNG CANCER CELLS AND HUMAN TUMOR CELLS ON CULTURED MYOTUBES.</a></h2><p>Factors secreted from tumors/tumor cells are hypothesized to cause skeletal muscle wasting in cancer patients. We examined whether cancer cells secrete factors to promote atrophy by evaluating the effects of conditioned media (CM) from murine lung cancer cells and primary cultures of human lung tumor cells on cultured myotubes. We evaluated murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and KRAS cells, and primary cell lines derived from tumor biopsies from patients with lung cancer (hTCM; n=6). In all experiments, serum content was matched across treatment groups. We hypothesized that CM from murine and human tumor cells would reduce myotube myosin content, decrease mitochondrial content and increase mitochondrial reactive  species production (ROS). Treatment of myotubes differentiated for 7 days with CM from LLC and KRAS cells did not alter any of these variables. Effects of murine tumor cell CM were observed when myotubes differentiated for 4 days were treated with tumor cell CM and compared to undiluted differentiation media. However, these effects were not apparent if tumor cell CM treatments were compared to control cell CM or dilution controls. Finally, CM from human lung tumor primary cell lines did not modify myosin content or mitochondrial content or ROS production compared to either undiluted differentiated media, control cell CM or dilution controls. Our results do not support the hypothesis that factors released from cultured lung cancer/tumor cells promote myotube wasting or mitochondrial abnormalities, but cannot dismiss the possibility that these cells could secrete such factors  within the native tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695223>Aproximación genética en la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica.</a></h2><p>The superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD1) gene is the first responsible gene mapped in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 1 (ALS1), and it codes for the enzyme SOD1, the function of which is to protect against damage mediated by free radicals deriving from . Its pathophysiological mechanism in ALS1 is related to ischemia. Several molecular studies of the SOD1 gene show that point mutations are the most frequent. The most common mutations in familial cases are p.A4V, p.I113Y, p.G37R, p.D90A and p.E100G, which account for more than 80% of cases, although intronic mutations have also been described as responsible for ALS1. Sporadic cases are explained by mutations in other genes such as SETX and C9orf72. ALS1 is a complex disease with genetic heterogeneity. On the other hand, familial and sporadic cases have a different etiology, which is explained by molecular heterogeneity and multiple pathogenic mechanisms that lead to ALS1; oxidative stress and ischemia are not the only cause. In Mexico, ALS molecular genetics studies are scarce. Clinical studies show an increase in cytokines such as adipsin in cerebrospinal fluid.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691131>M1 macrophage dependent-p53 regulates the intracellular survival of mycobacteria.</a></h2><p>Tumor suppressor p53 is not only affects immune responses but also contributes to antibacterial activity. However, its bactericidal function during mycobacterial infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that the p53-deficient macrophages failed to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), manifested as a lower apoptotic cell death rate and enhanced intracellular survival. The expression levels of p53 during Mtb infection were stronger in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages. The TLR2/JNK signaling pathway plays an essential role in the modulation of M1 macrophage polarization upon Mtb infection. It facilitates p53-mediated apoptosis through the production of reactive  species, nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines in Mtb-infected M1 macrophages. In addition, nutlin-3 effectively abrogated the intracellular survival of mycobacteria in both TB patients and healthy controls after H37Ra infection for 24 h, indicating that the enhancement of p53 production effectively suppressed the intracellular survival of Mtb in hosts. These results suggest that p53 can be a new therapeutic target for TB therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687753>Carbon Dioxide Fumigation to Shorten Cold Disinfestation Treatments for Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Citrus Fruit.</a></h2><p>Although elevated levels of carbon dioxide have been used in controlled atmosphere treatments with low  levels for a number of deciduous crops, the use of much higher concentrations of carbon dioxide followed by a short cold treatment for citrus was only suggested as a viable option for disinfestation in 2005. Carbon dioxide alone, for a period of 24 h at concentrations up to 70% in air caused variable levels of mortality of Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) larvae in citrus, but never completely controlled this pest. The susceptibility to carbon dioxide appeared to vary more with the batch of T. leucotreta eggs than with different citrus cultivars. By following CO2 fumigation with a short cold treatment, complete control of this pest was achieved and the results with sequential treatments were more consistent. The efficacy of the combined treatment was reduced when it took ≥12 h to move fruit after fumigation into a cold room at 2°C, or if the temperature was not reduced below 12°C within 24 h after fumigation. In these cases, the benefit of the short cold treatment was lost and mortality was similar to CO2 fumigation alone. These results hold promise for the development of a shorter commercial treatment to meet quarantine restrictions against this pest in citrus.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, studies on the α-hederin that exert biological activities on the cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells are limited. In this study, we evaluated the effects of α-hederin in HGC27/DDP and the potential mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro.HGC27/DDP cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed quantitatively using Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell invasion and migration were detected by Transwell invasion assay and wound healing assay. Cell apoptosis was examined by employing Hoechst 33258 Staining Kit and an Annexin V-PE apoptosis kit. Intracellular GSH levels were examined by using a GSH Assay Kit. DCFH-DA and JC-1 Kit were used to detect levels of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm). The protein levels of Apaf-1, AIF, Bax, Bcl-2, Cyt C, Survivin, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, MMP-9 and MMP-2 were detected by Western blot analysis. The effect of α-hederin in vivo was observed by xenograft tumor models in nude mice.The α-hederin treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner of HGC27/DDP and induced obvious apoptosis compared with the control group (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the ability of cells to invade and migrate was suppressed (P<0.05). The α-hederin induced the depletion of GSH (P<0.05) and the accumulation of intracellular ROS (P<0.05), changed the mitochondrial membrane potential (P<0.05), increased the Bax, Apaf-1, AIF, Cyt C, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 expression and decreased the protein level of Bcl-2, survivin, MMP-9 and MMP-2 (P<0.05). Pretreatment with NAC (12 mM) enhanced the tendency and pretreatment with BSO (8 mM) attenuated the tendency above (P<0.05). Meanwhile, α-hederin inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo (P<0.05).Our study provides strong molecular evidence to support our hypothesis that α-hederin inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HGC27/DDP cells by increasing the levels of intracellular ROS and triggering mitochondrial pathway activation.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693915>Light emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation therapy on murine macrophage exposed to Bothropstoxin-I and Bothropstoxin-II myotoxins.</a></h2><p>The light-emitting diode (LED) is considered a therapeutic tool due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and wound-healing effects, which occur through angiogenesis, decrease in IL-1β and IL-6 secretion, and acceleration of the cicatricial process. Snakebites are an important public health problem in tropical regions of the world. LED treatment is a therapeutic tool associated with serum therapy used to minimize the local effects of snakebites, including decrease in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations, myonecrosis, and inflammatory and haemorrhagic responses. In this study, we analysed the photobiomodulation effect of LED on the activation of murine macrophages induced by BthTX-I or BthTX-II isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom. Photobiomodulation caused an increase in mitochondrial metabolism and a considerable decrease in cytotoxicity in murine macrophages. Moreover, it induced a decrease in reactive  species and nitrogen liberation. However, photobiomodulation caused an increase in macrophage phagocytic capacity and lipid droplet formation. The results of this study corroborated with those of others in an unprecedented way and provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of photobiomodulation, besides offering a coadjuvant action treatment for the local effects of snakebites, not achieved with serum therapy alone.Copyright © 2019.

Similar to many other FPR2 agonistic peptides, nanomolar concentrations of both PSMα2 and PSMα3 activate neutrophils to increase the cytosolic concentration of Ca and release NADPH oxidase-derived reactive  species. In addition, the PSMα peptides induce FPR2 homologous desensitization, actin polymerization, and neutrophil reactivation through a receptor cross-talk mechanism. However, in contrast to conventional FPR2 agonistic peptides, including the host-derived formyl peptide MCT-ND4, we found that the PSMα peptides lacked the ability to recruit β-arrestin and induce neutrophil chemotaxis, supporting the previous notion that β-arrestin translocation is of importance for cell migration. Despite the lack of β-arrestin recruitment, the PSMα peptides induced an FPR2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and internalization. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship analysis with PSMα2 derivatives revealed critical roles of the first 3 aa linked to N-fMet as well as the C terminus of PSMα2 in promoting FPR2 to recruit β-arrestin. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel neutrophil activation pattern upon FPR2 sensing of PSMα peptides, signified by the ability to induce increased intracellular Ca, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, internalization, and NADPH oxidase activity, yet lack of β-arrestin recruitment and neutrophil chemoattraction. These novel features adopted by the PSMα peptides could be of importance for  virulence and might facilitate identification of new therapeutic strategies for treating  infections.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691327>The need for differentiation between ischaemic and non-ischaemic diabetic foot ulcers when treating with hyperbaric  therapy.</a></h2><p>We read with great interest the article by Golledge and Singh [1].

By exploring the role of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and the role of oxidative stress in MC-LR-induced apoptosis in testicular Sertoli cells in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, this study indicated that MC-LR increased the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes by raising the levels of H3K4me3. 5'-Deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), the inhibitor of H3K4me3, reduced apoptosis, indicating for the first time that epigenetic modification is closely related to the testicular reproductive toxicity induced by MC-LR. MC-LR also induced oxidative stress by stimulating the generation of reactive  species (ROS), and subsequently triggering mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing the levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and so on. MC-LR-induced apoptosis of testicular cells could be decreased after pretreatment with oxidative stress inhibitor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, the pathological damage to mitochondria and testes were observed in SD rats. These results show that MC-LR can induce apoptosis by raising the levels of H3K4me3, and pretreatment with MTA can ameliorate the MC-LR-induced apoptosis of cocultured cells by lowering the levels of H3K4me3. Furthermore, NAC has a protective effect on MC-LR-induced apoptosis of testicular cells in SD rats by inhibiting the oxidative stress.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694529>Increase of reactive  species contributes to growth inhibition by fluconazole in Cryptococcus neoformans.</a></h2><p>Cryptococcus neoformans, a basidiomycetous yeast, is a fungal pathogen that can colonize the lungs of humans causing pneumonia and fungal meningitis in severely immunocompromised individuals. Recent studies have implied that the antifungal drug fluconazole (FLC) can induce oxidative stress in C. neoformans by increasing the production of reactive  species (ROS), as presence of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) could reverse the inhibitory effects of FLC on C. neoformans. However, in Candida albicans, AA has been shown to stimulate the expression of genes essential for ergosterol biosynthesis. Hence, the contribution of ROS in FLC-mediated growth inhibition remains unclear.In order to determine whether counteracting ROS generated by FLC in C. neoformans can contribute to diminishing inhibitory effects of FLC, we tested three other antioxidants in addition to AA, namely, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), retinoic acid (RA), and glutathione (GSH). Our data confirm that there is an increase in ROS in the presence of FLC in C. neoformans. Importantly, all four antioxidants reversed FLC-mediated growth inhibition of C. neoformans to various extents. We further verified the involvement of increased ROS in FLC-mediated growth inhibition by determining that ROS-scavenging proteins, metallothioneins (CMT1 and CMT2), contribute to growth recovery by PDTC and AA during treatment with FLC.Our study suggests that ROS contributes to FLC-mediated growth inhibition and points to a complex nature of antioxidant-mediated growth rescue in the presence of FLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692366>Breathing with fins: Do the pectoral fins of larval fishes play a respiratory role?</a></h2><p>Convective water flow across respiratory epithelia in water-breathing organisms maintains transcutaneous  (O) partial pressure (PO) gradients that drive O uptake. Following hatch, larval fishes lack a developed gill and the skin is the dominant site of gas transfer, yet few studies have addressed the contribution of convective water flow to cutaneous O uptake in larvae. We hypothesized that the pectoral fins, which can generate water flow across the skin in larvae, promote transcutaneous O transfer and thus aid in O uptake. In zebrafish (), the frequency of pectoral fin movements increased in response to hypoxia at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf), but the response was blunted by 15 dpf, when the gills become the dominant site of O uptake and was absent by 21 dpf. In rainbow trout (), PO measured at the skin surface of ventilating larvae was lower when the pectoral fins had been surgically removed, directly demonstrating that fins contribute to convective flow that dissipates cutaneous PO boundary layers. Lack of pectoral fins compromised whole animal O consumption in trout during hypoxia, but this effect was absent in zebrafish. Overall, our findings support a respiratory role of the pectoral fins in rainbow trout, but their involvement in zebrafish remains equivocal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696666>Combined effects of growth hormone and testosterone replacement treatment in heart failure.</a></h2><p>Although preliminary studies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness of single replacement therapy for growth hormone deficiency or testosterone deficiency in heart failure (HF), no data are available regarding the combined treatment with both GH and T in this setting. Thus, the aim of the present hypothesis generating pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multiple hormonal replacement therapies in chronic HF.Five stable HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, with a concomitant diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency and testosterone deficiency, on top of guideline-based HF treatment underwent 1 year of GH replacement therapy by subcutaneous injections of somatotropin at a dose of 0.012 mg/kg every second day. After 12 months, a T replacement treatment was added at a dosage of 1000 mg every 3 months. Each patient underwent a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination, and an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at baseline (BL), after 1 year of GH treatment (V1), and after 1 year of combined GH + T treatments (V2). One-year of GH treatment resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+5.4%, P < 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class (P < 0.05), and peak  consumption (VO peak) (+19.3%, P < 0.01), and in a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (-35.1%, P < 0.01). Notably, one additional year of combined GH and T replacement therapy induced a further increase in VO peak (+27.7%, final delta change + 52.44%, P < 0.01), as well as a significant improvement in muscular strength, as assessed by handgrip dynamometry (+17.5%, final delta change + 25.8%, P < 0.01). These beneficial effects were paralleled with an improvement of the overall clinical status (as assessed by New York Heart Association class). Of note, neither adverse effects nor cardiovascular events were reported during the follow-up period.Our preliminary data suggest for the first time that combined replacement therapy with GH and T could be considered safe and therapeutic in HF patients with multiple hormone deficiencies, supporting the hypothesis that multiple hormone deficiencies syndrome can be considered as a novel and promising therapeutic target in HF.

Xanthine oxidase-derived ROS increased parasite-induced cytokine secretion and CD80 surface expression in DCs. This enhanced maturation phenotype boosted the DCs' ability to prime autologous naive CD4 T cells, resulting in higher T cell proliferation in vitro. Xanthine oxidase-derived ROS did not have an effect on the cytokines produced by primed T cells. We propose that oxidative stress during malaria contributes to the inflammatory response by enhancing the magnitude of DC and CD4 T cell responses without changing the quality.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689626>Solution equilibrium, structural and cytotoxicity studies on Ru(η-p-cymene) and copper complexes of pyrazolyl thiosemicarbazones.</a></h2><p>Solution chemical properties of two bidentate pyrazolyl thiosemicarbazones 2-((3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide (Me-pyrTSC), 2-((1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide (Ph-pyrTSC), stability of their Cu(II) and Ru(η-p-cymene) complexes were characterized in aqueous solution (with 30% DMSO) by the combined use of UV-visible spectrophotometry, H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in addition to their solid phase isolation. The solid phase structures of Me-pyrTSC∙HO, [Ru(η-p-cymene)(Me-pyrTSC)Cl]Cl and [Cu(Ph-pyrTSCH)] were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. High stability mononuclear Ru(η-p-cymene) complexes with (N,S) coordination mode are formed in the acidic pH range, and increasing the pH the predominating dinuclear [(Ru(η-p-cymene))(L)] complex with μ-bridging sulphur donor atoms is formed (where L is the deprotonated thiosemicarbazone). [CuL] and [CuL] complexes show much higher stability compared to that of complexes of the reference compound benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone. [CuL] complexes predominate at neutral pH. Me-pyrTSC and Ph-pyrTSC exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines (IC = 33-76 μM), while their complexation with Ru(η-p-cymene) (IC = 11-24 μM) and especially Cu(II) (IC = 3-6 μM) resulted in higher cytotoxicity. Cu(II) complexes of the tested thiosemicarbazones were also cytotoxic in three breast cancer and in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.

Despite these therapeutic interventions, 40% of patients relapse, urging the need for more effective therapies. In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a light-activated photosensitizer produces reactive  species that ultimately lead to cell death. Targeted PDT, using a photosensitizer conjugated to tumor-targeting molecules, has been explored as a more selective cancer therapy. Organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional structures that can be grown from both normal and tumor patient-material and have recently shown translational potential. Here, we explore the potential of a recently described HNSCC-organoid model to evaluate Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-targeted PDT, through either antibody- or nanobody-photosensitizer conjugates. We find that EGFR expression levels differ between organoids derived from different donors, and recapitulate EGFR expression levels of patient material. EGFR expression levels were found to correlate with the response to EGFR-targeted PDT. Importantly, organoids grown from surrounding normal tissues showed lower EGFR expression levels than their tumor counterparts, and were not affected by the treatment. In general, nanobody-targeted PDT was more effective than antibody-targeted PDT.

Recently, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) induction has been found to render lung adenocarcinomas resistant to EGFR-TKIs, and targeting ALDH1A1 becomes a novel strategy to overcome resistance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying such effect remains poorly understood.  Comprehensive assays were performed in a panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and xenografts that acquired resistance to erlotinib. Cancer phenotype was evaluated by cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition analysis , tumorsphere formation analysis , and tumor growth and dissemination analysis . Reactive  species (ROS) and reactive carbonyl species (RCS) were detected based on fluorescent oxidation indicator and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, respectively. Protein target was suppressed by RNA interference and pharmacological inhibition or ecto-overexpressed by lentivirus-based cloning. Gene promoter activity was measured by dual-luciferase reporting assay.  Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ALDH1A1 overcame erlotinib resistance  and . ALDH1A1 overexpression was sufficient to induce erlotinib resistance. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated lower ROS-RCS levels in ALDH1A1-addicted, erlotinib-resistant cells; in line with this, key enzymes for metabolizing ROS and RCS, SOD2 and GPX4, respectively, were upregulated in these cells. Knockdown of SOD2 or GPX4 re-sensitized the resistant cells to erlotinib and the effect was abrogated by ROS-RCS scavenging and mimicked by ROS-RCS induction. The ALDH1A1 overexpressed cells, though resisted erlotinib, were more sensitive to SOD2 or GPX4 knockdown. The ALDH1A1 effect on erlotinib resistance was abrogated by ROS-RCS induction and mimicked by ROS-RCS scavenging. Detection of GPX4 and SOD2 expression and analysis of promoter activities of GPX4 and SOD2 under the condition of suppression or overexpression of ALDH1A1 demonstrated that the RCS-ROS-metabolic pathway was controlled by the ALDH1A1-GPX4-SOD2 axis. The ROS-RCS metabolic dependence mechanism in ALDH1A1-induced resistance was confirmed . Analysis of public databases showed that in patients undergoing chemotherapy, those with high co-expression of ALDH1A1, GPX4, and SOD2 had a lower probability of survival.  ALDH1A1 confers erlotinib resistance by facilitating the ROS-RCS metabolic pathway. ALDH1A1-induced upregulation of SOD2 and GPX4, as well as ALDH1A1 itself, mitigated erlotinib-induced oxidative and carbonyl stress, and imparted the TKI resistance. The elucidation of previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism underlying erlotinib resistance provides new insight into the biology of molecular targeted therapies and help to design improved pharmacological strategies to overcome the drug resistance.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692987>Regulation of Nrf2 Signaling.</a></h2><p>Regulation of antioxidant gene expression is essential for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining physiological homeostasis.

Nrf2 activity is subjected to the regulation at various levels including protein stability, transcription, and post-transcription. Among the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 axis is the most prominent regulator of Nrf2 activity.

The line 722HA has great potential for hybrid breeding in kenaf. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls pollen abortion in 722HA remains unclear, thus limiting the full utilization of this line. To understand the possible mechanism governing pollen abortion in 722HA, cytological, transcriptomic, and biochemical analyses were carried out to compare the CMS line 722HA and its maintainer line 722HB. Cytological observations of the microspore development revealed premature degradation of the tapetum at the mononuclear stage, which resulted in pollen dysfunction. The k-means clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that these genes are related to processes associated with the accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), including electron transport chain, FF-ATPase proton transport, positive regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), hydrogen peroxide catabolic, and oxidation-reduction. Biochemical analysis indicated that ROS-scavenging capability was lower in 722HA than in 722HB, resulting in an accumulation of excess ROS, which is consistent with the transcriptome results. Taken together, these results demonstrate that excessive ROS accumulation may affect the normal development of microspores.

However, insufficient penetration depth, tumor hypoxia, and a single treatment method severely limit the effectiveness of treatment.  In this study, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform has been fabricated based on Au/Ag-MnO hollow nanospheres (AAM HNSs). The Au/Ag alloy HNSs were first synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction and then the MnO nanoparticles were deposited on the Au/Ag alloy HNSs by the reaction between Ag and permanganate (KMnO), finally obtained the AAM HNSs. Then, SH-PEG was modified on the surface of AAM HNSs by the interaction of sulfhydryl and Au/Ag alloy, which improved the dispersibility and biocompatibility of the HNS. Next, the PDT photosensitizer Ce6 was loaded into AAM HNSs, benefiting from the hollow interior of the structure, and the AAM-Ce6 HNSs were obtained.  The AAM HNSs exhibit broad absorption at the near infrared (NIR) biological window and remarkable photothermal conversion ability in the NIR-II window. The MnO nanoparticles can catalyze endogenous HO to generate O and enhance the therapeutic effect of PDT on tumor tissue. Simultaneously, MnO nanoparticles intelligently respond to the tumor microenvironment and degrade to release massive Mn ions, which introduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties. When AAM-Ce6 HNSs are loaded with Ce6, the AAM-Ce6 HNSs can be used for triple-modal imaging (fluorescence/photoacoustic/magnetic resonance imaging, FL/PAI/MRI) guided combination tumor phototherapy (PTT/PDT).  This multifunctional nanoplatform shows synergistic therapeutic efficacy better than any single therapy by achieving multimodal imaging guided cancer combination phototherapy, which are promising for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692944>Potential for therapeutic use of hydrogen sulfide in oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h2><p>Oxidative phosphorylation is a source of energy production by which many cells satisfy their energy requirements. Endogenous reactive  species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial metabolism. Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696129>Reperfusion Microvascular Ischemia After Prolonged Coronary Occlusion: Implications And Treatment With Local Supersaturated  Delivery.</a></h2><p>Following a prolonged coronary arterial occlusion, heterogeneously scattered, focal regions of low erythrocyte flow are commonly found throughout the reperfused myocardium. Experimental studies have also demonstrated the presence of widespread, focally patchy regions of microvascular ischemia during reperfusion (RMI). However, the potential contribution of RMI to tissue viability and function has received little attention in the absence of practical clinical methods for its detection. In this review, the anatomic/functional basis of RMI is summarized, along with the evidence for its presence in reperfused myocardium. Advances in microcirculation research related to obstructive responses of vascular endothelial cells and blood elements to the effects of hypoxia and low shear stress are discussed, and a potential cycle of intensification of RMI from such responses and progressive loss of functional capillary density is presented. In capillaries with impaired erythrocyte flow, compensatory increases in the delivery of , because of its low solubility in plasma, are effective only at high partial pressures. As discussed herein, attenuation of the cycle with  at hyperbaric levels in plasma is, very likely, responsible for improved tissue level perfusion noted experimentally. Observed clinical benefits from intracoronary SuperSaturated  (SSO) delivery, including infarct size reduction, can be attributed to attenuation of RMI with improvement in microvascular blood flow.© 2019 Spears.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696673>Oxidative Cyclization-Induced Activation of a Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Inhibitor for Enhanced Selectivity of Cancer Chemotherapeutics.</a></h2><p>In this work, we designed a prodrug that reacts with cellular oxidative equivalents leading to ether cleavage and cyclization to release an active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. We show that the compound reduces affinity for PI3KA relative to the PI3K inhibitor, is slow to intercellularly oxidize, and is resistant to liver microsomes. We observed modest activity in untreated acute myeloid leukemia cells and 14-fold selectivity relative to non-cancerous cells. The cellular activity of the compound can be modulated by the addition of antioxidants or oxidants, indicating the compound activity is sensitive to cellular reactive  species (ROS) state. Co-treatment with cytosine arabinoside or doxorubicin was used to activate the compound inside cells. We observed strong synergistic activity specifically in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cancer cells with an increase in selective anticancer activity of up to 90-fold. Thus, these new self-cyclizing compounds can be used to increase the selectivity of anticancer agents.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Trauma to the vaginal vasculature might limit the delivery of  to the surgical wound, which may negatively affect wound healing and regeneration of connective tissue. This possibly increases the future risk of recurrence. We aimed to determine the effects of vaginal prolapse surgery on the microcirculation of the vaginal wall.We evaluated the vaginal microcirculation in healthy participants without known vascular disease undergoing anterior and/or posterior colporrhaphy. We used incident dark-field imaging for in vivo assessment before and after (1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks) surgery. We studied perfusion (microvascular flow index [MFI]), angioarchitecture (morphology/layout of microvessels) and capillary density.Ten women were included. Interindividual differences were observed 1 day postoperatively with regard to perfusion and angioarchitecture. Microvascular flow at the surgical site was absent or significantly reduced in some participants, whereas normal microvascular flow was observed in others (MFI range 0-3). Perfusion and angioarchitecture had been restored in all participants after 6 weeks (MFI range 2-3), regardless of the extent of vascular trauma 1 day postoperatively.The difference in the extent of vascular trauma between women undergoing seemingly identical surgical procedures suggests that some individuals are more susceptible to vascular trauma than others. Delivery of  to the wound and subsequent wound healing may be compromised in these cases, which could be related to the development of anatomical recurrence. Future studies should investigate whether there is a relationship between the vaginal microvasculature and the recurrence of prolapse.© 2019 The Authors.

These complexes were characterized by NMR, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, while their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In all these complexes, 1,5-naph acts as a bridging ligand between two Ag(I) ions, while the remaining coordination sites are occupied by  atom(s) of the corresponding anion. The antimicrobial efficiency of these silver(I) complexes was evaluated against the broad panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The complexes showed good to moderate antibacterial activity with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values being in the range 2.5-100 μg/mL (6.5-333.3 μM), while their antifungal activity against the investigated Candida spp. was significantly higher (MIC = 0.78-6.25 μg/mL; 2.6-20.8 μM). Moreover, complexes Ag1 and Ag2 effectively inhibited C. albicans biofilms formation, while Ag1 was also shown to inhibit the formation of mixed C. albicans/Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Toxicological evaluations on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos revealed that all silver(I) complexes could be applied as antifungal agents, whereas Ag3 had the best therapeutic potential showing both the lowest MIC values against the tested Candida strains and the non-toxic in vivo response in the zebrafish embryos at these doses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Over the past few decades, flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs), characterized by their extremely high theoretical energy density from consuming  in air and low cost, have been regarded as one of the most promising power supplies. However, their unique half-open structure poses great challenges for the environmental stability of their components, including the electrolyte and electrodes. As an important ionic conductor, the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-KOH gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) has been widely utilized in FZABs. To date, most studies have focused on investigations of the electrode, electrocatalyst materials and battery configuration, while very few have paid attention to the influence of the environment on the electrolyte and the corresponding FZAB performance. Herein, for the first time, the environmental stability of PVA-KOH GPE, such as dimensional stability and water and ionic conductivity retention capability, for FZABs in ambient air has been thoroughly studied. Moreover, the properties of the assembled FZABs in terms of cycling stability, discharge performance and power output are investigated. This report aims to play a leading role in examining the environmental stability of electrolytes in FZABs, which is critical for their practical applications.Copyright © 2019 Fan, Liu, Ding, Deng, Han, Hu and Zhong.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695422>Methyloleanolate Induces Apoptotic And Autophagic Cell Death Via Reactive  Species Generation And c-Jun N-terminal Kinase Phosphorylation.</a></h2><p>To develop a potent anticancer agent similar to oleanolate, the underlying mechanisms of its derivative, methyloleanolate, in the apoptosis and autophagy of A549 and H1299 cells were elucidated.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of methyloleanolate in inducing apoptotic and autophagic cell death in cancer cells.Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V/PI staining, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted in A549 and H1299 cells.Methyloleanolate increased the fraction of Annexin V/PI apoptotic cells and activated caspase-8, caspase-3, and death receptor 5 (DR5) more than oleanolate in A549 and H1299 cells pretreated with pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and DR5 depletion. Also, methyloleanolate induced autophagic features of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 3BII (LC3BII) conversion and puncta in A549 and H1299 cells, along with autophagosomes and vacuoles. Methyloleanolate blocked autophagy flux for impaired autophagy and chloroquine (CQ)-enhanced microtubule-associated protein LC3BII accumulation and cytotoxicity in A549 and H1299 cells, although 3-methyladenine (3-MA) did not. Interestingly, LC3BII accumulation was detected only in methyloleanolate-treated autophagy-related gene 5 () mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells but not in   MEF cells.

Despite intervention programs designed to face a clinical status may last several months, no longitudinal studies have compared the effect of NW to another usual form of exercise, like walking (W). We evaluated the effects of diet combined with a long-supervised NW versus W training on body composition, aerobic capacity and strength in overweight adults.Thirty-eight participants, randomized into a NW (n=19, 66±7 years, body mass index (BMI) 33±5)) and a W (n=19, 66±8 years, BMI 32±5) group, followed a diet and a supervised training routine 3 times/week for 6 months. The variables assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months were: anthropometric indexes (ie, BMI and waist circumference (WC)), body composition, aerobic capacity ( consumption (VO), peak power output (PPO), 6-min walking test (6MWT)) and strength (maximal voluntary contraction of biceps brachialis (MVC) and quadriceps femoris (MVC), chair stand and arm curl (AC)).After 6 months both NW and W group decreased significantly BMI (6% and 4%, respectively) and WC (8% and 4%, respectively), but only the NW group reduced (<0.05) total body fat (8%), android fat (14%) and leg fat (9%). After 6 months, PPO increased (<0.05) in both groups, but VO improved (<0.05) only in the NW group (8%). After 6 months, 6MWT increased (<0.001) in both groups and only the NW group improved (<0.05) in MVC (14%), MVC (17%) and AC (35%).Our results suggest that NW can give in some relevant health parameters, greater and faster benefits than W.

A01 laccase: thermostable, detergent resistant, anti-environmental and industrial pollutants enzyme.</a></h2><p>Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2; benzenediol;  oxidoreductases) is a multi-copper oxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of phenols, polyphenols, aromatic amines, and different non-phenolic substrates with concomitant reduction of O to HO. Enzymatic oxidation techniques have the potential of implementation in different areas of industrial fields. In this study, the  sp. A01 laccase gene was cloned into pET-26 (b+) vector and was transformed to  BL21. Then it was purified using His tag affinity (Ni sepharose resin) chromatography. The estimated molecular weight was approximately 60 kDa using SDS-PAGE. The highest enzyme activity and best pH for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) oxidation were recorded as 8 at 90 °C respectively. The calculated half-life and kinetic values including K, V, turn over number (k), and catalytic efficiency (k/K) of the enzyme were 106 min at 90 °C and 686 μM, 10.69 U/ml, 20.3 S, and 0.029 s μM, respectively. The DMP was available as the substrate in all the calculations. Enzyme activity enhanced in the presence of Cu, NaCl, SDS, n-hexane, Triton X-100, tween 20, and tween 80, significantly. The binding residues were predicted and mapped upon the modeled tertiary structure of identified laccase. The remaining activity and structural properties of  sp. A01 laccase in extreme conditions such as high temperatures and presence of metals, detergents, and organic solvents suggest the potential of this enzyme in biotechnological and industrial applications.

The aim of the present study was to determine the importance of brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT) NAD metabolism in regulating whole-body thermogenesis and energy metabolism. Accordingly, we generated and analyzed adipocyte-specific nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase () knockout (ANKO) and brown adipocyte-specific  knockout (BANKO) mice because NAMPT is the rate-limiting NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We found ANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in both BAT and WAT, had impaired gene programs involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function in BAT and a blunted thermogenic (rectal temperature, BAT temperature, and whole-body  consumption) response to acute cold exposure, prolonged fasting, and administration of β-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and CL-316243). In addition, the absence of NAMPT in WAT markedly reduced adrenergic-mediated lipolytic activity, likely through inactivation of the NAD-SIRT1-caveolin-1 axis, which limits an important fuel source fatty acid for BAT thermogenesis. These metabolic abnormalities were rescued by treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which bypasses the block in NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT deficiency. Although BANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in BAT only, had BAT cellular alterations similar to the ANKO mice, BANKO mice had normal thermogenic and lipolytic responses. We also found  expression in supraclavicular adipose tissue (where human BAT is localized) obtained from human subjects increased during cold exposure, suggesting our finding in rodents could apply to people. These results demonstrate that adipose NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis is essential for regulating adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis, and whole-body energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694310>Clinical Response to Personalized Exercise Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Reduced Ejection Fraction is Accompanied by Skeletal Muscle Histological Alterations.</a></h2><p> Heart failure (HF) is associated with skeletal muscle wasting and exercise intolerance. This study aimed to evaluate the exercise-induced clinical response and histological alterations. One hundred and forty-four HF patients were enrolled. The individual training program was determined as a workload at or close to the lactate threshold (LT1); clinical data were collected before and after 12 weeks/6 months of training. The muscle biopsies from eight patients were taken before and after 12 weeks of training: histology analysis was used to evaluate muscle morphology. Most of the patients demonstrated a positive response after 12 weeks of the physical rehabilitation program in one or several parameters tested, and 30% of those showed improvement in all four of the following parameters:  uptake (VO2) peak, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), exercise tolerance (ET), and quality of life (QOL); the walking speed at LT1 after six months of training showed a significant rise. Along with clinical response, the histological analysis detected a small but significant decrease in both fiber and endomysium thickness after the exercise training course indicating the stabilization of muscle mechanotransduction system. Together, our data show that the beneficial effect of personalized exercise therapy in HF patients depends, at least in part, on the improvement in skeletal muscle physiological and biochemical performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692991>Preparation of a Novel Phosphorus-Nitrogen Containing Novolac Curing Agent for Epoxy Resin and flame-retardancy of its cured epoxy resin.</a></h2><p>In this study, DICY (dicyandiamide)-containing novolac (NN) was first prepared, and then DOPO (9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide) was introduced to react with the unsaturated bonds from DICY to obtain a novel phosphorus-nitrogen-containing novolac resin (PNN), which was used as a curing agent for epoxy resins.

Cisplatin (CisPt) is a very common chemotherapeutic agent to treat cancer by reestablishing apoptotic mechanisms of cell death. However, certain patients acquire resistance to CisPt as well as suffer nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting. The synthesis of new Pt(II) compounds represents an alternative to CisPt to avoid resistance and undesirable side effects. Pd(II) could be a Pt(II) surrogate given the similarity of coordination chemistry between them, thus widening the spectra of available anticancer drugs. Herein, we have synthesized and characterized two Pt(II) or Pd(II) complexes with TdTn (2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)imino-N-(2-thiazolin-2-yl)thiazolidine), a thiazoline derivative ligand, with formula [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)]. The potential anticancer ability was evaluated in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 and human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cell lines. To that aim, U-937 and HT-29 cells were treated with TdTn, [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)] for 24 h. The microscopy monitoring indicated that TdTn, [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)] arrested the cell proliferation of U-937 and HT-29 cells with respect to control, in agreement with MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) analysis. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the ligand by its own showed antiproliferative effects in both cell lines. [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)] caused caspase-3 activation in U-937 cells, simultaneously with caspase-9 activation due to complexes; however, in HT-29 caspase-3 activation occurred simultaneously with caspase-8 activation induced by the ligand TdTn. Only metal complexes were able to induce ROS (Reactive  Species) generation in U-937 cells, but not TdTn.

This afferent information is critical for the short-term regulation of arterial blood pressure and the buffering of emotional and physical stressors. Glossopharyngeal afferents supply the medulla with continuous mechanoreceptive signals from baroreceptors at the carotid sinus. Vagal afferents ascending from the heart supply mechanoreceptive signals from baroreceptors in different reflexogenic areas including the aortic arch, atria, ventricles, and pulmonary arteries. Ultimately, afferent information from each of these distinct pressure/volume baroreceptors is all relayed to the nucleus tractus solitarius, integrated within the medulla, and used to rapidly adjust sympathetic and parasympathetic activity back to the periphery. Lesions that selectively destroy the afferent fibers of the vagus and/or glossopharyngeal nerves can interrupt the transmission of baroreceptor signaling, leading to extreme blood pressure fluctuations. Vagal efferent neurons project back to the heart to provide parasympathetic cholinergic inputs. When activated, they trigger profound bradycardia, reduce myocardial  demands, and inhibit acute inflammation. Impairment of the efferent vagal fibers seems to play a role in stress-induced neurogenic heart disease (i.e., takotsubo cardiomyopathy). This focused review describes: (1) the importance of the vagus and glossopharyngeal afferent neurons in regulating arterial blood pressure and heart rate, (2) how best to assess afferent and efferent cardiac vagal function in the laboratory, and (3) two clinical phenotypes that arise when the vagal and/or glossopharyngeal nerves do not survive development or are functionally impaired.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695621>Two Weeks of High-Intensity Interval Training in Combination With a Non-thermal Diffuse Ultrasound Device Improves Lipid Profile and Reduces Body Fat Percentage in Overweight Women.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative strategy which combined low-frequency ultra sound (LOFU) with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve physical fitness and promote body fat loss in overweight sedentary women. A placebo controlled, parallel group randomized experimental design was used to investigate the efficacy of a 2-week combined LOFU and HIIT program (3 sessions per week). Participants were allocated into either the Experimental HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10) or Placebo HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10). Baseline exercise testing (maximal  uptake, lower limb strength and substrate oxidation test), dietary assessment, anthropometric measures and blood sampling were completed in week 1 and repeated in week 4 to determine changes following the program (Post-HIIT). During each training session, the HIIT and HIIT groups wore a non-thermal diffuse ultrasound belt. However, the belt was only switched on for the HIIT group. Delta change scores were calculated for body weight, body fat percentage (Fat%), muscle mass,  O , hip and waist circumferences, and all lipid variables from Baseline to Post-HIIT. Statistical analysis was completed using a repeated-measures factorial analysis of variance by group (HIIT and HIIT) and time (Baseline and Post-HIIT).

Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes have been demonstrated as the potential anticancer agents, however, their antitumor efficacies against GSCs are still unknown.

Moreover, Ir1 and Ir2 can destroy the GSCs self-renewal and unlimited proliferation capacity by affecting the GSCs colony formation.

This study examines singlet  (1O2) production and release by PoP liposomes carrying either no chemotherapeutic cargo (EMPTY), or those carrying either doxorubicin (DOX) or irinotecan (IRT) chemotherapy drugs. Herein, we developed a strategy to quantify the fraction of 1O2 lifetime spent in the three distinct local liposomal environments by obtaining four key pieces of information for each system: average 1O2 deactivation rate constants (kΔ) for liposome suspensions in H2O and in D2O solvents, as well as the absolute and the apparent 1O2 production quantum yields (ΦΔ). Despite the characteristic differences in their photophysical behavior, namely in ΦΔ values, all three formulations of PoP liposomes were found to carry out 1O2 release in a similar manner. It was found that >80% of all sensitized 1O2 from the ensemble of PoP liposomes deactivates within the nanostructures themselves, with the largest portion (∼50%) deactivating in the lipid membrane specifically. Based on these findings, we conclude that the current design of the PoP liposomes is well suited for light-induced chemotherapeutic drug release. Importantly, the 1O2 partition quantification approach reported herein has potential to be a tool for characterizing nanoparticulate light-activated chemo- and phototherapeutic systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689938>Nanocomposites SnO/SiO:SiO Impact on the Active Centers and Conductivity Mechanism.</a></h2><p>This paper is focused on the effect of the stabilizing component SiO on the type and concentration of active sites in SnO/SiO nanocomposites compared with nanocrystalline SnO.

Nanocomposites SnO/SiO synthesized using the hydrothermal method were characterized by low temperature nitrogen adsorption, XRD, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermo-programmed reduction with hydrogen (TPR-H), IR-, and electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-spectroscopy methods.

The introduction of SiO results in an increase in the concentration of paramagnetic centers Sn and the amount of surface hydroxyl groups and chemisorbed  and leads to a decrease in the negative charge on chemisorbed  species. The temperature dependences of the conductivity of SnO and SnO/SiO nanocomposites are linearized in Mott coordinates, which may indicate the contribution of the hopping mechanism with a variable hopping distance over local states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692317>Elucidating the Dynamic Nature of Fuel Cell Electrodes as a Function of Conditioning: An Ex-situ Materials Characterization and In-situ Electrochemical Diagnostic Study.</a></h2><p>To increase the commercialization of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), it is imperative to improve the activity and performance of electrocatalysts through combined efforts focused on materials characterization and device level integration. Obtaining fundamental insights into the ongoing structural and compositional changes of electrocatalysts in-operando is crucial for not only transitioning an electrode from its as-prepared to functional state, also known as "conditioning"- but also for establishing intrinsic electrochemical performances . Here, we investigated several ORR electrocatalysts in-operando via in situ and ex situ characterization techniques to provide fundamental insights into the interfacial phenomena occurring on the catalyst surface that enable peak  reduction reaction mass activity and high current density performance. A mechanistic understanding of a fuel cell conditioning procedure is described - which encompasses voltage cycling and subsequent voltage recovery steps at low potential holds performed at a relative humidity above saturation). In particular, Ex situ MEA characterization using transmission electron microscopy and Ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) were performed for determining changes in carbon and Pt particle size, morphology and surface impurities, and In situ electrochemical diagnostics were performed either during or after specific points in the testing protocol to determine the electrochemical and interfacial changes occurring on the catalyst surface responsible for  transport resistances through ionomer films during operation. The results demonstrate that voltage cycling (break-in) step aids in the removal of sulfate and fluoride and reduces non-Fickian  transport resistances, especially for catalysts where Pt is located within the pores of the carbon support. Subsequent low voltage holds at low temperature and oversaturated conditions, i.e. voltage recovery (VR) cycles, serve to improve mass activities by a factor of two to three, through a combined removal of contaminants, surface-blocking species (i.e. oxides), and rearrangement of the catalyst atomic structure (i.e., Pt-Pt and Pt-Co coordination).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689131>Protective effect of nitronyl nitroxide against hypoxia induced damage in PC12 cells.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia induces cellular oxidative stress that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. 4'-hydroxyl-2-subsitiuted phenyl nitronyl nitroxide (HPN), a stable nitronyl nitroxide, shows excellent free radical scavenge activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of HPN on hypoxia-induced damage in PC12 cell. It was shown that HPN significantly attenuated hypoxia induced loss of cell viability, LDH release and morphological changes of PC12 cell. Moreover, hypoxic PC12 cells had an elevation in reactive  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, but a reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), while HPN could reverse these changes. HPN also inhibited hypoxia induced cell apoptosis via suppressing Bax, cytochrome C and caspase-3 expression and inducing Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that the protection of HPN on hypoxia-induced damage in PC12 cells is associated with its suppression on hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. HPN could be a promising candidate in the development of a novel neuroprotective agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695732>Anaemia and transfusion triggers in critically ill patients - What we have learnt thus far.</a></h2><p>Anaemia is a common finding in critically ill patients, the cause of which is multi-factorial including: sepsis, haemolysis (and disseminated intravascular coagulation), iatrogenic blood loss secondary to laboratory sampling, post-operative anaemia, bone marrow suppression/failure, decreased production of erythropoietin, anaemia secondary to drugs/toxins, overt or occult blood loss, functional iron deficiency, poor nutrition and haemodilution. Anaemia is associated with deleterious outcomes including increased risk of cardiac-related morbidity and mortality and decrease in -carrying capacity in the face of increased metabolic demands. There is a growing body of evidence, which demonstrates that packed red blood cell transfusions are associated with poorer outcomes. Clinicians therefore need to weigh the potential benefit of treating anaemia against the desire to avoid unnecessary transfusions. We explored current literature regarding transfusion triggers and morbidity and mortality associated with packed red blood cell transfusions transfusion, concentrating on studies that have been conducted in critical care patients. In addition, we reflected on trials which considered the viability of iron transfusion and erythropoietin in critically unwell patients.© The Intensive Care Society 2018.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688979>Interfacial Engineering FeOOH/CoO Nanoneedle Array for Efficient Overall Water Splitting Driven by Solar Energy.</a></h2><p>Interface engineering has been applied as an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance because of the strong coupling and synergistic effects between individual components.

The synthesized FeOOH/CoO exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and  evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. For the overall water splitting, the bifunctional FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle catalyst requires only a cell voltage of 1.58 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , which is much lower than that required for IrO 2 //Pt/C (1.68 V).

Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut microbiota and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells. The imbalance of factors promoting or blunting endothelial cell viability and function and angiogenesis seems to be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the circulating factors identified to date, either directly produced by gut microbes or resulting from the metabolism of diet derivatives as polyphenols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693801>Cigarette smoke extract inhibits cell migration and contraction via the reactive  species/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway in nasal fibroblasts.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast migration plays a significant role in wound healing after endoscopic sinonasal surgery. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is a potent inhibitor of fibroblast functions including cell proliferation and migration. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of CSE on migration and collagen gel contraction in nasal fibroblasts and investigate its underlying mechanisms.Fibroblast migration was evaluated using wound healing assay and transwell migration assay. Contractile activity was assessed by collagen gel contraction assay. Reactive  species (ROS) were quantified by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Fibroblasts were treated with CSE and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), metformin, compound C, or transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression. AMPK activation was determined by Western blot.CSE and metformin were found to significantly reduce the migration and collagen gel contraction activity of nasal fibroblasts. Conversely, pretreatment with NAC and compound C significantly enhanced the migration and collagen gel contraction activity of fibroblasts. ROS production and AMPK phosphorylation were found to be significantly induced by CSE treatment, whereas the activity was inhibited on treatment with NAC, metformin, compound C, or AMPK siRNA. Silencing of AMPK expression was found to significantly reverse the suppressive effect of CSE in nasal fibroblasts.CSE has an inhibitory effect on cell migration and collagen gel contraction activity via the ROS/AMPK signaling pathway in nasal fibroblasts.© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691623>Video-assisted thoracoscopic total thymectomy: two-lung ventilation with artificial pneumothorax.</a></h2><p> Double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLET) and one-lung ventilation (OLV) have been generally accepted as the classic anesthetic method in video-assisted thoracoscopic total thymectomy (VATT). However, there are still some disadvantages of DLET. Two-lung ventilation (TLV) with single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLET) is considered to be an alternative in VATT to avoid these disadvantages. This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of TLV in VATT by comparing it with OLV cases. We retrospectively screened 198 patients who received TLV unilateral thoracic incision VATT and 117 patients who received OLV unilateral thoracic incision VATT. Perioperative data were analyzed, including surgical variables, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, and postoperative complications and hospital stay. No significant differences with regard to operative time ( = .146), postoperative hospital stay ( = .553), complications ( = .254), hemodynamic parameters and pulse  saturation (SpO) were found between TLV group and OLV group. However, end-tidal CO (EtCO) was higher in TLV group at 15 min (39.95 ± 5.03 vs 38.70 ± 4.57,  = .021) and 30 min (41.91 ± 5.50 vs 38.91 ± 4.51,  < .001) after initiation of the operation.

Ginger plants were grown in soil containing 500 mg/kg Pb(NO) without (CK) or with Si, Se, or microorganism fertilizer (T1, T2, T3) as soil conditioners. Morphology indexes, Pb accumulation and distribution rates, and antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated. The Pb transfer and Pb absorption coefficients were calculated, and Pb accumulation in plant organs at various developmental stages were determined. All three soil conditioners alleviated Pb stress in ginger plants. The rhizome fresh weight in T1, T2, and T3 was increased by 96.06, 85.81, and 41.58%, respectively, compared with CK. The accumulation of Pb in organs was lower in all treatments than in CK. The chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in leaves, and root activity, root length, and the tolerance index, were higher in the treatments than in CK. The reactive  species content in ginger leaves and roots was significantly lower in all treatments than in CK. Soil conditioners alleviated the negative effects of Pb stress on ginger plants: Si was the most effective, followed by Se, and then the microorganism fertilizer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This study retrospectively reviews our experience with surgery in adult patients with FSV.From January 2008 to September 2017, 65 adult patients with FSV underwent surgery in our hospital. Twenty underwent Blalock-Taussig shunt or bidirectional Glenn procedures in other hospitals prior, and four were lost to follow-up. Finally, 41 patients were included in this study.The early postoperative mortality was 7.3% (3/41). Postoperative systemic arterial  saturation (SpO , 83.7% ± 4.8%) was significantly higher than preoperative SpO (77.9% ± 10.1%, P < .01). The mean follow-up time was 3.9 ± 3.1 years (range 1-11 years). There was only one case of late mortality and massive hemoptysis was the cause of death. Right ventricular morphology and severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) were the risk factors of postoperative death for patients with pulmonary stenosis(PS). There was no death case in patients who received Fontan procedure. In a follow-up, we found the grade of AVVR was reduced and the grade of heart function (New York Heart Association) was improved.Adult patients with FSV can also undergo surgery. The mortality was acceptable and late results were satisfactory. After surgery,  saturations increased, grades of AVVR decreased and the heart functions improved.

However, they have evolved a self-defense system whereby reactive  and nitrogen species (RONS) act as double-edged swords by imposing (at higher concentration) and mitigating (at lower concentration) environmental stress. Cold plasma is emerging as a feasible option to produce a variety of RONS in a controlled manner when amalgamate with water. Cold plasma activated/treated water (PAW) contains a variety of RONS at concentrations, which may help to activate the plant's defense system components. In the present study, we examine the effect of cold atmospheric-air jet plasma exposure (15 min, 30 min, and 60 min) on the water's RONS level, as well as the impact of PAW irrigation, (assigned as 15PAW, 30PAW, and 60PAW) on tomato seedlings growth and defense response. We found that PAW irrigation (priming) upregulate seedlings growth, endogenous RONS, defense hormone (salicylic acid and jasmonic acid), and expression of key pathogenesis related (PR) gene. 30 min PAW contains RONS at concentrations which can induce non-toxic signaling. The present study suggests that PAW irrigation can be beneficial for agriculture as it modulates plant growth as well as immune response components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691421>High-flow  therapy: Conclusion after adventures in the jungle of abbreviations.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693977>Stimulation of cell invasion by the Golgi Ion Channel GAAP/TMBIM4 via an HO-Dependent Mechanism.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms by which the Golgi apparatus (GA) impacts on cell invasion are poorly understood. The human Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein (hGAAP, also known as TMBIM4) is a highly conserved Golgi cation channel that modulates intracellular Ca fluxes. Human GAAP is expressed in all human tissues, is essential for cell viability and provides resistance against a range of apoptotic stresses. Furthermore, hGAAP enhances adhesion and cell migration by increasing the turnover of focal adhesions due to activation of store-operated Ca entry. Here, we describe a GA-derived mechanism that controls cell invasion. The overexpression of hGAAP stimulates 3-dimensional proteolytic cell invasion by a mechanism that is dependent on the accumulation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide which might be produced by the hGAAP-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide new insight into the complex mechanisms by which Ca and reactive  species signaling contribute to cell invasion and to the role of the GA in these processes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the effects of PbS NPs on the central nervous system are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to determine, using rats, the mechanism of action of PbS NPs, exposure to which results in persistent alterations in nervous system function. The results of the Morris water maze test showed that PbS NPs significantly impaired learning and memory. Compared with that in the control group, the lead content in the hippocampal tissue was significantly elevated after PbS NP exposure. Exposure to PbS NPs led to increased oxidative damage in blood and hippocampal tissues, and significantly inhibited the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) while increasing the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In addition, reactive  species triggered the activation of Nrf2 and the antioxidant system, including HO-1, r-GCS, and GSH-Px. Moreover, we observed significant apoptosis in the hippocampi of the rats using the TUNEL assay and transmission electron microscopy. The MOD values from the TUNEL assay of the hippocampi were all significantly higher than those of the control group, which increased as the concentration of the PbS NPs increased. There were also changes in the ultrastructure of the hippocampal neurons and synapses in the PbS-treated rats, including a shorter synaptic active zone, smaller curvature of the synaptic interface, and thicker postsynaptic density. Therefore, PbS NP exposure could lead to increased brain lead content, oxidative damage, and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690503>Biogenic stabilization and heavy metal immobilization during vermicomposting of vegetable waste with biochar amendment.</a></h2><p>Vermicomposting is a traditional technology that produces the best quality of compost, but factors such as maturity, presence of heavy metals, etc. need to be tackled prior to agrarian application. The present study investigates the influence of varying biochar dose (2.5, 5, and 10% on a weight basis) on the maturity of compost and heavy metals during vermicomposting of vegetable waste using epigeic earthworm. Biochar amendment notably enhanced the electrical conductivity (up to 2.7 mS/cm), nitrogen content (up to 3.1%), NO-N (up to 630 mg/kg) and nutritional value. The heavy metals,  uptake rate (below 0.96 mg/g VS/day) and CO evolution rate (below 1 mg/g VS/day) were attenuated along with degradation of complex organic crystals as observed in powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) spectra. Furthermore, biochar aid in reducing pathogens (below 1.1 × 10 MPN/g dry weight) as inferred from the Most Probable Number (MPN) results as well as degrading the complex organics into simpler compounds as revealed from the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra. The present study inferred that the vegetable waste was biologically stabilized through biochar amendment during vermicomposting process with improved nutritional and physico-chemical properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It describes a bioengineering software solution, which is explored for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae fed-batch cultures. The experimental investigation of both cultures presents experimental validation results since the start of the bioprocess, i.e. since the injection of inoculant solution into bioreactor. In total, four strains were analyzed, and 21 experiments were performed under varying bioprocess conditions, out of which 7 experiments were carried out with dosed substrate feeding. Development of the microorganisms' culture invariant generic estimator of biomass concentration was the main goal of this research.The results show that stoichiometric parameters provide acceptable knowledge on the state of biomass concentrations during the whole cultivation process, including the exponential growth phase of both E. coli and S. cerevisiae cultures. The cell culture stoichiometric parameters are estimated by a procedure based on the Luedeking/Piret-model and maximization of entropy. The main input signal of the approach is cumulative  uptake rate at fed-batch cultivation processes. The developed noninvasive biomass estimation procedure was intentionally made to not depend on the selection of corresponding bioprocess/bioreactor parameters.The precision errors, since the bioprocess start, when inoculant was injected to a bioreactor, confirmed that the approach is relevant for online biomass state estimation. This included the lag and exponential growth phases for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae. The suggested estimation procedure is identical for both cultures. This approach improves the precision achieved by other authors without compromising the simplicity of the implementation. Moreover, the suggested approach is a candidate method to be the microorganisms' culture invariant approach. It does not depend on any numeric initial optimization conditions, it does not require any of bioreactor parameters. No numeric stability issues of convergence occurred during multiple performance tests. All this makes this approach a potential candidate for industrial tasks with adaptive feeding control or automatic inoculations when substrate feeding profile and bioreactor parameters are not provided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689654>Physiological endpoints in daphnid acute toxicity tests.</a></h2><p>Daphnids are freshwater crustaceans used in toxicity tests.

Using high-resolution, in situ DO time-series collected over the course of a year in a novel marine ecosystem (Jellyfish Lake, Palau), we show that DO declined throughout the marine lake and subsequently recovered in the upper water column. These shifts were accompanied by variations in water temperature and were correlated to changes in wind, precipitation, and especially sea surface height that occurred during the 2015-2016 El Niño-Southern Oscillation event. Multiple approaches used to calculate rates of community respiration, net community production, and gross primary production from DO changes showed that DO consumption and production did not accelerate nor collapse; instead, their variance increased during lake deoxygenation and recovery, and then stabilized. Spatial and temporal variations in rates were significantly related to climatic variability and changes in DO, and causality testing indicated that these relationships were both correlative and causative. Our data indicate that climatic, physical, and biogeochemical properties and processes collectively regulated DO, producing linked feedbacks that drove DO decline and recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694361>Rain exacerbates cold and metabolic strain during high-intensity running.</a></h2><p>Outdoor exercise often proceeds in rainy conditions.

Mean weighted skin temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON during exercise (P<0.05).  consumption and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 50 and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma lactate was significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05).These results suggest that rain increased heat loss during the early phase of exercise in the cold, then heat production increased and transiently suppressed cold stress. However, with time, body heat loss intensified due to increasing wet area, and then energy expenditure and plasma lactate increased due to cold stress. Therefore, rain may decrease exercise performance and affect sport safety.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696204>CXCR3 from chemokine receptor family correlates with immune infiltration and predicts poor survival in osteosarcoma.</a></h2><p>Chemokine receptors have a crucial role in regulating tumor mediating immunity and also implicated in the prognosis of some cancers. Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling pathways modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, metabolism, KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive  species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related pathways such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690112>Neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4 (NEDD4) regulates hydrogen peroxide-induced cell proliferation and death through inhibition of Hippo signaling.</a></h2><p>E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death. In this study, we investigated the role of neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) in regulation of hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis in human bone marrow-derived stem cells (hBMSCs). Cell proliferation was increased in low doses of HO (10 to 10 μM), whereas sublethal concentrations of HO (>200 μM) induced apoptosis. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified that recruitment of NF-κB onto the promoter region of  mediated HO-induced  expression. The increase of NEDD4 expression by HO induced translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP) into the nucleus by decreasing the stability of large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS). Thus, the phosphorylation of serine 127 residue of YAP by LATS upstream kinase is decreased and thereby increased the transcriptional activity of YAP. The mRNA expression levels of catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase, which are well-known targets of YAP, were increased by HO treatment but down-regulated by NEDD4 silencing using a specific small interfering RNA targeting NEDD4 (siNEDD4). HO-induced scavenging capacity of reactive  species was also decreased by siNEDD4 in hBMSCs. Finally, hBMSC differentiation into osteoblast was decreased by siNEDD4 but reverted by reintroduction of the S127A mutant construction of YAP. Taken together, these results indicate that NEDD4 regulates HO-induced alteration of cell status through regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway.-Jeon, S.-A., Kim, D. W., Cho, J.-Y.

Acute exacerbations of COPD patients are in significant respiratory distress and noninvasive measurements of WOB are easier for the patient to tolerate. Given the interest in using alternative therapies to noninvasive ventilation, such as high flow nasal  therapy or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, understanding the physiological changes are key and this includes assessment of WOB. This narrative review considers the role of three different methods of assessing WOB in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Esophageal pressure is a very well validated measure of WOB, however the ability of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD to tolerate esophageal tubes is poor. Noninvasive alternative measurements include parasternal electromyography (EMG) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EMG is easily applied and is a well validated measure of neural drive but is more likely to be degraded by the electrical environment in intensive care or high dependency. EIT is less well validated as a tool for WOB in COPD but extremely well tolerated by patients. Each of the different methods assess WOB in a different way and have different advantages and disadvantages. For research into therapies treating acute exacerbations of COPD, combinations of EIT, EMG and esophageal pressure are likely to be better than only one of these.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692088>MiR-92a regulates brown adipocytes differentiation, mitochondrial oxidative respiration, and heat generation by targeting SMAD7.</a></h2><p>Brown adipocytes are rich in mitochondria and linked to the body's blood fat levels and obesity.

The direct target gene of miR-92a was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Brown adipocytes were treated with isoprenaline (Iso) and transfected by miR-92a inhibitor and siSMAD7. The expression of heat-producing genes and adipose differentiation genes related to brown adipocytes were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 were detected using Western blot analysis. The mitochondrial content was measured by mitotracker fluorescent staining. MiR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased the expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cells. MiR-92a inhibitor could upregulate the expression of Ucp1, Cox7a1, Elovl3, Ppargc1α, PPARγ, and FABP4, and its effect on Ucp1 was increased after the treatment of isoprenaline. Moreover, miR-92a inhibitor increased mitochondrial content,  consumption rate (OCR) and the expression of SMAD7 and suppressed the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3, whereas miR-92a directly targeted SMAD7 to exert its inhibitory effects. SiSMAD7 reversed the effects of the inhibitor on heat-producing genes, mitochondrial content, OCR and the expressions of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 in brown adipocytes. Blocking miR-92a might promote brown adipocytes differentiation, mitochondrial oxidative respiration, and thermogenesis by targeting SMAD7 to inhibit the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690310>Redirecting photosynthetic electron flux in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by the deletion of flavodiiron protein Flv3.</a></h2><p>-evolving photoautotrophic organisms, like cyanobacteria, protect their photosynthetic machinery by a number of regulatory mechanisms, including alternative electron transfer pathways. Despite the importance in modulating the electron flux distribution between the photosystems, alternative electron transfer routes may compete with the solar-driven production of CO-derived target chemicals in biotechnological systems under development. This work focused on engineered cyanobacterial Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains, to explore possibilities to rescue excited electrons that would normally be lost to molecular  by an alternative acceptor flavodiiron protein Flv1/3-an enzyme that is natively associated with transfer of electrons from PSI to O, as part of an acclimation strategy towards varying environmental conditions.The effects of Flv1/3 inactivation by flv3 deletion were studied in respect to three alternative end-products, sucrose, polyhydroxybutyrate and glycogen, while the photosynthetic gas fluxes were monitored by Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) to acquire information on cellular carbon uptake, and the production and consumption of O. The results demonstrated that a significant proportion of the excited electrons derived from photosynthetic water cleavage was lost to molecular  via Flv1/3 in cells grown under high CO, especially under high light intensities. In flv3 deletion strains these electrons could be re-routed to increase the relative metabolic flux towards the monitored target products, but the carbon distribution and the overall efficiency were determined by the light conditions and the genetic composition of the respective pathways. At the same time, the total photosynthetic capacity of the Δflv3 strains was systematically reduced, and accompanied by upregulation of oxidative glycolytic metabolism in respect to controls with the native Flv1/3 background.The observed metabolic changes and respective production profiles were proposedly linked with the lack of Flv1/3-mediated electron transfer, and the associated decrease in the intracellular ATP/NADPH ratio, which is bound to affect the metabolic carbon partitioning in the flv3-deficient cells. While the deletion of flv3 could offer a strategy for enhancing the photosynthetic production of desired chemicals in cyanobacteria under specified conditions, the engineered target pathways have to be carefully selected to align with the intracellular redox balance of the cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687693>Preparation of Co-Mo-O ultrathin nanosheets with outstanding catalytic performance in aerobic oxidative desulfurization.</a></h2><p>In this study, ultrathin α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets intercalated with molybdate were successfully synthesized using a one-step coprecipitation method, and the derived Co-Mo-O mixed metal oxides demonstrated outstanding catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidative desulfurization (AODS) of fuels using molecular  (O2) in air as the oxidizing agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693194>Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibition Ameliorates Cardiac Dysfunction and Exacerbates Hypotension Caused by Alcohol in Female Rats.</a></h2><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) protects against alcohol-evoked cardiac dysfunction in male rodents but its role in the estrogen (E )-dependent hypersensitivity of female rats to alcohol-evoked myocardial oxidative stress and dysfunction is not known.We addressed this question by studying the effect of cyanamide (ALDH2 inhibitor) on cardiac function, blood pressure, alcohol metabolizing enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 2E1, catalase and ALDH2) activities and cardiac redox status (reactive  species, ROS; malondialdehyde, MDA) in the absence or presence of ethanol in female sham-operated (SO) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats.Cyanamide attenuated the ethanol-evoked myocardial dysfunction (reduced dP/dt and LVDP) in SO rats. Ethanol, cyanamide or their combination did not alter dP/dt or LVDP in OVX rats. Cyanamide induced cardiac oxidative stress and abrogated the subsequent alcohol-evoked increases in ROS and MDA levels in SO rats. Neither ethanol nor cyanamide influenced ROS or MDA levels in OVX rats. Importantly, cyanamide exaggerated ethanol-evoked hypotension in SO and uncovered this hypotensive response in OVX rats, which implicates ALDH2 in the vasodilating effect of ethanol.Contrary to our hypothesis, cyanamide attenuated the E -dependent cardiac dysfunction caused by alcohol, likely by preconditioning the heart to oxidative stress, while exacerbating the vasodilating effect of alcohol. The latter might predispose to syncope when cyanamide and alcohol are combined in females.Copyright © 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693037>Formation of uniform porous yolk-shell MnCoO microrugby balls with enhanced electrochemical performance for lithium storage and the  evolution reaction.</a></h2><p>Mixed transition metal oxides with favorable electrochemical properties are promising electrode materials in energy storage and conversion systems.

Here, we propose that the electrocatalytic properties could be well modified by incorporating missing linkers into the MOF. Theoretical calculations suggest the electronic structure of MOFs can be tuned by introducing missing linkers, which improves  evolution reaction (OER) performance of the MOF. Inspired by these aspects, we introduced various missing linkers into a layered-pillared MOF Co(OH)(CHO) (termed as CoBDC) to prepare missing-linker MOFs. Transmission electron microscope and synchrotron X-ray measurements confirmed that the missing linkers in the MOF could be introduced and well controlled by our strategy. The self-supported MOF nanoarrays with missing linkers of carboxyferrocene exhibit excellent OER performance with ultralow overpotential of 241 mV at 100 mA cm.

In this study, we compared three different anesthetic induction techniques to standard IV propofol inductions (control) in their effect on reducing redistribution hypothermia.Elective, afebrile patients, age 18 to 55 years, were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 50 each). Group "INH/100" was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 100% , Group "INH/50" with 8% sevoflurane in 50%  and 50% nitrous oxide, Group "PROP" with 2.2 mg/kg propofol, and Group "Phnl/PROP" with 2.2 mg/kg propofol immediately preceded by 160 mcg phenylephrine. Patients were maintained with sevoflurane in 50% nitrous oxide and 50%  in addition to opioid narcotic. Forced air warming was used.

However, its use in patients treated for malignancies, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients, is controversial. In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed outcomes of pediatric cancer and HSCT patients (including nonmalignant indications) with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with HFNC on the ward. Among 39 patients included in the study, 53 episodes of HFNC treatment were analyzed. Of these episodes, 18 (34%) failed and patients required subsequently pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. A significant median higher C reactive protein (175 [range, 72 to 308] vs. 80 [13.5 to 187.8] mg/dL; P=0.006) and higher Bedside Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) 1 to 4 hours after initiation of HFNC (10.1±0.8 vs. 7.1±0.4; P=0.001) was found in the failure group compared with the nonfailure group. Among the 18 patients admitted to PICU, 14 (78%) needed intubation. Five (28%) patients died during their PICU admission. In summary, one third of the pediatric cancer and HSCT patients receiving HFNC on the ward eventually required PICU admission of which 78% were intubated. C reactive protein and BedsidePEWS 1 to 4 hours after initiation of HFNC were significantly associated with the need for PICU admission. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn whether HFNC treatment should actually be initiated in the ward in this vulnerable patient population.

It is well-known that pressure can induce structural phase transition, producing novel properties. On the other hand, the study of W oxides under high pressures is beneficial for the control of the  fugacity. In this work, we built the high-pressure phase diagram of W-O binary compounds through first-principles swarm-intelligence structural search calculations. WOand WOare stable in the whole considered pressure range from 0 to 300 GPa. Besides reproducing the known structures, we identify two new phases of WO(e.g., C2/m and Cmca) and three ones for WO(e.g., Pnma, Cmcm, and Pm-3n), associating with the evolution of polyhedron (i.e. octahedron → distorted octahedron for WO, and octahedron → hendecahedron → tetradecahedron → icosahedron for WO). More interestingly, the Pm-3n-structured WOshows the highest coordination number of 12. Electron structure calculations indicates that pressure-induced nonmetal → metal transition occurs for WOand WO. Our study provides an opportunity to understand the structure and electronic properties of W-O system under high pressure.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689651>GO/PEDOT:NaPSS modified cathode as heterogeneous electro-Fenton pretreatment and subsequently aerobic granular sludge biological degradation for dye wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>Heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) technology has been wildly applied for the treatment of wastewater containing dyes and other organic pollutants. However, biologically treatment should be further applied after heterogeneous electro-Fenton process in order get better effluent quality. In the present study, a simple electropolymerization method using poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and graphene oxide (GO) was applied for graphite felt (GF) electrode modification as cathode in EF system, and coupling subsequently aerobic granular sludge (AGS) biological treatment for dye wastewater treatment. The modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectrum, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Data implied that much higher HO productivity, current response and coulomb efficiency (CE) were achieved by using GO/PEDOT:NaPSS modified GF. The results could be ascribed to the synergistic effect between PEDOT and GO that accelerated the electron transfer rate. Moreover, the HO production capacity remained over 84.2% after 10-times reuses for GO/PEDOT:NaPSS modified GF, indicating that GO significantly improved the stability and life of electrode. Compared with the single system, the total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical  demand (COD) removal efficiencies of the combined system degradation methylene blue (MB) wastewater were significantly improved. Therefore, this modified GF could be used as a potentially useful cathode in heterogeneous EF technology for actual wastewater treatment and the combined system have a promising engineering application value in MB wastewater degradation field.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the exact role and mechanism of lncRNA MALAT1 (MALAT1) in the progress of DR. -induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model and high glucose (HG)-stimulated human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were employed to mimic the pathological statues of DR. qRT-PCR or western blot results showed that MALAT1, VEGFA and HIF-1α levels were increased in DR retinal tissues and HG-stimulated HRMECs, whereas the expression of miR-203a-3p was decreased. Knock-down of MALAT1 or up-regulation of miR-203a-3p both suppressed HG-induced proliferation, migration and tube formation of HRMECS. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-203a-3p could bind to the predicted seed regions of MALAT1 as evidenced by the reduced luciferase activity. Furthermore, enforced down-regulation of miR-203a-3p abolished the suppressive effect of MALAT1 silencing on HRMECs cell migration and tube formation. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that MALAT1 may affect angiogenesis by sponging miR-203a-3p in DR.

In eukaryotes, its role and frequency remain highly debated, although recent research supports that gene transfer from bacteria to diverse eukaryotes may be much more common than previously appreciated. However, most of this research focused on animals and the true phylogenetic and functional impact of bacterial genes in less-studied microbial eukaryotic groups remains largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed transcriptome data from the deep-branching stramenopile Opalinidae, common members of frog gut microbiomes and distantly related to the well-known genus Blastocystis. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the early acquisition of several bacterial genes in a common ancestor of both lineages. Those LGTs most likely facilitated the adaptation of the free-living ancestor of the Opalinidae-Blastocystis symbiotic group to new niches in the -depleted animal gut environment.© The Author(s) 2019.

By integrating human bone, teeth, and environmental samples this research tests the hypothesis of the persistent importance of community-wide seasonal pastoral transhumance during the early formation of complex settlement systems of the South Caucasus.This research applies stable  and radiogenic strontium isotope analyses on incremental samples of human tooth enamel, bulk tooth enamel, and bone to resolve mobility patterns. Sequential and bulk sampling techniques elucidate seasonal and residential mobility behaviors. Extensive environmental isotope samples of plant and water were collected through regional survey and establish local and regional isotopic baselines, which are compared to human isotope analysis results.Qızqala individuals exhibit low isotopic variability compared to regional contemporaries.  Sr/ Sr ratios from human remains indicate seasonal and residential isotopic variability within the baseline ranges of local landscapes. δ O values display erratic patterns, but correspond to seasonal variability with fluctuations between highland and lowland altitudinal zone baseline values.Results suggest that isotopic analysis of multiple elements and sequential enamel samples offers finer resolution on the complexities of human mobility strategies and elucidate the daily lives of often overlooked mobile populations. Higher resolution of individual mobility reveals shared routine behaviors that underscore the importance of diverse social collaborations in forming complex polities in the South Caucasus.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689484>Activation of ALDH2 attenuates high glucose induced rat cardiomyocyte fibrosis and necroptosis.</a></h2><p>Necroptosis is one of a regulated programmed death mode, fibrosis is closely related with cell death. It has been reported that inhibition of necroptosis can play the protective role in cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury, stroke and other diseases, but the mechanisms of aldehyde dehydrogenases 2 (ALDH2) against high glucose induced neonatal rat ventricular primary cardiomyocytes fibrosis and necroptosis had not been elucidated clearly. This study was to observe the effect of ALDH2 on high glucose (HG) induced myocardial fibrosis and necroptosis in primary rat cardiomyocytes model. In contrast to normal glucose group, in HG group, with the decreases of ALDH2 activity, mRNA and protein levels, the cardiomyocytes viability was decreased, reactive  species (ROS), the inflammation factors - tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, collagen I (col I) and col III mRNA expressions and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP4) protein expression were increased, while matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) protein level, the ratio of MMP14/TIMP4 were decreased, and the necroptosis key factors - the receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) at mRNA and protein expressions were increased, the inflammasome core proteins - NLRP3 and ASC protein expressions were also increased, the apoptosis rate and necrosis rate were also increased. When the cardiomyocytes were treated with Alda-1 (the ALDH2 agonist) in HG intervention, the cell viability, ALDH2 activity, mRNA and protein levels, MMP14 protein level, the ratio of MMP14/TIMP4 were higher, ROS and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β levels, RIP1, RIP3, MLKL, NLRP3 and ASC expressions, col I and col III, TIMP4 expressions, the apoptosis rate and necrosis rate were lower than in HG group. Daidzin, the antagonist of ALDH2 abolished the role of Alda-1. In summary, ALDH2 maybe is a key regulator in high glucose induced cardiomyocytes injury. Activation of ALDH2 prevented the happening of fibrosis, apoptosis and necroptosis in high glucose induced primary cardiomyocytes injury model, the protective effects were related to the inhibiting of oxidative stress and inflammation, changing of MMP14 and TIMP4, then inhibiting the happening of fibrosis, apoptosis and necroptosis.

A deeper understanding of the physical and chemical functioning of tropical reservoirs is essential to mitigate dam-related impacts. However, the development of predictive tools is hampered by a lack of consistent data on physical mixing and biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs. In this study, we focus on Lake Kariba (Southern Africa), the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam forms a transboundary reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and therefore its management represents a socio-politically sensitive issue because the Kariba Dam operation completely changed the downstream hydrological regime. Although Lake Kariba represents a unique and scientifically interesting case study, there is no consistent dataset documenting its physical and chemical behaviour over time. This limits the scope for quantitative studies of this reservoir and its downstream impacts. To address this research gap, we aggregated a consistent database of in situ measurements of temperature and  depth profiles for the entire 60 years of Lake Kariba's lifetime and performed a detailed statistical analysis of the thermal and  regime of the artificial lake to classify the different behaviours of the lake's sub-basins. We demonstrate that the seasonal stratification strongly depends on the depth of the water column and on the distance from the lake inflow. Satellite data confirm these spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, and reveal a consistent longitudinal warming trend of the lake surface water temperature of about 1.5°C from the inflow to the dam. Finally, our results suggest that the stratification dynamics of the lacustrine sub-basins have the potential to alter the downstream Zambezi water quality. Future research should focus on assessing such alterations and developing strategies to mitigate them.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688759>Perioperative Risks Are Similar for Normal versus Selected High-Body Mass Index Patients Undergoing Outpatient Hand and Elbow Surgery.</a></h2><p>Many ambulatory surgery centers use body mass index as a screening tool to make admissions decisions because of complication risks associated with high-body mass index patients. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate perioperative complications in a cohort of high-body mass index patients undergoing hand and elbow surgery at an ambulatory surgery center. The authors' hypothesis was that anesthesia-related complications for this cohort would be similar to those of a normal-body mass index group.The authors retrospectively reviewed data from all hand and elbow procedures performed on patients with a high body mass index (>40 kg/m). One hundred eighty-nine high-body mass index patients and 189 normal-body mass index patients were included in the analysis.The average weight-based dosage of propofol was similar in both groups but was lower in the high-body mass index group for midazolam and fentanyl. Two high-body mass index patients had  desaturations in the postanesthesia care unit. No patients developed complications related to anesthesia. In the high-body mass index group, one patient developed hypotension in the postanesthesia care unit, was admitted to the emergency room for monitoring, but was discharged the following morning.Outpatient hand surgical care of high-body mass index patients can be performed safely.

The study involved 4 women and 13 men, with an average age of 50 years. The mean time between the end of the radiotherapy and the onset of neurological signs was 28 months. Systematic Brain MRI, sometimes complemented by spectro-MRI, allowed the diagnosis in 100% of cases. Etiologically, this complication occurred after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cancer of the larynx in all cases.

The biochemical indicators closely related to fatigue, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid (LD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) in the serum; liver glycogen (LG) in the liver tissue; muscle glycogen (MG); inorganic phosphate (Pi) and Annexin V in the gastrocnemius; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities; malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); and the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive  species (ROS) content in both serum and the gastrocnemius were detected. Morphological changes were also observed.

Although autophagy was reported to have a protective effect against atherosclerosis, its mechanism for reducing oxidative stress remains un-elucidated. In this study, we have identified 4 novel autophagic compounds from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), which activated the AMPK mediated autophagy pathway for the recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) to reduce the production of reactive  species (ROS) in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this study, 4 compounds (TA, PG, TB and PG1) identified from Penthorum chinense Pursh (PCP) were demonstrated for the first time to possess binding affinity to HUVECs cell membranes via cell membrane chromatography (CMC) accompanied by UHPLC-TOF-MS analysis, and the 4 identified compounds induce autophagy in HUVECs. Among the 4 autophagic activators identified from PCP, TA (Pinocembrin dihydrochalcone-7-O-[3″-O-galloyl-4″,6″-hexahydroxydiphenoyl]-glucoside) is the major chemcial component in PCP, which possesses the most potent autophagy effect via a Ca/AMPK-dependent and mTOR-independent pathways. Moreover, TA efficiently reduced the level of ROS in HUVECs induced by HO. Additionally, the expression of pro- and cleaved-IL-1β in the aortic artery of ApoE-KO mice were also alleviated at the transcription and post-transcription levels after the administration of TA, which might be correlated to the reduction of oxidative-stress induced inflammasome-related Nod-like receptor protein3 (NLRP3) in the aortic arteries of ApoE-KO mice. This study has pinpointed the novel autophagic role of TA in alleviating the oxidative stress of HUVECs and aortic artery of ApoE-KO mice, and provided insight into the therapeutic application of TA in treatment of atherosclerosis or other cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants display a number of responses that allow them to survive under different abiotic stresses such as flooding. We focused on understanding the mechanism that facilitates  diffusion to submerged tissues and the impact it has on sustaining respiration levels. We observed that, as flooding stress progresses, stems increase their diameter and internal porosity. Ethylene triggers stem hypertrophy by inducing cell wall loosening genes, and aerenchyma formation seems to involve programmed cell death mediated by  peroxide. We finally assessed whether these changes in stem morphology and anatomy are indeed effective to restore  levels in submerged organs. We found that aerenchyma formation and hypertrophy not only increase  diffusion towards the base of the plant but also result in an augmented respiration rate. We consider that this response is crucial to maintain adventitious root development under such conditions and, therefore, making it possible for the plant to survive when the original roots die.

The aim of our study was to assess and compare the neonatal morbidity and mortality of multiple versus single very preterm infants.Obstetrical and neonatal data on mothers and preterm infants with gestational ages between 24 and 30 weeks, born during 2015 and 2016 at 11 level III perinatal centers after a surveilled pregnancy, were analyzed and compared. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS® statistics 25 and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 494 infants delivered from 410 women were enrolled in the study; 320 (64.8%) infants resulted from single gestation and 174 (35.2%) resulted from multiple order gestation (double=153, triple=21). Multiples were associated with a higher maternal age, a greater use of medically assisted reproduction techniques, higher C- section rates, more frequent full cycle use of antenatal corticosteroids, higher gestational age with adequate birth weight, spent less days on  therapy, presented less prevalence of BPD and cPVL, needed less surgical closure of PDA and had a lower length of stay in NICU. Abruptio placenta, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preeclampsia were more frequent in single pregnancies. The multivariate analysis by logistic regression adjusted to gestational age and confounding variables did not show any significant difference on the outcomes of multiples compared to singles.The results of our study support the scientific evidence that, with the current practices, the neonatal morbidity and mortality of very premature infants are not different between those resulting from single and multiple gestations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689530>Sildenafil reduces aortic endothelial dysfunction and structural damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats: Role of NO, NADPH and COX-1 pathways.</a></h2><p>Arterial hypertension is a condition associated with endothelial dysfunction, accompanied by an imbalance in the production of reactive  species (ROS) and NO. The aim of this study was to investigate and elucidate the possible mechanisms of sildenafil, a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, actions on endothelial function in aortas from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR treated with sildenafil (40 mg/kg/day, p.o., 3 weeks) were compared to untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography and vascular reactivity was determined in isolated rat aortic rings. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells and systemic ROS were measured by flow cytometry. Plasmatic total antioxidant capacity, NO production and aorta lipid peroxidation were determined by spectrophotometry. Scanning electron microscopy was used for structural analysis of the endothelial surface. Sildenafil reduced high SBP and partially restored the vasodilator response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in SHR aortic rings. Using selective inhibitors, our experiments revealed an augmented participation of NO, with a simultaneous decrease of oxidative stress and of COX-1-derived prostanoids contribution in the endothelium-dependent vasodilation in sildenafil-treated SHR compared to non-treated SHR. Also, the relaxant responses to sildenafil and 8-Br-cGMP were normalized in sildenafil-treated SHR and sildenafil restored the pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance and the endothelial architecture. In conclusion, sildenafil reverses endothelial dysfunction in SHR by improving vascular relaxation to acetylcholine with increased NO bioavailability, reducing the oxidative stress and COX-1 prostanoids, and improving cGMP/PKG signaling. Also, sildenafil reduces structural endothelial damage. Thus, sildenafil is a promising novel pharmacologic strategy to treat endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive states reinforcing its potential role as adjuvant in the pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2018.

Herein, based on the photoinduced photothermal, photoelectric, and photocatalytic effects of black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, a BP-PAO fiber with enhanced uranium extraction capacity and high antibiofouling activity is fabricated by compositing BP nanosheets into polyacrylamidoxime (PAO). The photothermal effect increases the coordination interaction between UO22+ and the functional amidoxime group, and the photoelectric effect produces the surface positive electric field that exhibits electrostatic attraction to the negative [UO2(CO3)3]4-, which all increase the capacity for uranium adsorption. The photocatalytic effect endows the adsorbent with high antibiofouling activity by producing biotoxic reactive  species. Due to these three photoinduced effects, the photoinduced BP-PAO fiber shows a high uranium adsorption capacity of 11.76 mg g-1, which is 1.50 times of the PAO fiber, in bacterial contained natural seawater.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease are almost always accompanied by hypoxia. Tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the dominant intrinsic cells in kidney tissue, are believed to be not only a victim in the pathological process of various kidney diseases, but also a major contributor to kidney damage. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the main regulator of adaptive response of cells to hypoxia. Under various clinical and experimental kidney disease conditions, HIF-1 plays a pivotal role in modulating multiple cellular processes in TECs, including apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, metabolic pattern alteration, and cell cycle arrest. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which HIF-1 regulates these cellular processes in TECs may help identify potential therapeutic targets to improve the outcome of acute kidney injury and delay the progression of chronic kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688955>Stable isotopes from the African site of Elmina, Ghana and their usefulness in tracking the provenance of enslaved individuals in 18th- and 19th-century North American populations.</a></h2><p>Stable isotope values for historic period human remains from Elmina, Ghana, are compared to isotope data from 18th- and 19th-century North American sites as a test case for examining African origins and identifying first generation Africans in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.Stable carbon, nitrogen, and  isotope values were measured in skeletal remains. Values from the cosmopolitan port city of Elmina provide the first available reference data from Africa during this time period and region. These values serve as a proxy for West African groups in general which are statistically compared to Euro-Americans and African Americans.Elmina carbon isotope values are relatively higher than those of North Americans, and African Americans show greater statistical similarity to West Africans. Elmina nitrogen isotope values are higher than those of North Americans. Elmina  isotope values are notably higher than those in all Mid-Atlantic North American sites in this study.Similarity in carbon isotope values between Elmina and African Americans suggests commonalities in food availability or food preferences between these groups. Elevated nitrogen isotope values in Elmina individuals support the documented reliance of the local population on marine dietary resources at this coastal port. While carbon and nitrogen isotopes provide insight into foodways,  isotope data, sourced from drinking water, provide better geographical information. The higher  values from Elmina not only differentiate this group from North American Mid-Atlantic sites, but also make it possible to identify outliers at these sites as potential recent arrivals from West Africa.Published 2019.

Animals were divided into four groups: control, Saxa, LPS, and LPS + Saxa. Histopathology changes of lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining. The degree of edema was determined by wet/dry ratio. The levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were detected using kits. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to test apoptosis and Western blotting was applied to measure the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways were detected by Western blotting. The results revealed that Saxa attenuated LPS-induced pathological injury and edema. Saxa decreased the levels of reactive  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The contents of inflammatory cytokines were reduced in the Saxa intervention group. Saxa attenuated apoptosis accompanied by alterations in the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1 were upregulated whereas phospho (p)-NF-κB p65 and phospho-inhibitory subunit of NF-κB alpha (p-IκB-α) were downregulated after Saxa treatment. These findings concluded that Saxa alleviates oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ALI induced by LPS via modulating the Nrf-2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways, which provides evidence for employing Saxa in ALI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695737>The role of a critical care outreach service in the management of patients with haematological malignancy.</a></h2><p>Although improvement in survival from haematological malignancies has been reported, a substantial number of these patients develop life threatening complications. Critical care outreach services (CCOS) aim to avert inappropriate ICU admissions, while ensuring timely patient review.We retrospectively analysed patients with haematological malignancy reviewed by an outreach service between January 2014 and December 2015 at a single institution. The aim of our study was to describe the patient population assessed by a well-established outreach team, identify predictors of ICU admission, as well as ICU and hospital mortality.Sixty of 126 patients reviewed (47.6%) were admitted to ICU. ICU and hospital mortality were 25.3% and 45.2%, respectively. The odds of being admitted to ICU was 13 times higher ( = 0.013) if the patient was referred for hypoxia, 20 times higher ( = 0.006) if they were referred for sepsis or 14 times higher ( = 0.027) if they were referred to CCOS for hypotension, compared to when the team was automatically alerted. The odds of not surviving hospital admission increased 1.27 times for every extra day of CCOS review ( = 0.02). When a patient was referred having a refractory or progressive haematological condition, the odds of not surviving to hospital discharge increased by four or 12 times, respectively, compared to when the referred patient was in remission. Receiving high flow nasal cannula  (HFNCO) was associated with a reduction in ICU admission ( = 0.03), irrespective of the underlying diagnosis, performance status or location of delivery. The CCOS participated in end-of-life discussions in 29% patients.ICU and hospital mortality of patients with haemato-oncological malignancy continue to improve. CCOS are heavily involved in the recognition and management of these patients, as well as in the facilitation of end-of-life discussions. Sepsis was associated with increased risk of ICU admission and mortality. Initiation of HFNCO outside ICU appears to be feasible and safe and was not associated with increasing risk in this single centre study.© The Intensive Care Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692058>Silencing circular RNA circANKRD36 remits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory damage by regulating microRNA-15/MyD88.</a></h2><p>Bedsore is a familiar disease, which fearfully harms the health of the patients.

CCK-8 and flow cytometry were respectively used to investigate the efficacies of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), circANKRD36, and microRNA (miR)-15 on cell viability and apoptosis. Moreover, circANKRD36 and miR-15 expression were changed by cell transfection and investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the levels of Bax, pro caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and proteins of the pathway were investigated by Western blot. Otherwise, the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive  species (ROS) was investigated by ROS assay. The relation between myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and miR-15 was investigated by luciferase assay. LPS caused inflammatory damage and upregulated circANKRD36. circANKRD36 was silenced in cells and si-circANKRD36 remitted inflammatory damage. Furthermore, si-circANKRD36 negatively regulated miR-15 and miR-15 inhibitor could reverse the efficacies of si-circANKRD36. Besides, si-circANKRD36 restrained the NF-κB pathway by upregulating miR-15.

The bioremediation fungi has received attention and reported to be an effective alternative to treat industrial wastewater. Similar efficient performance is envisaged for domestic wastewater whereby assessed performance of fungi for varying carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in domestic wastewater is crucial. Thus, the performance of pre-grown wild-Serbian Ganoderma lucidum mycelial pellets (GLMPs) was evaluated on four different synthetic domestic wastewaters under different conditions of initial pH (pH 4, 5, and 7) and chemical  demand (COD) to nitrogen (COD/N) ratio of 3.6:1, 7.1:1, 14.2:1, and 17.8:1 (C3.6N1, C7.1N1, C14.2N1, and C17.8N1). The COD/N ratios with a constant concentration of ammonia-nitrogen (NH-N) were chosen on the basis of the urban domestic wastewater characteristics sampled at the inlet basin of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The parameters of pH, COD, and NH-N were measured periodically during the experiment. The wild-Serbian GLMPs efficiently removed the pollutants from the synthetic sewage. The COD/N ratio of C17.8N1 wastewater had the best COD and NH-N removal, as compared to the lower COD/N ratio, and the shortest treatment time was obtained in an acidic environment at pH 4. The highest percentage for COD and NH-N removal achieved was 96.0% and 93.2%, respectively. The results proved that the mycelium of GLMP has high potential in treating domestic wastewater, particularly at high organic content as a naturally sustainable bioremediation system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689041>Long-term sperm cryopreservation does not affect post-thaw survival rates.</a></h2><p>To compare cryosurvival rates of human spermatozoa in a prolonged period of cryopreservation.This retrospective study involved 33 cryopreserved semen samples from patients with cancer, between 2002 and 2011. The semen sample was obtained by masturbation and initial semen analysis was performed. The cryoprotectant solution was added and samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen in a slow step-wise process. For thawing, the samples were incubated at 25.0°C for 15 min, followed by incubation at 36.7°C for 15 min. The cryosurvival rate (CS) was calculate by CS= [(% total motile sperm post-thaw) x100/(% total motile sperm/tube)]. Each study sample was divided into three aliquots (Study Group; n=23): (I) official patient sample, which was kept cryopreserved for subsequent Assisted Reproduction procedure, cryopreserved between 2002 and 2011; (II) sample destined to post-thaw tests, performed after the sample had been kept cryopreserved for 24 hours; and (III) study sample. Only in 2014, after 3-12 years of cryopreservation, the study samples were thawed and evaluated. To validate the study design, a Validation Group was created including 10 samples obtained between 2014 and 2016, using the same methodology in the study samples. The data was analyzed using the T-test, with a significant p-value of 5%.The mean age was 29.93±9.57 years in the Study Group and 21.80±6.49 years in the Validation Group. No significant difference between the Validation and Study Groups was found in the initial semen analysis (p>0.05). After 24 hours of cryopreservation, the cryosurvival rate was 26.11±46.36% in the Study Group and 23.71±57.06% in the Validation Group. Aliquots of the same sample preserved from 3-12 years demonstrated 23.71±57.06% of cryosurvival rate. Thus, no significant difference was found vis-à-vis the cryosurvival rates (p=0.56).We concluded that the method introduced in the late 1990s, which enables the removal of debris, potentially toxic elements and generators of reactive  species from the seminal sample before cryopreservation, exhibited efficiency in maintaining the same cryosurvival rate after an extended period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696613>The toxic effects of Fluorene-9-bisphenol on porcine oocyte in vitro maturation.</a></h2><p>Fluorene-9-bisphenol (9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorene [BHPF]) is a bisphenol A (BPA) substitute used in the production of "BPA-free" plastics, now has been identified is harmful to living organisms. Our previous study showed that BHPF impaired mouse denuded oocyte in vitro maturation. However, there is a question that whether BHPF is still able to affect oocyte maturation in the presence of dense cumulus cells. In the present study, we checked the toxic effects of BHPF on porcine oocyte maturation which is derived from COCs in vitro culture. Our results showed that BHPF (50 μM) inhibited the expansion of cumulus cells, led to a significant decrease in polar body extrusion (PBE). Importantly, BHPF resulted in abnormal spindle assembly, ATP level decrease, reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and early apoptosis in porcine oocytes, which are all negative to oocyte maturation. Furthermore, BHPF also declined porcine oocyte quality by disturbing the cortical granules (CGs) distribution. In conclusion, our study showed that BHPF still inhibited oocyte maturation even in the presence of cumulus cells leading to abnormal spindle assembly, ATP decrease, increased ROS level, early apoptosis, and disturbed CGs distribution in porcine oocytes, and also indicates that BHPF has a wide range toxic effects on oocyte in different species.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690504>Diatom-assisted biomicroreactor targeting the complete removal of perfluorinated compounds.</a></h2><p>Persistent perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have been recognized as a global environmental issue. Developing methods without leading to additional burden in nature will be essential for PFCs removal. Herein, we functionalized iron nanoparticles on living diatom (Dt) to efficiently enable the Fenton reaction and reactive  species (ROS) production. Iron nanoparticles at the surface of living diatom act as promising catalytic agents to trigger OH radical generation from HO. Dt plays dual roles: i) as solid support for effective adsorption, and ii) it supplies  and inherently produces ROS under stress conditions, which improves removal efficiency of PFCs. We also demonstrated its reusability by simple magnetic separation and 85% of decomposition efficiency could still be achieved.

Current clinical guidelines recommend preterm infants are slept supine from 32 weeks' postmenstrual age, regardless of gestational age at birth. However, respiratory function is also related to gestational and chronological ages and is affected by sleep state. We aimed to identify the optimal timing for adopting the supine sleeping position in preterm infants, using a longitudinal design assessing the effects of sleep position and state on cardiorespiratory stability.Twenty-three extremely (24-28 weeks' gestation) and 33 very preterm (29-34 weeks' gestation) infants were studied weekly from birth until discharge, in both prone and supine positions, in quiet and active sleep determined by behavioral scoring. Bradycardia (heart rate ≤100 bpm), desaturation ( saturation ≤80%), and apnea (pause in respiratory rate ≥10 s) episodes were analyzed.Prone positioning in extremely preterm infants reduced the frequency of bradycardias and desaturations and duration of desaturations. In very preterm infants, prone positioning only reduced the frequency of desaturations. The position-related effects were not related to postmenstrual age. Quiet sleep in both preterm groups was associated with fewer bradycardias and desaturations, and also reduced durations of bradycardia and desaturations in the very preterm group.Cardiorespiratory stability is improved by the prone sleep position, predominantly in extremely preterm infants, and the improvements are not dependent on postmenstrual age. In very preterm infants, quiet sleep has a more marked effect than the prone position. This evidence should be considered in individualizing management of preterm infant positioning.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

HCMV can result in severe direct and indirect pathologies under immunosuppressed conditions and is the leading cause of birth defects related to infectious disease. Currently, the effect of HCMV infection on host cell metabolism as an increase in glycolysis during infection has been defined. We have observed that oxidative phosphorylation is also increased. We have identified morphological and functional changes to host mitochondria during HCMV infection. The mitochondrial network undergoes fission events after HCMV infection. Interestingly, the network does not undergo fusion. At the same time mitochondrial mass and membrane potential increase. The electron transport chain (ETC) functions at an elevated rate resulting in the release of increased reactive  species. Surprisingly, despite the stress applied to the host mitochondria, the network is capable of responding to and meeting the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands placed on it. When mitochondrial DNA is depleted from the cells, we observed severe impairment of viral replication. Mitochondrial DNA encodes many of the ETC components. These findings suggest that the host cell ETC is essential to HCMV replication. Our studies suggest the host cell mitochondria may be a therapeutic target. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus present in up to 85% of some populations. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV infection is for life. There is no vaccine currently available, neutralizing antibody therapies are ineffective and current antivirals have limited long-term efficacy due to side effects and potential for viral mutation and resistance. The significance of this research is in understanding how HCMV manipulates the host mitochondria to support bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements for replication. Despite a large genome, HCMV relies exclusively on host cells for metabolic functions. By understanding the dependency of HCMV on the mitochondria, we could exploit these requirements and develop novel antivirals.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694206>A Neuroimaging Study of Personality Traits and Self-Reflection.</a></h2><p>This study examines the blood- level dependent (BOLD) activation of the brain associated with the four distinctive thinking styles associated with the four personality orientations of the Gountas Personality Orientations (GPO) survey: Emotion/Feeling-Action, Material/Pragmatic, Intuitive/Imaginative, and Thinking/Logical. The theoretical postulation is that each of the four personality orientations has a dominant (primary) thinking style and a shadow (secondary) thinking style/trait. The participants (N = 40) were initially surveyed to determine their dominant (primary) and secondary thinking styles. Based on participant responses, equal numbers of each dominant thinking style were selected for neuroimaging using a unique fMRI cognitive activation paradigm. The neuroimaging data support the general theoretical hypothesis of the existence of four different BOLD activation patterns, associated with each of the four thinking styles. The fMRI data analysis suggests that each thinking style may have its own cognitive activation system, involving the frontal ventromedial, posterior medial, parietal, motor, and orbitofrontal cortex. The data also suggest that there is a left hemisphere relationship for the  and  styles and a right activation relationship for  and  styles. Additionally, the unique self-reflection paradigm demonstrated that perception of self or self-image, may be influenced by personality type; a finding of potentially far-reaching implications.</p></html>
