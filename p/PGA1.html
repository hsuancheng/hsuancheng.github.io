Epidemiological studies show that chronic treatment with low levels of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) lowers the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) by as much as 50%. Unfortunately, inhibiting cyclooxygenases with NSAIDs blocks the synthesis of downstream neuroprotective and neurotoxic PGs, thus producing adverse side effects. We focus on prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) because it is highly neurotoxic compared to , D2, and E2. Unlike other PGs, PGJ2 and its metabolites have a cyclopentenone ring with reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that form covalent Michael adducts with key cysteines in proteins and GSH. Cysteine-binding electrophiles such as PGJ2 are considered to play an important role in determining whether neurons will live or die. We discuss in vitro and in vivo studies showing that PGJ2 induces pathological processes relevant to neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD. Further, we discuss our work showing that increasing intracellular cAMP with the lipophilic peptide PACAP27 counteracts some of the PGJ2-induced detrimental effects. New therapeutic strategies that neutralize the effects of specific neurotoxic PGs downstream from cyclooxygenases could have a significant impact on the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative disorders with fewer adverse side effects.© 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352224>Stimulation of CFU-f formation by prostaglandin E2 is mediated in part by its degradation product, prostaglandin A2.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PG) of the E series are known to rapidly undergo non-enzymatic dehydration in culture medium containing serum albumin to produce the cyclopentenone PGs of the A series. We investigated the actions of  and A2 in the in vitro calcifying fibroblastic-colony forming unit assay which can partially mimic the in vivo anabolic effects of PGE2. It was found that  and A2 both stimulated colony formation in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum at 10(-6) M and to a similar degree to PGE2.

Furthermore, the addition of protein kinase A inhibitors, H8 and H89, had no significant effect on the stimulation of colony number by PGE2.

There was, in addition, an unexplained increase in folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells which is shown in this paper to be mediated by a transporter with a low pH optimum. The pH profile for folic acid influx in parental Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells indicated peak activity at pH 6; this was increased >3-fold in PyrR100 cells. In contrast, methotrexate (MTX) influx in AA8 cells showed two peaks of comparable activities at pH 6 and 7.5; in PyrR100 cells, the component at pH 6 was increased 2-fold. Folic acid was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MTX or [3H]folic acid influx (1 microM) via the low pH route with IC50 values of approximately 1 microM.  was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MTX influx via the reduced folate carrier 1 at pH 7.5 with only a small inhibitory effect on the low pH route. The addition of 10 microM folic acid to PyrR100 cells resulted in a MTX influx pH profile identical to that of AA8 cells, consistent with suppression of the low pH route. In contrast, addition of 25 microM  to PyrR100 cells resulted in a MTX influx pH profile comparable to that of folic acid, consistent with the loss of the reduced folate carrier-mediated component. Inhibition ( approximately 70%) of [3H]folic acid influx by approximately 10 microM unlabeled folic acid at pH 7.5 indicated that the low pH transporter accounts for the majority of folic acid transport at physiological pH. This study demonstrates the functional importance of a low pH folate transporter that is increased when enhanced folic acid entry into cells is required as an adaptive response to antifolate selective pressure. This may represent a mechanism of resistance to new antifolate inhibitors of folate cofactor-dependent enzymes in which cytotoxic activity is limited by expanded cellular folate pools.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2310673>Selection of HTLV-I positive clones is prevented by prostaglandin A in infected cord blood cultures.</a></h2><p>Type A prostaglandins ( and 16,16-dimethyl-PGA2-methyl ester) were found to block the proliferation of HTLV-I infected cord blood lymphocytes (CBL) in vitro, thus preventing the clonal immortalisation that is considered as a predisposing condition to HTLV-I positive leukaemia.  and di-M-PGA2 did not affect the long-term survival of normal non-infected CBL, whereas they suppressed the proliferation of an established cord-blood derived HTLV-I positive cell line, MT-2. As shown by the number of HTLV-I infected p19+ cells, the block of the selection of immortalised, infected clones by PGAs did not appear to be due to an inhibition of early stages of HTLV-I infection. The possibility that the effect of PGAs could be mediated by an action on the immune response was also examined. PGAs regulated the cell-mediated cytotoxic function of CBL to a different extent when normal non-infected or HTLV-I exposed CBL were compared. In fact, PGAs down-regulated the natural killing and macrophage/lymphocyte cytotoxic response of normal CBL, whereas they did not modify the already depressed immune response of CBL challenged with HTLV-I. These results suggest that the protective effect of PGAs against HTLV-I infection in vitro is mostly related to the direct suppression of the clonal expansion of virus-infected cells, rather than to the anti-viral activity or modulation of the cell-mediated immunity.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349138>TGA transcription factors and jasmonate-independent COI1 signalling regulate specific plant responses to reactive oxylipins.</a></h2><p>Jasmonates and phytoprostanes are oxylipins that regulate stress responses and diverse physiological and developmental processes. 12-Oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and phytoprostanes are structurally related electrophilic cyclopentenones, which activate similar gene expression profiles that are for the most part different from the action of the cyclopentanone jasmonic acid (JA) and its biologically active amino acid conjugates. Whereas JA-isoleucine signals through binding to COI1, the bZIP transcription factors TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6 are involved in regulation of gene expression in response to phytoprostanes. Here root growth inhibition and target gene expression were compared after treatment with JA, OPDA, or phytoprostanes in mutants of the COI1/MYC2 pathway and in different TGA factor mutants. Inhibition of root growth by phytoprostanes was dependent on COI1 but independent of jasmonate biosynthesis. In contrast, phytoprostane-responsive gene expression was strongly dependent on TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6, but not dependent on COI1, MYC2, TGA1, and TGA4. Different mutant and overexpressing lines were used to determine individual contributions of TGA factors to cyclopentenone-responsive gene expression. Whereas OPDA-induced expression of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP81D11 was primarily regulated by TGA2 and TGA5, the glutathione S-transferase gene GST25 and the OPDA reductase gene OPR1 were regulated by TGA5 and TGA6, but less so by TGA2. These results support the model that phytoprostanes and OPDA regulate differently (i) growth responses, which are COI1 dependent but jasmonate independent; and (ii) lipid stress responses, which are strongly dependent on TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6.

Among them, lipids bearing unsaturated aldehyde or ketone moieties can form covalent adducts with cysteine residues and modulate protein function. Through proteomic techniques we have identified actin as a target for the addition of biotinylated analogs of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and PGA(1) in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. This modification could take place in vitro and mapped to the protein C-terminal end. Other electrophilic lipids, like the isoprostane 8-iso-PGA(1) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, also bound to actin. The C-terminal region of actin is important for monomer-monomer interactions and polymerization. Electron microscopy showed that actin treated with 15d-PGJ(2) or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal formed filaments which were less abundant and displayed shorter length and altered structure. Streptavidin-gold staining allowed mapping of biotinylated 15d-PGJ(2) at sites of filament disruption.

Here, we report that 15d-PGJ2 blocks translation through inactivation of translational initiation factor eIF4A. Binding of 15d-PGJ2 to eIF4A blocks the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G that is essential for translation of many mRNAs. Cysteine 264 in eIF4A is the target site of 15d-PGJ2. The antineoplastic activity of 15d-PGJ2 is likely attributed to inhibition of translation. Moreover, inhibition of translation by 15d-PGJ2 results in stress granule (SG) formation, into which TRAF2 is sequestered. The sequestration of TRAF2 contributes to the anti-inflammatory activity of 15d-PGJ2.

This effect is associated with induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) in mammalian cells. We now report that, in human monocytes,  is able to induce the synthesis of the iron-binding, redox-regulated protein ferritin. L-chain ferritin induction is consequent to a substantial increase in the accumulation of L-chain ferritin transcripts in -treated cells, whereas H-chain ferritin is regulated post-transcriptionally, consequently to reduction of iron-regulatory protein binding to iron-responsive elements in ferritin mRNA. Ferritin induction is specific for cyclopentenone prostaglandins (, PGA2, PGJ2, Delta12-PGJ2), whereas other arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites have no effect. In human monocytes,  also induces heat shock gene transcription via heat shock factor activation, as well as the synthesis of the oxidative-stress protein heme oxygenase (HOS). Differently from HSP, the induction of ferritin by  is specific for monocytes. Monocytes/macrophages play a pivotal role in , controlling iron metabolism and releasing a variety of mediators, including proinflammatory reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines and AA metabolites.

Two lighter membrane fractions (I and II), which were enriched 11-fold and 8.4-fold in adenylate cyclase activity over crude homogenate, were pooled and subjected to various studies. Results suggested that the basal activity of the membrane preparations has, as in many other cell types, a relatively broad pH optimum (pH 7.5 to 8.5), requires Mg2+, which must be present in excess ATP, and is inhibited by Ca2+.

Here we report the identification of members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family as selective targets of the cyPG prostaglandin A(1) (PGA(1)). AKR enzymes metabolize aldehydes and drugs containing carbonyl groups and are involved in  and tumorigenesis. Thus, these enzymes represent a class of targets to develop small molecule inhibitors with therapeutic activity. Molecular modeling studies pointed to the covalent binding of PGA(1) to Cys299, close to the active site of AKR, with His111 and Tyr49, which are highly conserved in the AKR family, playing a role in PGA(1) orientation. Among AKR enzymes, AKR1B10 is considered as a tumor marker and contributes to tumor development and chemoresistance. We validated the direct modification of AKR1B10 by biotinylated PGA(1) (PGA(1)-B) in cells, and confirmed that mutation of Cys299 abolishes PGA(1)-B incorporation, whereas substitution of His111 or Tyr49 reduced the interaction. Modification of AKR1B10 by PGA(1) correlated with loss of enzymatic activity and both effects were increased by depletion of cellular glutathione. Moreover, in lung cancer cells PGA(1) reduced tumorigenic potential and increased accumulation of the AKR substrate doxorubicin, potentiating cell-cycle arrest induced by this chemotherapeutic agent.

It could be demonstrated that prostaglandin E1 and E2 have an angiogenetic capacity, whereas their precursor (arachidonic acid) as well as , A2, B2, I2 and Thromboxan A2 were inactive in this regard. Histology showed that corneal neovascularization is always accompanied by the invasion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Corneal edema in the beginning of vascularization can be explained by the activities of PGE (vasodilation, increase of vascular permeability, liberation of histamine). The implantation of lipoxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid compounds (5-HETE, Leukotriene B4) demonstrated that these mediators share in the process of neovascularization by inducing the chemotaxis. The above mentioned activities of prostaglandins and leukotrienes could also be demonstrated following penetrating keratoplasty and alkali burns of the anterior segment inducing extensive corneal neovascularization. An analysis of the prostaglandin- and leukotriene-dependent mechanisms could be achieved by selective PG- and LT-inhibitors. Radioimmunoassays showed a definite correlation between the concentrations of PGE and the amount of neovascularization following alkali burns. The results of our research lead to the following scheme of pathophysiology of corneal neovascularization: hypoxic, chemical, thermic and mechanical alterations of the cornea induce an activation of corneal cytomembranes, thus initiating the cyclooxygenase-dependent synthesis of prostaglandins with consecutive vasodilation and increase of vascular permeability as well as histamine liberation resulting in corneal edema; on the other hand, prostaglandins proved to have a minimal chemotactic activity; the lipoxygenase-dependent synthesis of leukotrienes inducing chemotaxis and diapedesis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the corneal stroma. These inflammatory cells are then the main source of newly synthesized leukotrienes maintaining the chemotaxis, and prostaglandins with angiogenetic activity. Cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-inhibitors can inhibit these activities at two different levels, leading to an approach of successful therapy of corneal diseases inducing neovascularization.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16407234>Herpes simplex virus disrupts NF-kappaB regulation by blocking its recruitment on the IkappaBalpha promoter and directing the factor on viral genes.</a></h2><p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are able to hijack the host-cell IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway, which regulates critical cell functions from apoptosis to inflammatory responses; however, the molecular mechanisms involved and the outcome of the signaling dysregulation on the host-virus interaction are mostly unknown.

Based on laboratory and clinical studies, it appears that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that are generated extracellularly and intracellularly by various mechanisms are among the major intermediary risk factors that initiate and promote neurodegeneration in idiopathic AD. Therefore, multiple antioxidant supplements could be useful in the prevention of AD, and as an adjunct to standard therapy in the treatment of AD. The products of inflammatory reactions such as prostaglandins (PGs; PGE1 and ), free radicals, cytokines, and complement proteins are neurotoxic. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit the synthesis of PGs, reduce the rate of deterioration of cognitive functions in patients with advanced AD. Cholinergic drugs are routinely used in the treatment of AD to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, we propose that a combination of multiple antioxidants and NSAIDs may be more beneficial in the prevention of AD, and that this combination taken together with cholinergic drugs may be more effective in the treatment of AD than the individual agents alone.

This is supported by the fact that the secretory products of inflammatory reactions, which include cytokines, complement proteins, adhesion molecules, and free radicals, are neurotoxic. We have recently reported that prostaglandins (PGs), which are also released during inflammatory reactions, cause rapid degenerative changes in differentiated murine neuroblastoma cells (NB) in culture.  is more effective than PGE1. Similar observations were made in a primary culture of fetal rat hippocampal cells. Epidemiological and clinical studies on AD also support the involvement of PGs in neuronal degeneration. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that PGs are one of the major extracellular signals that initiate neuronal degeneration, which is mediated by intracellular signals such as the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and ubiquitin, since the levels of these proteins are increased by PG treatment. We further suggest that adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the factors that regulate the levels of both Abeta and ubiquitin in NB cells. Increases in the level of Abeta in NB cells following an elevation of intracellular cAMP levels appear to be due to an increase in the rate of processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) rather than an increase in the expression of APP. The mechanisms underlying Abeta-induced neuronal degeneration have been under intense investigation, and several mechanisms of action have been proposed. We postulate that PG-induced elevation of Abeta may lead to an increased binding of Abeta to the 20S proteasome, resulting in a reduction of 20S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. This is predicted to lead to an increase in an accumulation of abnormal proteins, which ultimately contribute to neuronal degeneration and death. Based on our hypothesis and on studies published by others, we propose that a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit the synthesis of PGs, and antioxidant vitamins, which quench free radicals and both of which have been recently reported to be of some value in AD treatment when used-individually, may be much more effective in the prevention and treatment of AD than the individual agents alone.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623164>Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy and Its Emerging Role in Hematological Malignancies.</a></h2><p>Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) ensures the selective degradation of cellular proteins endowed with a KFERQ-like motif by lysosomes. It is estimated that 30% of all cellular proteins can be directed to the lysosome for CMA degradation, but only a few substrates have been formally identified so far. Mechanistically, the KFERQ-like motifs present in substrate proteins are recognized by the molecular chaperone Hsc70c (Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein cytosolic), also known as HSPA8, and directed to LAMP2A, which acts as the CMA receptor at the lysosomal surface. Following linearization, the protein substrate is next transported to the lumen of the lysosomes, where it is degraded by resident proteases, mainly cathepsins and eventually recycled to sustain cellular homeostasis. CMA is induced by different stress conditions, including  deprivation that also activates macro-autophagy (MA), that may make it difficult to decipher the relative impact of both pathways on cellular homeostasis. Besides common inducing triggers, CMA and MA might be induced as compensatory mechanisms when either mechanism is altered, as it is the often the case in different pathological settings. Therefore, CMA activation can compensate for alterations of MA and vice versa. In this context, these compensatory mechanisms, when occurring, may be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Both processes have received particular attention from scientists and clinicians, since modulation of MA and CMA may have a profound impact on cellular proteostasis, metabolism, death, differentiation, and survival and, as such, could be targeted for therapeutic intervention in degenerative and immune diseases, as well as in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. The role of MA in cancer initiation and progression is now well established, but whether and how CMA is involved in tumorigenesis has been only sparsely explored. In the present review, we encompass the description of the mechanisms involved in CMA, its function in the physiology and pathogenesis of hematopoietic cells, its emerging role in cancer initiation and development, and, finally, the potential therapeutic opportunity to target CMA or CMA-mediated compensatory mechanisms in hematological malignancies.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10487535>Inhibitory effects of  on membrane transport of folates mediated by both the reduced folate carrier and ATP-driven exporters.</a></h2><p>Studies are reported that describe the multifaceted inhibitory effects of  () on processes that govern the transport of folates across the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells: the reduced folate carrier, RFC1, and ATP-dependent exporters.  was a noncompetitive inhibitor of MTX influx mediated by RFC1 with a Ki of approximately 21 microM.

HSV utilize cellular signaling pathways and transcription factors to promote their replication. Here we report that HSV type 1 (HSV-1) induces persistent activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B, a critical regulator of genes involved in , by activating the I kappa B kinase (IKK) in the early phase of infection. Activated NF-kappa B enhances HSV-1 gene expression. HSV-1-induced NF-kappa B activation is dependent on viral early protein synthesis and is not blocked by the anti-herpetic drug acyclovir. IKK inhibition by the anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandin A(1) blocks HSV-1 gene expression and reduces virus yield by more than 3000-fold. The results identify IKK as a potential target for anti-herpetic drugs and suggest that cyclopentenone prostaglandins or their derivatives could be used in the treatment of HSV infection.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6256749>Prostaglandin I2 modifies both prolactin binding capacity and fluidity of mouse liver membranes.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine if prostaglandins alter the fluidity of hepatic membranes and if this, in turn, modifies their ability to bind prolactin.

Only membrane preparations treated with prostaglandin I2 showed an increase in specific binding of ovine prolactin.

The maximal contractile force produced by 15-HPAA was 1.5 times that of serotonin and was equivalent to that of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha or . At concentrations in which reductions of [14C]-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the breakdown product of PGI2) occurred, both 15-HPAA and tranylcypromine contracted the artery, whereas indomethacin consistently relaxed it. In the case of indomethacin, as the drug inhibited the synthesis of [14C]-PGE2, F2 alpha and thromboxane(TX) B2 (the breakdown product of TXA2) as well, it has been considered that the balances between PGI2 and other vasoconstrictive PGs or TX may regulate the tone of the artery. Furthermore, it was shown that 15-HPAA enhanced the synthesis of lipoxygenase products from [14C]arachidonic acid. Experiments were done, therefore, to know whether these enhanced lipoxygenase products participated in the manifestation of contraction induced by 15-HPAA or not. As a result, although indomethacin did not affect the contraction, significant reductions of the contraction were shown by eicosatetraynoic acid.

Microalgae are promising and potential alternate  resources for biodiesel production. Thus, our efforts were focused on surveying the natural diversity of microalgae for the production of biodiesel. The present study aimed at identification, isolation, and characterization of oleaginous microalgae from shola forests of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), the biodiversity hot spot of India, where the microalgal diversity has not yet been systematically investigated.Overall the higher biomass yield, higher lipid accumulation and thermotolerance observed in the isolated microalgal strains have been found to be the desirable traits for the efficient biodiesel production. Species composition and diversity analysis yielded ten potential microalgal isolates belonging to Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. The chlorophytes exhibited higher growth rate, maximum biomass yield, and higher lipid accumulation than Cyanophyceae. Among the chlorophytes, the best performing strains were identified and represented by Acutodesmus dissociatus (TGA1), Chlorella sp. (TGA2), Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) and Hindakia tetrachotoma (). The Chlamydomonadales sp. recorded with the highest growth rate, lipid accumulation and biomass yield of 0.28 ± 0.03 day (μ), 29.7 ± 0.69% and 134.17 ± 16.87 mg L day, respectively. It was also found to grow well at various temperatures, viz., 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, indicating its suitability for open pond cultivation. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of stationary phase cultures of selected four algal strains by tandem mass spectrograph showed C16:0, C18:1 and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production. All the three strains except for Hindakia tetrachotoma () recorded higher carbohydrate content and were considered as potential feed stocks for biodiesel production through hydrothermal liquefaction technology (HTL).In conclusion, the present investigation is a first systematic study on the microalgal diversity of soil and water samples from selected sites of NBR. The study resulted in isolation and characterization of ten potent oleaginous microalgae and found four cultures as promising feed stocks for biodiesel production. Of the four microalgae, Chlamydomonadales sp.

This report provides the first evidence that CYP4F3B is uniquely induced by  () in human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells and leads to the synthesis of 20-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Real time PCR, immunoblot analysis with a specific antipeptide antibody, and determination of  acid omega-hydroxylase activity demonstrate that  treatment strongly increases expression of CYP4F3B.

Namely, cells harboring a wild-type p53 gene accumulate p53 protein that is conformationally and functionally impaired. This occurs via an unknown molecular mechanism. We report that electrophilic cyclopentenone prostaglandins covalently modify and inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein that governs p53 and other redox-sensitive transcription factors. This mechanism accounts fully for the unusual p53 phenotype in cells exposed to electrophilic prostaglandins. Based on this mechanism we derived, tested, and affirmed several predictions regarding the kinetics of p53 inactivation; the protective effects of selenium; the structure-activity relationships for inhibition of thioredoxin reductase and impairment of p53 by electrophilic lipids; the susceptibility of hypoxia-inducible factor to inactivation by electrophilic lipids; and the equivalence of chemical inactivation of p53 to deletion of a p53 allele. Chemical precepts dictate that other electrophilic agents should also inhibit thioredoxin reductase and impair its governance of redox-sensitive proteins.

Upon reconstitution with P450 reductase and phospholipid, CYP4F2 converted LTB4 to 20-OH LTB4 at a turnover rate of 392 pmol/min/nmol P450, whereas the other human liver P450s tested, including CYP4A11, exhibited neglible LTB4 omega-hydroxylase activity. Polyclonal antibodies to CYP4F2 were found to markedly inhibit (91.9 +/- 5%; n = 5) LTB4 20-hydroxylation by human liver microsomes. Microsomal 20-OH LTB4 formation was also inhibited 30% by arachidonic acid, a known CYP4F2 substrate, and 50% by  but was unaffected by lauric acid, palmitic acid, and PGF2alpha. Finally, a strong correlation (r = 0.86; P < 0.002; n = 10) was observed between CYP4F2 content and LTB4 20-hydroxylase activity in the human liver samples. Our results indicate that CYP4F2 is the principle LTB4 omega-hydroxylating enzyme expressed in human liver and, as such, may play an important role in regulating circulating as well as hepatic levels of this powerful proinflammatory eicosanoid.Copyright 1998 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17489560>Modification and activation of Ras proteins by electrophilic prostanoids with different structure are site-selective.</a></h2><p>Cyclopentenone prostanoids (cyP) arise as important modulators of  and cell proliferation. Although their physiological significance has not been fully elucidated, their potent biological effects have spurred their study as leads for the development of therapeutic agents. A key determinant of cyP action is their ability to bind to thiol groups in proteins or in glutathione through Michael addition. Even though several protein targets for cyP addition have been identified, little is known about the structural determinants from the protein or the cyP that drive this modification. The results herein presented provide the first evidence that cyP with different structures target distinct thiol sites in a protein molecule, namely, H-Ras. Whereas 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and Delta12-PGJ2 preferentially target the C-terminal region containing cysteines 181 and 184,  and 8-iso- bind mainly to cysteine 118, located in the GTP-binding motif. The biological counterparts of this specificity are the site-selective modification and activation of H-Ras in cells and the differential interaction of cyP with H, N, and K-Ras proteins. Cysteine 184 is unique to H-Ras, whereas cysteine 118 is present in the three Ras homologues. Consistent with this,  binds to and activates H-, N-, and K-Ras, thus differing from the preferential interaction of 15d-PGJ2 with H-Ras. These results put forward the possibility of influencing the selectivity of cyP-protein addition by modifying cyP structure. Furthermore, they may open new avenues for the development of cyP-based drugs.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25911511>Quantification and Potential Functions of Endogenous Agonists of Transient Receptor Potential Channels in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.</a></h2><p>In mice, activation of the transient receptor potential cation channels (TRP) TRPV1, TRPV4, and TRPA1 causes visceral hypersensitivity. These receptors and their agonists might be involved in development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, which activate TRPs, are present in colon tissues from patients with IBS and act as endogenous agonists to induce hypersensitivity.We analyzed colon biopsy samples from 40 patients with IBS (IBS biopsies) and 11 healthy individuals undergoing colorectal cancer screening (controls), collected during colonoscopy at the University of Bologna, Italy. Levels of the PUFA metabolites that activate TRPV1 (12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and leukotriene B4), TRPV4 (5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid [EET] and 8,9-EET), and TRPA1 (, 8-iso-prostaglandin A2, and 15-deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J2) were measured in biopsies and their supernatants using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry; we also measured levels of the PUFA metabolites prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and resolvins. C57Bl6 mice were given intrathecal injections of small interfering RNAs to reduce levels of TRPV4, or control small interfering RNAs, along with colonic injections of biopsy supernatants; visceral hypersensitivity was measured based on response to colorectal distension. Mouse sensory neurons were cultured and incubated with biopsy supernatants and lipids extracted from biopsies or colons of mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect TRPV4 in human dorsal root ganglia samples (from the National Disease Research Interchange).Levels of the TRPV4 agonist 5,6-EET, but not levels of TRPV1 or TRPA1 agonists, were increased in IBS biopsies compared with controls; increases correlated with pain and bloating scores. Supernatants from IBS biopsies, but not from controls, induced visceral hypersensitivity in mice. Small interfering RNA knockdown of TRPV4 in mouse primary afferent neurons inhibited the hypersensitivity caused by supernatants from IBS biopsies. Levels of 5,6-EET and 15-HETE were increased in colons of mice with, but not without, visceral hypersensitivity. PUFA metabolites extracted from IBS biopsies or colons of mice with visceral hypersensitivity activated mouse sensory neurons in vitro, by activating TRPV4. Mouse sensory neurons exposed to supernatants from IBS biopsies produced 5,6-EET via a mechanism that involved the proteinase-activated receptor-2 and cytochrome epoxygenase. In human dorsal root ganglia, TPV4 was expressed by 35% of neurons.Colon tissues from patients with IBS have increased levels of specific PUFA metabolites. These stimulate sensory neurons from mice and generate visceral hypersensitivity via activation of TRPV4.Copyright © 2015 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PG), PGA, PGJ2, and delta 12-PGJ2, inhibit the growth of many cell types in vitro. This report describes the preferential binding of the growth inhibitory prostaglandins by L-FABP and the reversible inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA by PGA2 and delta 12-PGJ2 in primary cultures of purified rat hepatocytes. As a model ligand, [3H] bound to L-FABP specifically, reversibly, rapidly, and with high affinity. Its dissociation constants were 134 nM (high affinity) and 3.6 microM (low affinity). The high-affinity binding of [3H] was 9- and approximately 13-fold more avid than the binding of the conventional  acid ligands, oleic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively. The abilities of different prostaglandins to compete with the high-affinity binding of [3H] correlated with their growth inhibitory activities reported previously and here. The growth inhibitory cyclopentenone prostaglandins (, PGA2, delta 12-PGJ2, and PGJ2) were the best competitive ligands, intermediate competitors were the weak growth inhibitors PGE1 and PGD2, and the poorest competitors were PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, which stimulate rather than inhibit DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The in vitro actions of L-FABP are compatible with those of a specific and dissociable carrier of growth inhibitory prostaglandins in rat hepatocytes and suggest that the carcinogen may usurp the cellular machinery of the growth inhibitory prostaglandins.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29608605>TGA2 signaling in response to reactive electrophile species is not dependent on cysteine modification of TGA2.</a></h2><p>Reactive electrophile species (RES), including prostaglandins, phytoprostanes and 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA), activate detoxification responses in plants and animals.

In conclusion, impairment of ubiquitin hydrolase activity, such as triggered by Delta12-PGJ2, may be an important contributor to neurodegeneration associated with accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and .</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18252242>Prostaglandins A1 and E1 influence gene expression in an established insect cell line (BCIRL-HzAM1 cells).</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) and other eicosanoids exert important physiological actions in insects and other invertebrates, including influencing ion transport and mediating cellular immune defense functions. Although these actions are very well documented, we have no information on the mechanisms of PGs actions in insect cells. Here we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to test our hypothesis that PGs modulate gene expression in an insect cell line established from pupal ovarian tissue of the moth Helicoverpa zea (BCIRL-HzAM1 cells). We treated cells with either PGA(1) or PGE(1) for 12 or 24h then analyzed cell lysates by 2-D electrophoresis. Analysis of the gels by densitometry revealed substantial changes in protein expression in some of the protein spots we analyzed. These spots were processed for mass spectrometric analysis by MALDI TOF/TOF, which yielded in silico protein identities for all 34 spots. The apparent changes in three of the proteins were confirmed by semi-quantative PCR, showing that the changes in mRNA expression were reflected in changes in protein expression. The 34 proteins were sorted into six categories, protein actions, , signal transduction, protection, cell functions and . The findings support the hypothesis that one mechanism of PG action in insect cells is the modulation of gene expression.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11994490>A proinflammatory role for the cyclopentenone prostaglandins at low micromolar concentrations: oxidative stress-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation without NF-kappa B inhibition.</a></h2><p>An anti-inflammatory role and therapeutic potential for cyclopentenone PGs (cyPGs) has been suggested, based on observations that levels of cyPGs in exudates increase during the resolution phase of , and that exogenous cyPGs may attenuate the inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro mainly through inhibition of NF-kappaB, a critical activator of inflammatory gene expression. However, exogenous cyPGs inhibit NF-kappaB only at concentrations substantially higher than those of endogenous cyPGs present in inflammatory fluids, thus challenging the hypothesis that cyPGs are naturally occurring inhibitors of  and suggesting that cyPGs at low concentrations might have previously unappreciated effects. In this study, using various cell types, we report that cyPGs, when used at concentrations substantially lower than required for NF-kappaB inhibition (viz, low micromolar concentrations), significantly potentiate the inflammatory response to TNF-alpha. At these concentrations, cyPGs induce production of reactive oxygen species, thereby synergizing with TNF-alpha to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, an activation which in turn potentiates proinflammatory cytokine expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Our study establishes a proinflammatory role for cyPGs at low micromolar concentrations, raises the possibility that cyPGs do not act as physiologic anti-inflammatory mediators, and questions the therapeutic potential of these compounds.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27468687>-induced apoptosis involves specific activation of H-Ras and N-Ras in cellular endomembranes.</a></h2><p>The cyclopentenone  () is an inducer of cell death in cancer cells. However, the mechanism that initiates this cytotoxic response remains elusive. Here we report that  triggers apoptosis by a process that entails the specific activation of H- and N-Ras isoforms, leading to caspase activation. Cells without H- and N-Ras did not undergo apoptosis upon  treatment; in these cells, the cellular demise was rescued by overexpression of either H-Ras or N-Ras. Consistently, the mutant H-Ras-C118S, defective for binding , did not produce cell death. Molecular analysis revealed a key role for the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in the apoptotic process through the induction of calpain activity and caspase-12 cleavage.

Optimal stimulation was observed at low PG concentrations (10-7 to 10-9 M), with malate or malate-NADPH supported side-chain cleavage. Under the same conditions, two endoperoxide analogs and several fatty acids were ineffective. The PG action was not observed with a mitochondrial acetone powder preparation. These observations suggest that primary PG may act by interfering with calcium distribution at the mitochondrial level, leading to the activation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage. Thus, an intracellular action of endogenous PG may be considered in the regulation of adrenal cortex steroidogenic functions.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9538624>Effects of prostaglandins on ethanol damage in primary cultured rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Several reports demonstrated that ethanol administration impairs the DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes. Also, it has been demonstrated that prostaglandin (PG) helps prevent membrane damage by hepatotoxic chemicals. In this study, the authors examined PG's effects on the toxicity of ethanol in the primary culture of rat regenerations.We examined two kinds of parameters, i.e., DNA synthesis and  peroxidation in the primary culture of rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method. The rate of DNA synthesis was determined by pulse-labelling cultured cells with [3H]-thymidine. Incorporation of (3H)-thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. DNA content was measured by the fluorescence spectrophotometer. The  peroxidation was assayed with spectrophotometer.The results were as follows: 1) PG family (, PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, PGG2a, PGI2 & Thromboxane B2) stimulated the DNA synthesis of hepatocytes (especially PGD2 and PGE1), 2) ethanol decreased DNA synthesis by clear dose-dependent manner, 3) the combined treatment of PGD2 or PGE1, prevents the decreasing of DNA synthesis, which was induced by ethanol, 4) in ethanol treatment,  peroxidation was decreased significantly, but PGD2, PGE1 and  were not affected, and 5) PGD2, PGE1 and  decreased  peroxidation with ethanol, significantly.From these results, we concluded that PG could be useful for the treatment of degenerative liver disease and alcohol-induced liver disease in the assumption that further studies on the action mechanisms of PG will continue.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5539203>Radioimmunoassay for prostaglandins.</a></h2><p>Antibodies to prostaglandin were obtained by immunization of rabbits with PGA(1), PGA(2), and PGE(1), protein conjugates of prostaglandins.

TAP-tag purification offers particular advantages for the identification of stimulus-induced protein interactions. Type II bZIP transcription factors (TGA2, TGA5 and TGA6) play key roles in pathways that control salicylic acid, ethylene, xenobiotic and reactive oxylipin signaling. Although proteins interacting with these transcription factors have been identified through genetic and yeast 2-hybrid screening, others are still elusive. We have therefore generated a C-terminal TAP-tag of TGA2 to isolate additional proteins that interact with this transcription factor. Three lines most highly expressing TAP-tagged TGA2 were functional in that they partially complemented reactive oxylipin-responsive gene expression in a tga2 tga5 tga6 triple mutant. TAP-tagged TGA2 in the most strongly overexpressing line was proteolytically less stable than in the other 2 lines. Only this overexpressing line could be used in a 2-step purification process, resulting in isolation of co-purifying bands of larger molecular weight than TGA2. TAP-tagged TGA2 was used to pull down NPR1, a protein known to interact with this transcription factor. Mass spectrometry was used to identify peptides that co-purified with TAP-tagged TGA2. Having generated this TGA2 TAP-tag line will therefore be an asset to researchers interested in stimulus-induced signal transduction processes.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11728177>Stimulated release of arachidonic acid by agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and retinoic acid receptors.</a></h2><p>Release of arachidonic acid from rat  cells is stimulated after a 6-hour incubation with 9-cis retinoic acid, all trans retinoic acid, the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma synthetic thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone, the cyclopentenones, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 and  and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, celecoxib and indomethacin.

In this report, we have measured the capacity of four rabbit CYP4A enzymes, each expressed in COS-1 cells, to catalyze the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid. These rates were compared to those obtained for other substrates such as lauric acid, palmitic acid, and prostaglandins PGE1 and . With the exception of P4504A5, all of the enzymes tested exhibited relatively high rates for the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid. P4504A5 showed very little activity toward arachidonic or palmitic acids as compared to that toward lauric acid (< 10%). In contrast, P4504A6 and P4504A7 catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid at rates that were roughly 50% of that observed for lauric acid. P4504A4 was not active toward lauric acid, but it also catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid at a rate that was roughly 20% of that exhibited for PGE1. Thus, each enzyme exhibits a distinct substrate specificity profile across this panel of substrates. A sensitive RNase protection assay was used to provide a more quantitative estimate of the relative abundance of mRNAs encoding P4504A5, P4504A6, and P4504A7 in  and kidney from control, pregnant, and clofibrate-treated animals. CYP4A5 is the most abundant of the mRNAs, but it was not induced in kidney and only moderately (2-fold) in  by clofibric acid. CYP4A7 exhibits a similar pattern of induction by clofibrate. In contrast, CYP4A6 is induced 12-fold in  and 6-fold in kidney. The higher induction ratio largely reflects a lower basal level of expression for CYP4A6 than for CYP4A7 and CYP4A5. Following treatment with clofibrate, the amount of CYP4A6 mRNA is similar to those of CYP4A5 and CYP4A7. Pregnancy did not affect the expression of CYP4A5, CYP4A6, or CYP4A7, although it induced the expression of CYP4A4 to detectable levels in the  and kidney, where it is not normally found in nonpregnant animals. Our results indicate that the enzyme whose mRNA is most highly induced by clofibric acid (P4504A6) and the enzyme selectively elevated during pregnancy (P4504A4) both exhibit relatively high rates for the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8468116>Combined treatments with interferon (alpha,beta) plus  to control early infection with HTLV-I in primary cord blood-derived mononuclear cells.</a></h2><p>Interferon (IFN) alpha and beta can activate an antiviral and immunomodulating response in primary cord blood-derived mononuclear cells (CBMC) exposed to infection with Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I (HTLV-I), resulting in partial inhibition of early infection in vitro.

Recipient CBMC were treated with IFN alpha or beta (1000 IU/ml) at the onset of the co-culture with lethally irradiated virus-donor MT-2 cells, followed by multiple treatments with  (4 micrograms/ml every 4 days, starting on day 0) for 6 weeks post infection (p.i.).

IFNs and  showed antagonistic effects on HSP70 production in infected CBMC. In fact, production of HSP70 was suppressed (or prevented) in IFN-treated co-cultures, tested 2 and 4 weeks p.i.

We reported that PGs influence protein expression in insect cell lines, which prompted the question: do PGs influence cell proliferation or viability in insect cell lines? Here, we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to address the question in cell lines from three insect orders: Hemiptera (squash bug, Anasa tristis, BCIRL-AtE-CLG15A), Coleoptera (red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, BCIRL-TcA-CLG1), and Lepidoptera (tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, BCIRL-HvAM1). Treating the insect cell lines with PGA, PGA, or PGD led to dose-dependent reductions in cell numbers. All three cell lines were sensitive to PGA and PGA (ICs = 9.9 to 26.9 μM) and were less sensitive to PGD (ICs = 31.6 to 104.7 μM). PG treatments also led to cell death at higher concentrations, as seen in mammalian cell lines. PGE, PGE, and PGF treatments did not influence AtE-CLG15A or HvAM1 cell numbers at lower concentrations, but led to dose-related reductions in TcA-CLG1 cells at higher concentrations. Similar treatments with pharmaceutical inhibitors of PG biosynthesis also led to reduced cell numbers: MAFP (inhibits phospholipase A), indomethacin (inhibits PG biosynthesis), and esculetin (inhibits lipoxygenase). Because these pharmaceuticals are used to relieve  and other medical issues in human medicine, they are not toxic to animal cells. We infer PGs are necessary in optimal quantities for ongoing homeostatic functions in established cell lines; in quantities outside the optimal concentrations, PGs are deleterious.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1007762>Effects of prostaglandins in canine endotoxin shock.</a></h2><p>Endotoxin shock was produced in healthy, adult mongrel dogs by the intravenous injection of 1.5 mg/kg of E. coli endotoxin.
