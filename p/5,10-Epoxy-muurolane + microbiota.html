<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h2><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590758>Impact of dietary ingredients on the interpretation of various fecal parameters in rats fed inulin.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the influences of diets (i.e. chow and AIN-93 diets) on the interpretation of various fecal parameters including viable , moisture, weight, and short-chain fatty acids in rats fed different amounts of inulin (0.-2 g/kg). Eight groups of rats (n = 8/group) were fed, for 4 weeks, chow or AIN-93 diets with or without inulin supplementation. Fecal samples were analyzed for different fecal parameters. After a 2-week adaptation, apparent differences in some fecal parameters were observed between the chow and AIN-93 diet groups. Throughout the 4-week intervention period, significantly (p < 0.05) higher Lactobacillus spp. counts, fecal moisture (∼2.7-fold), and fecal weight (∼.8-fold) were observed with chow diet over AIN-93 diet. More specifically, significant elevations in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., fecal moisture, and fecal weight could be observed at low-dose (0. g/kg) of inulin in chow diet groups, while most of these changes could merely be seen at medium-dose (1 g/kg) in AIN-93 diet groups. These results demonstrated that the choice of experimental diets would affect the comparison of fecal parameters as well as the interpretation of effective dosage of prebiotic in intestinal health assessments.Copyright © 2019.

The use of various types of mouthrinses plays an important role in maintaining proper oral hygiene and in removing some of the microbial components from the oral cavity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of selected mouthrinses on the reference strains of Trichomonas tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis which can be a part of the oral cavity . Two standard strains Trichomonas tenax (ATCC 30207) and Entamoeba gingivalis (ATCC 30927) were used and metronidazole as a drug used in the treatment of infections caused by protozoa as well as fourteen agents used as mouthwashes were tested, with two pure compounds acting as mouthrinse ingredients, i.e. 20% benzocaine and 0.2% chlorhexidine, as well as 12 commercially-available formulas: Azulan, Colgate Plax Complete Care Sensitive, Corsodyl 0.2%, Curasept ADS 205, Dentosept, Dentosept A, Eludril Classic, Listerine Total Care, Octenidol, Oral-B Pro-Expert Clinic Line, Sylveco and Tinctura salviae. The protozoonicidal activity of the preparations was evaluated on the basis of the ratio of dead to living ratios after incubation in an incubator (37°C) for 1, 10 and 30 min. Protozoa were counted in the Bürker chamber in each case up to 100 cells in an optical microscope (over 400×). The criterion for the death of protozoa was the lack of movement and changes in the shape and characteristics of cell disintegration. The curves of activity were obtained after experiments conducted for –7 different solutions of each preparation. On the basis of the curves, the solution killing 50% of the population (CL50) was calculated. All mouthrinses tested in this work in their undiluted form acted lethally on both protozoa. Benzocaine, used as a local anesthetic, has etiotropic properties which can be useful for supporting antiprotozoal treatment. Chlorhexidine confirmed its high efficiency in the eradication of potentially pathogenic protozoa. The use of mouthrinses is an important complement for other procedures intended to maintain correct oral hygiene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670358>Effect of supplementation of nicotinamide and sodium butyrate on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of stocking density and dietary nicotinamide (NAM) and butyrate sodium (BA) supplementation on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density. A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into  groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572332>Efficacy of Fecal Sampling as a Gut Proxy in the Study of Chicken Gut .</a></h2><p>Despite the convenience and non-invasiveness of fecal sampling, the fecal  does not fully represent that of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the efficacy of fecal sampling to accurately represent the gut  in birds is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses. In this study, the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine (84.11-87.28%) and ceca (99.39%) could be identified in feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12 and .83% of the total fecal members, respectively. The composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the observations in fecal samples (ρ = 0.54-0.71 and 0.71-0.78, respectively,  < 0.001). However, there were few significant correlations for each genus between feces and each of the four gut segments, and these correlations were not high (ρ = -0.2-0.4,  < 0.05) for most genera. Our results suggest that fecal microbial community has a good potential to identify most taxa in the chicken gut and could moderately mirror the microbial structure in the intestine at the microbial population level with phylum specificity. However, it should be interpreted with caution by using feces as a proxy to study associations for microbial structure at individual microorganism level.Copyright © 2019 Yan, Sun, Zheng, Wen, Ji, Zhang, Chen, Hou and Yang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602309> genus associated with visceral fat accumulation in adults 20-76 years of age.</a></h2><p>The gut  is reported to be related to obesity, and visceral fat is reported to be strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. However, the association between the gut  and obesity has mainly been studied using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy for obesity. We investigated the relationship of both visceral fat and BMI with the gut  stratified by sex in a population-based cross-sectional study of Japanese men and women 20-76 years of age ( = 1001). Women with a higher visceral fat area (VFA) harboured a higher relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( for trend <0.001) and a lower relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum ( for trend 0.030), whereas men with higher VFA harboured a lower relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( for trend 0.076) and a higher relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum ( for trend 0.013). Similar results were obtained using BMI as an index, but the differences were not significant in men. At the genus level,  was the only gut microbe significantly and inversely associated with VFA regardless of sex. In conclusion, at the genus level we found that  was the only gut microbe significantly and inversely associated with VFA, regardless of sex.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649644>Caecal  of Experimentally Infected Chickens at Different Ages.</a></h2><p> is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne zoonosis in the European Union. Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3..2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty acids (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001). Despite performing consecutive repetitions, the factor experimental replication contributed more to the differences of microbial composition in comparison to the factor age at infection.Copyright © 2019 Hankel, Jung, Kuder, Keller, Keller, Galvez, Strowig and Visscher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611994>Characteristics of fecal gut  in patients with colorectal cancer at different stages and different sites.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies have revealed that the gut  serves an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The present study aimed to investigate the populations present in the gut  in patients with CRC of different stages and at different sites. Fecal samples were obtained from 67 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls, which were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Increased diversity of the fecal gut  in patients with CRC was reported compared with the healthy controls. In the present study, at the genus level, the relative abundances of  and  in the gut  of CRC patients were substantially increased compared with healthy controls, while the relative abundance of  was significantly lower. In addition, differences in the fecal gut  were also compared between patients with stage I-IV CRC and healthy controls. The results revealed that the abundances of the genera  and  were significantly increased in patients with CRC stage I compared with the healthy controls, while  was enriched in patients with stage III CRC compared with patients with stage IV. Furthermore, the present study reported that the genera  and  were more abundant in the proximal segments than in the distal segments of the colon. In conclusion, despite the low number of samples employed in the present study, a signature of genera indicating dysbiosis of the gut  of patients with stage I-IV CRC patients was proposed, which may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the progression of CRC. These findings are also valuable for developing novel fecal diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CRC.Copyright: © Sheng et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552140>Host transcriptome and microbiome interaction modulates physiology of full-sibs broilers with divergent feed conversion ratio.</a></h2><p>Efficient livestock production relies on effective conversion of feed into body weight gain (BWG). High levels of feed conversion are especially important in production of broiler chickens, birds reared for meat, where economic margins are tight. Traits associated with improved broiler growth and feed efficiency have been subjected to intense genetic selection, but measures such as feed conversion ratio (FCR) remain variable, even between full siblings (sibs). Non-genetic factors such as the composition and function of microbial populations within different enteric compartments have been recognized to influence FCR, although the extent of interplay between hosts and their microbiomes is unclear. To examine host-microbiome interactions we investigated variation in the composition and functions of host intestinal-hepatic transcriptomes and the intestinal  of full-sib broilers with divergent FCR. Progeny from 300 broiler families were assessed for divergent FCR set against shared genetic backgrounds and exposure to the same environmental factors. The seven most divergent full-sib pairs were chosen for analysis, exhibiting marked variation in transcription of genes as well as gut microbial diversity. Examination of enteric  in low FCR sibs revealed variation in microbial community structure and function with no difference in feed intake compared to high FCR sibs. Gene transcription in low and high FCR sibs was significantly associated with the abundance of specific microbial taxa. Highly intertwined interactions between host transcriptomes and enteric  are likely to modulate complex traits like FCR and may be amenable to selective modification with relevance to improving intestinal homeostasis and health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535332>Oral probiotics and the female urinary microbiome: a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Probiotics may reduce risk of urinary tract infection by preventing colonization of uropathogens. We aimed to determine the change in the ratio between uropathogens:Lactobacillus (U/L) within the lower urinary tract in response to oral probiotic.This was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial of healthy pre-menopausal female volunteers. Participants provided daily voided urine for 3 months including three phases of the trial: 1-baseline, 2-intervention, 3-wash-out. Participants were randomized to an oral probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14) versus placebo. The primary outcome was the U/L ratio of daily voided urine, as determined by an enhanced urine culture method. Analysis included t test of the ratios and separate generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) for  diversity.481 samples of seven female participants with mean age 29.1 years (± .3 years) were included in the analysis (probiotic n = 4; placebo n = 3). No adverse events were reported. The placebo and probiotic groups had similar mean U/L ratios with no difference between placebo and probiotic groups in Phases 1-3 (p = 0.90, p = 0.58 and p = 0.72, respectively). The probiotic species were never identified in the voided urine. There were no changes between groups in terms of  diversity.For young healthy women, the use of oral probiotic did not affect the U/L ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h2><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either  serovars of Salmonella enterica,  E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.% or .0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study appraises current literature and provides an overview of the effectiveness and limitations of FMT as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS). Five electronic databases and two gray literature sources were searched up to 10 December 2018. All interventional and observational studies that contained information on the relevant population (adult patients with obesity and MS), intervention (receiving allogeneic FMT) and outcomes (metabolic parameters) were eligible. From 1096 unique citations, three randomized placebo-controlled studies (76 patients with obesity and MS, body mass index = 34.8 ± 4.1 kg/m, fasting plasma glucose = .8 ± 0.7 mmol/L) were included for review. Studies reported mixed results with regards to improvement in metabolic parameters. Two studies reported improved peripheral insulin sensitivity (rate of glucose disappearance, RD) at 6 weeks in patients receiving donor FMT versus patients receiving the placebo control. In addition, one study observed lower HbA1c levels in FMT patients at 6 weeks. No differences in fasting plasma glucose, hepatic insulin sensitivity, body mass index (BMI), or cholesterol markers were observed between two groups across all included studies. While promising, the influence of FMT on long-term clinical endpoints needs to be further explored. Future studies are also required to better understand the mechanisms through which changes in gut microbial ecology and engraftment of  affect metabolic outcomes for patients with obesity and MS.

Modulation of FXR and TGR5 activation have been demonstrated to impact the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1, insulin and glucagon as well as energy expenditure and gut  composition with potential beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.A search strategy based on literature searches in pubmed.org with various combinations of the key words FXR, TGR5, agonist, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), bile acid sequestrant, metformin and glucose metabolism has been applied to obtain material for the present review. Furthermore, manual searches including scanning of reference lists in relevant papers and conference proceedings have been performed.This review provides an outline of the link between bile acid and glucose metabolism, with a special focus on the gluco-metabolic impact of treatment modalities with modulating effects on bile acid physiology; including FXR agonists, TGR5 agonists, ASBT inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants and metformin.Any potential beneficial gluco-metabolic effects of FXR-agonists remain to be established, whereas the clinical relevance of TGR5-based treatment modalities seems limited due to substantial safety concerns of TGR5 agonists observed in animal models. The glucose-lowering effects of ASBT inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants and metformin are at least partly mediated by modulation of bile acid circulation, which might allow an optimization of these bile acid modulating treatment modalities.© Endocrine Society 2019.

With the growing interest of the use of mastic oil in the food and pharmaceutical industry, systematic in vivo studies are needed to address controlled usage and safety issues. In the present work we evaluated the safety of mastic oil using as a model the zebrafish lateral line system. In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular metabolism with immune defense. Notably, , a constituent of the mucus hydrogel that protects the host against invading pathogens, was up-regulated.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal  in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the  were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the  might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut  can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut  in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut  of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the  and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the  may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587409>Transplant associated infections-The role of the gastrointestinal  and potential therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>Infectious complications are common following kidney transplantation and rank in the top five causes of death in patients with allograft function.

Unfortunately, there is no reliable control methods have been developed. Recently, interest in disease control using microbial agents is growing. However, kiwifruit  and their roles in the disease control is mainly remaining unknown. In this study, we secured bacterial libraries from kiwifruit ecospheres (rhizosphere, endospere, and phyllosphere) and screened reliable biocontrol strains against Psa. As the results,  W1SF4,  sp. W3SF9 and  KPB2 were selected as anti-Psa agents from the libraries. The strains showed forcible antibacterial activity as well as exceptional colonization ability on rhizosphere or phyllosphere of kiwifruit. Genome analyses of the strains suggested that the strains may produce several anti-Psa secondary metabolites.

But whether Formula-3 ameliorates food allergy through modulating the composition of intestinal  remains to be explored. Here, we aimed to determine whether gut  mediate the anti-food allergic effects of Formula-3. Mouse model of food allergy (FA) was induced by intragastrically administered with ovalbumin and cholera toxin for two weeks, then these mice were orally administrated daily with 1 ml PBS (0.1 mmol/L) or 1 ml Formula-3 (100 mg/m1) for four weeks. The number and abundance of gut mircrobiota were measured with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found administration of Formula-3 significantly alleviated FA by decreasing the serum levels of specific IgE, and Th2 cytokine IL-4, IL-, and IL-13. The dominant characteristics of gut  in mice with FA was the increase in  and decrease in , and the emergence of .

To improve differentiation, underlying pathogeneses need to be further unraveled.To determine if the microbial composition in the appendix differs between children with simple and complex appendicitis.Two-center, prospective cohort study including 40 children (0-17 years old) undergoing appendectomy for suspected appendicitis. Appendix tissue was used for IS-pro analysis to identify bacterial species by their length of 16S-23S rDNA interspacer (IS) region. Cluster analysis, based on IS-profiles, and correspondence with type of appendicitis, using Fisher exact test, was performed. Simple and complex appendicitis were compared regarding bacterial presence, intensity and diversity, using Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively.Appendicitis was confirmed in 36 of 40 patients (16 simple, 20 complex). Cluster analysis identified 2 clusters, encompassing 34 patients. Distribution of simple and complex appendicitis was 12 (80%) and 3 (20%) versus 3 (16%) and 16 (84%) patients for clusters 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0.001). Complex appendicitis was on phylum level characterized by an increased intensity (Bacteroidetes P = 0.001, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (FAFV) P = 0.005 and Proteobacteria P < 0.001) and diversity (Bacteroidetes P = 0.001 and Proteobacteria P = 0.016) and an increased abundance of  species (Alistipes finegoldii P = 0.009, Bacteroides fragilis P = 0.002, Escherichia coli P = 0.014, Parvimonas micra P = 0.022 and Sutterella spp P = 0.026).The microbial composition of the appendix differs between children with simple and complex appendicitis, regarding both composition and diversity.

However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h2><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species.

This trial studied CPSC effects on ruminal fermentation, biohydrogenation and the bacterial community in dairy cows. Ten cows were used in a crossover design with two experimental diets and fed during two 63-day periods. The cows were group fed forage ad libitum and the concentrate individually. The concentrates, control and CPSC, were isoenergetic, isoproteic and isofat. The ruminal samples collected at the end of each experimental period were analyzed for short-chain fatty acid, FA and DNA sequencing. CPSC decreased butyrate molar proportion (4%,  = 0.005). CPSC decreased C16:0 (28%,  < 0.001) and increased C18:0 (14%,  < 0.001) and total monounsaturated FA, especially C18:1 trans-11 (13%,  = 0.023).

We evaluated the gut  between NAFLD and non-NAFLD participants, excluding the influence of obesity and sex in this study involving a large number of participants.In total, 1148 adults participated in the health survey. NAFLD was defined as fatty liver by ultrasonography in the absence of other causes of steatosis. To exclude the influence of obesity and sex, NAFLD participants were matched to non-NAFLD participants based on BMI and sex. The relative abundance of each bacterial taxa in fecal samples was calculated using 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and was compared between NAFLD and non-NAFLD participants.There were 205 (23.%) participants defined as having NAFLD. Before matching, there were significant differences in the relative abundance of more than 1% in two classes, two orders, three families, and three genera including Faecalibacterium between NAFLD and non-NAFLD participants.

Recently, it has been proposed that excess dietary choline consumption is metabolized to trimethylamine (TMA) by the gut ; TMA is then oxidized to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver. Epidemiological studies have clearly shown a positive correlation between plasma TMAO concentrations and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, some studies have shown an association between excess dietary choline, plasma TMAO concentrations, and atherosclerotic lesion size in apoE knockout (Apoe-/-) mice.The aim of this study was to further investigate the relation between dietary choline and atherosclerosis in 2 atherogenic mouse models, the LDL receptor knockout (Ldlr-/-) and Apoe-/- mice.Six feeding trials were performed in Ldlr-/- (40% high-fat diet) and Apoe-/- (unpurified diet) male mice, aged 8-10 wk. Mice randomly received control diet (0.1% choline), or choline- (1% choline), betaine- (0.1% choline and 0.9% betaine), or TMAO- (0.1% choline and 0.12% or 0.2% TMAO) supplemented diet for ≤28 wk. After the dietary intervention, the animals were killed and tissues and blood collected. Aortic atherosclerotic plaque area, plasma lipids, and choline metabolites were quantified.In Ldlr-/- mice, dietary supplementation for 8 wk with choline or TMAO increased plasma TMAO concentrations by 1.6- and 4-fold, respectively. After 16 wk, there was a 2-fold increase in plasma TMAO after dietary TMAO supplementation. In Apoe-/- mice, dietary supplementation with choline, betaine, or TMAO for 12 wk did not increase plasma TMAO concentrations. However, choline and TMAO supplementation for 28 wk significantly increased plasma TMAO concentrations by 1.8- and 1.-fold, respectively. Contrary to predictions, atherosclerotic lesion size was not altered by any of the dietary interventions, irrespective of mouse model.In our study, high intakes of dietary choline or TMAO supplementation did not influence atherosclerosis development in Ldlr-/- or Apoe-/- male mice.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548686>Gut bacteria responding to dietary change encode sialidases that exhibit preference for red meat-associated carbohydrates.</a></h2><p>Dietary habits have been associated with alterations of the human gut resident microorganisms contributing to obesity, diabetes and cancer. In Western diets, red meat is a frequently eaten food, but long-term consumption has been associated with increased risk of disease. Red meat is enriched in N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) that cannot be synthesized by humans. However, consumption can cause Neu5Gc incorporation into cell surface glycans, especially in carcinomas. As a consequence, an inflammatory response is triggered when Neu5Gc-containing glycans encounter circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Although bacteria can use free sialic acids as a nutrient source, it is currently unknown if gut microorganisms contribute to releasing Neu5Gc from food. We found that a Neu5Gc-rich diet induces changes in the gut , with Bacteroidales and Clostridiales responding the most. Genome assembling of mouse and human shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified bacterial sialidases with previously unobserved substrate preference for Neu5Gc-containing glycans. X-ray crystallography revealed key amino acids potentially contributing to substrate preference. Additionally, we verified that mouse and human sialidases were able to release Neu5Gc from red meat. The release of Neu5Gc from red meat using bacterial sialidases could reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases associated with red meat consumption, including colorectal cancer and atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558046>Multispecies biofilm formation by the contaminating  in raw milk.</a></h2><p>Biofilms can be formed on the surfaces of dairy processing equipment and are a potential source of product contamination. This study evaluated the diversity of multispecies biofilms formed on stainless steel (SS) due to the contaminating  in raw milk. Samples of raw milk were used: one was fresh milk and the other maintained in refrigerated bulk tanks for up to 48 h. The mesophilic aerobic contamination was ∼10 CFU ml in fresh milk and 10 CFU ml in bulk milk. SS coupons were kept immersed in the milk at 7 ±2 °C for 10 days, and every two days, the raw milk was changed for samples of the same origin collected on the current day. After incubation for 10 days, sessile cells in the biofilm reached 10 CFU cm in the presence of fresh milk, and 10 CFU cm in the presence of bulk milk. The genetic diversity analysis showed that Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli predominated in the biofilms throughout the incubation of both milk samples and these biofilms showed a reduction in diversity over time.

Two previous cohort studies of the association between talc use and uterine cancer have reported weak positive associations, but we know of no previous evaluations of the relationship between douching and uterine cancer.Using a large prospective cohort, we examined the relationship between incident uterine cancer and self-reported use of talc or douche using Cox proportional hazards models.After excluding those with prior hysterectomy, 271 of 33,609 women reported incident uterine cancer (mean follow-up = 8.3 years in noncases; maximum 12.6 years). Overall, 26% of women reported ever using talc and 15% reported ever having douched. Ever talc use was associated with an increase in risk of uterine cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94, 1.6), with some evidence of a dose-response for frequency of talc use (P-for-trend = 0.07). Ever douching was not associated with uterine cancer risk (HR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.72, 1.), with no evidence of a frequency dose-response (P = 0.96). The estimates were similar when we restricted to invasive endometrial cancers, but not when we further restricted to endometroid adenocarcinomas.The positive association we observed between talc use and uterine cancer risk is consistent with findings from previous prospective cohort studies of endometrial cancer. The relationships between uterine cancer and both douching and talc use merit further consideration, particularly as both exposures are preventable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600928>Prevalence of Resistance to β-Lactam Antibiotics and  Genes Among Commensal  Isolates from Respiratory  in Poland.</a></h2><p>(1) Background: Beta-lactams are the most frequently used antimicrobials, and are the first-line drugs in many infectious diseases, e.g., pneumonia, otitis media.

The gut microbiome is a crucial modulator of visceral pain, whereas recent evidence suggests that gut  may also play a critical role in many other types of chronic pain, including inflammatory pain, headache, neuropathic pain, and opioid tolerance. We present a narrative review of the current understanding on the role of gut  in pain regulation and discuss the possibility of targeting gut  for the management of chronic pain. Numerous signalling molecules derived from gut , such as by-products of , metabolites, neurotransmitters, and neuromodulators, act on their receptors and remarkably regulate the peripheral and central sensitisation, which in turn mediate the development of chronic pain. Gut -derived mediators serve as critical modulators for the induction of peripheral sensitisation, directly or indirectly regulating the excitability of primary nociceptive neurones. In the central nervous system, gut -derived mediators may regulate neuroinflammation, which involves the activation of cells in the blood-brain barrier, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells, to modulate induction and maintenance of central sensitisation. Thus, we propose that gut  regulates pain in the peripheral and central nervous system, and targeting gut  by diet and pharmabiotic intervention may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the management of chronic pain.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The main transmission route is from toddlers, who commonly carry pneumococci. However, neonatal pneumococcal disease case reports suggest that vertical pneumococcal transmission may also occur.To describe and compare pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage and density by infant mode of delivery in young Fijian infants.Annual cross-sectional surveys were performed in Suva, Fiji, before the introduction of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), from September 14 to December 20, 2012, and after PCV10 was introduced, from July 11 to November 19, 2013; July 15 to December 9, 2014; and August 13 to November 19, 2015. Caregivers of 2006 infants aged  to 8 weeks participated in the surveys. Statistical analysis was performed from May 24, 2018, to August 12, 2019.Caregivers provided data on infant mode of delivery and demographics via interviewer-led survey.Pneumococci in swab samples were detected and quantified by lytA quantitative polymerase chain reaction with molecular serotyping by microarray. Pneumococci were categorized as PCV10 or non-PCV10 serotypes.Of the 2006 infants (976 girls and 1030 boys; mean [SD] age, 6.1 [0.02] weeks]), 1742 (86.8%) were born vaginally and 264 were born by cesarean delivery. Infants delivered vaginally, compared with those born by cesarean delivery, had a higher prevalence of overall pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage (470 of 1722 [27.3%; 95% CI, 25.2%-29.4%] vs 47 of 260 [18.1%; 95% CI, 13.6%-23.3%]; P = .002), PCV10 carriage (113 of 1698 [6.7%; 95% CI, .%-7.9%] vs 8 of 256 [3.1%; 95% CI, 1.4%-6.1%]; P = .03), and non-PCV10 carriage (355 of 1698 [20.9%; 95% CI, 19.0%-22.9%] vs 38 of 256 [14.8%; 95% CI, 10.7%-19.8%]; P = .02), and had higher median densities of overall pneumococci (4.9 log10 genome equivalents [GE]/mL [interquartile range, 4.8-.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4. log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.1-4.6 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 pneumococci (4.9 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.7-.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4.4 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.0-4.7 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01). Vaginal delivery was associated with overall (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.10-2.23]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.01-2.20]; P = .04]) pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage. Vaginal delivery was not associated with PCV10 carriage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.80-3.51]; P = .17). After adjustment, vaginal delivery was not associated with density.Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence and density were higher in infants delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean birth. After adjustment, vaginal delivery was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Differences in carriage by mode of delivery may be due to differential exposure to the vaginal  during delivery and the effect of intrapartum antibiotics during cesarean delivery on the infant microbiome. Our findings also raise the hypothesis that vertical transmission may contribute to pneumococcal acquisition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543288>Antibiotic Use and Risk of Incident Kidney Stones in Female Nurses.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiome may affect urinary stone disease by modulating the amount of oxalate absorbed from the intestine and subsequently excreted in urine. This study sought to explore the association between antibiotics, which alter the intestinal , and risk for urinary stone disease.Prospective cohort study.,010 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I and II who had collected 24-hour urine samples.Use of antibiotics during the age range of 40 to 49 (NHS II), 40 to 59 (NHS I), and 20 to 39 years (both cohorts).Incident symptomatic urinary stone disease; urine composition.Cause-specific hazards regression adjusted for age, body mass index, comorbid conditions, thiazide use, and dietary factors. Follow-up was censored at the time of asymptomatic kidney stones, cancer, or death.Cumulative use of antibiotics for a total of 2 or more months during the age range of 40 to 49 years (NHS II) and 40 to 59 years (NHS II) was associated with significantly higher risk for developing incident stones compared with no use (pooled HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.96). Similar results were found for the period of 20 to 39 years (pooled HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.84). Results were unchanged after excluding participants who reported urinary tract infection with their stone event or as the most common reason for antibiotic use. Urine composition was generally similar across antibiotic groups except for marginally lower urine pH and citrate values among those taking antibiotics for 2 or more months.Observational design; lack of information for type of antibiotic used; relatively large span of time between antibiotic use and urine collection.Use of antibiotics for more than 2 months in early adulthood and middle age is associated with higher risk for urinary stone disease in later life.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis remain unclear. After DSS-induced colitis were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut  by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced colitis. KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty acid degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated colitis as compared with the DSS group. Further investigations revealed that TOE increased the expression levels of Adh5, Aldh3a2 and Acox3, but decreased those of CCL20, CCR6 and CXCL1/ in DSS-induced colitis, where TOE also induced the enrichment of S24-7 and adlercreutzia, but decreased the amount of anaerostipes, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and peptostreptococcaceae. In conclusion, TOE ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by regulating fatty acid degradation and microbial dysbiosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal  in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and immunity.A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at  weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time 2). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo.Probiotics may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥  weeks.

The gut of children with optimum growth is enriched in certain species, especially  and  and ommensal  both contribute to formation of acidic stool, and an elevated faecal pH indicates reduction of these species in the gut. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of faecal pH with childhood stunting.In this cross-sectional study, 100 children with length-for-age Z score (LAZ) <-1 aged between 12 and 18 months were enrolled from the ongoing Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. LAZ was measured by anthropometry and data on factors affecting linear growth were recorded. Faecal pH measurement was done using pH metre on freshly collected non-diarrhoeal faecal samples following standard procedure. Multiple quantile regression was done to quantify the relation between faecal pH and LAZ scores.The mean LAZ and faecal pH of the children were -2.12±0.80 and .84±1.11, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant negative correlation between stool pH and the LAZ scores (p<0.01). After inclusion of other factors affecting linear growth into the regression model, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between faecal pH and LAZ score (p<0.01).Elevated faecal pH was found to have a significant association with stunted growth.

In each trial, one hundred and eighty 18-day-old embryos were allocated into 1 of 2 groups: Control and treated group (inoculated with 107 BBP). On day 19 of embryogenesis, seeder embryos (n = 18) were inoculated with 4. × 104E. coli/mL+272 μg/mL tetracycline and segregated into mesh hatching bags. Twelve chicks per group were euthanized at hatch and at day 7 to evaluate the gastrointestinal composition of total GNB or total aerobic pasteurized bacteria. Also, in trial 2, ceca content from five chickens at day 7 were collected to evaluate  composition. Embryos inoculated with BBP showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the total number of GNB at day-of-hatch (DOH) and day 7. Probiotic treatment increased BW at DOH and day 7, and BW gain (days 0 to 7) when compared with Control chickens. Proteobacteria phylum was significantly reduced, while the Firmicutes was significantly increased by the BBP as compared to the Control (P < 0.05). At family level, Enterobacteriaceae was significantly decreased, while the Lachnospiraceae was significantly elevated in the BBP as compared to the Control group (P < 0.05). The genus Oscillospira was significantly enriched in the BBP group, whereas the unidentified genus of family Enterobacteriaceae in the Control group (P < 0.05). The BBP group increased the bacterial species richness, although there was no significant difference between treatments (P > 0.05). Interestingly, beta diversity showed a significant difference in bacterial community structure between Control and BBP groups (P < 0.05). The results of the present study suggest that in ovo administration of a BBP can reduce the severity of virulent E. coli horizontal transmission and infection of broiler chickens during hatch. The reduction in the severity of the transmission and infection by the BPP might be achieved through alterations of  composition and its community structure.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665625>Neutrophil Recruitment to Noninvasive MRSA at the Stratum Corneum of Human Skin Mediates Transient Colonization.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of skin and soft issue infection, but paradoxically, it also transiently, and often harmlessly, colonizes human skin. An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Soil aggregates are supposed to provide heterogeneous habitats for microorganisms, which may result in distinct metabolic functions. However, limited information is available regarding the distribution patterns, driving factors, and activity of ureolytic  at the aggregate scale. In this study, we characterized the ureolytic  and urease activity of three soil aggregate fractions from an Inceptisol subjected to  years of different fertilization regimes. Correlations between soil chemical characteristics and ureolytic microbial communities were analyzed. The results showed that the total abundance as well as the relative abundance of copiotrophic ureolytic microbes generally increased with the increasing soil aggregate size. This trend was in line with the nutrient distribution patterns, including labile carbon, NH, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Soil urease activity also increased significantly with the increasing soil aggregate size and was positively correlated with copiotrophic ureolyric microbes, such as Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Thus, we speculated that larger size soil aggregates with greater availability of labile carbon support more copiotrophic ureolyric microbes with a high growth rate, leading to a high density of total ureolytic microbes and higher urease activity. Smaller aggregates with less available carbon were associated with more oligotrophs, higher abundances of total ureolytic microbes, and higher urease activity. Our results suggest that larger soil aggregates and associated ureolyric microbes play a more important role in nutrient cycling for crop growth in this Inceptisol ecosystem.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643033>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Pyridostigmine Bromide Attenuates Gut Pathology and Bacterial Dysbiosis in a Murine Model of Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a Th2 inflammatory bowel disease characterized by increased IL- and IL-13 expression, eosinophilic/neutrophilic infiltration, decreased mucus production, impaired epithelial barrier, and bacterial dysbiosis of the colon. Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut  were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628420>Changes in motor behavior, neuropathology, and gut  of a Batten disease mouse model following administration of acidified drinking water.</a></h2><p>CLN3 mutations cause the fatal neurodegenerative disorder, CLN3 Batten disease. The Cln3 mouse model displays characteristic features of the human disease including motor deficits. When mice received acidified drinking water (pH 2.-2.9) instead of normal tap water (pH 8.4) for several generations, the motor skills of Cln3 mice normalized to control levels, indicating a disease-modifying effect of acidified water. Here we investigated if acidified water administered from postnatal day 21 has therapeutic benefits in Cln3 mice. Indeed, acidified water temporarily attenuated the motor deficits, had beneficial effects on behavioral parameters and prevented microglial activation in the brain of Cln3 mice. Interestingly, in control mice, acidified drinking water caused brain region-specific glial activation and significant changes in motor performance. Since the gut  can influence neurological functions, we examined it in our disease model and found that the gut  of Cln3 mice was markedly different from control mice, and acidified water differentially changed the gut  composition in these mice. These results indicate that acidified water may provide therapeutic benefit to CLN3 Batten disease patients, and that the pH of drinking water is a major environmental factor that strongly influences the results of murine behavioral and pathological studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut-microbiome axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>DNA of gut  can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with  mg iron (2. mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2. mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7. g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.-9. months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut . There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut  response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606534>Inflammation inhibition and gut  regulation by TSG to combat atherosclerosis in ApoE mice.</a></h2><p>2,3,,4'-Tetrahydroxy-stilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside (TSG) is the main active component of Polygoni Multiflori Radix, a root of the homonymous plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. TSG has protective effects on the liver, reduces cholesterol and possesses anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. However, the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action of Polygonum multiflorum on atherosclerosis (AS) have not been studied yet.The aim of this research was to study the effects of Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata (PMRP) and its major active chemical constituent TSG on AS in ApoE-deficient (ApoE) mice fed with high fat diets to provide a scientific basis in the use of PMRP and TSG against cardiovascular diseases.High fat diet induced AS in ApoE mice were treated with PMRP, TSG (low and high doses), and simvastatin (SIM) for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, mouse serum lipid levels, triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by an oxidase method (other indicators were determined by ELISA), while the content in oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and the expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the serum and aortic samples were measured by ELISA. Atherosclerotic plaque morphology was evaluated by oil red O in thoracic aorta. In addition, 16S rDNA-V4 hypervariable region genome sequence of all microbes in the fecal sample from each group was analyzed to evaluate potential structure changes in the gut  after treatment with PMRP and TSG.TSG markedly inhibited AS plaque formation in ApoE mice. Furthermore, PMRP and TSG improved lipid accumulation by reducing TG and ox-LDL levels. TSG inhibited inflammation by the down-regulation of IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression in serum, and PMRP inhibited inflammation by reducing VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and CCRA expression in aortic tissue. In addition, TSG reduced or prevented AS by the regulation of the composition of the overall gut , such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Proteobacteria phyla, Akkermensia genera and Helicobacter pylori.PMRP and TSG improved lipid accumulation and inflammation, and regulated the intestinal microbial imbalance in ApoE mice. TSG exerted a preventive effect in the development and progression of AS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Statistical analyses focused on intraindividual and interindividual bacterial diversity and identification of differentially abundant taxa.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls had similar microbiome profiles of the gut  regarding intraindividual bacterial diversity, OTU distribution, ratio between regional and local species diversity when testing all OTUs, and genera with a relative abundance greater than 0.%. Similarly, the subgroup of NMDAR encephalitis patients with an ovarian teratoma (n = 3) showed no differences in microbiome variation compared with controls. Patients in the acute encephalitis stage (n = 8) showed significant differences in the numbers of , , , , and ; however, significance was lost after correction for multiple testing.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls both had a normal gut microbiome. The lack of overabundance of certain bacterial species in patients suggests that microbiome changes are no major contributors to the pathogenesis, disease course, or prognosis in NMDAR encephalitis. Despite the small sample size and heterogeneous groups, findings indicate differences to other neuroimmunologic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In the present study, we evaluated longitudinal changes in the NP  with a focus on lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB) and their linkage with BRD-associated bacteria in steers ( = 13) that were first transported to an auction market, and then to a feedlot. Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at the farm before transportation to the auction market (day 0), at feedlot placement (day 2), and  (day 7) and 12 (day 14) days after feedlot placement. Swabs were processed for the assessment of the NP  using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and for the detection of , and  by culturing. Possible associations among the top 15 most relatively abundant bacterial genera were predicted using a stepwise-selected generalized linear mixed model. Correlations between LAB and BRD-associated  families were also assessed. In addition, antimicrobial activity of selected LAB isolates against  was evaluated . A noticeable shift was observed in the NP microbial community structure, and in the relative abundance of LAB families as a result of auction market exposure, transport and feedlot placement. Varying degrees of positive or negative associations between the 15 most relatively abundant genera were observed. Many of the LAB families were inversely correlated with the BRD-associated  family as the cattle were transported to the auction market and then to the feedlot. Nearly all steers were culture-negative for  and , and  became less prevalent after feedlot placement. Isolates from the , and  families inhibited the growth of .

We sought to determine the feasibility of a high GLV dietary intervention in adults with an increased risk of CC () via a 12-week randomized controlled crossover trial. Participants were randomized to immediate or delayed (post-4-week washout) intervention groups. During the 4-week intervention period, participants were given frozen GLVs and counseled to consume one cooked cup equivalent daily. The primary outcomes were: accrual-recruiting 50 adults in 9 months; retention-retaining 80% of participants at completion; and adherence-meeting GLV intake goals on 90% of days. Adherence data were collected twice weekly and 24-h dietary recalls at each time point provided nutrient and food group measures. The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed to determine acceptability. On each of the four study visits, anthropometrics, stool, saliva, and blood were obtained. Fifty adults were recruited in 44 days. Participants were 48 ± 13 years of age, 62% female, and 80% Caucasian, with an average BMI at screening of 35.9 ± .1. Forty-eight (96%) participants were retained and completed the study. During the intervention phase, participants consumed GLVs on 88.8% of days; the adherence goal of one cup was met on 73.2% of days. Dietary recall-derived Vitamin K and GLVs significantly increased for all participants during the intervention periods. Overall satisfaction did not differ between intervention and control periods ( = 0.214). This feasibility trial achieved accrual, retention and acceptability goals, but fell slightly short of the benchmark for adherence.

Gut  exerts a fundamental role on host physiology, and how extrinsic perturbations influence its composition has been increasingly examined. However, the effect of DBPs on gut  is still poorly understood. In the present study, adult zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations of dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm, an emerging nitrogenous DBP) for 30 days. Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons revealed a significant change in the richness and diversity of  in the gut of DCAcAm-exposed zebrafish. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased and the abundance of Fusobacteria and Firmicutes increased significantly in the gut after exposure to 100 and 500 μg/L DCAcAm. At the genus level, the abundances of several bacteria which are considered pathogens or opportunistic pathogens in fish and closely related to fish metabolism, disease and inflammation (Aeromonas, Stenotrophomonas, Bacteroides and Ralstonia) increased in the DCAcAm-treated groups.

Novel alternatives to traditional antibiotics, such as peptidomimetics, have the potential to address this challenge. Previously, two series of cationic amphiphiles (CAms) were developed with both hydrophilic head groups and nonpolar domains, giving them the ability to self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with membrane-lytic properties. Those CAms were shown to be effective against biofilms of Gardnerella vaginalis while preserving the commensal . Two new series of CAms were designed with varying levels of flexibility between the hydrophilic head groups and the hydrophobic domains. Activities against the vaginal pathogen G. vaginalis ranged from 1.3 µM to 18. µM, while the tested vaginal lactobacilli were significantly more tolerant of CAms, with MIC values as high as 208 µM. Minimal biofilm bactericidal concentrations (MBC-Bs) of the tested CAms ranged from 21.47 µM to < 388.3 µM, and were lowest against resistant forms of G. vaginalis, while Lactobacillus biofilms were tolerant of concentrations ≥ 687 µM. Safety aspects of the CAms were also investigated, and they were found to be safe for use against vaginal ectocervical tissue.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556231>Anti-TNF-α therapy alters the gut  in proteoglycan-induced ankylosing spondylitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, progressive disease, and its treatment is relevant to the gut . Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) therapy alters the gut  in many diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, little is known about the effect of TNF-α blocker treatment on the gut  in ankylosing spondylitis. Herein, the effect of a TNF-α blocker on the gut  in proteoglycan-induced arthritis was investigated. Proteoglycan-induced mice were treated with an rhTNFR:Fc solution of etanercept ( µg/g) for 4 weeks. rhTNFR:Fc treatment attenuated the arthritis incidence and severity of arthritis in the proteoglycan-induced mice and decreased inflammation in the ankle joints and ameliorated ileal tissue destruction. Moreover, high gut permeability occurred, and zonula occludens-1 and occludin protein levels were reduced in proteoglycan-induced mice. These levels were significantly restored by the administration of rhTNFR:Fc. The serum TNF-α and IL-17 levels were also decreased. In addition, flora analysis via 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that rhTNFR:Fc treatment restored the gut  composition to a composition similar to that in control mice. In conclusion, anti-TNF-α therapy attenuated proteoglycan-induced arthritis progression and modulated the gut  and intestinal barrier function.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1. cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata. Large and well-designed studies are required to confirm the role of FMT in alopecia areata.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

In the present study, the association between LPS and the dysbiosis of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome was determined in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (T2DM-CKD; stages 4 and , not on dialysis) compared with healthy individuals. Microbiome diversity was analyzed in patients with T2DM-CKD and healthy controls by sequencing the hypervariable sub-regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from stool samples. Serum samples were assayed by ELISA for LPS, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL6) and endothelin-1. A total of four gut Gram-negative phyla (Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) were identified in the gut microbiome of the T2DM-CKD and control groups. Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in patients with T2DM-CKD when compared with controls (P<0.05). The levels of serum LPS were significantly increased in patients with T2DM-CKD compared with controls (P<0.05). Elevated serum LPS was significantly correlated with increased levels of TNFα, IL6 and CRP. The dysbiosis of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome of patients with T2DM-CKD may contribute to the elevated serum levels of LPS and the consequential effects on the inflammatory biomarkers in these patients. The association between the dysbiosis of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome of patients with T2DM-CKD, increased LPS levels and the effects on inflammatory biomarkers may provide insight into potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the treatment of T2DM-CKD.Copyright: © Salguero et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut  Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut  play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different  is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the  and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different  but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different  but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut  in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut  induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut . Still, these different gut  have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

Fecal samples were collected at Days 0, 1, 2, 3, , and 10. Samples were homogenized and plated on LB plates supplemented with NalAc to determine viable Ec231 counts. Body weights were measured at every fecal sample collection point. qPCR was performed using specific  O157:H7 primers to quantify the number of  O157:H7 genome copies.  community profiles were analyzed using Denature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA sequencing. F.O.P. significantly ( < 0.05) reduced  O157:H7 pathogen counts by 54%. Ampicillin therapy significantly ( < 0.05) reduced  O157:H7 pathogen counts by 79%. Greater initial weight-loss occurred in mice treated with ampicillin (-.44%) compared to other treatment groups. No notable changes in the gut  profiles were observed for control and F.O.P. groups. In contrast, the antibiotic group displayed noticeable distortion of the gut  composition, only partially returning to normal by Day 10. In conclusion, we found that F.O.P. administration was effective in reducing viable  O157:H7 in infected mice with a similar efficacy to ampicillin therapy.

Overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (2. vs 26 months, P < .001), melanoma (3.9 vs 14 months, P < .001), and other tumor types (1.1 vs 11, P < .001) was consistently worse in those who received pATBs vs those who did not. Multivariate analyses confirmed that pATB therapy (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9-6.1; P < .001) and response to ICI therapy (HR, 8.2; 95% CI, 4.0-16.9; P < .001) were associated with OS independent of tumor site, disease burden, and performance status.Despite being limited by sample size, geographic origin, and the lack of correlative analyses on patients' gut , this study suggests that pATB therapy but not cATB therapy is associated with a worse treatment response and OS in unselected patients treated with ICIs in routine clinical practice.

Here we evaluate the responses to different levels of fat in the diet using both chow diet (CD, 13-18% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD, 45-60% fat). We studied cohorts of BXD strains, both inbred parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (commonly known as B6 and D2, respectively), as well as B6D2 and D2B6 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The comparative impact of genetic and dietary factors was analyzed by profiling a range of phenotypes, most prominently their cecum bacterial composition. The parents of the BXDs and F1 hybrids express limited differences in terms of weight and body fat gain on CD. In contrast, the strain differences on HFD are substantial for percent body fat, with DBA/2J accumulating 12.% more fat than C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001). The F1 hybrids born to DBA/2J dams (D2B6F1) have 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) than those born to C57BL/6J dams. Sequence analysis of the cecum  reveals important differences in bacterial composition among BXD family members with a substantial shift in composition caused by HFD. Relative to CD, the HFD induces a decline in diversity at the phylum level with a substantial increase in Firmicutes (+13.8%) and a reduction in Actinobacteria (-7.9%). In the majority of BXD strains, the HFD also increases cecal sIgA (P < 0.0001)-an important component of the adaptive immunity response against microbial pathogens. Host genetics modulates variation in cecum bacterial composition at the genus level in CD, with significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Oscillibacter mapped to Chr 3 (18.7-19.2 Mb, LRS = 21.4) and for Bifidobacterium mapped to Chr 6 (89.21-89.37 Mb, LRS = 19.4). Introduction of HFD served as an environmental suppressor of these QTLs due to a reduction in the contribution of both genera (P < 0.001). Relations among liver metabolites and cecum bacterial composition were predominant in CD cohort, but these correlations do not persist following the shift to HFD. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important impact of environmental/dietary manipulation on the relationships between host genetics, gastrointestinal bacterial composition, immunological parameters, and metabolites-knowledge that will help in the understanding of the causal sources of metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546035>Effects of dietary Gelsemium elegans alkaloids on intestinal morphology, antioxidant status, immune responses and  of Megalobrama amblycephala.</a></h2><p>Numerous plant extracts used as feed additives in aquaculture have been shown to stimulate appetite, promote growth and enhance immunostimulatory and disease resistance in cultured fish.

Food preference testing was conducted using a two-pan method-control diet vs. four treatment diets-for 4 days for each additive diet, a total 16 days in 9 beagles. Feces were collected to enumerate bacterial counts. Preferences for glasswort and Ganghwa mugwort were higher than those of the control ( < 0.05). Furthermore, fecal  enumeration displayed a higher number of beneficial microorganisms in treated groups.

It was found that treatment with JGT or -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) alleviated the severity of colitis symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of gut microbiome revealed that JGT groups were clearly separated from the DSS group, suggesting that JGT administration altered gut . The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were decreased by DSS but increased by JGT include  and . On the other hand, OTUs that were increased by DSS but decreased by -ASA or JGT treatments include Bacteroidales S24-7, Ruminococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae, and the genera , , , and . After JGT administration, the metabolites, including most amino acids and lactic acid that were altered by colitis induction, became similar to those of the control group.

Low-dose antibiotics have historically been used to modulate food production animals and their microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or without two different probiotics (8 cage units,  = 80 per group). Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls. Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be beneficial for humans. Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their , similar to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise for modulating the avian host and its .Copyright © 2019 Ward et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577818>Highly diverse anaerobe-predominant vaginal  among HIV-infected pregnant women in Zambia.</a></h2><p>Vaginal dysbiosis has been shown to increase the risk of some adverse birth outcomes. HIV infection may be associated with shifts in the vaginal microbiome. We characterized microbial communities in vaginal swabs collected between 16-20 gestational weeks in the Zambian Preterm Birth Prevention Study to investigate whether HIV and its treatment alter the microbiome in pregnancy. We quantified relative abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and identified community state types (CST) by hierarchical clustering. Associations between exposures-HIV serostatus (HIV+ vs HIV-) and preconceptional ART (ART+ vs ART-)-and microbiome characteristics were tested with rank-sum, and by linear and logistic regression, accounting for sampling by inverse-probability weighting. Of 261 vaginal swabs, 256 (98%) had evaluable sequences; 98 (38%) were from HIV+ participants, 55 (56%) of whom had preconceptional ART exposure. Major CSTs were dominated by: L. crispatus (CST 1; 17%), L.] iners (CST 3; 32%), Gardnerella vaginalis (CST 4-I; 37%), G. vaginalis & Atopobium vaginae (CST 4-II; %), and other mixed anaerobes (CST 4-III; 9%). G. vaginalis was present in 95%; mean relative abundance was higher in HIV+ (0.46±0.29) compared to HIV- participants (0.35±0.33; rank-sum p = .01). Shannon diversity was higher in HIV+/ART+ (coeff 0.17; 95%CI (0.01,0.33), p = .04) and HIV+/ART- (coeff 0.37; 95%CI (0.19,0.55), p < .001) participants compared to HIV-. Anaerobe-dominant CSTs were more prevalent in HIV+/ART+ (63%, AOR 3.11; 95%CI: 1.48,6.55, p = .003) and HIV+/ART- (85%, AOR 7.59; 95%CI (2.80,20.6), p < .001) compared to HIV- (45%).

Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial fecal  transplantation (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function,  composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement.

In this study, transfer of an antibiotic resistance plasmid from a commensal E. coli originating from a broiler chicken towards the human intestinal  was assessed by using a Mucosal Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (M-SHIME). This in vitro model mimics the human intestinal ecosystem and received a single dose of 10E. coli MB6212, which harbors a plasmid known to confer resistance towards several antibiotics including tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and cefotaxime. Since the degree of stress imposed by stomach pH and bile acids vary with the consumed meal size, the effect of meal size on E. coli donor survival and on plasmid transfer towards lumen and mucosal coliforms and anaerobes was determined. The administered commensal E. coli strain survived stomach acid and bile salt stress and was able to grow in the colon environment during the timeframe of the experiment (72 h). Transfer of antibiotic resistance was observed rapidly since cultivable transconjugant coliforms and anaerobes were already detected in the lumen and mucosa after 2 h in the simulated proximal colon. The presence of the resistance plasmid in the transconjugants was confirmed by PCR. Differences in meal size and adapted digestion had neither a detectable impact on antibiotic resistance transfer, nor on the survival of the E. coli donor strain, nor on short chain fatty acid profiles. The median number of resistant indigenous coliforms in the lumen of the inoculated colon vessels was .00 × 10 cfu/ml [min - max: 3.47 × 10-3.70 × 10 cfu/ml], and on the mucosa 1.44 × 10 cfu/g [min-max: 4.00 × 10-4.00 × 10 cfu/g]. Exact quantification of the anaerobic transconjugants was difficult, as (intrinsic) resistant anaerobic background  were present. QPCR data supported the observation of plasmid transfer in the simulated colon. Moreover, inoculation of E. coli MB6212 had no significant impact on the microbial diversity in the lumen as determined by 16 S ribosomal gene based next generation sequencing on lumen samples. This study demonstrates that a commensal, antibiotic resistant E. coli strain present in food can transfer its antibiotic resistance plasmid relatively quickly to intestinal  in the M-SHIME. The spread and persistence of antibiotic resistance genes and resistant bacteria in our intestinal system is an alarming scenario which might present clinical challenges, since it implies a potential reservoir for dissemination to pathogenic bacteria.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin B and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within  d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery.

The dynamics of intestinal microflora in response to particulate pollutants is unclear. The present study investigated changes in the gut  related to pollutant exposure using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). DNA was extracted from fecal samples. Amplicon Generation and the quality control of PCR products were performed. PCR products was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data analysis included: operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering and species annotation, alpha diversity, beta diversity, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and the use of PICRUSt bioinformatics software. The microbial diversity of the SHR rats was inversely associated with exposure to pollutants. In terms of relative abundance, 24 bacterial genera and 2 genera in particular ( and ) significantly declined, and one genus () increased. Moreover, pollutant exposure was associated with the accumulation of genes from the gut  that are implicated in cardiovascular diseases. From the long-term exposure experiment, rats appeared to respond to pollutant injury.

This study investigated how maternal versus artificial rearing shapes the rumen  using 24 sets of triplet lambs. Lambs within each sibling set were randomly assigned to natural rearing on the ewe (NN); ewe colostrum for 24 h followed by artificial milk feeding (NA); and colostrum alternative and artificial milk feeding (AA). Maternal colostrum feeding enhanced VFA production at weaning but not thereafter. At weaning, lambs reared on milk replacer had no rumen protozoa and lower microbial diversity, whereas natural rearing accelerated the rumen microbial development and facilitated the transition to solid diet. Differences in the rumen prokaryotic communities disappear later in life when all lambs were grouped on the same pasture up to 23 weeks of age. However, NN animals retained higher fungal diversity and abundances of Piromyces, Feramyces and Diplodiniinae protozoa as well as higher feed digestibility (+4%) and animal growth (+6.%) during the grazing period. Nevertheless, no correlations were found between rumen  and productive outcomes. These findings suggest that the early life nutritional intervention determine the initial rumen microbial community, but the persistence of these effects later in life is weak.© 2019 The Authors.

Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of irritant laxatives causes serious side effects. Meanwhile, more than 50% of patients are dissatisfied with sense of use of non-prescriptional laxatives. -glucans are natural polysaccharides widely found in yeast, fungus, and plants, which have been reported to exhibit various pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of -glucans extracted from the bread yeast cell wall on loperamide-induced constipation mice. Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with 2., , and 10 mg/kg -glucan. We assessed the defecation frequency, intestinal transit function of mice, as well as used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal  composition and functional biological profiles data. Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (-HT) and expression of tight junction protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. -glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that -glucans can influence the intestinal  and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical barrier. We suggested that -glucans could be used as an active nutritional supplement to protect the damaged intestinal barrier and help patients who have constipation complications and dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652348>Nod-like receptors are critical for gut-brain axis signalling in mice.</a></h2><p>Nod-like receptors regulate cognition, anxiety, and HPA-axis activation Nod-like receptors regulate central and peripheral serotonergic biology Nod-like receptors are important for maintenance of GI physiology Intestinal epithelial cell expression of Nod1 receptors regulate behaviour ABSTRACT: Gut-brain axis signalling is critical for maintaining health and homeostasis. Stressful life events can impact gut-brain signalling, leading to altered mood, cognition and intestinal dysfunction. Here we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLR), Nod1 and Nod2, as novel regulators for gut-brain signalling. NLR are innate immune pattern recognition receptors expressed in the gut and brain, important in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We found that mice deficient in both Nod1 and Nod2 (NodDKO) demonstrate signs of stress-induced anxiety, cognitive impairment and depression in the context of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These deficits were coupled with impairments in the serotonergic pathway in the brain, decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and immature neurons, as well as reduced neural activation. In addition, NodDKO mice had increased GI permeability and altered serotonin signalling in the gut following exposure to acute stress. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, abrogated behavioral impairments and restored serotonin signalling. We also identified that intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Nod1 (VilCre Nod1 ), but not Nod2, increased susceptibility to stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive impairment following exposure to stress. Together these data suggest that intestinal epithelial NLR are novel modulators of gut-brain communication and may serve as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of gut-brain disorders.

An international panel of experts presented key elements that will shape forthcoming FMT research and practice.Systematic search was performed, FMT literature was critically appraised and a 1-day round-table discussion was conducted to derive expert consensus on key issues in FMT research.16 experts convened and discussed five questions regarding (1) the role of donor and recipient microbial (bacteria, viruses, fungi) parameters in FMT; (2) methods to assess  alterations; (3) concept of keystone species and microbial predictors of FMT, (4) influence of recipient profile and antibiotics pretreatment on FMT engraftment and maintenance and () new developments in FMT formulations and delivery. The panel considered that variable outcomes of FMT relate to compositional and functional differences in recipient's , and likely donor-associated and recipient-associated physiological and genetic factors. Taxonomic composition of donor intestinal  may influence the efficacy of FMT in recurrent  infections and UC. FMT not only alters bacteria composition but also establishes trans-kingdom equilibrium between gut fungi, viruses and bacteria to promote the recovery of microbial homeostasis. FMT is not a one size fits all and studies are required to identify microbial components that have specific effects in patients with different diseases.FMT requires optimisation before their therapeutic promise can be evaluated for different diseases. This summary will guide future directions and priorities in advancement of the science and practice of FMT.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Particularly, root exudation is one of the most important plant-associated processes in this respect, as it may have a substantial effect on the bioavailability of soil contaminants, specially of hydrophobic contaminants strongly sorbed by soil. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of root exudates (natural and artificial) on the desorption of α-, β-, δ- and γ-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) from contaminated soil, using batch experiments. Natural root exudates were obtained from Holcus lanatus plants growing in the same (contaminated) area. Fifteen compounds (mainly organic acids and phenolic compounds) usually found in root exudates were also tested, individually or as mixtures (1 and 10 mM). Both natural and artificial exudates favoured the mobilization of sorbed HCH in soil. The effect was highly significant for α-, β- and γ-HCH isomers, for which the desorption rates increased by 23.0, 26.8 and 15.% in the presence of natural root exudates and by 40.1, 25.9 and 25.6% in the presence of the artificial mixture (at 10 mM). The δ-HCH desorption rates increased by less than 10%. The effect of individual exudate components was very variable, but increased with the carbon content, reflecting the significance of hydrophobic interactions between the exudates and HCH molecules in the desorption of these last from soil. These findings indicate that plants may significantly influence the bioavailability of persistent contaminants, with major implications for improving phyto- and bioremediation procedures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although high and/or moderate temperature in combination with US has been studied, the knowledge about cooling/low temperatures as well as its combined effect with chemical preservation methods is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the inactivation of Staphylococcus spp. (SA) present in the natural  of sliced Brazilian dry-cured loin (Socol, BDL) using US (40 kHz and .40 W/g) at 1.6-17.9 kJ/g, temperature (T) between 6.4 and 73.6 °C and peracetic acid (PA) between . and 274. mg/L employing the Central Composite Rotatable Design. The model fully describes how the combination of US, T, and PA affects SA inactivation. In BDL, an increase in US acoustic energy density (kJ/g) allows the reduction of T necessary to inactivate SA because of the occurrence of synergistic effect. However, US applied at low T was inefficient. On the other hand, PA was more efficient at low T, since high T degraded this compound at different rates according to the holding T. Therefore, the data indicates a relation between the technologies used in the combined decontamination of sliced BDL improving dry-cured meat safety.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of H1PV infection on rat gut . Inbred Wistar rats were infected with H1PV by routine gavage and clinical signs were recorded. Gross anatomical and histopathological examination of the gut was performed, as was immune cytokine analysis. The cecal contents were also collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. Gross anatomical examination showed distention of the ileum associated with flatulence after infection, while histopathological examination showed hyperemia and inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum. Upregulation of the interleukin-6 in sera in H1PV infected rats was also detected. The gut  had been significantly changed in H1PV infected rats: there was a reduction in several bacteria species including probiotic bacteria from the genera Parabacteroides and Butyricicoccus, while others were increased, including those from the genera Methanobrevibacter and Syntrophococcus. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic H1PV infection in rats leads to gastrointestinal inflammation with flatulence. The gut  alterations were associated with decreased polymorphisms, reduced abundance of probiotic bacteria and increased abundance of methane-producing bacteria.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659380>Cervical cancer and vaginal  changes.</a></h2><p>Microbial changes in vaginal ecosystem may accelerate the process of cervical carcinogenesis.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide; however, whether GM dysbiosis participates in the development of HF remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the specific changes in GM composition and function in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF in rats.The rats were divided into C (control), 4w-HF (ISO, 2. mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, intraperitoneally), and 2w-HF (ISO, 2. mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, intraperitoneally) groups. The cardiac structure and function in rats were assessed, and metagenomic analyses were then performed. Compared with the healthy control group, we found that the Shannon diversity index and microbial gene count in the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups was drastically decreased. High-throughput sequencing showed that the three groups differed in intestinal bacterial community composition. Overgrowth of bacteria, such as Prevotella, was observed in the 4w-HF group, with reduced growth of bacteria, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Butyrivibrio, associated with healthy status compared with the C group on the genus level. Concomitant with the alteration of GM composition, underrepresentation of health-linked microbial function was observed in both the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups compared with the C group.Iso-induced HF rats showed a significant decrease in the diversity and richness of the intestinal microbiome, with a downregulation of the key intestinal bacterial groups and overgrowth of bacteria considered to be involved in inflammatory responses as well as a decrease in health-linked microbial function.

Administration of  KBL375 significantly decreased dermatitis score, ear and dorsal thickness, and serum immunoglobulin E level in AD-induced mice. Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper 2 cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Taxonomic and functional analyses of gut  showed significantly higher cecum bacterial diversities and abundances including genus , and  in  KBL375-treated mice. Metabolic analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine, as well as short chain fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375. Therefore,  KBL375 could be useful for AD treatment by modulating the immune system and inducing various metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Kim, Jang, Han, Seo, Park, Lee and Ko.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623411>Tea Compounds and the Gut Microbiome: Findings from Trials and Mechanistic Studies.</a></h2><p>In recent years, the gut microbiome has become a focal point of interest with growing recognition that a well-balanced gut  composition is highly relevant to an individual's health status and well-being.

Usually BS is typically found in individuals in prepubertal age, even though it has been identified in adults associated with microbial exchange and / or with iron metabolism disorders. Microbial exchange concerns the possible exchange of bacteria between family members which can take place directly, through effusions, or indirectly, through brushes, cutlery or glasses. For this reason, it is recommended that toothbrushes of family members not be left damp and in contact with each other. The bathroom, being a warm-humid environment, is in fact an optimal habitat for microbial proliferation. Of specific importance in BS is the accumulation of iron in tissues and secretions which, together with chromogenic bacteria, are the primary cause of this pathology. In fact, among the metabolic products synthesized by bacteria in the oral cavity, hydrogen sulfide is of considerable interest, since upon reacting with iron available in saliva, in pathological conditions (iron metabolism disorders), it forms black precipitates consisting of ferric sulfide. These precipitates bind to the surface of the teeth, tending to form a stria that usually follows the contour of the gingiva, with an unsightly and variable chromatic intensity. In physiological situations, iron homeostasis is defined as the state of equilibrium between iron present in tissues and in secretions and that which is present in the circulation. Instead, in pathological conditions, defined as iron metabolism disorders, there is an accumulation of iron in tissues and secretions and a lack of it in the circulation. It is also important to remember that subjects affected by BS are more protected from carious processes than healthy subjects, probably due to a significant predominance of chromogenic bacteria compared to those responsible for caries. It should also be remembered that in young subjects BS tends to regress with pubertal development and the transition to adult life. In any case, using common professional hygiene procedures, it is possible to remove BS as well as plaque and tartar deposits. In particular, with ultrasonic scalers, polishing pastes and powders carried by air and water jets, the surfaces of the teeth can be restored to their natural healthy state. All the techniques for removing the precipitates, are not enough however, to fix and permanently eradicate their appearance, as these precipitates last only for short periods and recur very frequently. Due to the frequent recurrences, new oral  control therapies are emerging; among these the use of lactoferrin (Lf) in the dental field and particularly in the treatment of BS appears to be very promising. Taken togheter, here the effect of Lf in subjects affected by BS has been investigated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594820>Live and Diet by Your Gut .</a></h2><p>Diet influences health in multiple ways.

The composition of the mosquitoes'  plays a role in P. falciparum transmission, so we studied midgut bacterial communities of An. gambiae s.l from Burkina Faso. DNA was extracted from 17 pools of midgut of mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex from six localities in three climatic areas, including cotton-growing and cotton-free localities to include potential differences in insecticide selection pressure. The v3-v4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted and sequenced using Illumina Miseq (2 × 250 nt). Diversity analysis was performed using QIIME and R software programs. The major bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria (97.2%) in all samples. The most abundant genera were Enterobacter (32.8%) and Aeromonas (29.8%), followed by Pseudomonas (11.8%), Acinetobacter (.9%) and Thorsellia (2.2%). No statistical difference in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found (Kruskal-Wallis FDR-p > 0.05) among the different areas, fields or localities. Richness and diversity indexes (observed OTUs, Chao1, Simpson and Shannon indexes) showed significant differences in the cotton-growing fields and in the agroclimatic zones, mainly in the Sudano-Sahelian area. OTUs from seven bacterial species that mediate refractoriness to Plasmodium infection in An. gambiae s.l were detected. The beta diversity analysis did not show any significant difference. Therefore, a same control strategy of using bacterial species refractoriness to Plasmodium to target mosquito midgut bacterial community and affect their fitness in malaria transmission may be valuable tool for future malaria control efforts in Burkina Faso.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528339> sp. probiotic supplementation diminish the  F4ac infection in susceptible weaned pigs by influencing the intestinal immune response, intestinal  and blood metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Probiosis is considered a potential strategy to reduce antibiotics use and prevent post-weaning diarrhea (PWD). This study investigated the effect of  DSM25840 or  DSM25841 supplementation on growth, health, immunity, intestinal functionality and microbial profile of post-weaning pigs after enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) F4 challenge.Sixty-four post-weaning piglets (7748 g ± 643 g) were randomly allocated to four groups: control basal diet (CO); CO + 1.28 × 10 CFU/g of  (BAA); CO + 1.28 × 10 CFU/g feed of  (BAS); CO + 1 g colistin/kg of feed (AB). At day (d) 7, animals were challenged with 10 CFU/mL of ETEC F4ac O149 and then followed for fecal score and performance until d 21. Blood was collected at d 6, d 12 and d 21 for immunoglobulins, at d 8 for acute phase proteins, at d 8 and d 21 for metabolomics analysis. Jejunum was sampled for morphometry, quantification of apoptosis, cell proliferation, neutral and acid mucine and IgA secretory cells, and microarray analysis at d 21. Jejunum and cecum contents were collected for  at d 21.AB and BAS reduced the fecal score impairment compared to CO ( < 0.05) at d 14. Body weight (BW), average daily weight gain (ADWG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) did not differ between  groups and CO. AB improved BW at d 7, d 14 and d 21, ADWG ADFI and G:F from d 0 to d 7 ( < 0.05). At d 8, CO had higher plasma arginine, lysine, ornithine, glycine, serine and threonine than other groups, and higher haptoglobin than AB ( < 0.05). At d 21, CO had lower blood glycine, glutamine and IgA than BAS. Morphology, cells apoptosis and mucins did not differ. BAS and AB increased the villus mitotic index. Transcriptome profile of BAS and AB were more similar than CO. Gene sets related to adaptive immune response were enriched in BAA, BAS and AB. CO had enriched gene set for nuclear structure and RNA processing. CO had a trend of higher Enterobacteriaceae in cecum than the other groups ( = 0.06).

However, sublethal exposure can exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial pollinators by dysregulating innate immunity. Generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO) by the dual oxidase (Duox) pathway is a critical component of the innate immune response, which functions to impede infection and maintain homeostatic regulation of the gut . Despite the importance of this pathway in gut immunity, the consequences of neonicotinoid exposure on Duox signaling have yet to be studied. Here, we use a  model to investigate the hypothesis that imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) can affect the Duox pathway. The results demonstrated that exposure to sublethal imidacloprid reduced HO production by inhibiting transcription of the  gene. Furthermore, the reduction in  expression was found to be a result of imidacloprid interacting with the midgut portion of the immune deficiency pathway. This impairment led to a loss of microbial regulation, as exemplified by a compositional shift and increased total abundance of  and  spp. (dominant  members) found in the gut. In addition, we demonstrated that certain probiotic lactobacilli could ameliorate Duox pathway impairment caused by imidacloprid, but this effect was not directly dependent on the Duox pathway itself. This study is the first to demonstrate the deleterious effects that neonicotinoids can have on Duox-mediated generation of HO and highlights a novel coordination between two important innate immune pathways present in insects. Sublethal exposure to certain pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoid insecticides) is suspected to contribute to honey bee () population decline in North America. Neonicotinoids are known to interfere with immune pathways in the gut of insects, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We used a  model to understand how imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) interferes with two innate immune pathways-Duox and Imd. We found that imidacloprid dysregulates these pathways to reduce hydrogen peroxide production, ultimately leading to a dysbiotic shift in the gut . Intriguingly, we found that presupplementation with probiotic bacteria could mitigate the harmful effects of imidacloprid. Thus, these observations uncover a novel mechanism of pesticide-induced immunosuppression that exploits the interconnectedness of two important insect immune pathways.Copyright © 2019 Chmiel et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638148>Effects of oats on gastrointestinal health as assessed by in vitro, animal, and human studies.</a></h2><p>Oats are uniquely nutritious, owing to their composition of bioactive compounds, lipids, and β-glucan. Scientific research has established that oats can improve diet quality, reduce cholesterol, regulate satiety, and protect against carcinogenesis in the colon; however, determining the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health and the gut microbiome is a newer, evolving area of research. To better understand the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health in humans, a literature review with predefined search criteria was conducted using the PubMed database and keywords for common gastrointestinal health outcomes. Moreover, to examine the gastrointestinal effects of oats across the scientific spectrum, a similar search strategy was executed to identify animal studies. In vitro studies were identified from the reference lists of human and animal studies. A total of 8 human studies, 19 animal studies, and  in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence in humans shows beneficial effects of oats on gastrointestinal health, with supportive evidence provided by in vitro and animal studies. The effective dose of oats varies by type, although an amount providing 2. to 2.9 g of β-glucan per day was shown to decrease fecal pH and alter fecal bacteria. For oat bran, 40 to 100 g/d was shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and short-chain fatty acids in humans. Differences in study design, methodology, and type of oats tested make valid comparisons difficult. The identification of best practices for the design of oat studies should be a priority in future research, as the findings will be useful for determining how oats influence specific indices of gastrointestinal health, including the composition of the human gut microbiome.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

A total of 116 overweight or obese participants were assigned randomly either to 10 g inulin plus 10 g resistant maltodextrin or to 20 g of placebo supplementation through 400 mL of milk a day, while on a - 500 kcal/day energy restricted diet.Altogether, 86 participants completed the intervention. There were no significant differences in weight loss or body composition between the groups. The fibre supplement reduced systolic (.35 ± 2.4 mmHg, p = 0.043) and diastolic (2.82 ± 1.3 mmHg, p = 0.047) blood pressure to a larger extent than placebo. Furthermore, a larger decrease in serum insulin was observed in the placebo group compared to the fibre group (- 26.0 ± 9.2 pmol/L, p = 0.006). The intake of fibre induced changes in the composition of gut  resulting in higher abundances of Parabacteroides and Bifidobacteria, compared to placebo. The effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism were mainly observed in women, and could be attributed to a higher gut  diversity after intervention. Finally, the fibre group experienced a higher degree of gastrointestinal symptoms, which attenuated over time.Supplementation of inulin and resistant maltodextrin did not provide an additional weight loss during an energy-restricted diet, but reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The following items were used to evaluate responses: body surface area (BSA), psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), dermatology life quality index (DLQI), histological examination, intestinal symptoms, adverse reactions and serum level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. After second FMT treatment for  weeks, aforementioned items were improved greatly compared with those before treatment. Moreover, IBS was completely relieved and no adverse reactions were observed during the treatment and follow-up. In conclusion, FMT could be a novel therapy for psoriasis.

Related to these observations, a wealth of studies has underscored the negative impact of both acute and chronic sleep deprivation on cognitive function. More recently it has become apparent that the gut  composition can be rapidly altered, modulates brain function and is affected by the aforementioned health problems. As such, changes in the  composition may contribute to the behavioural and physiological phenotypes associated with sleep deprivation. It is unclear, however, whether a brief period of sleep deprivation can also negatively impact the gut . Here, we examined the impact of  hr of sleep deprivation on gut  composition of male C57Bl6/J mice. Despite the fact that the overall microbial composition did not change between the control- and sleep-deprived groups, the relative abundance of the Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae were slightly altered in sleep-deprived animals compared to controls. Together, these data suggest that depriving mice of sleep for  hr leads to subtle changes in the gut  composition.© 2019 The Authors.

When cell-free extracts from  were combined with the above probiotics at a ratio of 2:1 to make mycotoxin-biodegradation preparation (MBP), the ZEA degradation rate reached 95.15% ( < 0.05). In order to further investigate the MBP effect on relieving the negative impact of ZEA for pig production performance, 120 young pigs were randomly divided into  groups, with 3 replicates in each group and 8 pigs for each replicate. Group A was given the basal diet with 86.19 μg/kg ZEA; group B contained 300 μg/kg ZEA without MBP addition; and groups C, D, and E contained 300 μg/kg ZEA added with 0.05%, 0.10%, and 0.15% MBP, respectively. The results showed that MBP addition was able to keep gut  stable. ZEA concentrations in jejunal contents in groups A and D were 89.47% and 80.07% lower than that in group B ( < 0.05), indicating that MBP was effective in ZEA biodegradation.

Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum -hydroxytryptamine (-HT) level and colonic -HT receptor 3A (-HTR)/-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of -HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut . Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal  transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS.

We present a general model to explore the optimal investment in host immunity under conditions in which the host can, versus cannot easily distinguish among commensal versus pathogenic bacteria, and when commensal  can, versus cannot protect the host against the impacts of pathogen infection. We find that a loss of immune vigilance associated with innate immunity over evolutionary time can occur due to the challenge of discriminating between pathogenic and other microbe species. Further, we find the greater the protective effect of microbiome species, acting either directly or via competition with a pathogen, or the higher the costs of immunity, the more likely the loss of immune vigilance is. Conversely, this effect can be reversed when pathogens increase host mortality. Generally, the magnitude of costs of immunity required to allow evolution of decreased immune vigilance are predicted to be lowest when microbiome and pathogen species most resemble each other (in terms of host recognition), and when immune effects on the pathogen are weak. Our model framework makes explicit the core trade-offs likely to shape the evolution of immunity in the context of microbiome/pathogen discrimination. We discuss how this informs interpretation of patterns and process in natural systems, including vulnerability to pathogen emergence.© 2019 The Author(s).

Hence a simpler and faster performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. The quantitative analysis was achieved within 6 min by using Agilent 6460C UPLC-MS/MS with 10% methyl alcohol isocratic elution and was more simple, convenient and rapid than that of previously reported methods. Furthermore, method verification results showed that the method correlation coefficient was 0.99978293, 0.99997514 and 0.98784721, and the detection limit was 0.121, 8.063 and 0.797 μg L-1, and the precision of the retention time and peak area of analytes was less than 0.331 and 3.280, respectively. The method was applied to simultaneously determine TMAO, TMA and DMA in the urine and serum from mice treated with normal, high l-carnitine, or high choline diet. Quantitative recoveries of TMAO, TMA and DMA were in the range of 94.2%-101.0%, and the RSD values were lower than .17%.

Recent evidence suggests that the gut  is associated with tacrolimus dosing requirements and direct metabolism of tacrolimus. We hypothesize that administration of antibiotics, which are known to alter the gut , is associated with tacrolimus trough variability.We conducted a retrospective chart review of subjects who received kidney transplants at our institution from 2012 to 2013 and evaluated subjects who received antibiotics during the first month of transplantation (Abx Group, N = 60) and subjects who did not (No Abx Group, N = 200). We evaluated whether antibiotic administration in the Abx Group had increased tacrolimus trough concentrations and concentration over tacrolimus dosage (C/D) after antibiotic administration. We also evaluated tacrolimus variability as measured by standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation between the Abx Group and No Abx Group.In the Abx Group, tacrolimus trough concentration over tacrolimus dosage (C/D) increased 7 and 15 days after antibiotic administration ( = 0.001,  = 0.07, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). From postoperative day 31-45, the variability in tacrolimus trough levels in the Abx Group as measured by SD and coefficient of variation was significantly higher than the variability in the No Abx Group ( = 0.03,  = 0.02, Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively).Our identification of antibiotic administration as a potentially new risk factor for tacrolimus trough variability suggests the need to carefully follow tacrolimus trough levels after antibiotic administration.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Old age alters our metabolic and regenerative capacity. Following recruitment of 65 human subjects in the age range of 70 to 82, we discerned healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) cohorts discordant in the occurrence of one or more major diseases: (1) cancer, (2) acute or chronic cardiovascular diseases, (3) acute or chronic pulmonary diseases, (4) diabetes, and () stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed these cohorts' oral microbiomes (saliva) and gut microbiomes (stool) to assess diversity and identify microbial biomarkers for HA. In contrast to the gut microbiome where no change was observed, we found that the saliva microbiome had higher α-diversity in the HA compared with the NHA group. We observed the genus Akkermansia to be significantly more abundant in the gut  of the HA group. Akkermansia muciniphila is a colonic mucin-degrading bacterium believed to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 was a taxon increased in abundance in the HA cohort.

The activity of purified p4818Cel5_2A was maximal at pH 6.0 and 50 °C and displayed resistance to trypsin digestion. This enzyme exhibited activities towards a wide variety of plant polysaccharides, including cellulosic substrates of avicel and solka-Floc, and the hemicelluloses of β-(1 → 4)/(1 → 3)-glucans, xyloglucan, glucomannan and galactomannan. Viscosity, reducing sugar distribution and hydrolysis product analyses further revealed that this enzyme was a processive endo-β-(1 → 4)-glucanase capable of hydrolyzing cellulose into cellobiose and cellotriose as the primary end products.

However, little progress has been made in determining the exact function of NHP on tumorigenesis. In the current study, we found that NHP inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in the APC  transgenic mouse model, as well as induced apoptosis and blocked angiogenesis in vivo. Our in-cell study suggested that this tumorigenic preventative effect of NHP is not due to the direct impact on tumor cells. Intriguingly, by utilizing 16 s rRNA gene-based  sequencing, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased, while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were increased in the presence of NHP. Additionally, the fecal  transplantation experiment further revealed that feeding with fecal of NHP-treated mice induced considerable inhibition of tumorigenesis, which indicates that the alteration of gut  is responsible for NHP-mediated prevention of colorectal tumorigenesis. Thus, our study not only suggests the efficacy of NHP as a potent natural product for preventing colorectal cancer but also proposes a compelling model to connect the gut  to the preventative effect of NHP on tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Such transitions can be shaped by a completely different branch of the tree of life: species in the microbiome. Probing these interactions using testable predictions from evolutionary theory could illuminate whether and how host-microbiome integrated life histories can evolve and be maintained. Beyond advancing fundamental science, this research program could yield important applications. In an age of microbiome engineering, understanding the contexts that lead to  signaling shaping ontogeny could offer novel mechanisms for manipulations to increase yield in agriculture by manipulating plant responses to stressful environments, or to reduce pathogen transmission by affecting vector efficiency.

Their results showed that rats supplemented with the symbiotic (both probiotic and prebiotic) treatment performed significantly better than other groups in the spatial memory test, though not in that of associative memory. Their data also reported that this improvement correlated with increased levels of BDNF, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and better electrophysiological outcomes in the hippocampi of the symbiotic group.

Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for  weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial barrier function were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut  composition were evaluated. Faecal  transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic  by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue metabolic profile, inflammatory status, gut  composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ceftiofur and its metabolites were measured in the plasma, interstitium, ileum and colon. The concentration and MIC of fecal E. coli and the fecal  composition were assessed after treatment. The maximum concentration of ceftiofur was higher in all sampled locations of steers treated with CHCL. Measurable drug persisted longer in the intestine of CCFA-treated steers. There was a significant decrease in E. coli concentration (P = 0.002) within 24 hours that persisted for 2 weeks after CCFA treatment. In CHCL-treated steers, the mean MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli peaked at 48 hours (mean MIC = 20.45 ug/ml, 95% CI = 10.29-40.63 ug/ml), and in CCFA-treated steers, mean MIC peaked at 96 hours (mean MIC = 10.68 ug/ml, 95% CI = .47-20.85 ug/ml). Shifts in the microbiome of steers in both groups were due to reductions in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes. CCFA leads to prolonged, low intestinal drug concentrations, and is associated with decreased E. coli concentration, an increased MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli at specific time points, and shifts in the fecal . CHCL led to higher intestinal drug concentrations over a shorter duration.

Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence. Homosexual behaviour may represent a risk factor for its transmission, while CD4 count and viremia didn't correlate with the presence of the protist. The pathogenetic role of Blastocystis remains unclear and no gut inflammation status was detected in Blastocystis-carriers. The only symptom associated with Blastocystis was the flatulence, evidencing a link between the presence of the protist and the composition and stability of gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627244>A case of 'blown pack' spoilage of vacuum-packaged pork likely associated with Clostridium estertheticum in Canada.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the potential causative agents for vacuum-packaged pork that had shown gross pack extension during a routine storage life study in a Canadian pork plant using both conventional and culture-independent methods.

The study explored changes in the faecal  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal  was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7. units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

A dysbiotic gut  can cause low-grade inflammation, and  composition was linked to cardiovascular disease risk. However, the role of this environmental factor in atherothrombosis remains undefined. To analyze the impact of gut  on atherothrombosis, we rederived low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient ( ) mice as germfree (GF) and kept these mice for 16 weeks on an atherogenic high-fat Western diet (HFD) under GF isolator conditions and under conventionally raised specific-pathogen-free conditions (CONV-R). In spite of reduced diversity of the cecal gut microbiome, caused by atherogenic HFD, GF  mice and CONV-R  mice exhibited atherosclerotic lesions of comparable sizes in the common carotid artery. In contrast to HFD-fed mice, showing no difference in total cholesterol levels, CONV-R  mice fed control diet (CD) had significantly reduced total plasma cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and LDL levels compared with GF  mice. Myeloid cell counts in blood as well as leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall at the common carotid artery of GF  mice on HFD were diminished compared to CONV-R  controls. Plasma cytokine profiling revealed reduced levels of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL7 and CXCL1 in GF  mice, whereas the T-cell-related interleukin 9 (IL-9) and IL-27 were elevated. In the atherothrombosis model of ultrasound-induced rupture of the common carotid artery plaque, thrombus area was significantly reduced in GF  mice relative to CONV-R  mice. , this atherothrombotic phenotype was explained by decreased adhesion-dependent platelet activation and thrombus growth of HFD-fed GF  mice on type III collagen. Our results demonstrate a functional role for the commensal  in atherothrombosis. In a ferric chloride injury model of the carotid artery, GF C57BL/6J mice had increased occlusion times compared to colonized controls.

They are resistant to salivary amylase and gastric juice. In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty acid, (SCFA) production. Arabinan, arabinogalactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were fermented by probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bi. longum, Bi. bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (commensal bacteria). While, polygalacturonic acid was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to  (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases.

However, a mutual dependence is developed between the host and symbiotic microbes, which has the potential to extract the energy present in these DF. Dietary fibers escape digestion in the foregut and are fermented in the hindgut, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that alter the microbial ecology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of pigs. Most of the carbohydrates are fermented in the proximal part, allowing protein fermentation in the distal part, resulting in colonic diseases. The structures of resistant starch (RS), arabinoxylan (AX), and β-glucan (βG) are complex; hence, makes their way into the hindgut where these are fermented and provide energy substrates for the colonic epithelial cells. Different microbes have different preferences of binding to different substrates. The RS, AX and βG act as a unique substrate for the microbes and modify the relative composition of the gut microbial community. The granule dimension and surface area of each substrate are different, which influences the penetration capacity of microbes. Arabinose and xylan are 2 different hemicelluloses, but arabinose is substituted on the xylan backbone and occurs in the form of AX. Fermentation of xylan produces butyrate primarily in the small intestine, whereas arabinose produces butyrate in the large intestine. Types of RS and forms of βG also exert beneficial effects by producing different metabolites and modulating the intestinal . Therefore, it is important to have information of different types of RS, AX and βG and their roles in microbial modulation to get the optimum benefits of fiber fermentation in the gut. This review provides relevant information on the similarities and differences that exist in the way RS, AX, and βG are fermented, and their positive and negative effects on SCFA production and gut microbial ecology of pigs. These insights will help nutritionists to develop dietary strategies that can modulate specific SCFA production and promote beneficial  in the GIT of swine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668625>Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas Suppress Local Root Immune Responses by Gluconic Acid-Mediated Lowering of Environmental pH.</a></h2><p>The root microbiome consists of commensal, pathogenic, and plant-beneficial microbes [1]. Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report that this pH-dependent cell wall remodeling is time dependent, with the initial change in pH driving cell wall unmasking, which is then remasked at later time points. Remasking of β-glucan was mediated via the cell density-dependent fungal quorum sensing molecule farnesol, while chitin remasking was mediated via a small, heat-stable, nonproteinaceous secreted molecule(s).

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered  composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly,  "normalization" involving the transfer of WT  into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed  composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563898>Cigarette smoking and oral  in low-income and African-American populations.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for diseases and cancers.

Defects in such mechanisms can favour the development of chronic intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the principal forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans, as well as systemic disorders. Over the last years, the frequency of intestinal and systemic immune-inflammatory disorders has increased in previously low incidence areas, likely due to the Westernization of lifestyles, including dietary habits. The Western diet is characterized by high consumption of proteins, saturated fats and sweets, as well as by a broad use of food additives (e.g., emulsifiers, bulking agents), which are used to preserve and enhance food quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that food additives can perturb gut homeostasis, thereby contributing to promote tissue-damaging inflammatory responses. For instance, mice given the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 develop dysbiosis with overgrowth of mucus-degrading bacteria. Such an effect triggers colitis in animals deficient in either interleukin-10, a cytokine exerting anti-inflammatory and regulatory functions, or Toll-like receptor , a receptor recognizing the bacterial flagellin. Similarly, the polysaccharide maltodextrin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal goblet cells, thereby impairing mucus release and increasing host susceptibility to colitis.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or  dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or  dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for  dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses.

This experiment evaluated the effects of a blend of prebiotics and dietary fibers on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and fecal metabolites related to gastrointestinal health in adult dogs. Four diets containing either % cellulose (control; CT), % dietary fiber and prebiotic blend (FP), 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (SE), or % fiber blend plus 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (FSE) were formulated to meet or exceed the AAFCO (2017) nutritional requirements for adult dogs. Eight adult female beagles (mean age 4.2 ± 1.1 yr; mean BW = 10.8 ± 1.4 kg; mean BCS = .8 ± 0.6) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 dietary treatments using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period consisted of 14 d (10 d of diet adaptation and 4 d of total and fresh fecal and total urine collection). All animals remained healthy throughout the study, with serum metabolites being within reference ranges for adult dogs. All diets were well accepted by the dogs, resulting in similar (P > 0.05) daily food intakes among treatments. Likewise, fecal output and scores did not differ (P > 0.05) among dietary treatments, with the latter being within the ideal range (2.-2.9) in a -point scale. All diets were highly digestible and had similar (P > 0.05) ATTD of dry matter (81.6%-84.4%), organic matter (86.4%-87.3%), and crude protein (86.6%-87.3%). However, total dietary fiber (TDF) digestibility was greater for dogs fed the FSE diet (P < 0.05) in contrast with dogs fed the CT and SE diets, whereas dogs fed FP diets had intermediate TDF digestibility, but not different from all other treatments. Fecal acetate and propionate concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) for dogs fed FP and FSE diets. Fecal concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater for dogs fed CT (P < 0.05) compared with dogs fed the other three treatments. No shifts in fecal microbial richness and diversity were observed among dietary treatments. Overall, the data suggest that dietary supplementation of fiber and prebiotic blend was well tolerated by dogs, did not cause detrimental effects on fecal quality or nutrient digestibility, and resulted in beneficial shifts in fecal metabolites that may support gut health.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study, the effects of DADS on lipid metabolism and its potential role in the modulation of the gut microbiome were determined. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining were used to assess the liver and intestinal tissues of mice treated with DADS. The expression of lipid metabolism‑associated genes was measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). The effects of DADS on the gut microbiome were measured using 16S recombinant (r)DNA gene analysis. The results revealed that the serum non‑esterified free fatty acids, high density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, low density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, liver triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of the mice fed with a low‑dose of DADS was significantly higher when compared with the control. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining demonstrated that DADS induced fatty liver in mice. The results of the RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression levels of a number of lipid metabolism‑associated genes were altered in the livers of mice treated with DADS. The 16S rDNA gene analysis demonstrated that the mice fed on a normal diet treated with a low‑dose of DADS had decreased levels of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla and increased levels of bacteria from the Firmicutes phyla. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed the top 20 pathways enriched in the low‑dose DADS group of mice fed with a normal diet. In the present study, low‑dose DADS induced fatty liver and altered the gut , similar to the phenotype induced by a high fat diet, by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism associated genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594815> Symbiosis Genes Impact Microbial Interactions between Symbionts and Multikingdom Commensal Communities.</a></h2><p>The wild legume  engages in mutualistic symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Using plants grown in natural soil and community profiling of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITSs), we examined the role of the  symbiosis genes , , , and  in structuring bacterial and fungal root-associated communities. We found host genotype-dependent community shifts in the root and rhizosphere compartments that were mainly confined to bacteria in  or fungi in  mutants, while  and  plants displayed major changes across both microbial kingdoms. We observed in all AM mutant roots an almost complete depletion of a large number of Glomeromycota taxa that was accompanied by a concomitant enrichment of Helotiales and Nectriaceae fungi, suggesting compensatory niche replacement within the fungal community. A subset of Glomeromycota whose colonization is strictly dependent on the common symbiosis pathway was retained in  mutants, indicating that  is dispensable for intraradical colonization by some Glomeromycota fungi. However, intraradical colonization by bacteria belonging to the  and  is dependent on AM root infection, revealing a microbial interkingdom interaction. Despite the overall robustness of the bacterial root  against major changes in the composition of root-associated fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal cooccurrence network analysis demonstrates that simultaneous disruption of AM and rhizobium symbiosis increases the connectivity among taxa of the bacterial root . Our findings imply a broad role for  symbiosis genes in structuring the root  and identify unexpected microbial interkingdom interactions between root symbionts and commensal communities. Studies on symbiosis genes in plants typically focus on binary interactions between roots and soilborne nitrogen-fixing rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi in laboratory environments. We utilized wild type and symbiosis mutants of a model legume, grown in natural soil, in which bacterial, fungal, or both symbioses are impaired to examine potential interactions between the symbionts and commensal microorganisms of the root  when grown in natural soil. This revealed microbial interkingdom interactions between the root symbionts and fungal as well as bacterial commensal communities. Nevertheless, the bacterial root  remains largely robust when fungal symbiosis is impaired. Our work implies a broad role for host symbiosis genes in structuring the root  of legumes.Copyright © 2019 Thiergart et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616689>Characterization of  in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis with different disease severities.</a></h2><p>Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) is one of most serious subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Although the pathogenesis of SoJIA remains unclear, several studies have suggested a correlation between gut dysbiosis and JIA. Further understanding of the intestinal microbiome may help to establish alternative ways to treat, or even prevent, the disease.To explore alterations in fecal  profiles in SoJIA patients and to evaluate the correlations between  and clinical parameters.We conducted an observational single-center study at the Pediatric Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Children who were diagnosed with SoJIA at our institution and followed for a minimum period of six months after diagnosis were recruited for the study. Healthy children were recruited as a control group (HS group) during the same period. Clinical data and stool samples were collected from SoJIA patients when they visited the hospital.The SoJIA group included 17 active and 15 inactive consecutively recruited children; the control group consisted of 32 children. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most abundant phyla among the total sample of SoJIA children and controls. There was a significant difference among the three groups in observed species, which was the highest in the Active-SoJIA group, followed by the Inactive-SoJIA group and then HS group (Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.000; and Inactive-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.005). We observed a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in SoJIA patients (3.28 ± 4.47 in Active-SoJIA, .36 ± 8.39 in Inactive-SoJIA, and .67 ± 3.92 in HS). We also observed decreased abundances of Ruminococcaceae (14.9% in Active-SoJIA, 17.3% in Inactive-SoJIA, and 22.8% in HS; Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.005) and Faecalibacterium (.1% in Active-SoJIA, 9.9% in Inactive-SoJIA, and 13.0% in HS; Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.000) in SoJIA compared with HS. By contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidaceae was the highest in the Active-SoJIA group, followed by the Inactive-SoJIA and HS groups (16.% in Active-SoJIA, 12.8% in Inactive-SoJIA, and 9.7% in HS; Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.03). The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between Proteobacteria or Enterobacteriaceae and juvenile arthritis disease activity score on 27 joints (JADAS-27).The composition of the intestinal  is different in SoJIA patients compared with healthy children.

The results obtained indicate that, as expected, higher storage temperatures lead to shorter shelf-lives (the time of sensory rejection by panelists). Thus, the shelf-life decreased from six days to two days for Batch A when the storage temperature increased from 1 to 7 °C, and from five to two days-when the same increase in storage temperature was compared-for Batch B.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying  engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut . Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in  induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut  composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

The yak () is the main livestock species that inhabits the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) at regions located at high-altitude of 3,000-,000 m. This work investigated the rumen bacterial community of yak that grazed on the QTP during the whole year to evaluate the relationship between the rumen bacterial community and the nutrient composition of forage plant at three stages. In this study, the diversity of the rumen prokaryotic community composition was monitored in 10 full-grazing yak in an alpine meadow of the QTP. The nutrient composition of three forage growth stages was determined: re-green stage (REGY), grassy stage (GY), and withered stage (WGY). High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used. The results showed that the nutritive composition of the alpine meadow changed with the seasons: crude protein (CP) (13.22%) was high in forage during REGY (spring), while neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (59.00%) was high during WGY (winter). Microbial diversity and richness were highest during REGY and the average number of operational taxonomic units from 30 samples was 4,470. The microbial composition was dominated by members of Bacteroidetes (51.82%), followed by Firmicutes (34.08%), and the relative microbial abundance changed in the three forage growth stages. Unweighted UniFrac distance PcoA showed that the bacterial community structure differed between REGY, GY, and WGY. Furthermore, taxonomic groups did not present differences regarding gender in these three stages. The rumen  was enriched with functional potentials that were related to ABC transporters, the two-component system, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and metabolism of Purine, Pyrimidine, Starch and sucrose metabolism. Significant differences were found in the composition, diversity, and function of yak ruminal microorganisms during different forage growth stages. This indicates that microbial changes in the rumen depend on changes in the forage nutritional composition. These findings provide evidence on the rumen microbial diversity of yaks in the QTP.©2019 Ma et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546600>The Dysbiosis and Inter-Kingdom Synergy Model in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis, a New Perspective in Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>As more information emerges on oral  using advanced sequencing methodologies, it is imperative to examine how organisms modulate the capacity of each other to colonize or trigger infection. Most mouse models of oral  infection have focused on interactions with single bacterial species. Thus, little is known about the microbiome-mediated interactions that control the switch of  from commensalism to infection. Evidence is accumulating that in immunosuppression where mucosal candidiasis is more prevalent, there is an altered oral bacterial microbiome with reduced diversity, but not an altered mycobiome. Oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunosuppressed humans and mice is associated with a further reduction in oral bacterial diversity and a dysbiotic shift with significant enrichment of streptococcal and enterococcal species. Our recent studies in a cancer chemotherapy mouse model supported the combined profound effect of immunosuppression and  in reducing oral bacterial diversity and provided the first direct evidence that these changes contribute to pathogenesis, representing dysbiosis. There is still a gap in understanding the relationship between  and the oral bacterial microbiome. We propose that certain oral commensal bacteria contribute to fungal pathogenesis and we identify gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in this cooperative virulence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576099>Evaluation and comparison of short chain fatty acids composition in gut diseases.</a></h2><p>An altered (dysbiosis) and unhealthy status of the gut  is usually responsible for a reduction of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration. SCFAs obtained from the carbohydrate fermentation processes are crucial in maintaining gut homeostasis and their determination in stool samples could provide a faster, reliable and cheaper method to highlight the presence of an intestinal dysbiosis and a biomarker for various gut diseases. We hypothesize that different intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), adenomatous polyposis (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) could display a particular fecal SCFAs' signature.To compare the fecal SCFAs' profiles of CD, AP, CRC patients and healthy controls, using the same analytical method.In this cross-sectional study, we defined and compared the SCFAs' concentration in fecal samples of 9 AP, 16 CD, 19 CRC patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). The SCFAs' analysis were performed using a gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Data analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess pairwise differences of SCFAs' profiles, partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to determine the status membership based on distinct SCFAs' profiles, and Dirichlet regression to determine factors influencing concentration levels of SCFAs.We have not observed any difference in the SCFAs' amount and composition between CD and healthy control. On the contrary, the total amount of SCFAs was significantly lower in CRC patients compared to HC ( = 0.044) and CD ( = 0.005). Moreover, the SCFAs' percentage composition was different in CRC and AP compared to HC. In detail, HC displayed higher percentage of acetic acid ( value = 1.3 × 10) and a lower amount of butyric ( value = 0.02192), isobutyric ( value = 7.4 × 10), isovaleric ( value = 0.00012) and valeric ( value = 0.00014) acids compared to CRC patients. AP showed a lower abundance of acetic acid ( value = 0.00062) and higher percentages of propionic ( value = 0.00433) and isovaleric ( value = 0.00433) acids compared to HC. Moreover, AP showed higher levels of propionic acid ( value = 0.03251) and a lower level of isobutyric acid ( value = 0.00427) in comparison to CRC. The PLS-DA model demonstrated a significant separation of CRC and AP groups from HC, although some degree of overlap was observed between CRC and AP.Analysis of fecal SCFAs shows the potential to provide a non-invasive means of diagnosis to detect patients with CRC and AP, while CD patients cannot be discriminated from healthy subjects.©The Author(s) 2019.

However, it remains unclear whether such patients might benefit from enhanced surveillance or from interventions targeting the gut  or the pathogens therein. We therefore undertook a prospective observational study of 24 ICU patients, in which serial faecal samples were subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing, phylogenetic profiling and microbial genome analyses. Two-thirds of the patients experienced a marked drop in gut microbial diversity (to an inverse Simpson's index of <4) at some stage during their stay in the ICU, often accompanied by the absence or loss of potentially beneficial bacteria. Intravenous administration of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent meropenem was significantly associated with loss of gut microbial diversity, but the administration of other antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, failed to trigger statistically detectable changes in microbial diversity. In three-quarters of ICU patients, we documented episodes of gut domination by pathogenic strains, with evidence of cryptic nosocomial transmission of . In some patients, we also saw an increase in the relative abundance of apparent commensal organisms in the gut microbiome, including the archaeal species .

It generates significant impacts on the quality of life of those affected. The pathophysiology is uncertain, but the role of various food types has been established in bowel sensitivity and its clinical manifestations. Carbohydrate intolerance, particularly to lactose, generates similar and sometimes indistinguishable symptoms from irritable bowel syndrome, and in clinical practice is both a frequent and underdiagnosed condition. Carbohydrate intolerance is related to enzymatic deficiencies, alterations of intestinal  and even genetic change. The principal test for a diagnosis of lactose intolerance is the breath test, which measures hydrogen emission (produced only by bacteria), after ingestion of the corresponding substrate.The present work aims to verify the prevalence of lactose intolerance in university students, presenting gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome.In a transversal study, to screen for those with suggestive symptoms, 124 medicine students participated by responding to a form. Those with abdominal pain were referred for anti-parasite treatment in order to exclude intestinal parasites as a secondary cause. Subsequently, using the hydrogen breath test, bacterial overgrowth was investigated, and if negative, lactose intolerance testing would be performed. Patients presenting high hydrogen concentrations of ≥20 ppm above the basal level were considered lactose intolerant.Of the total of students researched (n=124), 7 were excluded because they did not completing all study phases. From those 117 individuals effectively included in the survey; 8 (6.8%) were diagnosed with lactose intolerance and 2 (1.7%) with bacterial overgrowth. Intolerance was more frequent in; female individuals (75%), age range 18 to 25 years (62.%), being colored (50%), and in their 5th semester of studies (37.%). The presence of at least one gastrointestinal symptom among those presenting intolerance (100%), and those not presenting intolerance (42.2%) was found (P=0.002). In addition to abdominal pain (100%) (P<0.001), the most recurrent gastrointestinal symptom in the lactose intolerant students was the distension/flatulence (62.%) (P=0.026). In relation to life habits and food patterns, there was no statistical difference between lactose tolerant and intolerant individuals, or for symptom frequencies. The more advanced students, completing more periods towards graduation, demonstrated more occurrences of gastrointestinal symptoms, yet without presenting significant statistical discrepancies.In view of the test sample quantity (n=21), a high prevalence of lactose intolerance (6.8%) in the academic environment, with epidemiological characteristics compatible to those found the literature is demonstrated, generating knowledge with understanding to prevent, diagnose, alleviate and treat lactose intolerant university students, and generate positive impacts towards well-being, improving the quality of life of these individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527716>Lactulose drives a reversible reduction and qualitative modulation of the faecal  diversity in healthy dogs.</a></h2><p>Hepatic encephalopathy is a frequent and debilitating complication of liver disorders. Lactulose is an established and reasonably effective treatment, yet with incompletely understood mechanisms of action. The aims of this study were to examine how the faecal  composition changed before, during and after lactulose treatment in a large animal model. Healthy, privately owned dogs (n = 18) completed a prospective cohort study. Faecal samples were collected weekly, while the subjects were either on their usual diet (week 1), or a standardised diet (weeks 2-9), with added oral lactulose in weeks 6-7. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were undertaken. Faecal samples from week 7 had a significantly lower  richness/diversity, based on observed operational taxonomic units, Shannon/Chao1 indexes and Pielou's Evenness. Beta diversity based on UniFrac distances was significantly different in week 7 compared to weeks 1,  and 9. At the phylum level, week 7 was associated with a significant increase of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and a decrease of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, when compared to weeks  and 9.

Given their commitment to antimicrobial mucosal immunity, we investigated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and Vα7.2+CD161- T-cell frequency/function and their possible associations with MT and gut dysbiosis, in chronic HIV and/or HCV infections. We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For Vα7.2+CD161++ and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and  stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNFα/IFNγ. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In  patients per group we assessed stool  composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells ( = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin ( = 0.004) and granzyme B ( = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon  stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+:  = 0.002; PD-1+:  = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+:  < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to  stimulation.

Hepatic mRNAs were extracted and sequenced. The expression levels of genes associated with LXR/RXR signaling were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and serum and hepatic cholesterol levels were measured. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics were used to examine serum and hepatic lipids.Pathway analysis indicated that arsenic exposure differentially influenced the hepatic signaling pathways in conventional and AB-treated mice. The expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (), and cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (), as well as cholesterol efflux genes, including ATP binding cassette subfamily G member /8 () and cluster of differentiation 36 (), was lower in arsenic-exposed conventional mice but not in AB-treated mice. Similarly, under arsenic exposure, the hepatic expression of scavenger receptor class B member 1 (), which is involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), was lower in conventional mice, but was higher in AB-treated animals compared with controls. Correspondingly, arsenic exposure exerted opposite effects on the serum cholesterol levels in conventional and AB-treated mice, i.e., higher serum cholesterol levels in conventional mice but lower levels in AB-treated mice than in respective controls. Serum lipid levels, especially triglyceride (TG) levels, were higher in conventional mice exposed to  arsenic, while arsenic exposure did not significantly affect the serum lipids in AB-treated mice. Liver lipid patterns were also differentially perturbed in a -dependent manner.Our results suggest that in mice, the gut  may be a critical factor regulating arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling perturbation, suggesting that modulation of the gut  might be an intervention strategy to reduce the toxic effects of arsenic on lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4415.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572312>Macroalga-Derived Alginate Oligosaccharide Alters Intestinal Bacteria of Atlantic Salmon.</a></h2><p>Prebiotics are substrates intended to sculpt gut microbial communities as they are selectively utilized by the microorganisms to exert beneficial health effects on hosts.

We found that the prebiotic shifts the intestinal  profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with 2.% AlgOS while with 0.% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity analysis indicated the significant differences between control and prebiotic-fed groups. The low supplementation level of AlgOS facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria (including , , ), and Spirochaetes () in the content or mucus of the fish, and few of these bacteria (, ) have genes associated with butyrate production. The results indicate that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon.

Human small noncoding RNAs are also implicated in CRC, and recent findings suggest that their release in the gut lumen contributes to shape the gut . Bacterial small RNAs (bsRNAs) may also play a role in carcinogenesis, but their role has been less extensively explored. Here, we performed small RNA and shotgun sequencing on 80 stool specimens from patients with CRC or with adenomas and from healthy subjects collected in a cross-sectional study to evaluate their combined use as a predictive tool for disease detection. We observed considerable overlap and a correlation between metagenomic and bsRNA quantitative taxonomic profiles obtained from the two approaches. We identified a combined predictive signature composed of 32 features from human and microbial small RNAs and DNA-based microbiome able to accurately classify CRC samples separately from healthy and adenoma samples (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87). In the present study, we report evidence that host-microbiome dysbiosis in CRC can also be observed by examination of altered small RNA stool profiles. Integrated analyses of the microbiome and small RNAs in the human stool may provide insights for designing more-accurate tools for diagnostic purposes. The characteristics of microbial small RNA transcription are largely unknown, while it is of primary importance for a better identification of molecules with functional activities in the gut niche under both healthy and disease conditions. By performing combined analyses of metagenomic and small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) data, we characterized both the human and microbial small RNA contents of stool samples from healthy individuals and from patients with colorectal carcinoma or adenoma. With the integrative analyses of metagenomic and sRNA-Seq data, we identified a human and microbial small RNA signature which can be used to improve diagnosis of the disease. Our analysis of human and gut microbiome small RNA expression is relevant to generation of the first hypotheses about the potential molecular interactions occurring in the gut of CRC patients, and it can be the basis for further mechanistic studies and clinical tests.Copyright © 2019 Tarallo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674687>Modulations of Probiotics on Gut  in a -Fluorouracil-Induced Mouse Model of Mucositis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal mucositis remained one of the most deleterious complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. -FU treatment was reported to affect the abundance of gut  and cause mucositis, which might be ameliorated by probiotics.

The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer. Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health. This experiment provided some experimental evidence for the dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management.© 2019 The Authors.

However, it remains unclear whether there is any association between the JD and fecal  composition. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between JD scores and fecal  in young Japanese adults, through the analysis of fecal  using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. JD scores were calculated with regard to nine food groups (rice, miso soup, pickles, green and yellow vegetables, seaweeds, fish, green tea, meat, and coffee) based on a brief self-administered diet-history questionnaire. JD total scores were categorized as low (score 0-3) or high (score 4-8). The high-scoring JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides than the low JD group, whereas the low JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella than the high JD group. With regard to food group intakes, a higher consumption of rice was associated with a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella, whereas a higher consumption of green tea was associated with a significantly higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between JD score and fecal  and may allow the prediction of changes in fecal  due to changes in the JD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile acids of healthy dogs.</a></h2><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea. Orally administered antibiotics may alter the intestinal , which is responsible for crucial key bile acid (BA) biotransformation reactions.To prospectively evaluate the impact of tylosin administration on fecal  and unconjugated bile acids (UBAs) over time.Sixteen healthy adult dogs.Prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Dogs were randomized to receive 20 mg/kg of tylosin or a placebo capsule PO q12h for 7 days while undergoing daily fecal scoring. Fecal samples were collected on days 0, 7, 21, and 63. The  was assessed using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Unconjugated BAs were assessed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).Fecal scores were unchanged during placebo and tylosin administration. In the placebo group, no significant changes were observed in fecal  or UBA concentrations. Day 7 samples from tylosin-exposed dogs exhibited decreased bacterial diversity (observed species, Chao1, Shannon, P < .001) characterized by decreases in anaerobes Fusobacteriaceae (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score, .03) and Veillonellaceae (LDA score, 4.85). Primary UBA concentrations were increased at day 21 (median, [range]; 7.42, [0.67-18.77] μg/kg; P = .04) and day 63 (3.49 [0-28.43] μg/kg; P = .02) compared to day 0 (.14 [.03-1.19] μg/kg) in dogs receiving tylosin. At day 63, bacterial taxa were not significantly different compared to day 0, but the extent of microbial recovery was individualized.Tylosin causes fecal dysbiosis in healthy dogs with corresponding shifts in fecal UBAs.

After inclusion around gestational week 16-18, participants are followed-up with data collection points around gestational week 32, at childbirth, as well as three times postpartum: after 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. At the last follow-up, 70.8% still remain in the cohort.In addition to internet-based surveys with self-report instruments, participants contribute with biological samples, for example, blood samples (maternal and from umbilical cord), biopsies (umbilical cord and placenta) and  samples. A nested case-control subsample also takes part in cognitive and emotional tests, heart rate variability tests and bioimpedance tests. Subprojects have identified various correlates of PND of psychological and obstetric origin in addition to factors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system.In parallel with the completion of data collection (final follow-up November 2019), BASIC study data are currently analysed in multiple subprojects. Since 2012, we are conducting an ongoing follow-up study on the participants and their children up to 6 years of age (U-BIRTH).

Exosomes are released into the extracellular medium by several cell types and are excellent carriers of biomolecules. Host-derived exosomes and the transport of pathogen-derived molecules by exosomes impact infections in different ways. The interactions of exosomes with the maternal immune system are pivotal to a favorable gestational outcome. In this review, we highlight the potential role of exosomes in the establishment of an adequate milieu that enables embryo implantation and discuss the participation of exosomes released at the maternal-fetal interface during the establishment of an immune-privileged compartment for fetal development. The placenta is a component where important strategies are used to minimize the risk of infection. To present a contrast, we also discuss possible mechanisms used by pathogens to cross the maternal-fetal interface. We review the processes, mechanisms, and potential consequences of dysregulation in all of the abovementioned phenomena. Basic information about exosomes and their roles in viral immune evasion is also presented. The interactions between extracellular vesicles and bacteria, fungi, parasites and proteinaceous infectious agents are addressed. The discovery of the placental  and the implications of this new  are also discussed, and current proposals that explain fetal/placental colonization by both pathogenic and commensal microbes are addressed. The comprehension of such interactions will help us to understand the immune dynamics of human pregnancy and the mechanisms of immune evasion used by different pathogens.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566173>Partially defatted olive cake in finishing pig diets: implications on performance, faecal , carcass quality, slurry composition and gas emission.</a></h2><p>One of the key factors to improve swine production sustainability is the use of agro-industrial by-products in feeds, such as olive by-products. However, it is necessary to assess its effects on the overall production process, including the animal and the environment. With this aim, an experiment was conducted to determine the effects of including a partially defatted olive cake (PDOC) in pig diets on growth performance, faecal , carcass quality and gas emission from the slurry. Two finishing diets were formulated, a control (C) diet and a diet with PDOC included at 120 g/kg. Eighty finishing male pigs Duroc-Danbred × (Landrace × Large White) of 60.4 ± 7.00 kg BW were divided between these two treatments. During the finishing period (60 to 110 kg BW, 55 days) average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded. Faecal samples from the rectum of 16 animals per treatment were incubated for bacteria enumeration. At the end of finishing period, backfat thickness and loin depth (LD) were measured. Animals were slaughtered to obtain carcass weight and carcass composition parameters, and subcutaneous fat was sampled to analyse the fatty acid (FA) profile. In addition greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions were measured during pig slurry storage using the methodology of dynamic flux chambers. An initial slurry characterisation and biochemical methane potential (B0) were also determined. No significant differences between treatments were found in performance, carcass quality and microbial counts with the exception of LD, which was lower in PDOC compared with C animals (45. v. 47. mm, SEM: 0.62; P = 0.020). The FA profile of the subcutaneous fat did not differ between treatments, but the monounsaturated FA (MUFA) concentration was higher and the polyunsaturated FA was lower in the animals fed PDOC (50.9 v. 48.3, SEM: 0.48, P < 0.001; 17.6 v. 19.3, SEM: 0.30, P < 0.001 in mg/100 g of Total FA, for PDOC and C animals, respectively). The initial pig slurry characterisation only showed differences in ADF concentration that was higher (P < 0.05) in the slurry from PDOC treatment. Regarding gas emission, slurries from both treatments emitted similar amounts of ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as B0 values. The results obtained suggest that PDOC may be included in balanced pig diets at rates of up to 120 g/kg without negative effects on performance, carcass quality, gut microflora and slurry gas emission, while improving the MUFA concentration of subcutaneous fat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529894>[Responses of soil organic carbon and microbial community structure to different tillage patterns and straw returning for multiple years.]</a></h2><p>Soil organic carbon is essential for maintaining terrestrial ecosystem function and mitigating soil degradation. Soil microorganisms participate in soil carbon cycling. They are affected by tillage methods and straw returning. A split-plot design was adopted in this experiment. The whole-plot treatment had two tillage methods, subsoil tillage (ST) and rotary tillage (RT). The split-plot treatment included full straw returning (F) and no straw returning (0). The microbial community structure and carbon sequestration genes were assessed by Illumina sequencing technique. Soil organic carbon contents were measured during 2012-2017. The results showed that 1) subsoil tillage and straw returning significantly increased pH, microbial biomass carbon, total nitrogen, silt content, and clay content, while significantly decreased sand content; 2) during the test period (2012-2017), soil organic carbon (SOC) content under all treatments showed an increasing trend, but the increment for average SOC content under straw returning and subsoiling treatments was significantly higher than that of no straw returning and rotary tillage by 33.2 % and 30.6%, respectively; 3) Proteobacteria was the most abundant type of bacteria in the soil, followed by Acidobacteria and Gemmatadanetes; 4) STF treatment maintained high microbial diversity; ) Excepted for soil sand content, soil pH, microbial biomass carbon, total nitrogen, silt content and clay content all caused the variation of soil microbial community structure under the STF treatment in the direction of SOC accumulation; 6) in addition to the gene abundance in the di- and oligosaccharides metabolic pathway, the gene abundance in the metabolic pathways for CO fixation, central carbohydrate metabolism, fermentation, one-carbon metabolism, organic acids, sugar alcohols and glycoside hydrolases showed that subsoil tillage was significantly higher than rotary tillage, with posi-tively correlation with soil organic carbon content. Therefore, the combination of subsoil tillage and straw returning could improve basic soil properties, affect soil microbial community structure, and increase the capacity of soil carbon fixation, thus providing a realistic basis for solving soil degradation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520866>Effects of a novel three-step sous-vide cooking and subsequent chilled storage on the  of beef steaks.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate a novel three-step sous-vide (SV) method on bacterial growth and diversity, and its relationship to product storage life. Vacuum-packed naturally contaminated steaks were sequentially cooked at 39 °C (1 h), 49 °C (1 h), and 59 °C (4 h), then stored at -1. and 2 °C for 28 d, with a single-step SV at 59 °C for 4 h for comparison. None of the seven indicator bacteria tested proliferated (P > .05) after incubation at 39 or 49 °C; microbial diversity was also unaffected. Bacterial load was reduced (P < .05) by up to  log units with both (P > .05) SV methods. The odour of all steaks remained acceptable on d 28. Unexpectedly, during storage, Pseudomonas, not lactic acid bacteria, dominated the  on steaks cooked by either SV method, likely due to the temperature shift-induced lag phase and/or heat sensitivity of psychrotrophic bacteria. In conclusion, the three-step SV did not lead to bacterial proliferation or compromise the storage life of cooked products.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

EED is a subclinical condition associated with stunting due to impaired nutrient absorption. This study investigated the effects of rice bran supplementation on weight for age and length for age z-scores (WAZ, LAZ), EED stool biomarkers, as well as  and metabolome signatures in weaning infants from 6 to 12 months old that reside in Nicaragua and Mali. Healthy infants were randomized to a control (no intervention) or a rice bran group that received daily supplementation with increasing doses at each month (1- g/day). Stool  were characterized using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Stool metabolomes were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months of age. Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible to support changes in LAZ from 6-8 and 8-12 months of age in Nicaragua and Mali infants when compared to control. WAZ was significantly improved only for Mali infants at 8 and 12 months. Mali and Nicaraguan infants showed major differences in the overall gut  and metabolome composition and structure at baseline, and thus each country cohort demonstrated distinct microbial and metabolite profile responses to rice bran supplementation when compared to control. Rice bran is a practical dietary intervention strategy that merits development in rice-growing regions that have a high prevalence of growth stunting due to malnutrition and diarrheal diseases. Rice is grown as a staple food, and the bran is used as animal feed or wasted in many low- and middle-income countries where EED and stunting is prevalent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600703>Antibiotic resistance and  in the gut of Chinese four major freshwater carp from retail markets.</a></h2><p>Fish-associated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential risks to human beings via the food chain. However, data are scarce regarding the antibiotic resistance in fish themselves. Herein, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were assessed in the gut of four major Chinese freshwater carp (i.e., silver carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp) from food retail markets. Results show that the abundances of target ARGs (e.g., tetA, tetO, tetQ, tetW, sulI, sulII, and bla) and class 1 integrase (intI1) were in the range 9.4 × 10 - 1.6 × 10 and 6.7 × 10 - .2 × 10 gene copies per 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The sulI, sulII, and tetQ strongly correlated with silver and mercury resistance genes (e.g., silE and merR). The microbial taxa of fish gut could be partly separated among retail markets based on the PCA analysis. About 15.0% of the OTUs in fish gut were shared and 74.% of the shared OTUs were identified as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. These phyla may constitute the core  in the guts of the four Chinese freshwater carp. The possible ARG hosts were revealed based on the network analysis, and the presence of pathogen-associated resistant genera in fish gut highlights the need to fully understand their potential human health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); () negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to  years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655448>Waxing and cultivar affect Salmonella enterica persistence on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) fruit.</a></h2><p>A dearth of knowledge exists on the pathogen-commodity association of Salmonella enterica on cucumber, despite cucumbers being implicated in multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in recent years in the U.S. Data are lacking on cultivar susceptibility to Salmonella colonization in relation to heterogeneity in fruit surface morphology. Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1. log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1. ± 8 mg/dL.

In this follow-up study, we assess short-term and long-term effects of these therapies on the gut , antibiotic resistance, and metabolic parameters.This was a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial done at nine medical centres in Taiwan. Adult patients (>20 years) with documented H pylori infection were randomly assigned (1:1:1, with block sizes of six) to receive T14, C10, or BQ10. We assessed long-term outcomes (reinfection frequency, changes in the gut , antibiotic resistance, and metabolic parameters) in patients with available data, excluding all protocol violators and those with unknown post-treatment H pylori status. Faecal samples were collected before treatment and 2 weeks, 2 months, and at least 1 year after eradication therapy. Amplification of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA was done followed by high-throughput sequencing. Susceptibility testing for faecal Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was done. This trial is complete and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between July 17, 2013, and April 20, 2016, 1620 participants were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (540 [33%] per group). 1214 (75%) attended 1-year follow-up and are included in this analysis. Compared with baseline, alpha diversity was significantly reduced 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0002), C10 (p<0·0001), and BQ10 (p<0·0001) treatment. Beta diversity was also significantly altered 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0010), C10 (p=0·0001), and BQ10 (p=0·0001). Alpha diversity and beta diversity were restored at week 8 (p=0·14 and p=0·918, respectively) and 1 year (p=0·14 and p=0·918) after T14, but were not fully recovered at week 8 and after 1 year in patients treated with C10 (p=0·0001 and p=0·013 at week 8; p=0·019 and p=0·064 at 1 year) and BQ10 (p<0·0001 and p=0·0002; p=0·001 and p=0·029). A transient increase at week 2 after T14 and C10 of the resistance rates of E coli to ampicillin-sulbactam (12% [15/127] to 66% [38/58] for T14, 7% [10/135] to 64% [28/44] for C10), cefazolin (13% [16/127] to 43% [25/58] for T14, 10% [13/135] to 41% [18/44] for C10), cefmetazole (8% [10/127] to 26% [15/58] for T14, 4% [/135] to 18% [8/44] for C10), levofloxacin (8% [10/127] to 35% [20/58] for T14, 7% [10/135] to 32% [14/44] for C10), gentamicin (13% [19/146] to 47% [27/58] for T14, 15% [22/149] to 45% [20/44] for C10), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33% [48/146] to 86% [50/58] for T14, 28% [42/148] to 86% [38/44] for C10; p<0·05 in paired samples in the above analyses) returned to basal state at week 8 and after 1 year. Although bodyweight and body-mass index slightly increased, there were significant improvements in metabolic parameters, with a decrease in insulin resistance, triglycerides, and LDL and an increase in HDL. Overall, there was no significant change in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome at week 8 and 1 year after T14, C10, and BQ10.Eradication of H pylori infection has minimal disruption of the , no effect on antibiotic resistance of E coli, and some positive effects on metabolic parameters.

The study population fulfilled the Rome III IBS criteria and comprised 50 patients. During 10 days, patients recorded the irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) along with the Bristol stool scale and number of stools/day. The enrolled patients were categorized as follows: 37 with diarrhea,  with constipation and 8 with mixed symptoms. The treatment response showed reduction in a majority of patients, 32 of which with 50-point reduction of IBS-SSS and 21 with a 100-point IBS-SSS reduction. The percentage improvement was 36 (23-49) and 28 (18-38) for women and men respectively. Short-chain fatty acids were not changed. We consider fecal  transplantation in the form of ACHIM as an option for the future therapeutic armamentarium in IBS. REGISTERED TRIAL: www.clinicaltrials.gov .Copyright © 2019.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut  contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572329>Dramatic Remodeling of the Gut Microbiome Around Parturition and Its Relationship With Host Serum Metabolic Changes in Sows.</a></h2><p>Perinatal care is important in mammals due to its contribution to fetal growth, maternal health, and lactation. Substantial changes in host hormones, metabolism, and immunity around the parturition period may be accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. However, to our knowledge, changes in the gut microbiome and their contribution to the shifts in host metabolism around parturition have not been investigated in pigs. Furthermore, pigs are an ideal biomedical model for studying the interactions of the gut  with host metabolism, due to the ease of controlling feeding conditions. Here we report dramatic remodeling of the gut  and the potential functional capacity during the late stages of pregnancy ( days before parturition, LP) to postpartum (within 6 h after delivery, PO) in both experimental and validated populations of sows ( = 107). The richness of bacteria in the gut of both pregnant and delivery sows significantly decreased, whilst the β-diversity dramatically expanded. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, and the relative abundance of Prevotella significantly decreased, whilst the relative abundance of the predominant genus  significantly increased from LP to PO state. The predicted functional capacities of the gut microbiome related to amino acid metabolism, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis were significantly decreased from LP to PO state. However, the abundance of the functional capacities associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were increased. Consistent with these changes, serum metabolites enriched at the LP stage were associated with the metabolism of amino acids and vitamins. In contrast, metabolites enriched at the PO stage were related to lipid metabolism. We further identified that the richness and β-diversity of the gut  and the abundance of  accounted for shifts in the levels of bile acid metabolites associated with lipid metabolism. The results suggest that host- interactions during the perinatal period impact host metabolism. These benefit the lactation of sows by providing energy from lipid metabolism for milk production.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Gao, Zhao, He, Ke, Wu, Zhou, Fu, Yang, Chen and Huang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662431>Interrogation of Internal Workings in Microbial Community Assembly: Play a Game through a Behavioral Network?</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that the influence of  on biogeochemical cycling, plant development, and human health is executed through a complex network of microbe-microbe interactions. However, characterizing how microbes interact and work together within closely packed and highly heterogeneous microbial ecosystems is extremely challenging. Here, we describe a rule-of-thumb framework for visualizing polymicrobial interactions and extracting general principles that underlie microbial communities. We integrate elements of metabolic ecology, behavioral ecology, and game theory to quantify the interactive strategies by which microbes at any taxonomic level compete for resources and cooperate symbiotically with each other to form and stabilize ecological communities. We show how the framework can chart an omnidirectional landscape of microbial cooperation and competition that may drive various natural processes. This framework can be implemented into genome-wide association studies to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial interaction networks and their evolutionary consequences along spatiotemporal gradients. Identifying general biological rules that underlie the complexity and heterogeneity of microbial communities has proven to be highly challenging. We present a rule-of-thumb framework for studying and characterizing how microbes interact with each other across different taxa to determine community behavior and dynamics. This framework is computationally simple but conceptually meaningful, and it can provide a starting point to generate novel biological hypotheses about microbial interactions and explore internal workings of microbial community assembly in depth.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut  in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or  g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601034>Adalimumab Therapy Improves Intestinal Dysbiosis in Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>The response to treatment with biologic drugs, in patients with Crohn's disease, could be associated with changes in gut  composition.

We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and  in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal  in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the pathways related to metabolism, diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal  composition and functions of P. clarkii.

We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with % gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of browning markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal  composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers. If confirmed in humans, we bring new arguments to eat fiber-rich cereals to promote a healthy diet. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

Five samples of commercial spelt flour were subjected to spontaneous fermentation to obtain a type I sourdough. A total of 186 LAB and 174 yeast isolates were selected at different refreshment steps and subjected to further analyses. Within LAB, coccal isolates constituted 78.% of the total LAB, with the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus. Although documented before as a component, this is the first report of a spelt sourdough fermentation dominated by this homofermentative LAB, characterized by a high acidification rate, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to grow in high osmolarity conditions. Yeast communities resulted in four dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae. This study highlights for the first time the biodiversity and dynamics of yeast communities involved in sourdough fermentation of spelt. Compared to commercial baker's yeast, autochthonous W. anomalus, P. fermentans and S. cerevisiae isolates show a good performance, and their use could be an advantage for their acquired adaptation to the environment, providing stability to the fermentation process.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

The present study identified 60 volatile compounds, 23 amino acids, and seven organic acids during the traditional brewing of Monascus vinegar. Acetic acid, alanine, alcohols, esters, lactic acid, and valine were the predominant metabolic compounds found during the fermentation process. Komagataeibacter medellinensis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Sterigmatomyces halophilus, and Yarrowia lipolytica were the dominant microorganisms during the traditional brewing of Monascus vinegar. Furthermore, based on Spearman's correlation analysis, K. medellinensis showed a positive correlation with acetic acid, acetoin, benzaldehyde, phenethyl acetate, 4-ethylphenol, proline, threonine, and isoleucine. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was positively associated with the production of acetoin, benzeneacetaldehyde, 2,3,-trimethylpyrazine, proline, threonine, and isoleucine. Bacillus velezensis and Yarrowia lipolytica were positively correlated with esters and alcohols, implying that these microorganisms might make a significant contribution to the flavor of vinegar. These findings demonstrated that some microorganisms may play important roles in improving the aromatic quality of Monascus vinegar.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, the counts of the strains with claimed probiotic properties were determined throughout the products' shelf-life. Additionally, the survival (%), at the beginning and at the end of their shelf-life, of each strain with claimed probiotic properties inoculated in the three foods was estimated by using a static in vitro system simulating the gastric (pH 2), enteric I (pH ) and enteric II (pH 7) phases of gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Overall, it has been found that the Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties showed greater viability than probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains no matter the food studied. The percentage of survival of the Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties were always above 83%. The Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties were able to survive well in all the food matrices tested.

Six multiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in a crossover design (two treatments × two periods). The control treatment (CON) was based on a diet including 50% of grass silage, whereas the experimental treatment (TAN) included grass silage sprayed with OTE (26 g/kg DM) just before baling. Milk yield (on average 24 kg fat protein corrected milk per day) was not affected, but both milk and rumen fatty acids profiles were impacted by OTE. Nitrogen intake (415 g N per cow per day) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; 0.25 on average) were not affected, but a shift from urine (-8% of N intake relatively to control, P = 0.06) to faecal N (+%; P = 0.004) was observed with the TAN diet (P ≤ 0.05). Nitrogen apparent digestibility was thus reduced for TAN (-3%; P ≤ 0.05). The effect of OTE on ruminal and milk FA profiles suggests an impact on rumen . Nitrogen isotopic discrimination between animal proteins and diet (Δ15N) was evaluated as a proxy for NUE. While no differences in NUE were observed across diets, a lower Δ15N of plasma proteins was found when comparing TAN v. CON diets. This finding supports the concept that Δ15N would mainly sign the N partitioning at the metabolic level rather than the overall NUE, with the latter also being impacted by digestive processes. Our results agree with a N shift from urine to faeces, and this strategy can thus be adopted to decrease the environmental impact of ruminant protein feeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641822>HS-SPME-GC-MS approach for the analysis of volatile salivary metabolites and application in a case study for the indirect assessment of gut .</a></h2><p>In this work, a straightforward analytical approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for the analysis of salivary volatile organic compounds without any prior derivatization step. With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain fatty acids and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of volatile metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing -day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the  and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut . This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut  dynamics.

Our goal is to analyze these changes together with those of intestinal  in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients over 50 years of age.Experimental single arm open study. HIV patients over the age of 50 with undetectable viral load were selected. EVOO was distributed among the patients so that each one consumed 50 g daily for 12 weeks. Lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), and intestinal  composition were analyzed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention.Total cholesterol decreased significantly ( mg/dL), and a nonsignificant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (12 mg/dL), triglycerides (21 mg/dL), and CRP (1.25 mg/dL) was observed. There was a significant increase in alpha diversity after the intervention in men and a decrease in proinflammatory genera such as Dethiosulfovibrionaceae was observed. Differences were also observed in the  of men and women and according to the type of antiretroviral treatment.Sustained consumption of 50 g of EVOO in elderly HIV-infected patients might be associated with an improvement in lipid profile and alfa diversity of intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563150>The composition and stability of the faecal  of Merino sheep.</a></h2><p>To determine the composition and temporal stability of the gut (faecal)  of sheep (Ovis aries).Microbial population dynamics was conducted using ARISA (28 sheep) and 16S rRNA sequencing (11 sheep). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the predominant bacterial phyla, constituting ~80% of the total population. The core faecal bacterial  of sheep consisted of 67 of 136 detected families and 91 of 215 detected species. Predominant microbial taxa included Ruminococcaceae, unassigned families in Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Paraprevotellaceae. Diversity indices and core  composition demonstrated the stability of the core  over 2-4 weeks. The core  remained similar over ~ months.Temporal stability of the sheep  is high over 2-4 weeks in the absence of experimental variables. The core  of Merino sheep shares taxa found in other breeds of sheep and other ruminants.Numerous studies seek to investigate the impact of experimental variables on gut  composition. To do so, knowledge of the innate stability (or instability) of the  over an experimental time course is required, independent of other variables. We have demonstrated high stability of the gut  in sheep over 3-4 weeks, with moderate stability over ~ months.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p></html>
