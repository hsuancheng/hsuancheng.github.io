<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352050>Development of a novel human stratum corneum model, as a tool in the optimization of drug formulations.</a></h2><p>Transdermal delivery represents a very attractive administration route that provides various advantages over other methods of administration, including enhanced patient compliance via non-invasive, painless and simple application and reduced side effects. Thereby, the research on suitable drugs for this route continues to increase. However, most of drug candidates face the challenges of low drug permeability across the skin's biologically active barrier - the stratum corneum (SC). In this context, a low cost, simple screening tool to evaluate penetration of drug candidates in a human SC barrier model was developed. The in vitro model is based on a modified phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (PVPA) with a lipid composition close to human SC layer. The new SC PVPA model can be stored up to 2 weeks at -20 °C, withstand a pH range from 2.0 to 8.0 and the presence of co-solvents (DMSO,  and cremophor®) without losing their integrity. The human mimicking SC PVPA model was able to detect calcein permeability differences when different drugs, applied in the therapy of skin-related diseases, were present. The obtained data correlated well with the well accepted pig ear model, which highlights the potential of this new human SC model.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Others have assessed BBB  with radionuclide markers. A nonradionuclide marker may be desirable in many studies. A charged antipyrine analogue may be useful to determine BBB  with concomitant antipyrine characterization of probe efficiency (Yokel et al., 1992, J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods 27:135-142), and may not require another analytical technique. We synthesized, validated, and evaluated 4-trimethylammonium antipyrine (4TMA-AP) as a BBB  marker. BBB permeation was determined by calculation of a BBB  percentage (Pi) from brain/blood concentrations. The PiS of Evan's blue, which does not permeate the intact BBB, and 4TMA-AP were not significantly different in rats without known BBB disruption, suggesting a lack of 4TMA-AP permeation through the intact BBB. When MD probes were slowly implanted into the frontal cortex, 4TMA-AP PiS were usually zero. Intracarotid  injection to open the BBB significantly increased 4TMA-AP PiS, suggesting that 4TMA-AP entered brain ECF when the BBB was compromised. Rapid probe implantation produced increased 4TMA-AP PiS, suggesting BBB disruption. The predicted appearance of 4TMA-AP in brain ECF suggests that it is a BBB  marker.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23526996>Fatty  ethyl esters induce intestinal epithelial  dysfunction via a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism in a three-dimensional cell culture model.</a></h2><p>Evidence is accumulating that ethanol and its oxidative metabolite, acetaldehyde, can disrupt intestinal epithelial , an important factor contributing to ethanol-induced liver injury. However, ethanol can also be metabolized non-oxidatively generating phosphatidylethanol and fatty  ethyl esters (FAEEs). This study aims to investigate the effects of FAEEs on  function, and to explore the role of oxidative stress as possible mechanism.Epithelial permeability was assessed by paracellular flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran using live cell imaging. Cell  was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release. Localization and protein levels of ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed by immunofluorescence and cell-based ELISA, respectively. Intracellular oxidative stress and cellular ATP levels were measured by dichlorofluorescein and luciferase driven bioluminescence, respectively.In vitro, ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitate dose dependently increased permeability associated with disruption and decreased ZO-1 and occludin protein levels, respectively, and increased intracellular oxidative stress without compromising cell viability. These effects could partially be attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant, resveratrol, pointing to the role of oxidative stress in the FAEEs-induced intestinal  dysfunction.These findings show that FAEEs can induce intestinal  dysfunction by disrupting the tight junctions, most likely via reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884070>Intravenous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells attenuates  induced acute lung injury in rats.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) and end-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were among the most common causes of death in intensive care units. The activation of an inflammatory response and the damage of pulmonary epithelium and endotheliumwerethe hallmark of ALI/ARDS. Recent studies had demonstrated the importance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in maintaining the normal pulmonary endothelial and epithelial function as well as participating in modulating the inflammatory response and they are involved in epithelial and endothelial repair after injury. Here, our study demonstrates MSCs therapeutic potential in a rat model of ALI/ARDS.Bone marrow derived MSCs were obtained from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and their differential potential was verified. ALI was induced in rats byoleic  (OA), and MSCs were transplanted intravenously. The lung injury and the concentration of cytokines in plasma and lung tissue extracts were assessed at 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after OA-injection.The histological appearance and water content in rat lung tissue were significantly improved at different time points in rats treated with MSCs. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor-a and intercellular adhesion molecular-1 in rats plasma and lung tissue extracts were significantly inhibited after intravenous transplantation of MSCs, whereas interleukin-10 was significantly higher after MSCs transplantation at 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after OA-challenge.Intravenous transplantation of MSCs could maintain the  of the pulmonary alveolar-capillary  and modulate the inflammatory response to attenuate the experimental ALI/ARDS. Transplantation of MSCs could be a novel cell-based therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359717>Buccal delivery of small molecules - Impact of levulinic , , sodium dodecyl sulfate and hypotonicity on ex vivo permeability and spatial distribution in mucosa.</a></h2><p>Studies of drug permeability rate and localization in buccal mucosa are essential to gain new knowledge of means such as chemical enhancers or osmolality to enhance buccal drug transport in the development of new buccal drug products. The transport of caffeine, diazepam and mannitol across porcine buccal mucosa was studied in modified Ussing chambers with a hypotonic donor solution, in the presence of levulinic  (LA),  (OA), propylene glycol (PG) as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Subsequently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was applied to image the spatial distribution of caffeine, mannitol and SDS in cross-sections of porcine buccal mucosa. The results revealed that none of the permeation enhancing strategies improved the permeability of caffeine or diazepam, despite impact on the tissue integrity by OA and SDS, as seen by an increased permeability of mannitol. Further studies are needed with OA since PG solvent may have concealed the possible impact of OA. SDS decreased the permeability of caffeine and diazepam, a decrease which can be explained by micellar lipid extraction and encapsulation in micelles. MALDI-MSI showed that SDS permeated into approximately one-third of the epithelium, and it therefore appears that the main permeability  for mannitol is located in the outer epithelium. MALDI-MSI was shown to be a useful method for imaging spatial distribution of drugs and permeations enhancers in buccal mucosa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the MRI manifestation of POA@SPION in the inner ear.A total of 26 male Wister rats were selected for testing POA@SPION administered through intracochlear, intratympanic and intravenous routes. MRI was performed with a 4.7 T MR scanner.POA@SPION can be introduced into the perilymph space, after which it becomes widely distributed and can demonstrate the  of the perilymph-endolymph . Positive highlighting of the endolymph compartment against the darkened perilymph was visualized for the first time. POA@SPION passed through the middle-inner ear barriers in only small amounts, but stayed in the perilymph for 3 days. They did not traverse the blood-perilymph  or blood-endolymph . The inner ear distribution of POA@SPION was confirmed by histology. POA@SPION is a promising T2 negative contrast agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21445759>Transdermal delivery using surface electrodes in porcine skin.</a></h2><p>The main  to cutaneous or transcutaneous drug and gene delivery is the impermeability of the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the skin (1). If the  of the SC is disrupted, the  to molecular transit may be greatly reduced. Cutaneous absorption can be increased by removal of the SC by tape-stripping or dermabrasion, by vehicle (solvent-carrier) optimization, or by the use of penetration enhancers like DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide), , and alcohols (2,3). An electric field can also be used to enhance delivery. Disruption of the SC can be achieved by electroporation, which is the creation of penetration sites by an electric pulse. Ions and molecules move through induced gaps of the SC by diffusion and electromotive or electroosmotic transport (4-6). Electroporation differs from iontophoresis, in which there is an increased migration of ions or charged molecules through the skin when an electrical potential gradient is applied. The primary transdermal route for iontophoresis seems to be appendageal or intercellular through preexisting pathways (5,7), or as a result of low-voltage (<5 V) induced permeabilization of appendageal bilayers (8). A third form of electroenhanced drug delivery, electrochemotherapy (9), refers to localized delivery of electric pulses across a tumor following systemic or intratumor drug administration, and usually does not involve cutaneous or transcutaneous delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7615201>Trefoil peptide protection of intestinal epithelial  function: cooperative interaction with mucin glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Goblet cells secrete a combination of trefoil peptides and mucin glycoproteins to form a continuous gel on the mucosal surface. The functional effects of these products remain uncertain.Trefoil peptides and/or mucin glycoproteins were added to Transwell monolayers of the human colonic cancer-derived T84 cell line. Intact monolayers permitted penetration of < 4% of the inert marker [3H]mannitol at 4 hours. Exposure to the toxic lectin phytohemagglutinin (1 mg/mL),  (8 mmol/L) and taurocholic  (12 mmol/L), or Clostridium difficile toxin A (0.7 microgram/mL) resulted in loss of  function with 36%, 62%, and 45% of [3H]mannitol penetration, respectively.Addition of recombinant human intestinal trefoil factor in physiological concentrations (1-5 micrograms/microL) resulted in attenuation of the damage to monolayer  by up to 52%. Protection was enhanced (up to 95%) by the copresence of human colonic mucin glycoproteins. Similar effects were observed when rat intestinal trefoil factor or human spasmolysin, another human trefoil peptide, were added alone or in the presence of human mucin glycoproteins. Conversely, mucin glycoproteins isolated from the rat colon or stomach facilitated protection when added with human spasmolysin or human intestinal trefoil factor.Trefoil peptides and mucin glycoproteins protect gastrointestinal mucosa from a variety of insults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9504581>Positron emission tomography measurements of pulmonary vascular permeability with Ga-68 transferrin or C-11 methylalbumin.</a></h2><p>To compare estimates of pulmonary endothelial   obtained using two different tracer proteins.Measure the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate with gallium (Ga)-68 labeled transferrin (PTCER(tf)) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and compare the results to similar measurements obtained with C-11 labeled methylalbumin (PTCER(alb)).Laboratory investigation.Mongrel dogs.No intervention in one group of dogs (n = 3);  induced lung injury in another set (n = 4).Although PTCER(tf) was consistently higher than PTCER(alb) (mean difference: 50 x 10(-4)/min), the overall correlation between the two methods, after normalizing for differences in regression slope and intercept among the individual dogs, was excellent (r2 = .67).The data support the continued use of PET and Ga-68 transferrin as an appropriate means of evaluating and quantifying lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1294887>The essential fatty acids.</a></h2><p>In animal and human tissues, there are four families of fatty acids that are derived from the precursors palmitoleic, , linoleic, and linolenic acids. Of these, linoleic and linolenic acids are essential dietary elements for humans and all higher animals. The four precursor fatty acids are metabolized (through desaturation and chain elongation) to form the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The principal fatty acids derived from linoleic  are arachidonic , which contains four double bonds (tetraene) and dihomogamma linolenic , whereas products formed from linolenic  are eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic . The major products from palmitoleic and  acids are the 20 carbon fatty acids with three double bonds (triene). In the presence of adequate dietary amounts of essential fatty acids, tetraene products predominate in plasma. When the intakes of both linoleic and linolenic acids are low, triene formation is high and hence the triene/tetraene ratio in plasma is used to assess the index of essential fatty  deficiency. The polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from essential fatty acids serve as cellular membrane phospholipid components which can influence the physicochemical characteristics of the lipid bilayer. Changes in membrane lipids can modify the mobility and function of a variety of membrane proteins which may result in altered cell/organ functions. Linoleic  is specifically required in the skin to maintain the  of epidermal water . The dihomogamma linolenic , arachidonic , and eicosapentaenoic  are the precursors of eicosanoids which influence many cell processes and organ functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic  damages   integrity and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

To this end, the penetration depth of each compound was elucidated through tape stripping studies by the simultaneous quantification of diclofenac-sodium and the fluorosurfactant from the same sample. A new approach was made by using the very sensitive and specific (19)F NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) for quantification of the fluorinated vehicle component. The tape stripping experiments with the microemulsions showed an almost similar penetration velocity of diclofenac-sodium and fluorosurfactant, suggesting that the surfactant within the microemulsion-structure intensified the stratum corneum uptake of the incorporated active constituent. Moreover, ATR-FTIR studies on porcine ear skin revealed significant shifts of the CH₂ stretching absorbances, which are associated with an enhanced disorder of the SC lipids resulting in a decreased skin  , after application of the microemulsions. However, the application of pure fluorosurfactant did not cause any shifts in the CH₂ stretching absorbances. It can be thereby concluded that the prepared microemulsions exerted specific effects on skin integrity resulting in a "push" of diclofenac-sodium penetration.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A recent report about acne vulgaris suggested that an impaired water  function may be responsible for comedo formation, since the  dysfunction is accompanied by hyperkeratosis of the follicular epithelium. Furthermore, the  of the water  is crucial for the maintenance of the epidermal calcium gradient. Yet stratum corneum intercellular lipid structures, a major factor of the skin  function, and calcium distribution in the follicular epithelium of comedones, were not reported. To see SC intercellular lipid and calcium distribution of the follicular epithelium of comedo by electron microscopy, we applied  on the inner surface of the ear of New Zealand white rabbits to induce comedones, and then we obtained specimens and performed osmium and ruthenium tetroxide postfixation and calcium ion-capture cytochemical procedure. We found incomplete lipid bilayer structures, prominent dilatation of lacunar domains and the loss of follicular epidermal calcium gradient in experimentally induced comedones. From our results, we suggest that the permeability  disruption in -applied follicular epithelium can be induced by the changes of SC intercellular membrane structures and lacunar dilatation, and the calcium gradient is lost, so follicular epithelial proliferation and hyperkeratosis can be induced and then comedo formation occurs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18292677>Autologous transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells attenuates acute lung injury in rabbits.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) and end-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the most common causes of death in intensive care units. Activation and damage of pulmonary endothelium is the hallmark of ALI/ARDS. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in maintaining normal endothelial function as well as endothelial repairing after vascular injury. Here, the authors present the first study demonstrating the therapeutic potential of EPCs in a rabbit model of ALI/ARDS.Circulating EPCs were obtained from rabbits using Ficoll centrifugation. One week after culturing, ALI was induced in rabbits by  (75 mg/kg, intravenous), and autologous EPCs were transplanted intravenously. Vasomotor function of isolated pulmonary artery and degrees of lung injury were assessed 2 days later.Endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary artery was significantly attenuated in rabbits treated with EPCs, whereas the endothelium-independent relaxation responses were not different. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was suppressed in the pulmonary artery of EPC-treated animals. Infiltration of leukocytes in the lung parenchyma was significantly reduced after EPC transplantation. EPCs also decreased water content, hyaline membrane formation, and hemorrhage in lungs.The authors demonstrated that autologous transplantation of EPCs preserves pulmonary endothelial function and maintains the  of pulmonary alveolar-capillary . Transplantation of EPCs can be a novel cell-based, endothelium-targeted therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15389899>Early blood-brain  disruption in human focal brain ischemia.</a></h2><p>Loss of  of the blood-brain  (BBB) resulting from ischemia/reperfusion is believed to be a precursor to hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and poor outcome. We used a novel magnetic resonance imaging marker to characterize early BBB disruption in human focal brain ischemia and tested for associations with reperfusion, HT, and poor outcome (modified Rankin score >2). BBB disruption was found in 47 of 144 (33%) patients, having a median time from stroke onset to observation of 10.1 hours. Reperfusion was found to be the most powerful independent predictor of early BBB disruption (p = 0.018; odds ratio, 4.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-13.1). HT was observed in 22 patients; 16 (72.7%) of those also had early BBB disruption (p < 0.001; odds ratio, 8.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.85-23.1). In addition to baseline severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >6), early BBB disruption was found to be an independent predictor of HT. Because the timing of the disruption was early enough to make it relevant to acute thrombolytic therapy, early BBB disruption as defined by this imaging biomarker may be a promising target for adjunctive therapy to reduce the complications associated with thrombolytic therapy, broaden the therapeutic window, and improve clinical outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8314859> supplementation reduces oxidant-mediated dysfunction of cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that supplementing cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) with exogenous  (18:1 omega 9) alters the fatty  composition of the cells and reduces oxidant-mediated cytotoxicity. Because the mechanisms by which lipid alterations modulate oxidant susceptibility have not been defined, the ability of 18:1 to reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated PAEC dysfunction was evaluated. PAEC monolayers on polycarbonate filters were incubated for 3 h in maintenance medium supplemented with either 0.1 mM 18.1 in ethanol vehicle (ETOH) or with an equivalent volume of vehicle alone. Twenty-four hours later monolayers were treated for 30 min with 50 or 100 microM H2O2 in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) or with HBSS alone (nonoxidant control). As a functional index of PAEC monolayer , the permeability of monolayers to albumin was then measured for 3 h. Treatment with 100 microM H2O2 caused cytotoxicity and progressive increases in PAEC monolayer permeability that were attenuated by 18:1 supplementation, whereas 50 microM H2O2 caused only a transient increase in permeability without cytotoxicity. Supplementation with 18:1 also attenuated H2O2-induced reductions in PAEC adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and disruption of PAEC microfilament architecture. The ATP content of PAEC monolayers was reversibly reduced in the absence of oxidant stress by incubation with glucose-depleted medium containing deoxyglucose and antimycin A. Metabolic inhibitor-induced ATP depletion increased monolayer permeability and altered cytoskeletal architecture, alterations that resolved during recovery of PAEC ATP content. These results demonstrate that ATP depletion plays a critical role in  dysfunction and suggests that the ability of 18:1 to reduce oxidant-mediated PAEC dysfunction and injury may relate directly to its ability to preserve PAEC ATP content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095531>Low-level red LED light inhibits hyperkeratinization and inflammation induced by unsaturated fatty  in an in vitro model mimicking acne.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units (PSU), associated with increased sebum production, abnormal follicular keratinization (hyperkeratinization), follicular overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), and increased inflammatory mediator release. Light therapy has attracted medical interests as a safe alternative treatment for acne. Both blue and red light therapies at high doses >10 J/cm have demonstrated marked effects on inflammatory acne lesions. However, few studies have investigated the effects of lower doses of light. The aim of this study is to investigate the biological effects of lower doses of red light at 0.2-1.2 J/cm for acne using an in vitro model previously developed to mimic the inflammation and hyperkeratinization observed clinically in acne.Human epidermal equivalents were topically exposed to an unsaturated fatty ,  (OA), followed by red light-emitting diode (LED) light treatments (light-plus-OA treatments). Endpoints evaluated included the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α, epidermal  integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and stratum corneum (SC) thickness to monitor hyperkeratinization.OA-induced IL-1α release was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced following red LED light at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.2 J/cm , from 266 ± 11 pg/ml of no-light-plus-OA-treated (OA treatment without light) controls to 216 ± 9, 231 ± 8, and 212 ± 7 pg/ml, respectively. Histological examination showed that SC thickening following OA treatment was reduced from 43% of total epidermis for no-light-plus-OA treatment to 37% and 38% of total epidermis following 0.5 and 1.1 J/cm red light plus OA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, 1.1 J/cm red-light-plus-OA treatment improved OA-induced TEER changes from 29% of baseline for no-light-plus-OA treatment, to 36% of baseline.Low level red LED light therapy could provide beneficial effects of anti-inflammation, normalizing pilosebaceous hyperkeratinization, and improving  impairment in Acne vulgaris.
