The gut microbiota plays an important role in nutrient  and affects a number of physiological mechanisms in the host. Studies have shown that seasonal changes occur in the intestinal microbes of mammals that hibernate seasonally. However, these studies only focused on ground squirrels and bears. It remains unclear how hibernation might affect the intestinal microbes of bats. In this study, we measured microbial diversity and composition in the gut of  in different periods (early spring, early summer, late summer, torpor, and interbout arousal) using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and PICRUSt to predict functional profiles. We found seasonal changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbes in . The diversity of gut microbiota was highest in the late summer and lowest in the early summer. The relative abundance of  was highest in the early summer and significantly lower in other periods. The relative abundance of  was lowest in the early summer and significantly increased in the late summer, followed by a significant decrease in the early winter and early spring. The relative abundance of  was significantly higher in the early spring compared with other periods. The results of functional prediction by PICRUSt showed seasonal variations in the relative abundance of -related pathways, including , carbohydrate , and energy . Functional categories for carbohydrate  had significantly lower relative abundance in early winter-torpor compared with late summer, while those associated with  had significantly higher relative abundance in the early winter compared with late summer. Overall, our results show that seasonal physiological changes associated with hibernation alter the gut microbial community of . Hibernation may also alter the metabolic function of intestinal microbes, possibly by converting the gut microflora from carbohydrate-related to -related functional categories. This study deepens our understanding of the symbiosis between hibernating mammals and gut microbes.Copyright © 2019 Xiao, Liu, Xiao, Zhu, Zhao, Li, Li and Feng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639770>Increased leptin, decreased adiponectin and FGF21 concentrations in adolescent offspring of women with gestational diabetes.</a></h2><p>Fetal exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases the risk of metabolic diseases in the offspring. Leptin, adiponectin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) may play potential roles in the underlying disease mechanisms. We investigated the impact of fetal exposure to GDM on leptin, adiponectin, and FGF21 concentrations and their associations with measures of adiposity and metabolic traits during childhood/adolescence.The follow-up study included 504 GDM and 540 control offspring aged 9-16 from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Anthropometric measurements, fasting blood samples, puberty status and  percentages by Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were examined. Serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, and FGF21 were measured by validated immune assays.GDM offspring had 38% (95% CI: 22-55%) higher leptin, 0.6mg/L (95% CI -1.2, -0.04mg/L) lower adiponectin, and 32% (95% CI: -47%, -12%) lower FGF21 concentrations than control offspring (p<0.05). After adjustment for confounders including maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM offspring had borderline higher leptin (p=0.06) and significantly lower FGF21 concentrations (p=0.006). When accounting for offspring BMI z-score, GDM exposure had no significant independent effect on leptin or adiponectin concentrations whereas FGF21 was still significant. In univariate analyses, leptin and adiponectin were associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and adiposity, and FGF21 with total  percentage.GDM offspring had higher leptin, lower adiponectin and FGF21 concentrations than control offspring. Elevated leptin and decreased adiponectin concentrations associated with adverse metabolic traits and were most likely driven by higher obesity prevalence among GDM offspring. The functional implications of decreased FGF21 concentrations among GDM offspring need to be further explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid  and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular  accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

They play three major roles: energy , structural, and signaling. They are dynamic molecules strongly influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetics, diet, age, lifestyle, drugs, disease and inflammation. As precision medicine starts to become mainstream, there is a huge burgeoning interest in lipids and their potential to act as unique biomarkers or prognostic indicators. Lipids comprise a large component of all metabolites (around one-third), and our expanding knowledge about their dynamic behavior is fueling the hope that mapping their regulatory biochemical pathways on a systems level will revolutionize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and stratify major human diseases. Up to now, clinical  measurements have consisted primarily of total cholesterol or triglycerides, as a measure for cardiovascular risk and response to  lowering drugs. Nowadays, we are able to measure thousands of individual lipids that make up the lipidome. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) metabolomics is also being increasingly used in large cohort studies where it can report on total levels of selected  classes, and relative levels of fatty acid saturation. To support the application of lipidomics research,  MAPS was established in 2003, and since then has gone on to become the go-to resource for several  databases,  drawing tools, data deposition, and more recently lipidomics informatics tools, and a  biochemistry encyclopedia, LipidWeb. Alongside this, the recently established Lipidomics Standards Initiative plays a key role in standardization of lipidomics methodologies.

To study reactive products of gut inflammation and redox signaling on CRC development we used untargeted adductomics to detect adduct features in pre-diagnostic serum from the EPIC-Italy cohort. We focused on modifications to Cys34 in human serum albumin (HSA), which is responsible for scavenging small reactive electrophiles that might initiate cancers. Employing a combination of statistical methods, we selected seven Cys34 adducts associated with CRC, as well as BMI (a well-known risk factor). Five adducts were more abundant in CRC cases than controls and clustered with each other, suggesting a common pathway. Since two of these adducts were Cys34 modifications by methanethiol, a microbial-human co-metabolite, and crotonaldehyde, a product of  peroxidation, these findings further implicate infiltration of gut microbes into the intestinal mucosa and the corresponding inflammatory response as causes of CRC. The other two associated adducts were Cys34 disulfides of homocysteine that were less abundant in CRC cases than controls and may implicate homocysteine  as another causal pathway. The selected adducts and BMI ranked higher as potentially causal factors than variables previously associated with CRC (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and total meat consumption). Regressions of case-control differences in adduct levels on days to diagnosis showed no statistical evidence that disease progression, rather than causal factors at recruitment, contributed to the observed differences. These findings support the hypothesis that infiltration of gut microbes into the intestinal mucosa and the resulting inflammation are causal factors for CRC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645268>The influence of post-infarct heart failure and high  diet on the expression of apelin APJ and vasopressin V1a and V1b receptors.</a></h2><p>Vasopressin and apelin are reciprocally regulated hormones which are implicated in the pathophysiology of heart failure and the regulation of ; however, little is known about their interactions under pathological conditions. In this study, we determined how post-infarct heart failure (HF) and a high  diet (HFD) affect expression of the apelin APJ receptor (APJR) and the V1a (V1aR) and V1b (V1bR) vasopressin receptors in the hypothalamus, the heart, and the retroperitoneal adipose tissue. We performed experiments in male 4-week-old Sprague Dawley rats. The animals received either a normal  diet (NFD) or a HFD for 8 weeks, then they underwent left coronary artery ligation to induce HF or sham surgery (SO), followed by 4 weeks of NFD or HFD. The HF rats showed higher plasma concentration of NT-proBNP and copeptin. The HF reduced the APJR mRNA expression in the hypothalamus. The APJR and V1aR protein levels in the hypothalamus were regulated both by HF and HFD, while the V1bR protein level in the hypothalamus was mainly influenced by HF. APJR mRNA expression in the heart was significantly higher in rats on HFD, and HFD affected the reduction of the APJR protein level in the right ventricle. The regulation of APJR, V1aR and V1bR expression in the heart and the retroperitoneal adipose tissue were affected by both HF and HFD. Our study demonstrates that HF and HFD cause significant changes in the expression of APJR, V1aR and V1bR, which may have an important influence on the cardiovascular system and .Copyright © 2019.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic  accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636709>Production of galactitol from galactose by the oleaginous yeast  IFO0880.</a></h2><p>Sugar alcohols are commonly used as low-calorie sweeteners and can serve as potential building blocks for bio-based chemicals.

In addition,  was able to produce galactitol from galactose at reduced titers during growth in nitrogen-poor medium, which also induces  production. These results suggest that  can potentially be used for the co-production of lipids and galactitol from galactose. We further characterized the mechanism for galactitol production, including identifying and biochemically characterizing the critical aldose reductase. Intracellular metabolite analysis was also performed to further understand galactose . has traditionally been used for the production of lipids and -based chemicals. Our work demonstrates that  can also produce galactitol, which can be used to produce polymers with applications in medicine and as a precursor for anti-cancer drugs. Collectively, our results further establish that  can produce multiple value-added chemicals from a wide range of sugars.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631099>Empagliflozin's Ameliorating Effect on Plasma Triglycerides: Association with Endothelial Function Recovery in Diabetic Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h2><p>So far, the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular benefits of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have not been fully clarified.In order to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on systemic hemodynamics, glucose ,  profile, and endothelial function, 50 diabetic patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) were included in this analysis and were given empagliflozin 10 mg/d. Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fats: 28.5 g), endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and body composition evaluation were performed before and after six months of treatment. Changes in %FMD between the treatment periods and its association with metabolic biomarkers were evaluated.After six months of treatment, the body weight and body  percentage decreased significantly, while the body muscle percentage increased significantly. The hemoglobin A1c level and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly decreased with treatment. Postprandial insulin secretion was also significantly suppressed and the insulin resistance index was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels decreased significantly, while total ketone bodies increased significantly after the six-month treatment. While the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was not changed, the C-reactive protein level was decreased and FMD was significantly improved after the six-month treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the strongest predictive factor of FMD improvement is change in the plasma TG levels.SGLT2 inhibitors improve multiple metabolic parameters. Of these, a reduction in plasma TGs was strongly associated with endothelial function recovery in diabetic patients with CAD, and this reduction may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631098>Regulation of angiopoietin-like protein 8 expression under different nutritional and metabolic status.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, is involved in glucose , , and energy homeostasis and believed to be associated with T2DM. Expression levels of ANGPTL8 are often significantly altered in metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that ANGPTL8, together with other members of this protein family, such as angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), regulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby participating in the regulation of triglyceride related lipoproteins (TRLs). In addition, members of the angiopoietin-like protein family are varyingly expressed among different tissues and respond differently under diverse nutritional and metabolic status. These findings may provide new options for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, metabolic syndromes and other diseases. In this review, the interaction between ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL3 or ANGPTL4, and the differential expression of ANGPTL8 responding to different nutritional and metabolic status during the regulation of LPL activity were reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649645> subsp.

It secretes unusually shaped nanotubular outer membrane vesicles (OMV) loaded with a number of virulence factors and immunoreactive proteins. In the present study, the vesicles were purified from a clinical isolate of subsp.  strain FSC200. We here provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of OMV using a novel approach in which a comparison of OMV and membrane fraction is performed in order to find proteins selectively enriched in OMV vs. membrane. Only these proteins were further considered to be really involved in the OMV function and/or their exceptional structure. OMV were also isolated from bacteria cultured under various cultivation conditions simulating the diverse environments of  life cycle. These included conditions mimicking the milieu inside the mammalian host during inflammation: oxidative stress, low pH, and high temperature (42°C); and in contrast, low temperature (25°C). We observed several-fold increase in vesiculation rate and significant protein cargo changes for high temperature and low pH. Further proteomic characterization of stress-derived OMV gave us an insight how the bacterium responds to the hostile environment of a mammalian host through the release of differentially loaded OMV. Among the proteins preferentially and selectively packed into OMV during stressful cultivations, the previously described virulence factors connected to the unique intracellular trafficking of  were detected.

From DEXA assessment, we estimated the ALM index (ALMI = appendicular lean mass/height2) and classified participants according to the degree of muscle loss (ALMI <  2 SD from the reference populations). Fasting blood was assayed for glycaemia, insulin, cortisol, and IGF-1 serum levels. Data were compared by T-test and Fisher's Exact Test; predictors of ALMI were investigated by linear regression models.The frequency of low ALM was 63% in overall sample, 55% T-group and 71% NT-group. Low ALM had no significant association with the origin of injury (X2 = 1.1, p = 0.29). Linear regression analyses showed significant association, in the whole sample, between ALMI and serum levels of IGF-1 (Beta = 0.69; p <  0.001), age (Beta=-5.8; p <  0.001), percentage  mass (Beta=-0.26; p = 0.001), and energy intake (Beta = 0.32; p = 0.02). These significances were not maintained in the NT-group sub-analyses.Low ALM was very frequent in our SCI participants, despite exercising and independently of the type of injury. Metabolic and demographic variables associated with low ALM were different according to the origin of injury, which possibly relies on physiopathology particularities.

Dysfunctional variants of NONO have been described as the cause of congenital heart defects in males. However, the effects of NONO deficiency on the ventricular function and cardiac fibrosis as well as the related mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the overall phenotypes, cardiac function and fibroblasts in NONO knockout (NONO KO) mice compared with the wild-type (WT) male littermates. The results showed that the birth rate of NONO mice was much lower than their WT male littermates at the time of weaning. The body weight of NONO mice was 19% lower than that of WT male littermates (27.2 ± 1.49 g vs. 22.01 ± 1.20 g, P < .001). NONO KO mice exhibited continuous higher mortality from birth to a year later (P < .05). Compared with those in the WT mice, the heart weight was lower(142.0 ± 8.7 mg vs. 179.0 ± 10.4 mg, P < .001), the heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) was similar, the E/A ratio was higher (1.80 ± 0.47 vs. 1.44 ± 0.26, P < .05), and the left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDd) was significantly lower (2.72 ± 0.51 mm vs.3.54 ± 0.43 mm, P < .001) in the NONO KO mice. We also found excessive matrix deposition in vivo. In vitro, NONO deficiency led to fibroblasts hyperproliferation, while migration was inhibited, which would induce collagen maturation and deposition. Conversely, overexpression of NONO inhibited fibroblasts proliferation and increased migration which reduced collagen deposition. RNA-seq of cardiac fibroblasts further indicated that NONO deficiency upregulated the cell cycle regulators, which included cyclin B2, the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1) and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6), while downregulated the migration regulators, which included myosins, integrin and coagulation factor II. Overexpression of NONO further verified the effects of these indicators. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that NONO deficiency was associated with developing heart defects in mice. Hyperproliferation of cardiac fibroblasts with dramatically excessive collagen secretion might be the cause of heart defects of NONO KO mice.Copyright © 2019.

They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C fatty acid palmitoyl-CoA and the amino acid L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid  will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat liver microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following  extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid  pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for  studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early  abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and diabetes, and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647087>Daily red wine vinegar ingestion for eight weeks improves glucose homeostasis and affects the metabolome but does not reduce adiposity in adults.</a></h2><p>Some studies have reported that vinegar ingestion at mealtime attenuates postprandial glycemia in healthy adults and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts  and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral  were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001).

In this study, we investigated the effect of  and its extracellular vesicles (EVs) on obesity-related genes in microarray datasets and evaluated the cell line and C57BL/6 mice by conducting RT-PCR and ELISA assays. -derived EVs caused a more significant loss in body and  weight of high- diet (HFD)-fed mice, compared with the bacterium itself. Moreover, treatment with  and EVs had significant effects on  and expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissues. Both treatments improved the intestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, energy balance, and blood parameters (i.e.,  profile and glucose level). Our findings showed that -derived EVs contain various biomolecules, which can have a positive impact on obesity by affecting the involved genes. Also, our results showed that  and its EVs had a significant relationship with intestinal homeostasis, which highlights their positive role in obesity treatment. In conclusion, -derived EVs can be used as new therapeutic strategies to ameliorate HFD-induced obesity by affecting various mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Ashrafian, Shahriary, Behrouzi, Moradi, Keshavarz Azizi Raftar, Lari, Hadifar, Yaghoubfar, Ahmadi Badi, Khatami, Vaziri and Siadat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks mitochondria down triggering metabolic rewiring in yeast.</a></h2><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate  droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole  suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629366>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults: Current concepts in etiology, outcomes and management.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease, extending from simple steatosis, through to inflammation and fibrosis with a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis. It is highly prevalent and is associated with significant adverse outcomes both through liver-specific morbidity and mortality, but perhaps more importantly, through adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. It is tightly associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and both of these conditions drive progressive disease towards the more advanced stages. The mechanisms that govern hepatic  accumulation and the predisposition to inflammation and fibrosis are still not fully understood, but reflect a complex interplay between metabolic target tissues including adipose and skeletal muscle, and immune and inflammatory cells.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Especially exposure to light at night containing short wavelength emissions (~450-500 nm) can disrupt the normal function of the biological clock, altering sleep-wake cycles and inducing metabolic changes. Recently, we reported that light at night acutely impairs glucose tolerance in nocturnal rats. However, light at night in nocturnal rodents coincides with their activity period, in contrast to artificial light at night exposure in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of blue (λ = 490 ± 20 nm) artificial light at night (bALAN) on glucose  and food intake in both male and female diurnal Sudanian grass rats (Arvicanthis ansorgei) fed either regular chow or a free choice high- high sucrose diet (HFHS). In both chow and HFHS fed male Arvicanthis, 1-hour of bALAN exposure induced a higher glucose response in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma insulin. Furthermore, in HFHS fed animals, bALAN induced an increase in sucrose intake during the dark phase in males but not in females. Additionally, 1-h of bALAN increased the nonfasted glucose levels together with plasma corticosterone in female grass rats. These results provide new and further evidence for the deleterious effects of exposure to short wavelength emission-containing artificial light at night on glucose  in a diurnal rodent in a sex-dependent manner.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of  in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several  classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty acids. This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty acids. The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and  homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change  concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in mitochondria, thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643424>Vitamin D.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D is a  soluble vitamin important in the regulation of calcium  and bone health and deficiency of which cause rickets, a disease marked by lack of mineralization of bone.

We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h2><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate  and amino acid  were dominant metabolic pathways.  was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal  deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the  metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal  accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648564>Prednisone and Its Active Metabolite Prednisolone Attenuate  Accumulation in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Synthetic forms of glucocorticoids (GCs; eg, prednisone, prednisolone) are anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used in clinical practice.

We investigated the effects of prednisone and prednisolone on macrophage oxidative stress and .C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with prednisone or prednisolone (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, followed by  analyses in the aorta and peritoneal macrophages. We also analyzed the effect of serum samples obtained from 9 healthy human volunteers before and after oral administration of prednisone (20 mg for 5 days) on J774A.1 macrophage atherogenicity. Finally, J774A.1 macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations (0-200 ng/mL) of prednisone or prednisolone, followed by determination of cellular oxidative status, and triglyceride and cholesterol . Prednisone and prednisolone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, as observed in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. These effects were associated with GCs' inhibitory effect on triglyceride- and cholesterol-biosynthesis rates, through downregulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and HMG-CoA reductase expression. Glucocorticoid-induced reduction of cellular  accumulation was mediated by the GC receptors on the macrophages, because the GC-receptor antagonist (RU486) abolished these effects. In fibroblasts, unlike macrophages, GCs showed no effects.Prednisone and prednisolone exhibit antiatherogenic activity by protecting macrophages from  accumulation and foam cell formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651237>RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis during bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infection.</a></h2><p>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the member of the genus Pestivirus within the Flaviviridae family and responsible for severe economic losses in the cattle industry. BVDV can employ 'infect-and-persist' strategy and 'hit-and-run' strategy to remain associated with hosts and thus contributes to BVDV circulation in cattle herds. BVDV have also evolved various strategies to evade the innate immunity of host. To further understand the mechanisms by which BVDV overcomes the host cell innate immune response and provide more clues for further understanding the BVDV-host interaction, in this descriptive study, we conducted a investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the host during BVDV infection by RNA-Seq analysis.Our analysis identified 1297, 1732, 3072, and 1877 DEGs in the comparison groups mock vs. MDBK cells infected with BVDV post 2 h (MBV2h), mock vs. MBV6h, mock vs. MBV12h, and mock vs. MBV24h, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability of the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analyses of GO annotations and KEGG pathways revealed the host DEGs that are potentially induced by BVDV infection and may participate in BVDV-host interactions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the potential interactions among the DEGs. Our findings suggested that BVDV infection induced the upregulation of genes involved in . The expression of genes that have antiviral roles, including ISG15, Mx1, OSA1Y, were found to be downregulated and are thus potentially associated with the inhibition of host innate immune system during BVDV infection. The expression levels of F3, C1R, KNG1, CLU, C3, FB, SERPINA5, SERPINE1, C1S, F2RL2, and C2, which belong to the complement and coagulation signalling cascades, were downregulated during BVDV infection, which suggested that the complement system might play a crucial role during BVDV infection.In this descriptive study, our findings revealed the changes in the host transcriptome expression profile during BVDV infection and suggested that BVDV-infection induced altering the host's metabolic network, the inhibition of the expression of antiviral proteins and genes within the complement system might be contributed to BVDV proliferation.

The present review describes the characters and patterns of lipidomic profiles in patients with different lung cancer subtypes, important values of comprehensive lipidomic profiles in understanding of lung cancer heterogeneity, urgent needs of standardized methodologies, potential mechanisms by -associated enzymes and proteins, and the importance of integration between clinical phenomes and lipidomic profiles. The characteristics of lipidomic profiles in different lung cancer subtypes are extremely varied among study designs, objects, methods, and analyses. Preliminary data from recent studies demonstrate the specificity of lipidomic profiles specific for lung cancer stage, severity, subtype, and response to drugs.

The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term effects of continuous access to a high  diet (HFD) versus limited access to dietary  on the gustatory neural circuit. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a chow diet, a HFD (55% kcal from ), or provided limited, daily (2h/day) or limited, intermittent (2h/day, 3 times/week) access to vegetable shortening for 2 weeks. Real time PCR was used to determine mRNA expression of markers of  sensing/signaling (e.g. CD36) on the circumvallate papillae, markers of homeostatic eating in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and markers of hedonic eating in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Continuous HFD increased mRNA levels of lingual CD36 and serotonin signaling, altered markers of homeostatic and hedonic eating. Limited, intermittent access to dietary  selectively altered the expression of genes associated with the regulation of dopamine signaling. Overall, these data suggest that short-term, continuous access to HFD leads to altered  taste and decreased expression of markers of homeostatic and hedonic eating. Limited, intermittent access, or binge-like, consumption of dietary  led to an overall increase in markers of hedonic eating, without altering expression of lingual  sensors or homeostatic eating.

The mechanisms behind DSMM in L individuals are not completely understood but decreased muscle mass and shifts in lipid and carbohydrate utilisation may contribute. Previously, we observed lower fat oxidation in a porcine model of low birth weight. To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with lipid  in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth weight (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth weight, diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary fat was associated with decreased LD intermuscular fat deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake and intramuscular fat deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis, lipid synthesis and transport increased in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary fat reduction, LD mRNA associated with lipid synthesis and inter- and intramuscular fat deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular fat deposition increased in both birth weight groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle lipid  associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth weight.

Although estimating the VFA by X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the primary index for visceral obesity, it is expensive and requires invasive radiation exposure. Dual bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple and reliable method to estimate VFA; however, the clinical usefulness of dual BIA remains unclear in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).We estimated the VFAs by dual BIA and CT in 98 patients with T2D and assessed anthropometric parameters, blood test results, and the presence of comorbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. We compared the correlation between the VFAs examined by dual BIA and CT. Furthermore, we performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for the VFAs to detect the presence of comorbid hypertension and/or dyslipidemia with T2D, which are major comorbidities of visceral obesity, and estimated the area under the curve (AUC).The measurement error between the VFAs by dual BIA and CT was significantly higher among patients with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥ 100 pg/mL than those with BNP < 100 pg/mL (39.2% ± 31.1% vs. 24.1% ± 18.6%, P < 0.05).

ZIKV tumor cell growth inhibition was later confirmed for glioblastoma. It was also demonstrated that an inactivated ZIKV prototype (ZVp) based on bacterial outer membrane vesicles has antiproliferative activity upon other cancer cell lines, such as PC-3 prostate cancer cell. This study aims at understanding the pathways that might be involved with the antiproliferative effect of Zika virus against prostate cancer cells.

As a novel adipocytokine, Chemerin not only plays a pivotal role in physiological and pathological processes such as immune response and , but is also involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, including autophagy and apoptosis. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether autophagy and apoptosis of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) was triggered by Chemerin. BMECs were cultured and treated with Chemerin in vitro. The expression of autophagosome-forming marker, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II (LC3-II) and sequestosome-1 (SQSTM 1, best known as p62), a substrate of autophagosome degradation were detected. The result showed that Chemerin significantly decreased the expression of p62 and markedly induced the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. The ratio of Bcl2-associated X and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bax/Bcl-2) and the activity of caspase-3 were up-regulated after being treated by Chemerin, and the apoptotic rate was also significantly increased. These results suggested that Chemerin promoted the occurrence of autophagy and apoptosis in BMECs. Chloroquine (CQ), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. To explore effects of Chemerin on apoptosis, we prevented Chemerin-induced autophagy by pre-adding CQ in BMECs. Interestingly, this part of the experiment helped us find that all effects of Chemerin on apoptosis of BMECs could be enhanced with the inhibition of autophagy. Our study demonstrates that Chemerin-induced autophagy and apoptosis are mutually regulated in BMECs, but the specific mechanism remains to be further researched.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648945>Structural analyses of inositol phosphate second messengers bound to signaling effector proteins.</a></h2><p>The higher-order inositol phosphate second messengers inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) are important signaling molecules that regulate DNA-damage repair, cohesin dynamics, RNA-editing, retroviral assembly, nuclear transport, phosphorylation, acetylation, crotonylation, and ubiquitination. This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme "adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 2" (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide  binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolic turnover of PPIn species has received immense attention due to the essential functions of these lipids as universal regulators of membrane biology and their dysregulation in numerous human pathologies. The diverse functions of PPIn lipids occur, in part, by orchestrating the spatial organization and conformational dynamics of peripheral or integral membrane proteins within defined subcellular compartments. The emerging role of stable contact sites between adjacent membranes as specialized platforms for the coordinate control of ion exchange, cytoskeletal dynamics, and  transport has also revealed important new roles for PPIn species. In this review, we highlight the importance of membrane contact sites formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) for the integrated regulation of PPIn  within the PM. Special emphasis will also be placed on non-vesicular  transport during the control of the PtdIns biosynthetic cycle as well as towards balancing the turnover of the signaling PPIn species that define PM identity.

Here, we report that mutant mice having defects in liver function, develop alopecia. We have shown previously that in mice lacking a Cnot3 gene, which encodes an essential component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in liver (Cnot3-LKO mice), the liver does not mature properly, resulting in various pathologies such as hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and anemia. Unexpectedly, Cnot3-LKO mice start to lose hair around postnatal day 17 (P17). The region of hair loss expands all across their backs and symptoms persist until around P28-30. Afterward, hair re-grows, and Cnot3-LKO mice show complete hair recovery by P40. The phenotype is dependent on mouse genotype, indicating that hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling are influenced by abnormal liver development. By performing histological, quantitative PCR, and immunoblot analyses, we detected sebaceous gland (SG) hypertrophy accompanied by an increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Collectively, these findings suggest that paracrine signaling related to liver function influences hair growth, at least in part, by altering .Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Obesity related  indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid , transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid  including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in . Our studies indicate that cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664920>Phenome-wide association analysis of LDL-cholesterol lowering genetic variants in PCSK9.</a></h2><p>We characterised the phenotypic consequence of genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus and compared findings with recent trials of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9.Published and individual participant level data (300,000+ participants) were combined to construct a weighted PCSK9 gene-centric score (GS). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration.The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma  and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials. ORs with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95% CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimer's disease - outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.Genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus recapitulates the effects of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 on major blood  fractions and MI.

We used adipose-derived human stromal/stem cells to reconstruct, using tissue engineering techniques, such an adipose tridimensional model. To determine to what extent the in vitro model is representative of its native counterpart, adipogenic differentiation, triglycerides accumulation and phospholipids profiles were analysed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed pathways enriched with differentially-expressed genes between native and reconstructed human adipose tissues. Interestingly, genes related to fatty acid  were downregulated in vitro, which could be explained in part by the insufficient amount of essential fatty acids provided by the fetal calf serum used for the culture. Indeed, the  profile of the reconstructed human adipose tissues indicated a particular lack of linoleic acid, which could interfere with physiological cell processes such as membrane trafficking, signaling and inflammatory responses. Supplementation in the culture medium was able to influence the  profile of the reconstructed human adipose tissues. This study demonstrates the possibility to directly modulate the phospholipid profile of reconstructed human adipose tissues. This reinforces its use as a relevant physiological or pathological model for further pharmacological and metabolic studies of human adipose tissue functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644039>Tesamorelin.</a></h2><p>Tesamorelin is a synthetic growth hormone releasing hormone analogue used in the treatment of visceral adiposity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients with lipodystrophy.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet  in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high- diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced  accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced  deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell  accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

In recent years, lignin has attracted renewed interest as a feedstock for bio-based chemicals via catalytic and biological approaches and has emerged as a target for genetic engineering to improve lignocellulose digestibility by altering its composition. In lignin biosynthesis and microbial conversion, small phenolic lignin precursors or degradation products cross membrane bilayers through an unidentified translocation mechanism prior to incorporation into lignin polymers (synthesis) or catabolism (bioconversion), with both passive and transporter-assisted mechanisms postulated. To test the passive permeation potential of these phenolics, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for 69 monomeric and dimeric lignin-related phenolics with 3 model membranes to determine the membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients for each compound. The results support an accessible passive permeation mechanism for most compounds, including monolignols, dimeric phenolics, and the flavonoid, tricin. Computed lignin partition coefficients are consistent with concentration enrichment near lipid carbonyl groups, and permeability coefficients are sufficient to keep pace with cellular . Interactions between methoxy and hydroxy groups are found to reduce membrane partitioning and improve permeability. Only carboxylate-modified or glycosylated lignin phenolics are predicted to require transporters for membrane translocation. Overall, the results suggest that most lignin-related compounds can passively traverse plant and microbial membranes on timescales commensurate with required biological activities, with any potential transport regulation mechanism in lignin synthesis, catabolism, or bioconversion requiring compound functionalization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657086>PRRX1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma activates the metabolic reprogramming of free fatty acids to promote invasion and metastasis.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences demonstrate a close correlation between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction and cancer . However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clarified.In our study, the relative expression level of PRRX1 was detected, its relationship with free fatty acid (FFA) and PPARG2 was analysed in 85 SACC tissues and 15 salivary glands from the benign salivary tumours. We also compared the FFAs composition and levels in these SACC cells. PPARG2 was detected in PRRX1-induced FFAs treatment as well as Src and MMP-9 were detected in FFAs treatment-induced invasion and migration of SACC cells, and ChIP test was performed to identify the target interactions.Our data showed that overexpression of PRRX1 induced EMT and facilitated the invasion and migration of SACC cells, and PRRX1 expression was closely associated with high FFAs level and poor prognosis of SACC patients. Furthermore, PRRX1 silence led to the increase of PPARG2 and the reduction of FFAs level and the migration and invasion of SACC cells. And inhibition of PPARG2 rescued FFAs level and migration and invasion capabilities of SACC cells. Free fatty acids treatment induced an increase of Stat5-DNA binding activity via Src- and MMP-9-dependent pathway.Collectively, our findings showed that the PRRX1/PPARG2/FFAs signalling in SACC was important for accelerating tumour metastasis through the induction of EMT and the metabolic reprogramming of FFAs.© 2019 The Authors.

FXR plays critical roles in other  metabolic pathways, including  oxidation; however, little is known about cafestol's effects on fatty acid . Thus, the goal was to investigate cafestol's effects on fatty acid  using Caenorhabditis elegans. Cafestol at 60 µM reduced  accumulation and increased locomotor activity (an indicator of energy expenditure) by 20% and 38%, respectively, compared to the control. Cafestol's effects were dependent on daf-12 (a functional homolog of the human FXR) with upregulation of ech-1.1 (a homolog of enoyl-CoA hydratase involved in fatty acid β-oxidation) and tub-1 (an ortholog of the human TUBBY involved in the neurological regulation of energy expenditure) without any effects on lipogenesis, lipolysis or  uptake and transport.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high- diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty acid with or without myriocin treatment.  accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty acid  associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high- diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% ), FO diet (NY, 10% ), HFD (60% ), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% ) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness, energy absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb.

Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646823>Correlations of recurrence after radical surgery for esophageal cancer with glucose-, insulin resistance, inflammation, stress and serum p53 expression.</a></h2><p>Esophageal cancer mortality trends vary substantially across the world.

While small molecule delivery via nanomedicine has promising applications for a number of chronic diseases, questions remain as to how nanoparticle formulation might be tailored to suit different tissue microenvironments and aid in drug delivery. In the current study, we aimed to compare the  drug delivering capability of three nanoparticle (NP) formulations encapsulating the LXR activator, GW-3965. We observed little difference in the base characteristics of standard PLGA-PEG NP when compared to two redox-active polymeric NP formulations, which we called redox-responsive (RR)1 and RR2. Moreover, we also observed similar uptake of these NP into primary mouse macrophages. We used the transcript and protein expression of the cholesterol efflux protein and LXR target ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) as a readout of GW-3956-induced LXR activation. Following an initial acute uptake period that was meant to mimic circulating exposure in vivo, we determined that although the induction of transcript expression was similar between NPs, treatment with the redox-sensitive RR1 NPs resulted in a higher level of ABCA1 protein.

Currently, our understanding of sublethal effects and underlying toxicologic mechanisms of GBHs are still limited, especially in amphibians. Here, the sublethal effects of a commercial GBH (KISSUN®) on tadpoles of a farmland dwelling frog, Microhyla fissipes, were investigated. The 10-d LC of "KISSUN®" GBH was 77.5 mg/L. Tadpoles exposed to 60-120 mg/L showed increased preference to higher temperature. After 10 days exposure, obvious growth suppression was observed in survived GBH-stressed tadpoles, characterized by dosage depended decrement in body mass, body width, total length, etc. GBH-stressed tadpoles also showed decreased tail length/snout-vent length ratio and smaller tail muscle fiber diameter. Comparative transcriptomics (control, 60 mg/L and 90 mg/L groups) was conducted to analyze the underlying molecular processes. GBH-stressed tadpoles showed downregulated transcription of ribosomal proteins and cytoskeleton proteins, which could explain their suppressed whole body and tail muscle growth. Moreover, GBH-stressed tadpoles showed transcriptional downregulation of carbohydrate and  catabolism, but upregulation of amino acid catabolism. It suggested a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and  to amino acid in these tadpoles. Accordingly, there was a trade-off between protein synthesis and energy production in respect to amino acid allocation, and it provided a metabolic explanation for why protein synthesis was downregulated and growth was suppressed in GBH-stressed tadpoles. In combination with existing literatures, we speculated that GBH might directly target the enzymes in carbohydrate and  catabolism, and this metabolic effect of GBH might be common to fish and amphibians. In conclusion, our study provided a systematic insight into the sublethal symptoms of GBH-stressed tadpoles, and a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and  to amino acid likely underlay some common toxic symptoms of GBHs on both fish and tadpoles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The growth status of abdominal  during postnatal late development ultimately affects meat yield and quality in chickens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in the biological processes involved in adipose tissue development. However, few studies have investigated miRNA expression profiles and their interaction networks associated with the postnatal late development of abdominal adipose tissue in chickens.We constructed four small RNA libraries from abdominal adipose tissue obtained from Chinese domestic Gushi chickens at 6, 14, 22, and 30 weeks. A total of 507 known miRNAs and 53 novel miRNAs were identified based on the four small RNA libraries. Fifty-one significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs were identified from six combinations by comparative analysis, and the expression patterns of these SDE miRNAs were divided into six subclusters by cluster analysis. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the SDE miRNAs were primarily involved in the regulation of  cell differentiation, regulation of , regulation of fatty acid , and unsaturated fatty acid  in the - or deposition-related biological process categories. In addition, we constructed differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA interaction networks related to abdominal adipose development.

In total, 14 relevant  were identified. The following prognostic risk model was generated: Risk score=CALML3 (degree of methylation) x (‑4.860) + CCNI2 x (2.071) + TNFRSF12A x (‑3.369) + IFITM1 x (1.203) + ENPP7P13 x (‑1.366) + DDT x (2.139) + RASAL2‑AS1 x (‑1.384) + ANKRD22 x (‑3.215). The median risk score (0.970) derived from this model was set as cutoff value for assigning patients to high‑ or low‑risk group. The 5‑year survival rate was 35.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.1‑47.4%] in the high‑risk group and 61.7% (95% CI=51.4‑74.2%) in the low‑risk group (P<0.0001). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.742, indicating that this model is appropriate for predicting the survival rate of patients. Furthermore, the methylation and expression levels of two key genes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12A and D‑dopachrome decarboxylase, were significantly associated with prognosis and were correlated with cg00510447, cg26808293, cg11060661 and cg16132339 methylation. In conclusion, a prognostic risk model for HCC is proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis of methylation‑driven genes. The findings of the present study may improve understanding of the pathogenesis and prognosis of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641036>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)-stimulated angiogenesis is mediated by epoxy hydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (EHETs) formed from COX-2.</a></h2><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are formed from the  of arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450s. EETs elicit endothelial angiogenic activity linked to tumor growth in various cancer models that can be attenuated in vivo by COX-2 inhibitors. This study further defines the relationship between endothelial EET  and COX-2 in promoting angiogenesis. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX-2 inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-2, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET). When exogenously dosed into HAEC, synthetic 8,9,11-EHET enhanced angiogenesis at all concentrations tested, whereas 8,9,15-EHET was inactive. Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-2  in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET. This  mediator may play a role in regulating physiological angiogenesis, and it may be especially important under circumstances where COX-2 is induced, such as in cancer tumor growth and inflammation. Finally, the generation of 8, 9, 11-EHET from 8, 9-EET may help explain why EETs are weakly angiogenic under some conditions yet block tumor growth under other conditions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648012>Recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor decreases  accumulation via the IIS pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (BTI) is a low molecular weight polypeptide that can help to prevent metabolic diseases such as obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Herein, the effects of recombinant BTI (rBTI) on  accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans were studied. rBTI prevented  accumulation under normal and high glucose conditions, and led to significantly shorter body widths without affecting C. elegans feeding behavior. Results also indicate that rBTI altered  breakdown, synthesis, and accumulation by altering the transcription, expression and activity of key enzymes in lipolysis and  synthesis. In daf-2 and daf-16 mutants, rBTI did not prevent  accumulation, indicating that rBTI activity relies on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway. Overall rBTI may regulate changes in lipolysis and  synthesis by down-regulating the IIS pathway, which can affect  accumulation. These findings support the application of rBTI in preventing obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia.Copyright © 2018.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to ,  transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to  and amino acid  were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy .

However, mutations in genes that control chromosome segregation are rare in human tumors as these mutations reduce cell fitness. Screening experiments indicate that the knockdown of multiple classes of genes that are not directly involved in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy induction. The possible contribution of these genes to cancer formation remains yet to be defined. Here we identified gene knockdowns that lead to an increase in aneuploidy in checkpoint-deficient human cancer cells. Computational analysis revealed that the identified genes overlap with recurrent mutations in human cancers. The knockdown of the three strongest selected candidate genes (ORP3, GJB3, and RXFP1) enhances the malignant transformation of human fibroblasts in culture. Furthermore, the knockout of Orp3 results in an aberrant expansion of lymphoid progenitor cells and a high penetrance formation of chromosomal instable, pauci-clonal B-cell lymphoma in aging mice. At pre-tumorous stages, lymphoid cells from the animals exhibit deregulated phospholipid  and an aberrant induction of proliferation regulating  associating with increased aneuploidy in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Together, these results support the concept that aneuploidy-inducing gene deficiencies contribute to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis involving the deregulation of various molecular processes such as lipid , proliferation, and cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637215>mTOR/HDAC1 Crosstalk Mediated Suppression of ADH1A and ALDH2 Links Alcohol  to Hepatocellular Carcinoma Onset and Progression .</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ranked the third deadliest cancer worldwide whose molecular pathogenesis is not fully understood. Although deregulated metabolic pathways have been implicated in HCC onset and progression, the mechanisms triggering this metabolic imbalance are yet to be explored. Here, we identified a gene signature coding catabolic enzymes (Cat-GS) involved in key metabolic pathways like amino acid, , carbohydrate, drug, and retinol  as suppressed in HCC. A higher expression of deregulated Cat-GS is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. On the other hand, we identified mTOR signaling as a key determinant in HCC onset and progression, whose hyperactivation is found associated with poor survival and aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Next, out of Cat-GS, we established two key regulators of alcohol , alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (ADH1A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), as being transcriptionally suppressed by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the downstream of mTORC1 signaling. Suppressed ADH1A and ALDH2 expression aligns well with HCC-specific molecular profile and can efficiently predict disease onset and progression, whereas higher ADH1A and ALDH2 expression is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Overall, our  findings suggest that transcriptional suppression of alcohol  regulators, ADH1A and ALDH2, at the downstream of mTOR signaling is, in part, responsible for triggering oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes resulting in disease onset and progression in HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zahid, Yao, Khan, Raza and Gou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632351>Influence of Maternal Inulin-Type Prebiotic Intervention on Glucose  and Gut Microbiota in the Offspring of C57BL Mice.</a></h2><p> Maternal obesity leads to glucose intolerance in the offspring. Changes in the gut microbiota are being increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. We hypothesized that inulin intervention during gestation and lactation improves glucose  disorders in mouse offspring from high- diet (HD)-fed dams.  Female C57BL mice were fed a control diet or HD for 4 weeks before mating. After mating, pregnant mice were randomly divided into three groups through gestation and lactation: control diet (CD) group, HD group, and HD treated with inulin (HD-inulin) group. At weaning, glucose metabolic status was assessed. Gut microbial DNA from offspring cecal contents was isolated and processed for metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and taxonomic and functional profiling were performed.  Offspring from dams in the HD-inulin groups demonstrated reduced fasting blood glucose, decreased blood glucose area under the curve during the oral glucose tolerance test, and reduced fasting serum insulin and HOMA-IR compared to offspring from dams in the HD group. Nineteen differentially abundant bacterial species were identified between the HD-inulin and HD groups. The HD-inulin group displayed significantly greater abundances of , and  species and lower abundances of , and  species. Differentially abundant bacterial species among the three groups were involved in 38 metabolic pathways, including several glucose and  pathways.  Our results show that early inulin intervention in HD-fed mouse dams moderates offspring glucose  and gut dysbiosis.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Xiao, Zheng, Li, Yu, Ping, Wang and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654064>Adipocyte dedifferentiation in health and diseases.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissues collectively as an endocrine organ and energy storage are crucial for systemic metabolic homeostasis. The major cell type in the adipose tissue, the adipocytes or  cells, are remarkably plastic and can increase or decrease their size and number to adapt to changes in systemic or local . Changes in adipocyte size occur through hypertrophy or atrophy, and changes in cell numbers mainly involve de novo generation of new cells or death of existing cells. Recently, dedifferentiation, whereby a mature adipocyte is reverted to an undifferentiated progenitor-like status, has been reported as a mechanism underlying adipocyte plasticity. Dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes has been observed under both physiological and pathological conditions. This review covers several aspects of adipocyte dedifferentiation, its relevance to adipose tissue function, molecular pathways that drive dedifferentiation, and the potential of therapeutic targeting adipocyte dedifferentiation in human health and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Author(s).

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular  contributes to malignant transformation and progression.  is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642410>Design and development of novel transdermal nanoemulgel for Alzheimer's disease: Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and biochemical investigations.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with depletion of acetylcholine.

NEGT4 contained 7 mg of drug in 10% w/w distilled water, 30% w/w surfactant (Labrafil M) and cosurfactant (Transcutol P) mixture in ratio 1:4 and 60 % Capryol 90 as oily phase thickened with 98.9 mg ethyl cellulose (20 cps). In vivo studies were carried out on male Wistar rats following standard guidelines. Scopolamine was used to induce amnesia in rats which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Various formulations were compared by performing pharmacokinetic, histopathological, behavioural and biochemical studies on rats. Stability studies on nanoemulsion gels were carried out in accordance with The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.Pharmacokinetic studies exhibited significantly greater extent of absorption from NEGT4 in comparison to capsule and hydrogel with a 2.18 & 5.26-fold increase respectively. Significant improvement in neurobehavioral parameters was observed with NEGT4 in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Biochemical assessment showed superior anti-amnesic activity of NEGT4 through augmentation of antioxidant enzymes, decreased  peroxidation & acetylcholinesterase activity. Low value of serum aminotransferase in rats treated with NEGT4 indicated absence of hepatotoxicity. NEGT4 was found to be non-irritant and possessed a shelf life of 4.11 years.Developed nanoemulsion gel of tacrine hydrochloride was found to be safe, stable, and efficacious and has immense potential to be used in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654514>Impact of Lopinavir/ritonavir-and Efavirenz-based Antiretroviral Therapy on the  Profile of Chinese HIV/AIDS Treatment-naïve Patients in Beijing: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with  abnormalities that contribute to increasing risk of cardiovascular (CV) events among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Several alterations in energy , like glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways.

Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved  and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high  oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle mitochondria, we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of mitochondria and complexes expression and (2) a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659151>Preparation of a new type 2 diabetic miniature pig model via the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</a></h2><p>Diabetes has become one of the major noninfectious diseases that seriously endanger public health.

We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and  to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of 5-oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

However, there is limited understanding of how increased concentration of CO associated with ocean acidification will impact host-parasite relationships. We investigated the effects of increased CO on growth and metabolic rates in the planktonic stages, rearing  from eggs to 12 days post hatch copepodids under three treatment levels: Control (416 µatm), Mid (747 µatm), and High (942 µatm). The CO treatment had a significant effect on oxygen consumption rate with the High treatment animals exhibiting the greatest respiration. The treatments did not have a significant effect on the other biological endpoints measured (carbon, nitrogen,  volume, and fatty acid content). The results indicate that  have mechanisms to compensate for increased concentration of COand that populations will be tolerant of projected future ocean acidification scenarios. The work reported here also describes catabolism during the lecithotrophic development of  information that is not currently available to parameterize models of dispersal and viability of the planktonic free-living stages.©2019 Thompson et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647596>Pharmacological biotargets and the molecular mechanisms of oxyresveratrol treating colorectal cancer: Network and experimental analyses.</a></h2><p>This article was designed by using a network pharmacological approach to reveal the therapeutic targets and molecular mechanisms of oxyresveratrol (Oxyres) treating colorectal cancer (CRC). Furthermore, several bioinformatic findings would be validated. Pathogenetic targets of CRC and pharmacological targets of Oxyres were identified by web-available databases. All identifiable biotargets were collected for functional enrichment analyses to reveal the biological processes and signaling pathways of Oxyres treating CRC. In addition, human CRC, non-CRC samples, and cell line study were used to validate the predictive biotargets of Oxyres treating CRC. In network pharmacological analyses, top therapeutic targets of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1), hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS), GTPase HRas (HRAS), and cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) in Oxyres treating CRC were identified, respectively. As shown in functional analysis, biological processes of Oxyres treating CRC were mainly involved in modulating cell communication, signal transduction, apoptosis, cell motility, cell proliferation, and . Furthermore, top 10 signaling pathways of Oxyres treating CRC were identified, respectively. In human study, CRC samples resulted in increased neoplastic expressions of Ki-67, MAPK1, IGF1, characterized with clinical imaging inspection, pathological diagnosis, and altered blood lipids in these CRC cases. In cell culture study, Oxyres-dosed CRC cells exhibited reduced cell proliferation, promoted cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, significantly decreased proteins of intracellular Ki-67, MAPK1, and IGF1 were observed in Oxyres-dosed cells when compared to those in controls. Collectively, anti-CRC pharmacological activity of Oxyres may be mainly associated with induction of apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation as revealed in bioinformatic findings. In addition, all core biotargets and molecular mechanisms of Oxyres treating CRC are unveiled respectively. Interestingly, the identifiable MAPK1, IGF1 biotargets may be potential molecules for treating and screening CRC.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654717>Identification of Nogo-B as a new molecular target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing chronic liver disease worldwide which can lead to liver cirrhosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays an important role in lipogenesis. Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the liver of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a liver specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high- diet (HFD) induced fatty liver associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo-B levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced fatty liver and Nogo-B expression. In summary, our study identifies Nogo-B as a new molecular target of PPARγ, and suggests increased Nogo-B might be a potential indicator for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019.

We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino-acid defined (CDAA) diets with increasing  content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (2-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of  content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary  in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the  genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60%  (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High  supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks. This model will aid the testing of interventions and drugs for severe NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656670>Discovery of potential plasma protein biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction via proteomics.</a></h2><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an acute disease with high mortality and seriously threatens human health. The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins,  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of - and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal  alters circulating  metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced obesity mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine  accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of adipogenesis by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and total  mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

Protein kinase A (PKA) is known to be involved in hepatic . However, the role of PKA in NAFLD has not been well tested in vivo due to the lack of optimal PKA deficient mouse model.A novel PKA-specific inhibitor gene was conditionally overexpressed in mouse (PKAi mouse) liver using LoxP/Cre system. PKA activity in the liver extract was measured with a commercial assay kit. The PKAi and control mice of 8-week age, were subjected to HFD or chow diet (CD) for 2 months. Body weight, liver index, and triglyceride in the liver were measured. RNA sequencing was performed for the liver tissues and analyzed with Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment.PKAi-GFP protein was overexpressed in the liver and the PKA activation was significantly inhibited in the liver of PKAi mouse.

However, when fed with HFD for 2 months, the liver was enlarged more, and the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver was more severe in PKAi mice. When comparing the transcriptomes of CD-fed and HFD-fed control mice, GO enrichment showed that the genes down-regulated by HFD were mainly enriched in immune-related GO terms, and up-regulated genes were enriched in . When comparing the transcriptomes of CD-fed and HFD-fed PKAi mice, GO analysis showed that the down-regulated genes were enriched in , while the up-regulated genes were clustered in ER stress-related pathways. When comparing HFD-fed PKAi and HFD-fed control mice, the genes with lower expression level in PKAi mice were enriched in the lipoprotein synthesis, which might explain that more TG is accumulated in PKAi liver after HFD feeding.Reduced PKA activity could be a factor promoting the TG accumulation in the liver and the development of NAFLD.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646300>Association of  peroxidation and interleukin-6 with carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Enhanced  peroxidation and elevated interleukin-6 levels are common in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering glycolysis and  metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on glycolysis and  pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty acid biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited  raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and  and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657437>How is the acyl chain composition of phosphoinositides created and does it matter?</a></h2><p>The phosphoinositide (PIPn) family of signalling phospholipids are central regulators in membrane cell biology. Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the metabolic pathways that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving  is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar  mixtures, and milk  globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic  concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body  percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and  droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated  droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and  in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632279>Synergistic Combination of Polymyxin B and Enrofloxacin Induced Metabolic Perturbations in Extensive Drug-Resistant .</a></h2><p>Polymyxins are used as a last-resort class of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative . As polymyxin monotherapy is associated with potential development of resistance, combination therapy is highly recommended. This study investigated the mechanism underlying the synergistic killing of polymyxin B and enrofloxacin against extensive drug-resistant (XDR) . An XDR isolate  12196 was treated with clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin B (2 mg/L) and enrofloxacin (1 mg/L) alone or in combination. Metabolome profiles were investigated from bacterial samples collected at 1-and 4-h posttreatment using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Significantly perturbed metabolites ( < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2) were subjected to pathway analysis. The synergistic killing by polymyxin B-enrofloxacin combination was initially driven by polymyxin B as indicated by the perturbation of  metabolites at 1 h in particular. The killing was subsequently driven by enrofloxacin  the inhibition of DNA replication, resulting in the accumulation of nucleotides at 4 h. Furthermore, the combination uniquely altered levels of metabolites in energy  and cell envelope biogenesis. Most importantly, the combination significantly minimized polymyxin resistance  the inhibition of  A modification pathway, which was most evident at 4 h. This is the first study to elucidate the synergistic mechanism of polymyxin B-enrofloxacin combination against XDR .

Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of , especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms.

Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630081>Role of microRNA-122 in hepatic  of the weanling female rat offspring exposed to prenatal and postnatal caloric restriction.</a></h2><p>We examined the role of hepatocyte micro-RNA-122 and hypothalamic neuropeptides, in weanling (21d) female rats exposed to calorie restriction induced growth restriction either prenatally (IUGR), postnatally (PNGR) or both (IPGR) vs. ad lib fed controls (CON). IUGR were hyperinsulinemic, hyperleptinemic and dyslipidemic with high circulating miR-122. In contrast, PNGR and IPGR displayed insufficient glucose, insulin and leptin amidst high ketones with a dichotomy in circulating miR-122 of PNGR<IPGR = CON. Examination of livers revealed a reduction in miR-122 expression in PNGR and IPGR reflecting the hepatic size. This reduction of hepatic miR-122 was associated with an increase in specific target transcripts (ALDO-A, BCKDK, PPAR-β) and those mediating fatty acid oxidation (PGC-1α, CPT-1α), with a concomitant suppression of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesizing transcripts (FAS, HMGCR). Functionally, these changes correlated with increased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial CPT1α enzyme activity ex vivo. In vitro physiologic (serum starvation) and genetic manipulation of miR-122 in H4IIE hepatoma cells revealed fidelity in regulating ALDO-A/BCKDK, but an infidelity in perturbing fatty acid/cholesterol synthesizing and oxidizing gene transcripts. Nevertheless, changes in endogenous miR-122 maintained singular directionality while altering FAS/HMGCR and CPT-1α/PGC-1α, almost reflecting each other, and thereby maintaining a balance in fatty acid/cholesterol supply necessary to meet the in vitro demands of these rapidly proliferating transformed cells. Successive microarray based analysis, comparing IPGR to CON demonstrated differential expression of hypothalamic genes mediating cell proliferation and survival, appetite/energy balance, circadian rhythm and obesity/diabetes. We conclude that miR-122 regulates genes mediating fatty acid/cholesterol  in postnatal female rats, fueling the energy demand.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660891>Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of tissue, serum, and serum exosomes from hepatocellular carcinoma patients.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a promising prognostic and diagnostic tool in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we performed small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) of tissue, serum and serum exosomes to investigate changes in miRNA expression between the different sample types and correlated the expression with clinical parameters. We also performed gene expression arrays on tumor and normal tissue.Paired tissue, serum and serum exosomes sequencing revealed consistent positive correlation of miR-21 between serum exosomes and tumor tissue, indicating that miR-21 could be exported from tissue to circulation via exosomes. We found that let-7 miRNAs are generally upregulated in serum exosomes compared to whole serum, indicating that these miRNAs could be preferentially loaded into exosomes. Comparing serum from HCC patients with serum from healthy individuals revealed a global increase of miRNAs in serum from HCC patients, including an almost 4-fold increase of several miRNAs, including the liver-specific miR-122. When correlating miRNA expression with clinical parameters we detected significant association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and miR-122 in serum as well as several serum and tissue-miRNAs that correlated with surgery type. We found that miR-141 and miR-146 correlated with cirrhosis in tumor tissue and normal tissue, respectively. Finally, high expression of miR-21 in tumors were associated with poor survival. Focusing on gene expression we found several significant messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between tumor and normal tissue and a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these changes were mainly related to cell cycle and . Further, we detected mRNAs that correlated with cirrhosis and HBV infection in tissue. Finally, GO analysis of predicted targets for miRNAs down-regulated in tumor found that these were enriched for functions related to collagen synthesis.Our combined data point to altered miRNA and mRNA expression contributing to both generally impaired lipid  and increased cell proliferation and a miRNA-driven increase in collagen synthesis in HCC. Our results further indicate a correlation in miRNA expression between exosomes, serum, and tissue samples suggesting export from tumors via exosomes. This correlation could provide a basis for a more tumor-specific miRNA profile in serum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632669>Histology and molecular biology studies on the expression and localization of angiopoietin-like protein 8 in human tissues.</a></h2><p>Angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) 8 regulates the partitioning of triglycerides by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase in muscle and adipose tissues. ANGPTL8 is expressed in the liver and adipose tissue and secreted into the blood. However, the precise localization of ANGPTL8-expressing cells in these tissues remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the localization of ANGPTL8-expressing cells in human tissues. Using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue specimens, the expression of ANGPTL8 was investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and  hybridization (ISH). The expression level of ANGPTL8 mRNA was the highest in the liver, followed by lipoma, hibernoma and normal adipose tissue. In the liver, wild type (KF809856) and two splice variants of ANGPTL8 mRNA (KF809857 and KF809858) were found to be expressed. The expression level of the splice variant KF809858, which produces a short form of ANGPTL8, accounted for <1% of ANGPTL8 in the liver. IHC revealed that ANGPTL8 was expressed in hepatocytes in zone 1 of the hepatic acinus in the liver. In the adipose tissue, mature adipocytes weakly expressed ANGPTL8, while immature adipocytes strongly expressed it. ISH confirmed ANGPTL8 mRNA expression in portal hepatocytes and immature adipocytes. ANGPTL8 was expressed in the cells, which actively uptake and metabolize triglycerides. In hibernoma, the ANGPTL8 protein and mRNA were homogeneously expressed in tumor cells. The expression of ANGPTL8 was associated with the differentiation state and activity of  in a subpopulation of cells in the liver and adipose tissue.

This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous acetate buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and 5 fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose. In addition, marginal decreases of T in all tissues and considerable increases in DHEA in male iWAT and eWAT in response to high- diet further strengthen the inference regarding role of steroid  in adipogenesis.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

However, to date, little is known about these unique pancreatic tumor‑surrounding adipocytes, or their response to cancer cells. The present study utilized an in vitro indirect coculture model in which the phenotypic changes of adipocytes following exposure to PC cells were directly observed. RNA‑sequencing was performed on 3T3‑L1 adipocytes cultured with or without Panc‑1 cancer cells, and significant changes were identified at the transcriptional level. In terms of delipidation and the impaired function of glucose and , coculture with tumor cells resulted in an altered metabolic phenotype in mature adipocytes. In co‑cultured adipocytes, the appearance of fibroblast‑like cells was observed, and the mesenchymal cell differentiation pathway was enriched following the integrated analysis into the transcriptome. In addition, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analyses of co‑cultured adipocytes revealed a loss in gene expression of mature adipocyte markers, and a gain in gene expression of fibroblast‑specific markers. It was also confirmed that newly generated cancer‑associated adipocytes could facilitate the invasive capacities of the tumor, and may contribute to PC stromal remodeling. The present study supports a novel concept that reprogramming of stromal adipocytes orchestrated by PC cells may generate cancer‑associated adipocytes with activated phenotypes, which may ultimately drive pancreatic tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile acid pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile acid pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic acid and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of  and glucose . Bile acid levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile acid levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic acid) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile acid and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile acid synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile acids can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic acid is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile acid synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) acid for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic acid is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Severely compromised LPL activity causes familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which is associated with very high plasma triglyceride levels and increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. Currently, no approved pharmacological intervention can acutely lower plasma triglycerides in FCS. Low yield, high aggregation, and poor stability of recombinant LPL have thus far prevented development of enzyme replacement therapy. Recently, we showed that LPL monomers form 1:1 complexes with the LPL transporter glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and solved the structure of the complex. In the present work, we further characterized the monomeric LPL/GPIHBP1 complex, and its derivative, the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein, with the goal of contributing to the development of an LPL enzyme replacement therapy. Fusion of LPL to GPIHBP1 increased yields of recombinant LPL, prevented LPL aggregation, stabilized LPL against spontaneous inactivation, and made it resistant to inactivation by the LPL antagonists angiopoietin-like protein 3(ANGPTL3) or ANGPTL4. The high stability of the fusion protein enabled us to identify LPL amino acids that interact with ANGPTL4. Additionally, the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein exibited high enzyme activity in in vitro assays. Importantly, both intravenous and subcutaneous administrations of the fusion protein lowered triglycerides in several mouse strains without causing adverse effects. These results indicate that the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein has potential for use as a therapeutic for managing FCS.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633401>The prospects of lipidic prodrugs: an old approach with an emerging future.</a></h2><p>Nowadays, prodrugs are no longer used as a last resort, rather, they are intentionally designed at the early stages of drug development.

Glycemic variation parameters were calculated, and dietary components, including percentages of carbohydrate, protein and fat in the total dietary intake, were analyzed by a dietitian. The interaction between parameters of glycemic variability and dietary components was analyzed.Sixty-one patients with T1DM (33 females, 28 males) were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years, and the average duration of diabetes was 14 years. Glycated hemoglobin before CGM was 8.54%. Participants with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake had a longer DM duration and a higher protein and fat intake than did those with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for ≥ 50% of total caloric intake, but there was no between-group difference in total caloric intake per day. The group with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake also had lower nocturnal continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA) 1, - 2 and - 4 values. The percentage of protein intake had a slightly negative correlation with mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) (r = - 0.286, p < 0.05) and a moderately negative correlation with coefficient of variation (CV) (r = 0.289, p < 0.05). One additional percentage of protein calories of total calories per day decreased the MAGE to 4.25 mg/dL and CV to 0.012 (p < 0.05). The optimal dietary protein percentage for MAGE < 140 mg/dL was 15.13%. The performance of predictive models revealed the beneficial effect of adequate carbohydrate intake on glucose variation when combined with protein consumption.Adequate carbohydrate consumption-but not more than half the daily total calories-combined with protein calories that amount to approximately 15% of the daily caloric intake is important for glucose stability and beneficial for patients with T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630861>Exploring the multilevel hazards of thiamethoxam using Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h2><p>Thiamethoxam (THIA) is a widely used pesticide.

Herein, the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of THIA (3.13 μg/mL for adults, 20.25 μg/mL for third-instar larvae) were identified. THIA (1/3 LC50) prolonged the time required for growth and development, and decreased the fecundity, the rates of pupation and eclosion, and lifespan of Drosophila. The uniform architecture of the compound eyes was disturbed. It also triggered DNA damage, and reduced the viability of  body cells and hemocytes. Moreover, RNA-sequencing showed that differentially expressed genes in response to THIA were mainly related to stratum corneum development, immune function.

In recent years, tree peony has been emerging as an oil crop. Therefore, combined analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tree peony () seeds at 25, 32, 39, 53, 67, 81, 88, 95, and 109 days after pollination (DAP) was conducted to better understand the transcriptional and translational regulation of seed development and oil biosynthesis. A total of 38,482 unigenes and 2841 proteins were identified. A total of 26,912 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 592 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were clustered into three groups corresponding to the rapid growth, seed inclusion enrichment and conversion, and late dehydration and mature stages of seed development. Fifteen  pathways were identified at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that a period of rapid fatty acid biosynthesis occurred at 53-88 DAP. Furthermore, 211 genes and 35 proteins associated with the fatty acid  pathway, 63 genes and 11 proteins associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and 115 genes and 24 proteins associated with ALA  were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 16 putative fatty acid desaturase (FAD)-encoding genes clustered into four  groups, eight of which exhibited the highest expression at 53 DAP, suggesting that they play an important role in ALA accumulation. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the temporal expression patterns of oil biosynthesis genes were largely similar to the RNA-seq results. The expression patterns of fatty acid - and seed development-related proteins determined by MRM were also highly consistent with the results obtained in the proteomic analysis. Correlation analysis indicated significant differences in the number and abundance of DEGs and DEPs but a high level of consistency in expression patterns and metabolic pathways. The results of the present study represent the first combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of tree peony seeds and provide insight into tree peony seed development and oil accumulation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664798>Hepatocellular Carcinoma [Internet].</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, has become a major global health problem.

We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with metabolic syndrome were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC. In the WGC and RC groups combined, adiponectin concentrations significantly increased after 12-week intervention, and are directly associated with plasma SCFAs and acetate.

Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the  of 5-10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate . To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on  membranes. Free energy calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. It is hoped that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630531>Differential expression of genes implicated in liver  in broiler chickens differing in weight.</a></h2><p> parameters and expression of  and  genes involved in  were investigated in two groups of high (HW) and low (LW) weight broilers from the same strain.

The relative expression of  and  genes was significantly lower in the liver tissues of HW broilers than in the LW group. The mRNA levels of these three genes showed a significant negative correlation with abdominal  deposition and live weight of broilers. However, relative expression of  and  hepatic genes did not differ among broilers. It was concluded that, of eight hepatic genes implicated in , only the expression of three ( and ) were significant for  and leanness within the same strain of chicken.

To address this, 79  mediators were measured in bovine CL, using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CL from estrous cycle days 4, 11, and 18 were compared and, separately, CL from days 18 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy were compared. Twenty-three lipids increased as the estrous cycle progressed ( < 0.05), with nine increasing between days 4 and 11 and fourteen increasing between days 4 and 18. Overall, this indicated a general upregulation of  mediator synthesis as the estrous cycle progressed, including increases in oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Only 15-KETE was less abundant in the CL of early pregnancy ( < 0.05), with a tendency ( < 0.10) for four others to be less abundant. Notably, 15-KETE also increased between estrous cycle days 4 and 18. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) indicated that functions associated with differentially abundant lipids during the estrous cycle included leukocyte activation, cell migration, and cell proliferation. To investigate changes in CL during maternal recognition of pregnancy, this  dataset was integrated with a published dataset from mRNA profiling during maternal recognition of pregnancy. This analysis indicated that lipids and mRNA that changed during maternal recognition of pregnancy may regulate some of the same functions, including immune cell chemotaxis and cell-cell communication. To assess effects of these  mediators, luteal cells were cultured with 5-KETE or 15-KETE. One ng/mL 5-KETE reduced luteal progesterone on day 1 of culture, only in the absence of luteinizing hormone (LH), while 1 ng/mL 15-KETE induced progesterone only in the presence of LH (10 ng/mL). On day 7 of culture, 0.1 ng/mL 15-KETE reduced prostaglandin (PG)F2A-induced inhibition of LH-stimulated progesterone production, while 1 ng/mL 15-KETE did not have this effect. Overall, these data suggest a role for  mediators during luteal development and early pregnancy, as regulators of steroidogenesis, immune cell activation and function, intracellular signaling, and cell survival and death.Copyright © 2019 Hughes, Bosviel, Newman and Pate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629092>Multi-dimensional Roles of Ketone Bodies in Cancer Biology: Opportunities for Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Ketone bodies are traditionally viewed as metabolic substrates in carbohydrate restriction and are applied in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, people have paid more attention to its application in the treatment for cancers. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells maintain a higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation and they highly rely on glucose for glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to against the oxidative stress. Based on tumor , ketogenic diets (low-carbohydrate, high-, and moderate protein) or ketone supplementation, as non-toxic therapeutic approaches, showed a positive therapeutic advantage in a broad range of malignancies. This review summarizes the multi-dimensional roles of ketone bodies in cancer biology and discusses the potential underlying mechanism in the inhibition of tumor growth.Copyright © 2019.

All these noxae cause changes in the  of functional cells in the liver. In this literature review we focus on the changes at the miRNA level, the formation and impact of reactive oxygen species and the crosstalk between those factors. Both, miRNAs and oxidative stress are involved in the multifactorial development and progression of acute and chronic liver diseases, as well as in viral hepatitis and carcinogenesis, by influencing numerous signaling and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, expression patterns of miRNAs and antioxidants can be used for biomonitoring the course of disease and show potential to serve as possible therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650009>Plasmalogen deficiency and neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease: Causation or coincidence?</a></h2><p>Causation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well understood.

This study aims to establish metabolic factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with obesity-related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum  levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high- diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk  and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid, and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty acid (palmitic acid, PA) to gauge its effects on cell  and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660733>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry enables rapid characterisation of enzyme kinetics and inhibition for the human soluble Epoxide Hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is conventionally used to acquire thermodynamic data for biological interactions. In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors.

However, the production of CFAs is generally difficult. Several challenges are the low CFAs content in natural sources, the difficulty to chemically synthesize target CFA isomers in high purity, and the sensitive characteristics of CFAs. In this article, the current technologies to produce CFAs, including physical, chemical, and biotechnical approaches were summarized, with a focus on the conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated linolenic acids (CLNAs) which are the most common investigated CFAs. CFAs usually demonstrate stronger physiological effects than other non-conjugated fatty acids; however, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation. Consequently, the quality control throughout the entire production process of CFAs is significant. Special attention was given to the micro- or nano-encapsulation which presented as an emerging technique to improve the bioavailability and storage stability of CFAs. The current applications of CFAs and the potential research directions were also discussed.Copyright © 2018.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D status on  profile in premenopausal women.A total of 315 nonsmoking premenopausal female volunteers without diabetes mellitus were included in the study. Patients were divided into four subgroups. The groups were as follows: patients with less than or equal to 12 ng/ml (group 1, =126) vitamin D levels, between 20 and 12 ng/ml (group 2, =48), between 30 and 20 ng/ml (group 3, =21), and at least 30 ng/ml (group 4, =120) vitamin D levels. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and log parathormone levels were made, no correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and  (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG) levels (=0.91, 0.06, 0.95, 0.79, respectively).There may be an association between vitamin D insufficiency and dyslipidemia.

One of the effects of androgen deficiency is the disturbance in the homeostasis of . Till date, there are no effective compounds developed to treat androgen deficiency without having any side effects. Nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a promising solution for various clinical indications. In this study, we investigated the effect of ostarine (enobosarm), a nonsteroidal SARM, on the rat adipocyte  using in vitro techniques. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of ostarine. Control incubation with testosterone as the natural ligand for AR was performed.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose . Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing browning of  cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the  of glucose and insulin.

The earliest stage of NAFLD is simple steatosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. Inhibition of steatosis is a potential treatment for NAFLD. Patchouli alcohol (PA) is an active component of  (Blanco) Benth. (Labiatae), which is a medicinal food in Asia countries and proved to possess hepatoprotective effect. This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PA against high  diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis in rats. In this study, male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a HFD for 4 weeks to induce NAFLD. Oral administration with PA significantly reduced pathological severity of steatosis in HFD-fed rats. It was associated with suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and regulating very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) . Our data showed that PA treatment effectively attenuated ER stress by inhibiting the activation of protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Moreover, PA decreased hepatic VLDL uptake by suppressing very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) expression. It also restored VLDL synthesis and export by increasing apolipoprotein B100 (apoB 100) secretion and microsomal triglyceride-transfer protein (MTP) activity. Taken together, PA exerted a protective effect on the treatment of NAFLD in HFD-fed rats and may be potential therapeutic agent acting on hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Xu, Li, Huang, Wu, Gan, Chen, Luo, Li, Huang, Su and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662443>CXCL12 promotes atherosclerosis by downregulating ABCA1 expression via the CXCR4/GSK3β/β-catenin/TCF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) is a member of CXC chemokine family and mainly acts on cell chemotaxis. CXCL12 also elicits a pro-atherogenic role, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined yet. We aimed to reveal if and how CXCL12 promoted atherosclerosis via regulating . In vitro, our data showed that CXCL12 reduced ABCA1 expression and it-mediated cholesterol efflux from THP-1-derived macrophages to apoA-I. Data from the Luciferase reporter gene and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TCF21 stimulated transcription of ABCA1 via binding to its promoter region, which was repressed by CXCL12. We found that CXCL12 increased the levels of phosphorylated GSK3β and phosphorylation of β-catenin at the position Thr120. Inactivation of GSK3β or β-catenin increased expression of TCF21 and ABCA1. Further, knockdown or inhibition of CXCR4 (CXC chemokine receptor 4) blocked the effects of CXCL12 on TCF21 and ABCA1 expression and phosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin. In vivo, overexpression of CXCL12 in Apoe-/- mice via lentivirus enlarged atherosclerotic lesion area and increased macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques. We further found that overexpression of CXCL12 reduced the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport and plasma HDL-C levels, decreased ABCA1 expression in aorta and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs), and suppressed cholesterol efflux from MPMs to apoA-I in Apoe-/- mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that CXCL12 interacts with CXCR4 and then activates the GSK-3β/β-cateninT120/TCF21 signaling pathway to inhibit ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages and aggravate atherosclerosis. Targeting CXCL12 may be a novel and promising strategy for the prevention  of atherosclerosis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653107>Impact of Fenugreek on Milk Production in Rodent Models of Lactation Challenge.</a></h2><p>Fenugreek, a herbal remedy, has long been used as galactologue to help mothers likely to stop breastfeeding because of perceived insufficient milk production. However, few studies highlight the efficacy of fenugreek in enhancing milk production. The aims of our study were to determine whether fenugreek increased milk yield in rodent models of lactation challenge and if so, to verify the lack of adverse effects on dam and offspring . Two lactation challenges were tested: increased litter size to 12 pups in dams fed a 20% protein diet and perinatal restriction to an 8% protein diet with eight pups' litter, with or without 1 g.kg.day dietary supplementation of fenugreek, compared to control dams fed 20% protein diet with eight pups' litters. Milk flow was measured by the deuterium oxide enrichment method, and milk composition was assessed.  and glucose  parameters were assessed in dam and offspring plasmas. Fenugreek increased milk production by 16% in the litter size increase challenge, resulting in an 11% increase in pup growth without deleterious effect on dam-litter .

In atorvastatin (ator)-treated high- diet-fed mice, we found reduced pancreatic β-cell size and β-cell mass, fewer mature insulin granules and reduced insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. Transcriptome profiling of primary pancreatic islets showed that ator inhibited the expression of pancreatic transcription factor (TF), mTOR signaling and small G protein (sGP) genes. Supplementation of the mevalonate pathway intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is produced by 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, significantly restored the attenuated mTOR activity, v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (MafA) expression and β-cell function after ator, lovastatin, rosuvastatin and fluvastatin treatment; this effect was potentially mediated by sGP prenylation. Rab5a, the sGP in pancreatic islets most affected by ator treatment, was found to positively regulate mTOR signaling and β-cell function. Rab5a knockdown mimicked the effect of ator treatment on β-cells. Thus, ator impairs β-cell function by regulating sGPs, for example, Rab5a, which subsequently attenuates islet mTOR signaling and reduces functional β-cell mass.

We hypothesize that the utilization of metabolomic techniques will allow for an improved understanding of the biochemical basis for the pharmacological activity of MTX, and can promote the identification and evaluation of novel molecular biomarkers of MTX response. In this work, erythroblastoid cells were exposed to MTX at the physiologic concentration of 1,000 nM and analyzed using three metabolomic platforms to give a broad spectrum of cellular metabolites. MTX pharmacological activity, defined as cellular growth inhibition, was associated with an altered cellular metabolomic profile based on the analysis of 724 identified metabolites. By discriminant analysis, MTX treatment was associated with increases in ketoisovaleric acid, fructose, galactose, and 2-deoxycytidine, and corresponding reductions in 2-deoxyuridine, phosphatidylinositol 32:0, orotic acid, and inosine monophosphate. Inclusion of data from analysis of folate  in combination with chemometric and metabolic network analysis demonstrated that MTX treatment is associated with dysregulated folate  and nucleotide biosynthesis, which is in line with its known mechanism of action. However, MTX treatment was also associated with alterations in a diversity of metabolites, including intermediates of amino acid, carbohydrate, and . Collectively, these findings support a robust metabolic response following exposure to physiologic concentrations of MTX. They also identify various metabolic intermediates that are associated with the pharmacological activity of MTX, and are, therefore, potential molecular biomarker candidates in future preclinical and clinical studies of MTX efficacy in autoimmune arthritis.© 2019 The Authors.

Three islet autoantibodies including GADA, IAA and ICA were measured, and clinical characteristics involved in those individuals were evaluated.The positive rate of islet autoantibodies was 28.5% in total. Compared with GADA negative group, positive counterparts significantly tended to have lower levels of BMI, WHR, and mALB. Adjusted for confounding factors, WHR, Triglycerides (TG), mALB seemed to be negative independent predictors of GADA. Patients with positive IAA tended to receive insulin treatment (P<0.0001).

While after AST was adjusted by unconditional logistic regression analysis, history of insulin treatment, FBG, HDL-CH, and GGT were confirmed as positive predictors of IAA. Furthermore, in patients with IAA positive, those treated with exogenous insulin tended to have longer duration of diabetes than non-insulin treatment counterparts. With regard to ICA, however, there were no significant differences between the two subgroups, except that serum level of AST/ALT seemed to be slightly different (P=0.064).These data suggested thatT2DM community patients with positive GADA tended to be lean and were able to maintain normal , while patients with positivity of IAA were frequently accompanied with insulin treatment and more closely associated with diabetic liver damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635081>Determination of the Pathological Features of NPC1 Variants in a Cellular Complementation Test.</a></h2><p>Niemann-Pick Type C (NP-C) is a rare disorder of  caused by mutations within the  and  genes.

The known variant p.Ile1061Thr showed a significantly impaired cholesterol clearance after 12 and 24 h compared to the wild type. Among the investigated variants, p.Ser954Leu and p.Glu1273Lys showed decelerated cholesterol clearance as well. The remaining variants p.Gln60His, p.Val494Met, and p.Ile787Val showed a cholesterol clearance indistinguishable from wild type. Further, p.Ile1061Thr acquired an enhanced clearance ability upon 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment.

The presence of MS was defined according to the NCEP-ATP III criteria. The effects of BMI, WHtR and the CLAP for predicting MS were compared using logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The prevalence of MS was 5.1% (6.6% and 3.5% among boys and girls, respectively). Overall obesity (based on BMI), abdominal obesity (based on WHtR) and CLAP≥P75 were significantly associated with an increased risk of MS (ORs (95% CIs) were 143.79 (18.78-1101.22), 86.83 (27.19-277.27), 150.75 (20.11-1130.19), respectively). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the CLAP was higher than that for BMI and WHtR for predicting MS, with AUC (95% CI) values of 0.944 (0.913-0.975), 0.895 (0.864-0.927), and 0.928 (0.903-0.953), respectively.The children's  accumulation product (CLAP) was an effective indicator associated with MS in Chinese children and adolescents and was better than BMI and WHtR for predicting MS.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654053>ABCG5/G8: a structural view to pathophysiology of the hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion.</a></h2><p>The ABCG5/G8 heterodimer is the primary neutral sterol transporter in hepatobiliary and transintestinal cholesterol excretion. Inactivating mutations on either the ABCG5 or ABCG8 subunit cause Sitosterolemia, a rare genetic disorder. In 2016, a crystal structure of human ABCG5/G8 in an apo state showed the first structural information on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) sterol transporters and revealed several structural features that were observed for the first time. Over the past decade, several missense variants of ABCG5/G8 have been associated with non-Sitosterolemia  phenotypes. In this review, we summarize recent pathophysiological and structural findings of ABCG5/G8, interpret the structure-function relationship in disease-causing variants and describe the available evidence that allows us to build a mechanistic view of ABCG5/G8-mediated sterol transport.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with  syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose , hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating  syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634748>Use of magnetic fields and nitrate concentration to optimize the growth and  yield of Nannochloropsis oculata.</a></h2><p>Microalgae produce increased  content accompanied by a significant decrease in cell density with decreasing nitrate concentration. Magnetic fields (MF) have been reported as a factor that could accelerate  and growth in microalgae culture. Thus, this study aimed to optimize the influence of MF and nitrate concentration (sodium nitrate, N) on the growth and  productivity of Nannochloropsis oculata. A single-factor experiment integrated with response surface methodology (RSM) via central composite design (CCD) was performed. The results showed that the maximum specific growth rate (0.24 d) and maximum  productivity (38 mg L d) obtained in this study were higher than those of the control culture (by 166% and 103%, respectively). This study also found that the two-way interaction term MF × N had a significant effect on cell growth but not on  production. It was concluded that to design appropriate MF for enhanced  productivity due to cell growth, further research must focus on developing an understanding of the relationship between the bioeffects of the magnetic field and the proteomic changes involved in  accumulation strategies. This approach would enable the design of conditions to obtain inexpensive high-value products from N. oculata.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The surrounding membrane of the inclusion contributes to the host- interface and specific pathogen-derived Inc proteins shape this interface allowing interactions with distinct cellular proteins. In contrast to many other bacteria,  species acquire sphingomyelin from the host cell. In recent years a clearer picture of how  acquires this  emerged showing that the bacteria interact with vesicular and non-vesicular transport pathways that involve the recruitment of specific RAB proteins and the -transfer protein CERT. These interactions contribute to the development of a new sphingomyelin-producing compartment inside the host cell. Interestingly, recruitment of CERT is conserved among different  species including .

Marantodes pumilum (Blume) Kuntze (Primulaceae) is believed to have phytoestrogenic properties and is claimed to have beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), but the mechanism behind its phytoestrogenic effects on estrogen-deficient diabetic condition have not been fully examined.The present study investigated the effects of oral treatment with M. pumilum var. alata (MPA) extracts on the estrogen receptor, metabolic characteristics and insulin signaling pathway in pancreas and liver of ovariectomised nicotidamide streptozotocin-induced diabetes in female rats.Ovariectomised diabetic (OVXS) Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with either aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA (50 or 100 mg/kg) respectively for 28 days. Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, oral glucose and insulin tolerance test. Distribution and expression level of insulin, oxidative stress and inflammatory marker in the pancreatic islets and liver were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot, respectively.Oral treatment with aqueous leaf and ethanol (50%) stem-root extracts of MPA (100 mg/kg) significantly reversed the elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. The protein expression of insulin, glucose transporter (GLUT-2 and GLUT-4) increased in the pancreatic islets and liver. Furthermore, marked improvement in the tissue morphology following treatment with MPA was observed. Similarly, the western blots analysis denotes improved insulin signaling in the liver and decreased reactive oxygen species producing enzymes, inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules with MPA treatment.Taken together, this work demonstrate that 100 mg/kg of aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA improves β-cell function and insulin signaling in postmenopausal diabetes through attenuation of oxidative stress and partially mediated by oestrogen receptor stimulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic acid and CDCA into deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA  under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653116>The Positive Effects of  Heteropolysaccharide on NAFLD and Regulation of the Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem in many countries.

We have reported pronounced loss of S1P and SK2 activity early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and an inverse correlation between hippocampal S1P levels and age in females, leading us to speculate that loss of S1P is a sensitizing influence for AD. Paradoxically, SK2 was reported to mediate amyloid β (Aβ) formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP)  To determine if loss of S1P sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration, we investigated whether SK2 deficiency worsens pathology and memory in male J20 (PDGFB-APP) mice. SK2 deficiency greatly reduced Aβ content in J20 mice, associated with significant improvements in epileptiform activity and cross-frequency coupling measured by hippocampal electroencephalography. However, several key measures of APP-dependent neurodegeneration were enhanced on the SK2 null background, despite reduced Aβ burden. These included hippocampal volume loss, oligodendrocyte attrition and myelin loss, and impaired performance in Y-maze and social novelty memory tests. Inhibition of the endosomal cholesterol exporter NPC1 greatly reduced sphingosine phosphorylation in glial cells, linking loss of SK2 activity and S1P in AD to perturbed endosomal .

Each LD is enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids, distinct from bilayer membranes. During LD biogenesis and growth, this monolayer of lipids expands by acquiring phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through nonvesicular mechanisms. Here, in a mini-screen, we find that ORP5, an integral membrane protein of the ER, can localize to ER-LD contact sites upon oleate loading. ORP5 interacts with LDs through its ligand-binding domain, and ORP5 deficiency enhances neutral  synthesis and increases the size of LDs. Importantly, there is significantly more phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and less phosphatidylserine (PS) on LDs in ORP5-deficient cells than in normal cells. The increased presence of PI(4)P on LDs in ORP5-deficient cells requires phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2-α. Our results thus demonstrate the existence of PI(4)P on LDs and suggest that LD-associated PI(4)P may be primarily used by ORP5 to deliver PS to LDs.© 2019 Du et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654486>The association study of  gene polymorphisms with AMD identifies a protective role for APOE-E2 allele in the wet form in a Northern Spanish population.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the potential role of eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the most relevant  genes in Northern Spanish patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).A case-control study of 228 unrelated native Northern Spanish patients diagnosed with AMD (73 dry and 155 wet) and 95 healthy controls was performed.

These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic  droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis.

Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency.

We injected intraperitoneally recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) (2.0mg/ kg/day) for 28 days to high- diet (HFD) induced obesity mice. rhACE2 treatment decreased body weight and improved glucose . Furthermore, rhACE2 increased oxygen consumption and upregulated thermogenesis in HFD-fed mice. In the rhACE2 treatment group, BAT mass increased, accompanied with ameliorated insulin signaling and increased protein levels of UCP-1 and PRDM16. Importantly, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) mass decreased, concomitant with browning, which was established by the increase of UCP-1 expression. The browning is due to increased H3K27 acetylation via the downregulation of HDAC3 and increased H3K9 acetylation via upregulation of GCN5 and PCAF. These results suggest that rhACE2 exerts anti-obesity effects by stimulating BAT and inducing browning in sWAT. ACE2 and the Ang 1-7 axis represent a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the development of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663477>In vivo antiplasmodial activity of curcumin-loaded Nanostructured  Carriers.</a></h2><p>It was shown that curcumin (Cur) has anti-plasmodium activity, however, its weak bioavailability, rapid , and limited chemical stability has restricted its application in clinical usages. Nanostructured  carriers (NLCs) are a type of drug-delivery systems (DDSs) which their core matrix is composed of both solid and liquid lipids.The aim of the current study was to prepare and characterize curcumin-loaded nanostructured  carriers (Cur-NLC) for malaria treatment.For the production of NLC, coconut oil and cetyl palmitate were selected as a liquid and solid , respectively. In order to prepare the Cur-NLC, the microemulsion method was applied. General toxicity assay on Artemia salina and also hemocompatibility was investigated. Antimalarial activity was studied on mice infected with Plasmodium berghei.The NLCs mean particle size and polydispersity index (PI) was 145 nm and 0.3, respectively. Moreover, the zeta potential of the Cur-NLC was -25 mV, as well as, the NLCs showed pseudo-spherical shape which revealed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The loading capacity and encapsulation efficacy of the obtained Cur-NLC were 3.1 ± 0.015% and 74 ± 3.32%, respectively. In vitro, Cur release profiles showed a sustained-release pattern up to 5 days in synthesized Cur-NLC. The results of in vivo anti-plasmodial activity against P. berghei revealed that antimalarial activity of Cur-NLC was high 2-fold compared with bare Cur at the tested dosage level.The results of this study showed that NLC would be used as a potential nanocarrier for the treatment of malaria.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642491>Altered Expression of Adrenomedullin 2 and its Receptor in the Adipose Tissue of Obese Patients.</a></h2><p>Adrenomedullin 2 (AM2) plays protective roles in the renal and cardiovascular systems. Recently, studies on experimental animals showed that AM2 is an adipokine with beneficial effects on energy . However, there is little information regarding AM2 expression in human adipose tissue.To investigate the pattern and regulation of AM2 expression and that of its receptor component in human adipose tissue, in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes.We measured metabolic parameters, serum AM2 and expression of ADM2 and its receptor component genes in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese (with or without type 2 diabetes) and normal-weight women. Serum AM2 was assessed before and 6-9 months after bariatric surgery. Expression/secretion of AM2 and its receptor was assessed in human adipocytes.ADM2 mRNA in both  depots was higher in obese patients, whether diabetic or not. Although serum AM2 was significantly lower in obese patients, it was not changed after bariatric surgery. AM2 and its receptor complex were predominantly expressed by adipocytes, and expression of CALCRL, encoding a component of the AM2 receptor complex, was lower in both  depots of obese patients. Incubating adipocytes with substances mimicking the microenvironment of obese adipose tissue increased ADM2 mRNA but reduced AM2 secretion into culture media and CALCRL mRNA expression.Our data indicate that AM2 signalling is suppressed in adipose tissue in obesity, involving lower receptor expression and ligand availability, likely contributing to insulin resistance and other aspects of the pathophysiology associated with obesity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

MMA leads to an inflammatory state. The aim was to investigate the impact of MMA on bone and . The hypothesis was that it is possible to predict MMA by measuring ketone bodies and bone markers. Blood samples from 175 sows were taken within 72 hr after farrowing. Serum was analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)-D), serum crosslaps (CTX-I), osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), triglycerides (TG), beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and haptoglobin. Spontaneous urine was collected, and pH value was measured in addition to Ca and P. A proximate analysis of the sows' diets was performed. Age, litter size, body condition score (BCS) and clinical signs of MMA were recorded for each sow. A multivariable logistic regression was undertaken with disease status (MMA or healthy) as the dependent variable. Significance was accepted at p < .05. MMA sows had a poorer BCS (p < .001) in relation to healthy sows. Age and number of piglets did not differ. MMA sows showed increased serum CTX-I (p = .004) and decreased serum OC (p < .001). Concentrations of P (p = .007), activity of ALP (p = .002) and BHB (p = .019) as well as TNF-α (p < .001) and haptoglobin (p = .048) concentrations were increased in MMA sows. No difference in urinary pH value between MMA and healthy sows was found. Our results are in accordance with the known fact that sows are in an extreme catabolic state peripartum. Bone  in MMA sows is much more negatively affected than in healthy sows post-partum, due to inflammatory processes shown by higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652899>Increasing Dietary Carbohydrate as Part of a Healthy Whole Food Diet Intervention Dampens Eight Week Changes in Salivary Cortisol and Cortisol Responsiveness.</a></h2><p>It is largely unknown whether and how whole food diets influence psychological stress and stress system responsiveness. To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not  or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant ( = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log Δ -0.35 ± 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log Δ -0.49 ± 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log Δ -0.50 ± 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log Δ -0.51 ± 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log Δ -0.4476 ± 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption. In support of this finding, we also found significant ( < 0.05) and inverse linear associations between dietary carbohydrate and log salivary cortisol, with the strongest negative association (β: -0.004 ± 0.0015,  = 0.009) occurring at 30 min post-TSST, but only in the DGA group and at week 9 of the intervention. Together, increasing dietary carbohydrate as part of a DGA-based diet may reduce circulating cortisol and dampen psychological stress-related cortisol responsiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637422>Mutations in PCYT2 disrupt etherlipid biosynthesis and cause a complex hereditary spastic paraplegia.</a></h2><p>CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ET), encoded by PCYT2, is the rate-limiting enzyme for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Phosphatidylethanolamine is one of the most abundant membrane lipids and is particularly enriched in the brain. We identified five individuals with biallelic PCYT2 variants clinically characterized by global developmental delay with regression, spastic para- or tetraparesis, epilepsy and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Using patient fibroblasts we demonstrated that these variants are hypomorphic, result in altered but residual ET protein levels and concomitant reduced enzyme activity without affecting mRNA levels. The significantly better survival of hypomorphic CRISPR-Cas9 generated pcyt2 zebrafish knockout compared to a complete knockout, in conjunction with previously described data on the Pcyt2 mouse model, indicates that complete loss of ET function may be incompatible with life in vertebrates. Lipidomic analysis revealed profound  abnormalities in patient fibroblasts impacting both neutral etherlipid and etherphospholipid . Plasma lipidomics studies also identified changes in etherlipids that have the potential to be used as biomarkers for ET deficiency. In conclusion, our data establish PCYT2 as a disease gene for a new complex hereditary spastic paraplegia and confirm that etherlipid homeostasis is important for the development and function of the brain.© The Author(s) (2019).

However, studies have failed to control for habitual physical activity levels, which directly influences both mtDNA copy number and insulin sensitivity. We, therefore, examined whether physical conditioning status (maximal oxygen uptake, V̇O) was associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume and mtDNA, and was predictive of T2DM in overweight, middle-aged men.Whole-body physiological (ISI-insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR, V̇O) and muscle biochemical/molecular (vastus lateralis; mtDNA, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes activity,  content and markers of  peroxidation) measurements were performed in three groups of overweight, middle-aged male volunteers (n = 10 per group): sedentary T2DM (ST2DM); sedentary control (SC) and non-sedentary control (NSC), who differed in aerobic capacity (ST2DM < SC < NSC).mtDNA was greater in NSC versus SC and ST2DM (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and less in ST2DM versus SC (P < 0.01). Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free  mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty acids, triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643348>Insulin.</a></h2><p>Insulin is a pancreatic hormone that plays an essential role in regulation of blood glucose as well as  and carbohydrate .

However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty acid substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or  transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty acid substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640132>Effects of Dietary Supplementation of Alpha-Ketoglutarate in a Low-Protein Diet on Fatty Acid Composition and  Related Gene Expression in Muscles of Growing Pigs.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dietary supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) in a reduced crude protein (CP) diet would affect fatty acid composition and  related gene expression in the muscles of growing pigs. A total of 27 Large White × Landrace growing pigs at 44 ± 1 d of age (11.96 ± 0.18 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments ( = 9). Dietary treatments included: (1) normal protein diet with 20% crude protein (CP) (NP); (2) a low crude protein diet formulated to contain approximately 17% CP (LP); and (3) a low crude protein diet with 17% CP supplemented with 1% AKG at the expense of regular corn components (ALP). The experimental trial lasted 35 d. The results showed that compared with the NP and LP diets, supplementation with AKG in a low-protein diet increased the intramuscular  (IMF), oleic acid (C18:1n-9), and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents ( < 0.05), and tended to increase the percentage of palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and stearic acid (C18:0) ( < 0.10) in the biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles of growing pigs. These effects may be associated with increased relative mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in skeletal muscle, indicating that AKG might be involved in the differential regulation of some key lipogenic genes in skeletal muscles of pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652734>Adipose Tissue Quality in Aging: How Structural and Functional Aspects of Adipose Tissue Impact Skeletal Muscle Quality.</a></h2><p>The interplay between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and the impact on mobility and aging remain enigmatic. The progressive decline in mobility promoted by aging has been previously attributed to the loss of skeletal mass and function and more recently linked to changes in body  composition and quantity. Regardless of body size, visceral and intermuscular adipose depots increase with aging and are associated with adverse health outcomes. However, the quality of adipose tissue, in particular abdominal subcutaneous as it is the largest depot, likely plays a significant role in aging outcomes, such as mobility decline, though its communication with other tissues such as skeletal muscle. In this review, we discuss the age-associated development of a pro-inflammatory profile, cellular senescence, and metabolic inflexibility in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Collectively, these facets of adipose tissue quality influence its secretory profile and crosstalk with skeletal muscle and likely contribute to the development of muscle atrophy and disability. Therefore, the identification of the key structural and functional components of adipose tissue quality-including necrosis, senescence, inflammation, self-renewal, metabolic flexibility-and adipose tissue-secreted proteins that influence mobility via direct effects on skeletal muscle are necessary to prevent morbidity/mortality in the aging population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641166>Relationship of the blood metabolome to subsequent carcass traits at slaughter in feedlot Wagyu crossbred steers.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to determine the relationships between the blood metabolome and (1) carcass traits with a focus on intramuscular  (marbling), and (2) the length of time cattle consumed a high-starch diet in feedlot cattle. Blood samples were obtained from 181 Wagyu-crossbred steers between 300-400 days before slaughter when carcass data was collected. H NMR spectroscopy identified 35 metabolites with 7 positively associated with marbling (3-hydroxybutyrate, propionate, acetate, creatine, histidine, valine, and isoleucine; P ≤ 0.05). Subcutaneous rump  thickness was positively associated with glucose, leucine and lipids (P ≤ 0.05) and negatively associated with anserine and arabinose (P ≤ 0.05). Carcass weight and growth rate were negatively associated with 3-hydroxybutyrate (P < 0.05), and growth rate was negatively associated with creatine (P < 0.05) and positively associated with aspartate (P < 0.05). Glucose and arginine showed a significant interaction between marbling and number of days animals consumed a high-starch diet (P < 0.05). Sire was the single variable with the largest effect on the relative concentration of metabolites and carcass and production traits.

Br. extract in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</a></h2><p>Salvia plebeia R. Br. is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been widely used for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism about the hepatoprotective effects of S. plebeia remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts of S. plebeia (SPEE) in the zebrafish model. Firstly, we determined the chemical compositions of SPEE and identified three major constituents by using GC-MS analysis. After that, SPEE exhibited significantly antioxidant properties in the LPS-induced zebrafish embryos, and the enzyme activities of ROS, CAT and SOD were obviously inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Secondly, SPEE greatly reduced  vacuoles (HE staining),  accumulation (Oil O staining) and hepatocyte fibrosis (Gemori staining) in the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatocyte injury of adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, the NO contents and -related genes were substantially down-regulated after SPEE exposure. Thirdly, we used RNA-Seq analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after SPEE exposure in adult zebrafish liver. The results showed that 1289 DEGs including 558 up-regulated and 731 down-regulated were identified between the TAA + SPEE and TAA groups. KEGG pathway and GO functional analysis revealed that steroid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction and innate immunity were significantly enriched. Mechanistically, SPEE can considerably reduce the cell apoptosis of hepatocytes and promote the translocation of Nrf2 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in TAA-induced zebrafish. Moreover, SPEE can modulate various inflammatory cytokines and immune genes both in the control and HO-stimulated conditions. The pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α was markedly up-regulated but the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β was greatly down-regulated after SPEE treatment. In addition, some key genes in the TLR signaling were also activated in the HO-stimulated conditions. In summary, our results suggested that SPEE had an important role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in zebrafish. Some of the components identified in this study may be served as potential sources of new hepatoprotective compounds for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise <0.1% of the tumour bulk and possess high self-renewal, tumour initiating properties, and are responsible for therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and tumour metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to understand the metabolic rewiring occurring in CSCs, especially their , on which there have been recent reports. CSCs rely highly upon  for maintaining their stemness properties and fulfilling their biomass and energy demands, ultimately leading to cancer growth and invasion. Hence, in this review we will shed light on the aberrant  that CSCs exploit to boost their survival, which comprises upregulation in de novo lipogenesis,  droplet synthesis,  desaturation, and β-oxidation. Further, the metabolic regulators involved in the process, such as key lipogenic enzymes, are also highlighted.

To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced  peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain , we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling pathways while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty acid , and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain.

Although surgical and non-surgical methods for reducing SAT exist, patients remain non-compliant because of potential adverse effects and cost. In this study, we developed a new minimally-invasive approach to achieve SAT reduction, using a microneedle (MN) patch prepared from gelatin, which is capable of regulating . Four gelatin types were used: three derived from fish (SA-FG, GT-FG 220, and GT-FG 250), and one from swine (SM-PG 280). We applied gelatin-based MN patches five times over 4 weeks to rats with high- diet (HD)-induced obesity, and determined the resulting amount of SAT. We also investigated the histological features and determined the expression levels of -associated genes in SAT using hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting, respectively. SAT decreased following treatment with all four gelatin MN patches. Smaller adipocytes were observed in the regions treated with SA-FG, GT-FG 250, and SM-PG 280 MNs, demonstrating a decline in  accumulation. The expression levels of -associated genes in the MN-treated SAT revealed that GT-FG 220 regulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. These findings suggest that gelatin MN patches aid in decreasing the quantity of unwanted SAT by altering  and  deposition.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652865>Development of a Food-Based Diet Quality Score from a Short FFQ and Associations with Obesity Measures, Eating Styles and Nutrient Intakes in Finnish Twins.</a></h2><p>We constructed a food-based diet quality score (DQS) and examined its association with obesity measures, eating styles and nutrient intakes. Participants were 3592 individuals (764 dizygotic [DZ] and 430 monozygotic [MZ] twin pairs) from the FinnTwin16 study. The DQS (0-12 points) was constructed from a short 14 item food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measures and eating styles were self-reported. Nutrient intakes were calculated from food diaries completed in a subsample of 249 individuals (45 same-sex DZ and 60 MZ twin pairs). Twins were analyzed both as individuals and as twin pairs. The DQS was inversely associated with body mass index (β = -0.12, per one-unit increase in DQS,  < 0.001), waist circumference (β = -0.34,  < 0.001), obesity (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95,  = 0.004) and abdominal obesity (OR: 0.88,  < 0.001), independent of sex, age, physical activity and education. A higher DQS was associated with health-conscious eating, having breakfast, less snacking, fewer evening meals, and a higher frequency and regularity of eating. The DQS was positively correlated with the intakes of protein, fiber and magnesium and negatively correlated with the intakes of total , saturated  and sucrose. Within twin pairs, most of the associations between the DQS with eating styles and some nutrients remained, but the DQS was not associated with obesity measures within twin pairs. The DQS is an easy-to-use tool for ranking adults according to diet quality and shows an association with obesity measures, eating styles and key nutrients in the expected direction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664441>Effect of Weight Loss via Severe vs Moderate Energy Restriction on Lean Mass and Body Composition Among Postmenopausal Women With Obesity: The TEMPO Diet Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Severely energy-restricted diets are the most effective dietary obesity treatment. However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and  mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups.

Mice lacking IL10 have enhanced thermogenesis, but the roles of specific cell types in the metabolic response to IL10 remain to be defined. We demonstrate here that selective loss of IL10 receptor a in adipocytes recapitulates the beneficial effects of global IL10 deletion, and that local crosstalk between IL10-producing immune cells and adipocytes is a determinant of thermogenesis and systemic energy balance. ingle uclei diocyte RNAuencing (SNAP-seq) of subcutaneous adipose tissue defined a metabolically-active mature adipocyte subtype characterized by robust expression of genes involved in thermogenesis whose transcriptome was selectively responsive to IL10Ra deletion. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adipose stromal populations identified lymphocytes as a key source of IL10 production in response to thermogenic stimuli. These findings implicate adaptive immune cell-adipocyte communication in the maintenance of adipose subtype identity and function.© 2019, Rajbhandari et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637346>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Nonobese Subjects of African Origin Has Atypical Metabolic Characteristics.</a></h2><p>Nonobese nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is reported in several populations.

Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28.5 ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m. Mean liver attenuation (MLA) and liver/spleen (LS) ratio, both inversely correlated to liver , were 62.8 ± 4.3 HU and 1.2 ± 0.1, respectively; 3.8% of participants had liver  >30% (LS ratio < 1). In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting insulin ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004).

However, the hypolipidemic effects and mechanism of rosemary ethanol extract (RO) and their metabolites are less known. In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic acid (RA) and carnosic acid (CA) significantly reduced the contents of liver triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the liver of orotic acid induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related pathways of RO and its main metabolites against  disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of fatty acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653213>Sex differences in the prevalence and adverse outcomes of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in community dwelling elderly in East China using the AWGS criteria.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (SO) have a greater impact on the elderly.

Children aged 6-17 years were invited to use COFIT over three days for recording all instances of eating in addition to maintaining written food records (FR). Spearman's correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the intake of macronutrients and micronutrients estimated using the image-based dietary assessment and the FR method. Intra-class correlation coefficients were used to estimate reliability between dietitians. In the final analysis, 23 children (mean age: 10.47 ± 0.47 years) with complete data obtained using two dietary assessment methods were included. Reliability among dietitians was high. Most assessments of macronutrients and micronutrients revealed moderate correlations between the two methods (range: 0.27-0.94); moreover, no significant differences in nutrients assessments were observed between the two methods, except for energy and . The average difference in energy intake between the methods was 194 kcal/day. Most limits of agreement were within an acceptable range. The Bland-Altman plots showed robust agreement with minimum bias. The limitation was the small sample size and not dividing the population into children and teenagers since the two groups may have different food consumption habits. Overall, the results showed that the image-based assessment tool is suitable for assessing children's dietary intake of macronutrients and micronutrients during pubertal growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638854>Transcription profiling in the liver of undernourished male rat offspring reveals altered  pathways and predisposition to hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Clinical and animal studies have reported an association between low birth weight and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in offspring. Using a model of prenatal maternal 70% food restriction diet (FR30) in rat, we previously showed that maternal undernutrition predisposes offspring to altered  in adipose tissue, especially under high- (HF) diet. Here, using microarray-based expression profiling combined with metabolic, endocrine, biochemical, histological and lipidomic approaches, we assessed whether FR30 procedure sensitizes adult male offspring to impaired  in the liver. No obvious differences were noted in the concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and bile acids in the liver of 4-month-old FR30 rats whatever the post-weaning diet used. However, several clues suggest that offspring's  and steatosis are modified by maternal undernutrition. First,  composition was changed (i.e., higher total saturated fatty acids and lower elaidic acid) in the liver whereas larger triglyceride droplets were observed in hepatocytes of undernourished rats. Second, FR30 offspring exhibited - impact on hepatic gene expression and  pathways under chow diet. Although the transcriptome profile was globally modified by maternal undernutrition, cholesterol and bile acids biosynthesis pathways appear as key targets indicating that FR30 animals were predisposed to impaired hepatic cholesterol . Third, FR30 procedure markedly modifies hepatic gene transcription profiles in undernourished offspring in response to post-weaning HF. Overall, FR30 offspring may exhibit impaired metabolic flexibility which does not enable them to properly cope with post-weaning nutritional challenges influencing the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636851>Theracurmin (Highly Bioavailable Curcumin) Prevents High  Diet-Induced Hepatic Steatosis Development in Mice.</a></h2><p>Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol isolated from the . plant, has many pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemo-preventive activities.

In this study, we compared the difference in prevalence of elevated and hypertensive BP values defined by the 2017 AAP guideline and the 2004 Fourth Report and estimated the cardiovascular risk associated with the reclassification of BP status defined by the AAP guideline. A total of 47 200 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years from 6 countries (China, India, Iran, Korea, Poland, and Tunisia) were included in this study. Elevated BP and hypertension were defined according to 2 guidelines. In addition, 1606 children from China, Iran, and Korea who were reclassified upward by the AAP guideline compared with the Fourth Report and for whom laboratory data were available were 1:1 matched with children from the same countries who were normotensive by both guidelines. Compared with the Fourth Report, the prevalence of elevated BP defined by the AAP guideline was lower (14.9% versus 8.6%), whereas the prevalence of stages 1 and 2 hypertension was higher (stage 1, 6.6% versus 14.5%; stage 2, 0.4% versus 1.7%). Additionally, comparison of laboratory data in the case-control study showed that children who were reclassified upward were more likely to have adverse  profiles and high fasting blood glucose compared with normotensive children. In conclusion, the prevalence of elevated BP and hypertension varied significantly between both guidelines. Applying the new AAP guideline could identify more children with hypertension who are at increased cardiovascular risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h2><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral  to subcutaneous  is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659673>Emerging roles of Golgi/endosome-localizing monomeric clathrin adaptors GGAs.</a></h2><p>GGAs (Golgi-localized, γ-adaptin ear-containing, ADP ribosylation factor [Arf]-binding proteins) are a family of ubiquitously expressed, Arf-dependent monomeric clathrin adaptor proteins, and are conserved from yeast to humans. Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino acid cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, lipid , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652726>Transcriptomic Revelation of Phenolic Compounds Involved in Aluminum Toxicity Responses in Roots of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.</a></h2><p> Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) is one of the most important coniferous evergreen tree species in South China due to its desirable attributes of fast growth and production of strong and hardy wood. However, the yield of Chinese fir is often inhibited by aluminum (Al) toxicity in acidic soils of South China. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity might help to further increase its productivity. Here we used the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform to carry out transcriptome analysis of Chinese fir roots subjected to Al toxicity conditions. A total of 88.88 Gb of clean data was generated from 12 samples and assembled into 105,732 distinct unigenes. The average length and N50 length of these unigenes were 839 bp and 1411 bp, respectively. Among them, 58362 unigenes were annotated through searches of five public databases (Nr: NCBI non-redundant protein sequences, Swiss-Prot: A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database, GO: Gene Ontology, KOG/COG: Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins, and KEGG: the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database), which led to association of unigenes with 44 GO terms. Plus, 1615 transcription factors (TFs) were functionally classified. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs, |log(fold change)| ≥ 1 and FDR ≤ 0.05) were identified in comparisons labelled TC1 (CK-72 h/CK-1 h) and TC2 (Al-72 h/Al-1 h). A large number of TC2 DEGs group were identified, with most being down-regulated under Al stress, while TC1 DEGs were primarily up-regulated. Combining GO, KEGG, and MapMan pathway analysis indicated that many DEGs are involved in primary , including cell wall  and , while other DEGs are associated with signaling pathways and secondary , including flavonoids and phenylpropanoids . Furthermore, TFs identified in TC1 and TC2 DEGs represented 21 and 40 transcription factor families, respectively. Among them, expression of bHLH, C2H2, ERF, bZIP, GRAS, and MYB TFs changed considerably under Al stress, which suggests that these TFs might play crucial roles in Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity. These differentially expressed TFs might act in concert with flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathway genes in fulfilling of key roles in Chinese fir roots responding to Al toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631524>Mechanisms underlying detection of seed dormancy by a scatter-hoarding rodent.</a></h2><p>The mechanism underlying detection of seed dormancy by scatter-hoarding rodents is unclear, although previous work suggests that the pericarp plays an important role in signaling dormancy status. Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) consume early germinating seeds as they are more likely to perish immediately, whereas dormant seeds tend to be cached. To examine the mechanisms underlying dormancy detection, we characterized physical and chemical differences between germinating and dormant pericarps of northern red oak (Quercus rubra), American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and the BC3 hybrid of Chinese chestnut and American chestnut (C. mollissima x C. dentata) using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). We found that, as seeds break dormancy, the wax layer on the pericarp degrades and is accompanied by the escape of lower molecular weight kernel compounds or  byproducts. Our field experiments showed that squirrels were 4-8 times more likely to consume seeds that were altered to remove pericarp wax coating or that were sprayed with seed chemicals. We argue that dormancy detection by scatter-hoarding rodents is a complex process involving physical cues such as loss of pericarp wax and chemical cues such as emission of olfactory cues.

The inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε) was originally described as an inducible protein kinase; whole-body gene deletion or systemic pharmaceutical targeting of this kinase improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice. To investigate the primary sites of action associated with IKKε during weight gain, we describe the first mouse line with conditional elimination of IKKε in the liver (IKKε ). IKKε  mice and littermate controls gain weight, show similar changes in body composition, and do not display any improvements in insulin sensitivity or whole-body glucose tolerance. These studies were conducted using both breeder chow diets and also matched low-  high-fat diets. While glycogen accumulation in the liver is reduced in IKKε mice, lipid storage in liver is similar IKKε mice and littermate controls.

Cholestatic liver diseases are frequently associated with an important increase in total cholesterol at the expense of lipoprotein X (LpX), an abnormal lipoprotein isolated and characterized in the 1960s to 1970s in patients with obstructive jaundice. Lipoprotein X is rich in phospholipids, albumin, and free cholesterol, has a density similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and a size similar to very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which has hampered its detection through routine laboratory tests. Unlike LDL, LpX has no apoB-100, so it is not removed from circulation via the LDL receptor, and it is not clear whether or not it can be atherogenic. Although LpX was initially described in patients with cholestasis, it has also been found in patients with genetic deficiency of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), in patients who receive -rich parenteral nutrition and most recently in patients with graft versus host disease of the liver. In the presence of LpX, plasma total cholesterol can rise up to 1000 mg/dL, which may lead to the development of skin xanthomas and hyperviscosity syndrome. Treatment of LpX-dependent hypercholesterolemia with conventional hypolipidemic drugs is frequently ineffective, and definitive treatment relies on correction of the underlying cause of cholestasis. Here, we present the case of a patient with LpX-dependent hypercholesterolemia in the context of primary biliary cholangitis.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655471>Relationships between adiponectin and bone: Sex difference.</a></h2><p>Despite being secreted exclusively by adipocytes, circulating adiponectin (ApN) is negatively associated with obesity.

Serum leptin and ApN levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.Our results showed that serum ApN levels were significantly associated with obesity measures in both men and women, and the greater effect was observed in men. In contrast, the relationship between ApN and BMD was sex-dependent. Levels of ApN were negatively associated with BMD in women, but not in men. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for potential confounding factors, such as leptin and body mass index. Moreover, serum ApN was found to be a major determinant of BMD in women on the multivariate regression analysis.Our results suggest that ApN, an adipocyte-derived hormone, may affect bone , which may be mediated by sex hormones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and , and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the liver. Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into liver suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the liver after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we performed a reciprocal crossing experiment with broiler and layer chickens and conducted RNA sequencing on liver tissues for reciprocal crosses and their parental lines to identify inheritance patterns of gene expression. Our results showed that heterosis of the abdominal  percentage was 69.28%-154.71% in reciprocal crosses. Over-dominant genes of reciprocal crosses were significantly enriched in three biological pathways, namely, butanoate , the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. Among these shared over-dominant genes, we found that a -related gene,  was enriched in these pathways. Furthermore, we validated this gene as over-dominant using qRT-PCR.

Rice containing RS as low as 1.07% attenuated adipose weight and adipocyte size gain, induced by a moderately high- (HF) diet which correlated with lower leptin levels in plasma and adipose tissue. Rice with 8.61% RS increased fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, modulated HF diet-induced adipose triacylglycerol  and inflammation related genes' expression, and increased fecal triglyceride excretion.

To address the effect of nicotine on food intake and body weight, and on potential changes of CB1R levels in the hypothalamus, mice kept on a high  diet (HFD) for four weeks were challenged with nicotine intraperitoneally.Validity of the micro-dissected samples was confirmed by the expression of established nucleus-enriched genes. The expression levels of CB1R in the arcuate and lateral nuclei of the hypothalamus were higher than paraventricular and ventral-dorsal medial nuclei. Nicotine administration led to a significant suppression of food intake and body weight either under standard or high  diet. Neither HFD nor nicotine alone altered CB1R levels in any nucleus tested. By contrast, treatment of HFD-fed mice with nicotine led to a significant increase in CB1R levels in the arcuate, paraventricular and lateral nuclei.CB1R was widely distributed in multiple hypothalamic nuclei. The expression of CB1R was augmented only when mice were treated with HFD and nicotine in combination. These data suggest that the exposure to nicotine may provoke an enhanced endocannabinoid response in diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2019.

The genetic regulation of leptin should similarly be episodic.Data from three mouse cohorts hosted by the Jackson Laboratory- 402 (174F, 228M) F2 Dilute Brown non-Agouti (DBA/2)×DU6i intercrosses, 142 Non Obese Diabetic (NOD/ShiLtJ×(NOD/ShiLtJ×129S1/SvImJ.H2g7) N2 backcross females, and 204 male Nonobese Nondiabetic (NON)×New Zealand Obese (NZO/HlLtJ) reciprocal backcrosses-were used to test for loci associated with absolute residuals in plasma leptin and arcsin-transformed percent fat ('phenotypic dispersion'; PDpLep and PDAFP). Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633867>The atherogenic role of immune cells in familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipoprotein  that mainly occurs due to mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and is characterized by increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, leading to accelerated atherogenesis and premature coronary heart disease. Both innate and adaptive immune responses, which mainly include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes, have been shown to play a key role for the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in the general population. In FH patients, these immune cells have been suggested to play specific pro-atherosclerotic activities, from the initial leukocyte recruitment to plaque rupture. In fact, the accumulation of cholesterol crystals and oxLDL in the vessels in FH patients is particularly high, with consequent abnormal mobilization of immune cells and secretion of various pro-inflammatory and chemokines. In addition, cholesterol accumulation in immune cells is exaggerated with chronic exposure to relevant pro-atherosclerotic triggers. The topics considered in this review may provide a more specific focus on the immune system alterations in FH and open new insights toward immune cells as potential therapeutic targets in FH.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione , pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty acid , biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655089>Preadipocyte factor 1 regulates adipose tissue browning via TNF-α-converting enzyme-mediated cleavage.</a></h2><p>Increasing adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming obesity and obesity-related disorders. Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige  biogenesis.Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6 N mice and in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6 N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige  markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige  formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible -specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis. This offers a unique target for improving energy homeostasis and treating obesity.Copyright © 2019.

EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by  analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty acids in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661927>A Shifty Target: Tumor-Initiating Cells and Their .</a></h2><p>Tumor-initiating cells (TICs), or cancer stem cells, constitute highly chemoresistant, asymmetrically dividing, and tumor-initiating populations in cancer and are thought to play a key role in metastatic and chemoresistant disease. Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive metabolic plasticity, TIC  is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with metabolic features, with some focus on oxidative , including fatty acid and . These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their  will require advanced methodologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642867>Association of Lipidomic Profiles With Progression of Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis in HIV Infection.</a></h2><p> disruption and excess risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been observed in HIV-infected individuals, but the associations among HIV infection, plasma lipidome, and CVD risk have not been well understood.To evaluate plasma lipidomic profiles and their associations with carotid artery atherosclerosis in individuals with HIV and individuals without HIV.Prospective analysis in the Women's Interagency HIV Study and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study during a 7-year follow-up (from 2004-2006 to 2011-2013) at multicenter HIV cohorts in the United States. The study included 737 participants aged 35 to 55 years (520 with HIV and 217 without HIV) without CVD or carotid artery plaque at baseline. Data were analyzed between April 2017 and July 2019.Two hundred eleven plasma  species.Poisson regression was used to examine the associations of baseline  species with risk of plaque measured by repeated B-mode carotid artery ultrasonography imaging.Of the 737 included participants, 398 (54%) were women, 351 (48%) were African American (non-Hispanic), 156 of 737 (21%) were nonwhite Hispanic, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (6) years. After adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, we identified 12  species, representing independent signals for 10  classes, associated with risk of plaque. Nine  species remained significant after further adjusting for conventional CVD risk factors, although many of them showed moderate to high association with conventional blood lipids (eg, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols and triglycerides). Cholesteryl ester (16:1) (risk ratio [RR] per standard deviation, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.52), ceramide (16:0) (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.63), lysophosphatidylcholine (20:4) (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.58), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (16:0) (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.57), phosphatidylethanolamine (38:6) (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.08-1.64), phosphatidylethanolamine-plasmalogen (36:2) (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52), phosphatidylserine-plasmalogen (36:3) (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.43), and triacylglycerol (54:6) (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) were associated with increased risk of plaque, while phosphatidylcholine (36:4) (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77) was associated with decreased risk of plaque. Most of these plaque-increased  species showed higher levels in individuals with HIV, particularly among individuals with HIV using antiretroviral therapy compared with individuals without HIV. Network analysis identified 9  modules, and 2 modules composed of triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines with long and unsaturated acyl chains, respectively, showed the strongest associations with increased risk of plaque.This study identified multiple plasma  species associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, and alterations in these  species might be associated with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. Our data suggest unfavorable associations of long-chain and unsaturated triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines with carotid artery plaque formation.</p></html>
