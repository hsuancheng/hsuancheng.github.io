To evaluate their impact on immune responses to sequential IAV infections, adult female mice were treated with placebo or one of two progestins, P4 or  (LNG), and infected with a mouse-adapted H1N1 (maH1N1) virus. Treatment with P4 or LNG reduced morbidity but had no effect on pulmonary virus titers during primary H1N1 infection compared to placebo treatment. In serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, total anti-IAV IgG and IgA titers and virus-neutralizing antibody titers but not hemagglutinin stalk antibody titers were lower in progestin-treated mice than placebo-treated mice. Females were challenged 6 weeks later with either an maH1N1 drift variant (maH1N1dv) or maH3N2 IAV. The level of protection following infection with the maH1N1dv was similar among all groups. In contrast, following challenge with maH3N2, progestin treatment reduced survival as well as the numbers and activity of H1N1- and H3N2-specific memory CD8 T cells, including tissue-resident cells, compared with placebo treatment. In contrast to primary IAV infection, progestin treatment increased the titers of neutralizing and IgG antibodies against both challenge viruses compared with those achieved with placebo treatment. While the immunomodulatory properties of progestins protected immunologically naive female mice from the severe outcomes from IAV infection, it made them more susceptible to secondary challenge with a heterologous IAV, despite improving their antibody responses against a secondary IAV infection. Taken together, the immunomodulatory effects of progestins differentially regulate the outcome of infection depending on exposure history. The impact of hormone-based contraceptives on the outcome of infectious diseases outside the reproductive tract is rarely considered. Using a mouse model, we have made the novel observation that treatment with either progesterone or a synthetic analog found in hormonal contraceptives, , impacts sequential influenza A virus infection by modulating antibody responses and decreasing the numbers and activity of memory CD8 T cells. Progestins reduced the antibody responses during primary H1N1 virus infection but increased antibody titers following a sequential infection with either an H1N1 drift variant or an H3N2 virus. Following challenge with an H3N2 virus, female mice treated with progestins experienced greater mortality with increased pulmonary  and reduced numbers and activity of CD8 T cells. This study suggests that progestins significantly affect adaptive immune responses to influenza A virus infection, with their effect on the outcome of infection depending on exposure history.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447355>Endometrial Synovial-like Metaplasia Associated With -releasing Intrauterine System.</a></h2><p>The -releasing intrauterine system (L-IUS) is widely used in contraception and in the treatment of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. L-IUS is also increasingly considered in the management of endometrial neoplasia and its precursors. Histologic changes in the endometrium can be due to the effects of high-dose progestogen or may be caused by the local irritant or mechanical effects of an intrauterine foreign body. In the present study, we describe a novel endometrial alteration associated with L-IUS that most closely resembles synovial metaplasia reported at other extra-articular anatomic sites. Eleven cases were identified with a mean age of 49.6 yr. In most patients L-IUS was used for management of menorrhagia or endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial synovial-like metaplasia was always a focal finding and was associated with areas of surface epithelial erosion. The synovial-like cells showed a distinctive palisaded arrangement with orientation perpendicular to the endometrial surface. Multinucleate cells were present in 2 cases, but granulomas were not identified. The synovial-like cells were vimentin immunoreactive and a variable proportion of cells expressed CD68. Only focal CD10 staining was seen and there was no expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or cytokeratin. In summary, L-IUS may be associated with a distinctive synovial-like metaplastic alteration which most likely represents a stromal reaction to an intrauterine foreign body following endometrial surface erosion. The synovial-like cells appear to comprise histiocytes and modified fibroblasts or stromal cells similar to this process in other sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283026>Preventing recurrence of endometriosis by means of long-acting progestogen therapy (PRE-EMPT): report of an internal pilot, multi-arm, randomised controlled trial incorporating flexible entry design and adaption of design based on feasibility of recruitment.</a></h2><p>Endometriosis is associated with the growth of endometrium in ectopic sites mainly within the pelvis. This results in  and scarring, causing pain and impaired quality of life. Endometriotic lesions can be excised or ablated surgically, but the risk of recurrence is high. A Heath Technology Assessment commissioning call in 2011 sought applications for trials aimed at evaluating long-term effectiveness of postoperative, long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARCs) in preventing recurrence of endometriosis. A survey of gynaecologists indicated that there was no consensus about which LARC ( Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DMPA)) or comparator (combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or no treatment) should be evaluated. Hence, we designed a 'flexible-entry' internal pilot to assess whether a four-arm trial was feasible including a possible design adaption based on pilot findings.In this pilot, women could be randomised to two, three or four treatment options provided that one was a LARC and one was a non-LARC. An assessment of feasibility based on recruitment to these options and a revised substantive trial design was considered by an independent oversight committee.The study ran for 1 year from April 2014 and 77 women were randomised. Only 5 (6%) women accepted randomisation to all groups, with 63 (82%) having a LARC preference and 55 (71%) a non-LARC preference. Four-way and three-way designs were ruled out with a two-way LARC versus COCP design, stratified by prerandomisation choice of LARC and optional subrandomisation to LNG-IUS versus DMPA considered a feasible substantive study.Multi-arm studies are potentially efficient as they can answer multiple questions simultaneously but are difficult to recruit to if there are strong patient or clinician preferences. A flexible approach to randomisation in a pilot phase can be used to assess feasibility of such studies and modify a trial design based on chosen recruitment options, but trialists should consider carefully any practical arrangements should groups need to be dropped during a study.International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, ISRCTN97865475 .

Although observational studies identify DMPA as an important STI risk factor, mechanisms underlying this connection are undefined.  (LNG) is another progestin used for hormonal contraception, but its effect on STI susceptibility is much less explored. Using a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, we herein found that DMPA and LNG similarly reduced genital expression of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1α (DSG1α), enhanced access of inflammatory cells to genital tissue by increasing mucosal epithelial permeability, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies with uninfected mice revealed that DMPA-mediated increases in mucosal permeability promoted tissue inflammation by facilitating endogenous vaginal  invasion. Conversely, concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and intravaginal estrogen restored mucosal barrier function and prevented HSV-2 infection. Evaluating ectocervical biopsy tissue from women before and 1 month after initiating DMPA remarkably revealed that inflammation and barrier protection were altered by treatment identically to changes seen in progestin-treated mice. Together, our work reveals DMPA and LNG diminish the genital mucosal barrier; a first-line defense against all STI, but may offer foundation for new contraceptive strategies less compromising of barrier protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27841046>Targeting mast cells: a new way to treat endometriosis.</a></h2><p>Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease of unclear etiology that affects 15-20% of women of reproductive age. Efforts are now focusing on understanding new mechanisms involved in its physiopathology, like novel target pathways and different molecules. There is evidence that mast cells (MCs) play a role in this disease. This article summarizes recent achievements in preclinical studies and clinical activities investigating the role of MCs in endometriosis. Targeting MCs might offer new alternatives to treat this disease. Areas covered: A systematic literature search was performed (PubMed, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov) using the keywords 'endometriosis and mast cells'. All relevant articles (34) found in PubMed were examined and their reference lists reviewed in order to pinpoint further studies for potential inclusion. Expert opinion: Since endometriosis is a multifactorial disease, and considering that numbers of MCs and activated MCs were clearly increased in endometriotic lesions in both animals and humans, use of MC stabilizers and inhibitors may prove to be effective to treat endometriosis and its associated pain. However, more data from preclinical studies and clinical trials will help to better define the status of MCs in the treatment of this pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on metabolic, hormonal,  and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg,  0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like weight, Body mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors. This study was conducted in a region where women do not have much access to high-end screening and diagnostic facilities that further exacerbates their clinical outcomes. Large scale, long-term studies need to be designed to further evaluate safety use of OCPs in PCOS women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634912>Progestin-Containing Contraceptives Alter Expression of Host Defense-Related Genes of the Endometrium and Cervix.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies indicate that progestin-containing contraceptives increase susceptibility to HIV, although the underlying mechanisms involving the upper female reproductive tract are undefined. To determine the effects of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on gene expression and physiology of human endometrial and cervical transformation zone (TZ), microarray analyses were performed on whole tissue biopsies. In endometrium, activated pathways included leukocyte chemotaxis, attachment, and inflammation in DMPA and LNG-IUS users, and individual genes included pattern recognition receptors, complement components, and other immune mediators. In cervical TZ, progestin treatment altered expression of tissue remodeling and viability but not immune function genes. Together, these results indicate that progestins influence expression of immune-related genes in endometrium relevant to local recruitment of HIV target cells with potential to increase susceptibility and underscore the importance of the upper reproductive tract when assessing the safety of contraceptive products.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30513080>Cervico-vaginal inflammatory cytokine alterations after intrauterine contraceptive device insertion: A pilot study.</a></h2><p>In a prospective study of twenty sexually transmitted infection (STI)-free women, we examined the impact of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) insertion on cervico-vaginal cytokine levels. Nine women chose the -containing IUCD and eight chose a copper IUCD. A cervico-vaginal swab was collected for cytokine analysis pre-insertion and four weeks post-insertion. Significant increases were noted in levels of IL-1α (median 483.4 versus 316.6 pg/mL, p = 0.046), IL-1β (median 605.7 versus 147.3 pg/mL, p = 0.018), IL-6 (median 570.1 versus 157.3 pg/mL, p = 0.046), TNFα (median 1.19 versus 0.6 pg/mL, p = 0.029) and the chemokine MCP-1 (median 340.2 versus 135.2 pg/mL, p = 0.003). No significant changes were noted in the levels of GM-CSF, IL-8, MIG, MIP-3α, RANTES, IL-10, IL-17, IP-10, MIP-1β. Whether this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreases epithelial  integrity and enhances susceptibility to STIs, including HIV, merits further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892938>Dendritic cell function and pathogen-specific T cell immunity are inhibited in mice administered  prior to intranasal Chlamydia trachomatis infection.</a></h2><p>The growing popularity of  (LNG)-releasing intra-uterine systems for long-acting reversible contraception provides strong impetus to define immunomodulatory properties of this exogenous progestin. In initial in vitro studies herein, we found LNG significantly impaired activation of human dendritic cell (DCs) and their capacity to promote allogeneic T cell proliferation. In follow-up studies in a murine model of intranasal Chlamydia trachomatis infection, we analogously found that LNG treatment prior to infection dramatically reduced CD40 expression in DCs isolated from draining lymph nodes at 2 days post infection (dpi). At 12 dpi, we also detected significantly fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs of LNG-treated mice. This inhibition of DC activation and T cell expansion in LNG-treated mice also delayed chlamydial clearance and the resolution of pulmonary . Conversely, administering agonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody to LNG-treated mice at 1 dpi restored lung T cell numbers and chlamydial burden at 12 dpi to levels seen in infected controls. Together, these studies reveal that LNG suppresses DC activation and function, and inhibits formation of pathogen-specific T cell immunity. They also highlight the need for studies that define in vivo effects of LNG use on human host response to microbial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832444>Reduced prevalence of chronic tubal inflammation in tubal pregnancies after  emergency contraception failure.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to compare chronic fallopian tubal inflammatory disease and fibrosis between patients with general tubal pregnancy (TP) and TP with  (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) failure.We retrospectively studied patients with general TP (n = 79) and TP following LNG-EC failure (n = 81) within the same conception cycle. Information on the gynecological features of each subject was collected. Pelvic inflammatory disease and associated sequelae were assessed by the serum Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) IgG test, laparoscopic evaluation of tubal damage, and histopathological observation of tube tissues. Chi-square and Student's t-tests were employed to determine the difference between the two groups.Compared with general TP, cases of TP following LNG-EC failure subjects were less likely to have a history of previous ectopic pregnancy (5.06% vs. 18.52%, p = 0.009) and adnexal surgery (6.33% vs. 22.22%, p = 0.010). Patients with TP following LNG-EC failure were less likely to have pelvic inflammatory disease and associated sequelae than those with general TP, as revealed by positive reaction to anti-CT IgG (18.18% vs. 35.94%, p = 0.031), assessment of tubal damage (grade I: 5.06% vs. 17.28%; grade II: 2.53% vs. 11.11%; grade III: 1.27% vs. 6.17%; p = 0.001), infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells (10.91% vs. 62.50%, p < 0.001), and positive Masson's staining (7.69% vs. 39.58%; p < 0.001).Compared with cases of general TP, cases of TP following LNG-EC failure exhibited reduced rates of CT infection, fallopian tubal inflammation, and/or fibrosis.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27381237>Does the Oral Contraceptive Pill Increase Plasma Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Levels in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinopathy of women, is a state of chronic low-grade  and is closely linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drug-naive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 ± 4.78 vs 21.92 ± 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 ± 3.92 vs 23.66 ± 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-α levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-α (P = .01).OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many metabolic parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

These hormonal changes cause increased proliferation, , pain and infertility. Hormonal imbalances are targets for treatment. Therapeutic strategies and innovations of hormonal drugs for endometriosis are increasing. Acting on estrogen receptors are hormonal drugs decreasing systemic and local estrogen synthesis (GnRH analogs, GnRH antagonists, Aromatase inhibitors) or estrogen activity (selective estrogen receptor modulators). The progesterone resistance is counteracted by progestins (Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Dienogest, Danazol, ) or by Selective progesterone receptor modulators, a class of drugs under development. The future trend will be to define new drugs to use for prolonged period of time and with poor side effects considering endometriosis a chronic disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the concomitant effects of COC and NO deficiency on the heart and glucose regulation are not well known. We therefore hypothesized that COC treatment during NO deficiency would lead to the development of cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly allotted into control, NO deficient (N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester: L-NAME; 20.0mg/kg b.w.), COC-treated (1.0μg ethinylestradiol+5.0μg , p.o) and L-NAME+COC-treated groups. The animals were treated daily for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was estimated by tail-cuff plethysmography, insulin resistance (IR) and β-cell  were estimated by homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-β). Pro-inflammatory (C-reactive protein; CRP and uric acid) and pro-fibrotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAI-1) biomarkers were estimated in the plasma. Cardiac histological examination was also done. Results show that COC or L-NAME treatments led to increased blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell , PAI-1, CRP and uric acid, without significant effect on cardiac mass. L-NAME+COC-treated group had significantly higher blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell , PAI-1, CRP and cardiac mass than COC- or L-NAME-treated groups. Histological examination validated that COC use during NO deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy. The present study demonstrates that COC treatment and NO deficiency synergistically causes cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, atherogenic dyslipidemia, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease with a copper or  IUD has been less than 1% in women who are low risk for sexually transmitted infections. IUD-related pelvic infections secondary to actinomyces have largely vanished from contemporary practice.A 49-year-old using a copper IUD for contraception with poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus was admitted for suspected tubo-ovarian abscess on the basis of abdominopelvic pain, leukocytosis, and computed tomography findings. After she was treated with intravenous and outpatient antibiotics with clinical improvement, repeat imaging 1 month later revealed a persistent complex left adnexal mass. Tumor markers were negative but given the persistence and complex nature of the mass, surgical management was recommended. A robotic-assisted hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Adhesiolysis, profuse irrigation, and ureteral stenting were required. Pathology revealed bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses with actinomyces species identified on intraoperative culture. The patient had a total of 10 days of postoperative antibiotics and improved glucose control with no further signs of infection.Although actinomyces-related IUD PID is considered an outdated diagnosis, there are intermittent case reports of bizarre presentations in older women, often mimicking malignancy. Actinomyces should be a consideration in tubo-ovarian abscesses or pelvic inflammatory disease in patients with an IUD in place, particularly those who have poor glucose control or are otherwise immunosuppressed. Early identification and treatment of actinomyces tubo-ovarian abscesses may reduce surgical morbidity and overall improve patient outcomes and safety.Reprint & Copyright © 2017 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566852>Role of medical therapy in the management of uterine adenomyosis.</a></h2><p>Adenomyosis is a benign uterine condition affecting women at various ages with different symptoms. The management of these patients is still controversial. Few clinical studies focusing on medical or surgical treatment for adenomyosis have been performed. No drug is currently labelled for adenomyosis and there are no specific guidelines to follow for the best management. Anyhow, medical treatments are effective in improving symptoms (pain, abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility). The rationale for using medical treatment is based on the pathogenetic mechanisms of adenomyosis: sex steroid hormones aberrations, impaired apoptosis, and increased inflammation. Several nonhormonal (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and hormonal treatments (i.e., progestins, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues) are currently used off-label to control pain symptoms and abnormal uterine bleeding in adenomyosis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are indicated before fertility treatments to improve the chances of pregnancy in infertile women with adenomyosis. An antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effect of progestins, such as dienogest, danazol and norethindrone acetate, suggests their use in medical management of adenomyosis mainly to control pain symptoms. On the other hand, the intrauterine device releasing  resulted is extremely effective in resolving abnormal uterine bleeding and reducing uterine volume in a long-term management plan. Based on new findings on pathogenetic mechanisms, new drugs are under development for the treatment of adenomyosis, such as selective progesterone receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors, valproic acid, and anti-platelets therapy.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
