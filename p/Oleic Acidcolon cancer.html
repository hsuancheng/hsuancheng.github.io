We investigated the modulating effect of supplementation of the diet of female F344 rats with sunflower-, rapeseed-, olive-, or coconut oil on the formation of the promutagenic, exocyclic DNA adducts in the liver, an organ where major metabolism of fatty acids takes place. 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine (etheno-dA), 3,N(4)-ethenodeoxycytidine (etheno-dC) and 1,N(2)-propandodeoxyguanosine from 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE-dGp) were determined as markers for DNA-damage derived from lipid peroxidation products and markers for oxidative stress. 8-Oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG) was also measured as direct oxidative stress marker. The body weight of the rats was not influenced by the four diets containing the different vegetable oils during the 4-week feeding period. Highest adduct levels of etheno-dC (430 +/- 181 adducts/10(9) parent bases), HNE-dGp (617 +/- 96 adducts/10(9) parent bases) and 8-Oxo-dG (37,400 +/- 12,200 adducts/10(9) parent bases) were seen in rats on sunflower oil diet (highest linoleic  content). Highest adducts levels of etheno-dA (133 +/- 113 adducts/10(9) parent bases) were found in coconut oil diet (lowest content of linoleic ). Weakly positive correlations between linoleic  content in the four diet groups were only observed for levels of HNE-dGp and 8-Oxo-dG. Neither the diet based on olive oil (which contains mainly ) nor the diet based on rapeseed oil (containing alpha-linolenic ) exerted any significant protective effect against oxidative DNA damage. Our results indicate that a high linoleic  diet may contribute to oxidative stress in the liver of female rats leading to a marginal increase in oxidative DNA-damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545039>Extra Virgin Olive Oil Minor Compounds Modulate Mitogenic Action of  on  Cell Line.</a></h1><p>Experimental and clinical findings suggest that olive oil has a protective effect, whereas  consumption induces colorectal  (CRC). Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty acids, mainly  and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that  (1-100 μM) but not elaidic  induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic  (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by . These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic  that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the arachidonic  cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action. In conclusion,  and  in the presence of olive oil representative minor components have opposite effects, suggesting that the consumption of seed oils, high  seed oils, or olive oil will probably have different effects on CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262033>Fatty  composition and anticancer activity in  carcinoma cell lines of Prunus dulcis seed oil.</a></h1><p>Almond oil is used in traditional and complementary therapies for its numerous health benefits due to high unsaturated fatty acids content.This study investigated the composition and in vitro anticancer activity of almond oil from Northern Cyprus and compared with almond oil from Turkey.Almond oil from Northern Cyprus was obtained by supercritical CO extraction and analyzed by GC-MS. Almond oil of Turkey was provided from Turkish pharmacies. Different concentrations of almond oils were incubated for 24 and 48 h with Colo-320 and Colo-741 cells. Cell growth and cytotoxicity were measured by MTT assays. Anticancer and antiprolifetarive activities of almond oils were investigated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against to BMP-2, β-catenin, Ki-67, LGR-5 and Jagged 1. (77.8%; 75.3%), linoleic  (13.5%; 15.8%), palmitic  (7.4%; 6.3%), were determined as the major compounds of almond oil from Northern Cyprus and Turkey, respectively. In the MTT assay, both almond oils were found to be active against Colo-320 and Colo-741 cells with 1:1 dilution for both 24 h and 48 h. As a result of immunohistochemical staining, while both almond oils exhibited significant antiproliferative and anticancer activity, these activities were more similar in Colo-320 cells which were treated with Northern Cyprus almond oil.Almond oil from Northern Cyprus and Turkey may have anticancer and antiproliferative effects on  cells through molecular signalling pathways and, thus, they could be potential novel therapeutic agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19582494>Docosahexaenoic  activates some SREBP-2 targets independent of cholesterol and ER stress in SW620  cells.</a></h1><p>The SREBP-2 transcription factor is mainly activated by low cellular cholesterol levels. However, other factors may also cause SREBP-2 activation. We have previously demonstrated activation of SREBP-2 by the polyunsaturated fatty  docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in SW620  cells. Despite activation of SREBP-2, only a few target genes were induced and cholesterol biosynthesis was reduced. In the present study, gene expression analysis at early time points verified the previously observed SREBP-2 target gene expression pattern. Activation of SREBP-2 using siRNAs targeting Niemann Pick C1 protein (NPC1) led to increased expression of all SREBP target genes examined, indicating that activation of some SREBP-2 target genes is inhibited during DHA-treatment. Cholesterol supplementation during DHA treatment did not abolish SREBP-2 activation. We also demonstrate that activation of SREBP-2 is independent of ER stress and eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which we have previously observed in DHA-treated cells. Thapsigargin-induced ER stress repressed expression of SREBP-2 target genes, but with a different pattern than observed in DHA-treated cells. Moreover,  (OA) treatment, which does not induce ER stress in SW620 cells, led to activation of SREBP-2 and induced a target gene expression pattern similar to that of DHA-treated cells. These results indicate that DHA and OA may activate SREBP-2 and inhibit activation of SREBP-2 target genes through a mechanism independent of cholesterol level and ER stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1826490>Arachidonic  and docosahexaenoic  are increased in human colorectal .</a></h1><p>Increased arachidonic  concentrations in experimental rodent   have been described recently. In humans, a reduced erythrocyte stearic  to  ratio has been reported in patients with colorectal  and it has been proposed that similar changes exist in the  tissue. The long chain fatty acids in the cancers of 15 patients with colorectal  were measured and compared with values in the unaffected mucosa. The values were expressed as mean (SD) mg fatty /g tissue and compared by analysis of variance. In the  tissue arachidonic  was increased (0.703 (0.109) mg/g v 0.603 (0.127) mg/g, p less than 0.05) as was docosahexaenoic  (0.211 (0.066) mg/g v 0.148 (0.039) mg/g, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the stearic  to  ratio in the  tissue was increased rather than decreased, as previously suggested (0.36 (0.05) v 0.29 (0.7), p less than 0.01). Increased arachidonic  and docosahexaenoic  concentrations may be related to reduced lipid peroxidation, which is a feature of rapidly growing cells. Alternatively, the increased arachidonic  values could be due to enhanced desaturase activity upon linoleic and linolenic , leading perhaps to increased formation of prostaglandins and other lipoxygenase products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246833>Cytotoxic Activity and Chemical Composition of the Root Extract from the Mexican Species Linum scabrellum: Mechanism of Action of the Active Compound 6-Methoxypodophyllotoxin.</a></h1><p>The cytotoxic activity and the chemical composition of the dichloromethane/methanol root extract of Linum scabrellum Planchon (Linaceae) were analyzed. Using NMR spectra and mass spectrometry analyses of the extract we identified eight main constituents:  (1), octadecenoic  (2), stigmasterol (3), α-amyrin (4), pinoresinol (5), 6 methoxypodophyllotoxin (6), coniferin (7), and 6-methoxypodophyllotoxin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (8). By using the sulforhodamine B assay, an important cytotoxic activity against four human  cell lines, HF6  (IC50 = 0.57 μg/mL), MCF7 breast (IC50 = 0.56 μg/mL), PC3 prostate (IC50 = 1.60 μg/mL), and SiHa cervical (IC50 = 1.54 μg/mL), as well as toward the normal fibroblasts line HFS-30 IC50 = 1.02 μg/mL was demonstrated. Compound 6 (6-methoxypodophyllotoxin) was responsible for the cytotoxic activity exhibiting an IC50 value range of 0.0632 to 2.7433 µg/mL against the tested cell lines. Cell cycle studies with compound 6 exhibited a cell arrest in G2/M of the prostate PC3  cell line. Microtubule disruption studies demonstrated that compound 6 inhibited the polymerization of tubulin through its binding to the colchicine site (binding constant K b = 7.6 × 10(6) M(-1)). A dose-response apoptotic effect was also observed. This work constitutes the first investigation reporting the chemical composition of L. scabrellum and the first study determining the mechanism of action of compound 6.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450226>Human carbonyl reductase 1 participating in intestinal first-pass drug metabolism is inhibited by fatty acids and acyl-CoAs.</a></h1><p>Human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, reduces a variety of carbonyl compounds including endogenous isatin, prostaglandin E and 4-oxo-2-nonenal. It is also a major non-cytochrome P450 enzyme in the phase I metabolism of carbonyl-containing drugs, and is highly expressed in the intestine. In this study, we found that long-chain fatty acids and their CoA ester derivatives inhibit CBR1. Among saturated fatty acids, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids were inhibitory, and stearic  was the most potent (IC 9µM). Unsaturated fatty acids (, elaidic, γ-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids) and acyl-CoAs (palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and oleoyl-CoAs) were more potent inhibitors (IC 1.0-2.5µM), and showed high inhibitory selectivity to CBR1 over its isozyme CBR3 and other SDR superfamily enzymes (DCXR and DHRS4) with CBR activity. The inhibition by these fatty acids and acyl-CoAs was competitive with respect to the substrate, showing the K values of 0.49-1.2µM. Site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate-binding residues of CBR1 suggested that the interactions between the fatty acyl chain and the enzyme's Met141 and Trp229 are important for the inhibitory selectivity. We also examined CBR1 inhibition by  in cellular levels: The fatty  effectively inhibited CBR1-mediated 4-oxo-2-nonenal metabolism in  DLD1 cells and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in the drug-resistant gastric  MKN45 cells that highly express CBR1. The results suggest a possible new food-drug interaction through inhibition of CBR1-mediated intestinal first-pass drug metabolism by dietary fatty acids.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

DAG oil is a cooking oil that contains >80% diglycerides, <20% triglycerides and <5% monoglycerides. Male 6-week-old F344 rats (20 in each group) were sequentially treated with five carcinogens for initiation in different organ target sites for 4 weeks (DMBDD treatment), and then administered DAG oil at dietary levels of 0% (control), 1.375%, 2.75% or 5.5% [triacylglycerol (TGs), with the same fatty  composition as DAG oil were also added at dietary levels of 5.5%, 4.125%, 2.75% and 0%, respectively, to maintain the same lipid level], or 5.5% high linoleic  TG (HLTG), 5.5% high  TG (HOTG), or 5.5% medium-chain TG (MCTG) (as reference substances, mostly consisting of triacylglycerols) admixed into AIN-93G semi-synthetic diet, for an additional 24 weeks. Controls received standard diet without any supplementation as non-treated control. All animals were killed at the end of week 28, and the major organs were carefully examined for preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. No DAG oil treatment-related changes were noted in survival, general conditions, body weights, food consumption and organ weights. Upon quantitative analysis of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci of the liver, DAG oil was not found to exert any effects. The incidence of  adenomas was significantly increased in rats given 1.375% DAG oil, but not 2.75% and 5.5% DAG oil, when compared to the control (5.5% TG group) value. Furthermore, incidences and multiplicity of hyperplasias and adenomas and/or adenocarcinomas were comparable across all DAG oil-treated groups. In contrast, incidences of  adenomas and/or adenocarcinomas were significantly increased in rats given 5.5% HOTG, and adenomas with MCTG, but not 5.5% HLTG, as compared to the 5.5% TG value. Preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions induced by DMBDD treatment in various organs other than the large intestine were comparable in all cases. Thus, the current results indicate that DAG oil may not exert modifying potential on tumor development, even in the  because of the lack of dose-dependence. DAG oil was equivalent to HOTG (standard cocking oil composed of naturally occurring fatty acids), with regard to  tumor development. Further dose-response study concerning HOTG may be needed to confirm whether the enhancing effect of large intestine carcinogenesis exert or not.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16123007>[Dietary fatty acids and experimental carcinogenesis].</a></h1><p>Experiments in animal models of mammary carcinogenesis suggest that fatty acids promote mammary tumors development. This effect depends first on the amount then on the type of fatty acids available. n-6 fatty acids such as linoleic  generally stimulates mammary tumor growth, while n-3 fatty acids oppose this effect. Conjugated diene fatty acids (CLA) inhibit mammary carcinogenesis when brought at elevated amount. There are limitations in using an animal model in the analysis between nutrition and colorectal cancers. This is ascribable to the following: firstly, the digestive tract of rodents if different from that of humans and secondly, the induction of  in these animals (chemical carcinogenesis, injection of cancerous cells or transgenesis) does not mimic human  carcinogenesis. However, on the basis of numerous published data, some important correlations have arisen that could generate hypotheses and guide new epidemiological/interventional and experimental studies. In these animal models it appears that an adequate supply of n-3 PUFAs and  in food may exert a protective effect at all stages of  carcinogenesis. On the other hand, an excessive consumption of n-6 PUFAs and of saturated fatty acids could promote  cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25268047>Selective in vitro anticancer effect of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles loaded in hyaluronan polymeric micelles.</a></h1><p>Due to its native origin, excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, hyaluronan (HA) represents an attractive polymer for superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) coating. Herein, we report HA polymeric micelles encapsulating  coated SPIONs, having a hydrodynamic size of about 100 nm and SPION loading capacity of 1-2 wt %. The HA-SPION polymeric micelles were found to be selectively cytotoxic toward a number of human  cell lines, mainly those of  adenocarcinoma (HT-29). The selective inhibition of cell growth was even observed when the SPION loaded HA polymeric micelles were incubated with a mixture of control and  cells. The selective in vitro inhibition could not be connected with an enhanced CD44 uptake or radical oxygen species formation and was rather connected with a different way of SPION intracellular release. While aggregated iron particles were visualized in control cells, nonaggregated solubilized iron oxide particles were detected in  cells. In vivo SPION accumulation in intramuscular tumor following an intravenous micelle administration was confirmed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histological analysis.

In this study, the efficacy of celastrol against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice was established and the mechanism was investigated using lipidomics. Celastrol treatment significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice, as revealed by the body weight,  length, scores of rectal bleeding and diarrhea, serum TNF-α level, and histological analysis results. Lipidomics analysis based on UPLC/MS revealed characteristic changes in the metabolic profiles of the colitis mice, with altered levels of lipid markers associated with IBD, including LPC18 : 0, LPC18 : 1, LPC18 : 2, sphingomyelin (SM), and increased LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 1 and LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 2 ratios. For the celastrol-treated colitis mice, however, levels of the above lipid markers were restored, together with recovered saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC ratios. Accordingly, using GC-MS analysis, increased stearic  (C18 : 0)/ (C18 : 1) and stearic  (C18 : 0)/linoleic  (C18 : 2) ratios were observed in colitis mice, which were later recovered after celastrol treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the liver expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), the key enzyme controlling the desaturation of saturated fatty , was dramatically inhibited in IBD mice, and was obviously recovered after celastrol treatment. These results suggest that the increased saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC (and saturated fatty /unsaturated fatty ) ratios associated with SCD1 down-regulation could be regarded as biomarkers of colitis, and celastrol alleviates DSS-induced colitis partially via up-regulation of SCD1, restoring the altered balance between stearic - and -derived lipid species, which plays an important role in alleviating colitis.

Here, we report that unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) are potent competitive inhibitors of the AKR enzymes. The sensitivities to the FAs were different among the enzymes, especially between AKR1C1 and AKR1C2. The most potent inhibitors for AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C4 were docosahexaenoic  (Ki 0.77 µM), palmitoleic  (Ki 0.41 µM) and linoleic  (Ki 0.33 µM), respectively. AKR1C3 was the most sensitive to FA inhibition, showing low Ki values (0.23-0.29 µM) for , linoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Linoleic and  acids also inhibited AKR1C3-mediated metabolism of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in  DLD1 cells. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggested upon FA binding to AKR1C1 and AKR1C3: (i) the carboxyl group of the FA binds to the oxyanion-binding site in the active site; (ii) the difference in FA sensitivity between AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 is due to their residue difference at position 54; (iii) Ser118, Phe306 and Phe311 of AKR1C3 are important for determining the inhibitory potency of FAs.© The Authors 2017.

We examined the effects of docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic  and arachidonic  on the  carcinoma cell lines SW480 derived from a primary tumour, and SW620 derived from a metastasis of the same tumour. DHA had the strongest growth-inhibitory effect on both cell lines. SW620 was relatively more growth-inhibited than SW480, but SW620 also had the highest growth rate in the absence of PUFAs. Flow cytometry revealed an increase in the fraction of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, particularly for SW620 cells. Growth inhibition was apparently not caused by increased lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione or low activity of glutathione peroxidase. Transmission electron microscopy revealed formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets after DHA treatment. In SW620 cells an eightfold increase in total cholesteryl esters and a 190-fold increase in DHA-containing cholesteryl esters were observed after DHA treatment. In contrast, SW480 cells accumulated DHA-enriched triglycerides. Arachidonic  accumulated in a similar manner, whereas the nontoxic  was mainly incorporated in triglycerides in both cell lines. Interestingly, nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (nSREBP1), recently associated with cell growth regulation, was downregulated after DHA treatment in both cell lines.

The relative sensitivity of cells to the antiproliferative effect of ET-18-OCH3 has been postulated to be due to the degree of inhibition of cellular acylation processes. We therefore investigated the effect of 5 micrograms/ml ET-18-OCH3 on the incorporation of fatty acids for up to 12 h, into A427 and A549 phospholipids. Significant changes observed in the incorporation of fatty acids into A427 phospholipids by the ALP were a decreased incorporation of  into PC after 8 h, an increased incorporation of linoleic  into PE after 12 h, decreased incorporation of arachidonate into PE after 3 h, and increased incorporation into PA after 5 h. Although the above changes affected the distribution of newly esterified fatty acids in the phospholipids, there was no effect on the total quantity of label incorporated in the phospholipid fraction between the experimental and control cells after 12 h. Incubation of A549 cells with ET-18-OCH3 resulted in decreased esterification of  into PC, SM, and LPC after 5 h; decreased incorporation of linoleic into PE after 12 h; and a decreased incorporation of arachidonate into SM after 1.5 h. After 12 h incubation with ET-18-OCH3, changes in the distribution of radiolabeled fatty acids were observed in the quantitatively minor phospholipids, SM and LPC. A 20% decrease in the quantity of  incorporated into the phospholipids was observed in cells incubated with the ALP; however, no differences were observed in the quantity of linoleic or arachidonic  incorporated into the phospholipids. The lack of common effects of the ALP on the incorporation of fatty acids into A427 and A549 phospholipids, coupled with the absence of changes that were more severe or manifested earlier in the more sensitive A427 cell line, suggests that the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on the acylation processes depends on the cell type and the fatty  species and is unlikely to be responsible for the relative sensitivities of the cells to the compound. Radiolabeled ET-18-OCH3 was used to examine the correlation between the amount of the compound accumulated in A427, A549, MCF7, T84, and LS174T cells and the relative susceptibilities of the cells to the ALP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21965723>Anticancer activity of branched-chain derivatives of .</a></h1><p>A number of unsaturated fatty acids and a few saturated branched-chain fatty acids have been reported to exhibit anticancer activity.In previously reported research, several novel branched-chain derivatives (methyl, n-butyl, phenyl) of methyl oleate were produced by bromination in the allylic position and subsequent treatment with organocuprate reagents.

We tested a saturated fatty  to compare the physiological relevance of our results.We show that  is a potent inhibitor of SOCE. By contrast, stearic  failed to have a SOCE-inhibitory effect. The SOCE-inhibition induced by  was protein kinase C-independent and restored by albumin. We also demonstrated that  induced increases in [Ca²⁺](i). The novelty of our report is that little variability in the concentration could end in a large different physiological effect.In conclusion, we suggest a physiological pathway for the beneficial effect of  in  carcinoma cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1402397>Influence of eicosapentaenoic  (20:5, n-3) on secretion of lipoproteins in CaCo-2 cells.</a></h1><p>CaCo-2 cells, grown on filter membranes, were used to study the effects of fatty acids on cellular metabolism of triacylglycerol and phospholipids. The rate of triacylglycerol secretion was enhanced more than 2-fold, from 1 to 2 weeks after reaching confluency, in the presence of 0.6 mM fatty acids. Triacylglycerol secretion and oxidation of  increased 2- and 9-fold, respectively, with this culture system, as compared to cells grown on conventional plastic dishes. Eicosapentaenoic  (20:5 n-3), when compared to , did not reduce formation of triacylglycerol or enhance phospholipid synthesis in CaCo-2 cells during short term (less than 24 h) experiments, when the cells resided on membranes, regardless of what type of radioisotopes were used as precursors in the incubation media. However, the n-3 fatty  was preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin, as compared to . The disappearance from the apical medium and cellular uptake of labeled eicosapentaenoic and  were similar during incubations up to 24 h, and the metabolism of these fatty acids to -soluble materials and CO2 was equal. Light scattering analysis indicated that secreted lipoproteins of density less than 1.006 g/ml were in the same size-range as chylomicrons derived from human plasma. Assessment of secreted apolipoprotein B showed that by incubating CaCo-2 cells with , apolipoprotein B levels increased approximately 1.4-fold when compared to cells incubated with eicosapentaenoic , whereas the amount of triacylglycerol and size-range of particles were similar for the two fatty acids. Our data indicate that CaCo-2 cells grown on filter membranes exhibit enterocyte-like characteristics with the ability to synthesize and secrete chylomicrons. Eicosapentaenoic  and  are absorbed, metabolized, and influence secretion of lipoprotein particles in a similar way, except for some differences in incorporation of the fatty acids into certain phospholipid classes and a reduced secretion of apolipoprotein B.

A total of 348 cases of  of the  and 194 cases of  of the rectum were individually matched by age, sex and neighbourhood of residence to 542 population controls and frequency match to 535 hospital controls who had undergone an abdominal operation. Each subject received a personal medical history questionnaire and a quantitative diet history questionnaire. Data on a number of potential non-nutrient risk factors for bowel  and on the consumption of 9 nutrients in the 2-month period up to 6 months before interview were analysed. The dietary data thus refer to recent diet consumed in a period antedating the diagnosis of, and in most cases symptoms from, large-bowel  in the cases, and a corresponding time period in the controls. The major findings were an elevated risk for those with a history of bowel polyps, and for those with an elevated intake of calories, total fat, total protein, saturated fat,  and cholesterol. No association was seen with an elevated intake of crude fibre, Vitamin C and linoleic . The nutrients for which an increased risk was demonstrated were highly correlated, though multivariate analysis using logistic regression indicated highest risk for saturated fat, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. The findings in both  sites, both sexes and with both sets of controls were quantitatively very similar. The population-attributable risk for  and rectal  combined was estimated from the neighbourhood controls to be 41% for males and 44% for females for saturated fat intake and 9.8% and 6.4% respectively for any history of polyps.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7750095>18:1 n7 fatty acids inhibit growth and decrease inositol phosphate release in HT-29 cells compared to n9 fatty acids.</a></h1><p>Studies have shown that trans fatty acids may play a role in the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease and . The objective of the present project was to examine the effect of supplementation with 18:1 isomers, both positional and geometrical, as compared to 18:0 on the growth, membrane fatty  composition and the phosphoinositide cycle of HT-29 human  cells. Cells were supplemented with 30 microM stearic  (18:0), elaidic  (18:1, n9, trans),  (18:1, n9, cis), vaccenic  (18:1, n7, cis) or trans-vaccenic  (18:1, n7, trans) as sodium salts complexed to fatty -free bovine serum. Cells were grown in these media for 9 days. Cell growth was examined by counting the number of cells and expressed as percentage of control (18:0 supplemented cells). The phosphoinositide (PI) cycle was examined by measuring the inositol phosphate (IP) released from phosphoinositides in the absence (basal) or presence of stimuli (0.1 mM carbachol, 0.1 mM A23187 or 20 mM NaF). The results obtained indicated that cis and trans n7 fatty acids inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells by 11% and 23%, respectively, as compared to 18:0 supplementation. 18:1, n9 had no effect on tumor growth. Supplementation with all forms of 18:1 resulted in an increase in IP and IP2 production as compared to 18:0 supplemented cells without influencing IP3. The presence of the double bond at the 9 position in the supplemented fatty  increases total IP production by 59% and in the cis form by 37% above the control. The breakdown of phosphoinositides in the absence and presence of several stimuli supports the observed finding on IP. Trans fatty  supplementation resulted in lower hydrolysis of PI as compared to cis fatty acids. It is concluded that the observed inhibition of tumor growth by the vaccenic acids may be mediated by their effect(s) on the PI cycle which may be associated with their incorporation into membrane lipids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6749174>Inability of the mutagen-blocking agent  to protect against  carcinogenesis in the rat.</a></h1><p> has been found in cooked beef and human feces.

The tetraene was identified by radio gas chromatography as arachidonic  (5, 8, 11, 14-20:4), and the triene had a retention time of 5, 11, 14-20:3. Thus, the possibility arises that a delta8 desaturase was involved. In the delta6 desaturase, with the urinary bladder cancerous tissue, the desaturase activity appeared to be decreased in comparison to neighboring tissue, whereas with the   tissue, the desaturase appeared to be relatively increased, though the number of samples was inadequate for confidence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151753>Orcinol Glucoside Loaded Polymer - Lipid Hybrid Nanostructured Lipid Carriers: Potential Cytotoxic Agents against Gastric,  and Hepatoma Carcinoma Cell Lines.</a></h1><p>Orcinol glucoside (OG) - loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC), coated with polyethylene glycol-25/55-stearate (PEG-25/55-SA), were explored for delivering OG to improve in vitro cytotoxicity against gastrointestinal tract (GIT),  and hepatoma carcinoma cell lines.

Dietary fat intake was found to be unrelated to the risk of breast  in cohort studies. In view of these conflicting findings it has been difficult to make nutritional recommendations for the prevention of breast . Studies in animal models and recent observations in humans, however, have provided evidence that a high intake of omega-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), stimulates several stages in the development of mammary and , from an increase in oxidative DNA damage to effects on cell proliferation, free estrogen levels to hormonal catabolism. In contrast, fish oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids seem to prevent  by influencing the activity of enzymes and proteins related to intracellular signalling and, ultimately, cell proliferation. In this commentary, current evidence from experimental and human studies is summarized that implicates a high intake of omega-6 PUFAs in  of the breast,  and, possibly, prostate and which indicates that omega-3 PUFAs and monounsaturated fatty acids such as  (omega-9) are protective. Plausible mechanisms for modulation of steps in the multistage carcinogenesis process by fats are discussed. Properly designed epidemiological studies are now needed, that integrate relevant biomarkers to unravel the contributions of different types of fat, their interactions with hormonal catabolism, protective nutritional factors and human  risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2910475>Fecal diglycerides as selective endogenous mitogens for premalignant and malignant human  epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Diglycerides (DGs) have been found in fecal extracts at concentrations which induce mitogenesis of adenoma and some carcinoma cells but not normal cells in primary culture. DGs containing stearic, , palmitic, and myristic  side chains were found in fecal extracts from each of eight subjects. Synthetic 1,2-DGs, containing the fatty acids found in endogenous fecal DGs, induced mitogenesis in cultures of premalignant cells from each of 13 adenomas, covering all histological classes, and in cultures from two of four carcinomas. The potent adenoma mitogen, dimyristin, had no mitogenic activity on cultures of normal  epithelial cells from seven different subjects. These results suggest DGs may act as endogenous mitogens in the development of human . The extent of adenoma mitogenesis was correlated with the chain length of the saturated R-groups: 16 greater than 14 greater than 12 greater than 10 greater than 8 much greater than 18. DGs with  residues, C18:1, were among the most active, while substitution of even one fatty  residue with a stearic  residue, C18:0, reduced or eliminated mitogenic activity. Dimyristin also induced enhanced levels of urokinase secretion from carcinoma cells, in parallel to the phorbol ester tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.

The antineoplastic properties of many PUFAs such as linoleic  and their metabolites are known. We tested the hypothesis that natural vegetable oils, such as sesame oil and its component linoleic , when added to human  adenocarcinoma cells growing in tissue culture would inhibit their growth and that normal  cells would not be similarly affected. Three human  cell lines and one normal human  cell line were exposed to the following: (1) pure linoleic ; (2) lipase-digested sesame oil; (3) undigested sesame oil; (4) five additional common vegetable oils; (5) mineral oil. Linoleic  inhibited the in vitro growth of all three malignant human  adenocarcinoma cell lines. The normal  cell line showed dramatically less inhibition of growth. Lipase-digested sesame oil (LDSO) and undigested sesame oil (UDSO) produced greater inhibition of growth of all three malignant  cell lines than of the normal  cells. Five other common vegetable oils containing various amounts of PUFAs such as corn, soybean, safflower, olive and coconut oils, all in their lipase-digested form, were found to dramatically inhibit the growth of the HT-29 malignant human  cell line. Undigested olive and safflower oils also inhibited the HT-29 cells although not as markedly as the lipase-digested oils. Mineral oil did not inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells. Both lauric and palmitic , which are saturated fatty acids found in abundance in coconut oil inhibits the HT-29 cells more strongly than linoleic , while  did not inhibit. We conclude that many vegetable oils including sesame contain in vitro antineoplastic properties and that this finding warrants further investigation both in vitro and in vivo to assess their possible chemotherapeutic potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21903399>Inhibitory effect of novel 5-O-acyl juglones on mammalian DNA polymerase activity,  cell growth and inflammatory response.</a></h1><p>We previously found that vitamin K(3) (menadione, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) inhibits the activity of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (pol γ). In this study, we focused on juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), which is a 1,4-naphthoquinone derivative, and chemically synthesized novel juglones conjugated with C2:0 to C22:6 fatty  (5-O-acyl juglones). The chemically modified juglones enhanced mammalian pol inhibition and their cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities. The juglone conjugated with  (C18:1-acyl juglone) showed the strongest inhibition of DNA replicative pol α activity and human  carcinoma (HCT116) cell growth in 10 synthesized 5-O-acyl juglones. C12:0-Acyl juglone was the strongest inhibitor of DNA repair-related pol λ, as well as the strongest suppression of the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the compounds tested. Moreover, this compound caused the greatest reduction in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced acute inflammation in mouse ears. C12:0- and C18:1-Acyl juglones selectively inhibited the activities of mammalian pol species, but did not influence the activities of other pols and DNA metabolic enzymes tested. These data indicate that the novel 5-O-acyl juglones target anti- and/or anti-inflammatory agents based on mammalian pol inhibition. Moreover, the results suggest that acylation of juglone is an effective chemical modification to improve the anti- and anti-inflammation of vitamin K(3) derivatives, such as juglone.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, total fat consists of different fatty  families, e.g., saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Epidemiological evidence and experimental studies suggest that these fatty  families have different effects on breast and  carcinogenesis. Therefore the action of each fatty  on carcinogenesis should be evaluated separately. Although it is difficult to establish firm conclusions on the effect of each fatty  in human epidemiological studies, experimental studies on animals and cultured cells suggest that n-6 PUFAs (linoleic  and arachidonic ) may have a tumor promoting effect, while n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic  and alpha-linolenic ) and conjugated fatty acids (CFAs; a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of PUFAs with conjugated double bonds) exert an inhibitory effect on tumor growth. SFAs such as palmitic  and stearic  show little or no tumor promoting effect, and the action of , a MUFA, is inconclusive. In addition to regulation of abnormal cell growth seen in cancers, fatty acids also control cell loss seen in degenerative eye diseases, such as degeneration of lens material in cataract and degeneration of photoreceptor cells in retinitis pigmentosa. Experiments suggest that n-6 PUFAs cause deleterious effects, while n-3 PUFAs result in beneficial effects on the lens and retina. In particular, docosahexaenoic  is known to be effective in rescuing photoreceptor cells from damage. Thus, understanding the function of each fatty  is likely to be important for making progress in treating these and other diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389579>Inhibitory effects of  and docosahexaenoic acids on lung metastasis by -carcinoma-26 cells are associated with reduced matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activities.</a></h1><p>In order to determine the effects of single unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) or combinations on establishment of lung metastatic colonies, UFAs were administered orally to CDF1 mice bearing s.c. implants of the highly metastatic  carcinoma 26.  (OA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) demonstrated significant inhibition. In the case of DHA, this inhibitory potential was markedly reduced by co-administration of linoleic  (LA) or EPA. Furthermore, while tumor cells treated with DHA showed a very low potential for lung colony formation when injected i.v., this again being partially reversed by co-administration of EPA. UFAs were found to be well absorbed into tumor tissues after oral administration, causing marked changes in relative levels, the arachidonic  (AA) content, in particular, being markedly decreased by treatment with DHA or EPA, but not with DHA plus EPA or with DHA plus LA. Investigation of the gelatinolytic activity of the 57-kDa and 92-kDa isoforms of type-IV collagenase (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively) showed a clear reduction in the former by treatment with OA, while DHA, but not DHA plus LA or EPA, caused a decrease in the 92-kDa isoform, which was well correlated with AA content in tumor tissues (r = 0.900, p < 0.001).

Specific binding was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by the addition of exogenous heparin, and binding was virtually eliminated (less than 6% control values) by pretreatment of membranes with bacterial heparinase. Cultured intestinal epithelial cells (CaCo-2), shown to possess membrane-associated heparin, also bound pancreatic triglyceride lipase in a specific and saturable manner, with KD = 77 +/- 12 nM and Bmax = 13.7 +/- 6 pmol/10(6) cells. Soluble heparin not only decreased binding, but it also diminished the enzyme-mediated cellular uptake of [14C]oleate from [14C]triolein by over 75%. Therefore, intestinal heparin, a component of the brush border membrane, localizes pancreatic triglyceride lipase in a receptor-like manner to the plasma membrane to promote the subsequent absorption of fatty acids derived from hydrolyzed triglycerides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1385951>Fatty  conjugates of 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine as prodrugs for the selective delivery of 5-fluorouracil to tumor cells.</a></h1><p>We have prepared a novel class of prodrugs by coupling 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5dFU) to  (18:1) and docosahexaenoic (22:6) acids, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of the drug and its conjugates (5dFU-18:1 and 5dFU-22:6) has been assayed in vitro upon HT-29, a  carcinoma cell line of human origin. After short term (2-hr) treatments with the drugs, both fatty  conjugates of 5dFU showed cytotoxic activity in a dose-dependent way, while 5dFU alone was devoid of toxic effects within the whole range of concentrations (10-200 microM) tested. Following long term (24- or 48-hr) incubations only a fraction of the HT-29 cell population was sensitive to 5dFU, the rest of the population being resistant even at the highest concentration tested (200 microM). In contrast, 5dFU- and, particularly, 5dFU-docosahexaenoic acids appeared toxic for the whole population of HT-29 cells under the same experimental conditions. The considerable gain in cell toxicity and, to a lesser extent, in selectivity resulted from the conjugation since the toxic effect of the drug alone was not modified when equimolar mixtures of 5dFU and fatty acids were assayed.

However, the intestine is also an important cholesterogenic organ and the possibility that this class of drugs may alter lipoprotein secretion by the intestine has not been fully studied. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible role of cholesterol in regulating apoB secretion by the intestine by testing if the suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the reductase inhibitor lovastatin affected the secretion of apoB by CaCo-2 human intestinal cells. Differentiated post-confluent CaCo-2 cells were incubated for 24-72 h in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 5 microM lovastatin, and the secretion rate of lipids, as well as apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) into the medium, was measured. Lovastatin markedly inhibited the incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into cholesterol for at least 48 h, lowered the content of esterified cholesterol in cells, and reduced their rate of cholesterol secretion. However, under basal conditions lovastatin had no effect on the secretion rate of apoB. After stimulation of apoB secretion by addition of 0.8 mM  to the medium, lovastatin did not alter apoB secretion in the first 2 days of incubation, but reduced the content of apoB in media from the 3rd day by 30%. This could not be explained by an increase in the rate of LDL degradation. Furthermore, supplementation with mevalonic  only reversed about one-half of the effect of lovastatin, suggesting that this effect was at least parly nonspecific or unrelated to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. There was also no specific effect of lovastatin on apoAI secretion. When cells were cultured with [1-14C]acetate for 24 or 72 h, the specific activity of cholesterol in medium at the end of the incubation was the same as in cells, suggesting that cholesterol used for lipoprotein secretion was in equilibrium with bulk cellular cholesterol and was not from a segregated compartment derived from newly synthesized cholesterol. This may explain why apoB secretion by CaCo-2 cells was unaffected by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1320912>Fatty  composition of normal and malignant cells and cytotoxicity of stearic,  and sterculic acids in vitro.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that saturated fatty acids are differentially cytotoxic to  cells.

EPA and DHA exerted significant inhibitory effects on tumour growth at the implantation site and significantly decreased the numbers of lung metastatic nodules.  also significantly inhibited lung metastatic nodules. Treatment with arachidonic  showed a tendency for reduction in colonization. However, treatment with high doses of fatty acids, especially linoleic , increased the numbers of lung metastatic nodules. DHA and EPA only inhibited lung colonizations when administered together with the tumour cells, suggesting that their incorporation is necessary for an influence to be exerted. Chromatography confirmed that contents of fatty acids in both tumour tissues and plasma were indeed affected by the treatments. Tumour cells pretreated with fatty acids in vivo, in particular DHA, also showed a low potential for lung colony formation when transferred to new hosts. Thus, DHA treatment exerted marked antimetastatic activity associated with pronounced change in the fatty  component of tumour cells. The results indicate that uptake of DHA into tumour cells results in altered tumour cell membrane characteristics and a decreased ability to metastasize.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7945235>Effect of chronic incubation of CaCo-2 cells with eicosapentaenoic  (20:5, n-3) and  (18:1, n-9) on triacylglycerol production.</a></h1><p>CaCo-2 monolayers, cultured for 1 week after reaching confluence, were incubated with micellar solutions of fatty acids for up to 7 days. These conditioned cells were incubated acutely (5 h) with eicosapentaenoic  and , and the levels of cell-associated and secreted triacylglycerol were determined. With acute addition of , both cell-associated and secreted triacylglycerol were decreased in cells chronically exposed to eicosapentaenoic . This effect was observed after as little as 2 days of chronic incubation with eicosapentaenoic . A further decrease was found when these cells were incubated acutely with eicosapentaenoic , regardless of which radioisotopes were used to label precursors in the incubation media. The secretion of both labelled and total triacylglycerol and apolipoprotein B was reduced approximately 50% in cells incubated chronically with eicosapentaenoic . The amounts of triacylglycerol and apolipoprotein B within the cells were not decreased by chronic exposure to eicosapentaenoic . Our data indicate that CaCo-2 cells chronically incubated with eicosapentaenoic  secrete significantly less triacylglycerol than cells incubated chronically with . When eicosapentaenoic  was also included acutely, triacylglycerol secretion was reduced even more. We conclude that chronic exposure of eicosapentaenoic  to this intestinal cell type reduces the rate of chylomicron secretion and may help explain the decreased postprandial lipaemia observed in humans taking fish oil supplements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566476>DHA induces ER stress and growth arrest in human  cells: associations with cholesterol and calcium homeostasis.</a></h1><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are normal constituents of the diet, but have properties different from other fatty acids (e.g., through generation of signaling molecules). N-3 PUFAs reduce  cell growth, but no unified mechanism has been identified. We show that docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 n-3) causes extensive changes in gene expression patterns at mRNA level in the  cell line SW620. Early changes include unfolded protein response (UPR) and increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha as verified at protein level. The latter is considered a hallmark of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is abundantly present already after 3 h. It may coordinate many of the downstream changes observed, including signaling pathways for cell cycle arrest/apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, cholesterol metabolism, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Also, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), but not  (OA), induced key mediators of ER stress and UPR at protein level. Accumulation of esterified cholesterol was not compensated for by increased total levels of cholesterol, and mRNAs for cholesterol biosynthesis as well as de novo synthesis of cholesterol were reduced. These results suggest that cytotoxic effects of DHA are associated with signaling pathways involving lipid metabolism and ER stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119098>Anti-inflammatory effects of Brucea javanica oil emulsion by suppressing NF-κB activation on dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>Brucea javanica is an important traditional medicinal herb used for the treatment of dysentery, malaria, inflammation and  in southeast Asia for many years. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery (also known as ulcerative colitis, UC) has not been fully illuminated. Brucea javanica oil emulsion (BJOE) is the major active and most common application form of Brucea javanica oil (BJO), which has a variety of pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of BJOE and possible mechanism of action on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice.The components of BJOE were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Balb/C mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 30mg/mL) induced colitis were treated with BJOE (0.5, 1 and 2g/kg) and two positive drugs (sulfasalazine, SASP, 200mg/kg; and azathioprine, AZA, 13mg/kg) once daily by gavage for 7 days. Mice in normal control group and DSS group were orally given the same volume of distilled water and soybean lecithin suspension (0.15g/kg) respectively. The effects of BJOE on DSS-induced UC were assessed by determination of body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI),  length, histological analysis, as well as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 in  tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. In addition, NF-κB p65, p-p65 and IκB-α, p-IκBα protein expression levels in  tissues were investigated using Western blotting.The major components of BJOE were found to be  (62.68%) and linoleic  (19.53%) as detected by GC-MS. Our results indicated that BJOE, SASP and AZA showed beneficial effect on DSS-induced colitis in mice, and significantly reduced the body weight loss and DAI, restored the  length, repaired  pathological variations, decreased histological scores, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IFN-γ) as compared with the DSS group. In addition, the mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 induced by DSS treatment was remarkably inhibited by BJOE, SASP or AZA treatments. Furthermore, when compared with DSS-treated mice, the activation of NF-κB was significantly inhibited by AZA and BJOE treatment.Our study shows that BJOE possessed appreciable anti-inflammatory effect against murine experimental UC induced by DSS. The protective mechanism of BJOE may involve inhibition of NF-κB signal transduction pathways and subsequent down-regulation of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that BJOE might be an efficacious and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of UC. Our investigation might also provide experimental evidence for the traditional application of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery and might add new dimension to the clinical indications for BJOE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present work verified the cytotoxic and antioxidant potential of biflorin, an o-naphthoquinone isolated from C. biflora collected in the northeast region of Brazil. The cytotoxicity was tested on three different animal cell models: mouse erythrocytes, sea urchin embryos and tumor cells, while the antioxidant activity was assayed by the thiocyanate method. Biflorin lacked activity on mouse erythrocytes as well as on the development of sea urchin eggs, but strongly inhibited the growth of all five tested tumor cell lines, especially the skin, breast and  cells with IC50 of 0.40, 0.43 and 0.88 micro/ml for B16, MCF-7 and HCT-8, respectively.

The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti-inflammatory compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA).

This phenomenon has been termed "adaptive cytoprotection." The aim of the present study was to use in vivo and in vitro approaches to study adaptive cytoprotection in the small intestine using physiologically relevant concentrations of . Anesthetized rats were instrumented for perfusion of the proximal jejunum with 10 or 40 mM  (in 20 mM sodium taurocholate). Mucosal epithelial integrity was continuously monitored by measuring the blood-to-lumen clearance of 51Cr-labeled EDTA. Perfusion of the lumen with 40 mM  produced a 10-fold increase in 51Cr-EDTA clearance, which was not affected by a previous perfusion with 10 mM , i.e., no adaptive cytoprotection. In another series of experiments,  was placed in the lumen rather than perfused, and mucosal epithelial integrity was assessed histologically. Intraluminal placement of 10 mM  resulted in the generation of a mucus layer over the epithelium. Subsequent placement of 40 mM  did not produce significant epithelial cell injury, i.e., adaptive cytoprotection. In in vitro studies, mucin (1, 5, and 10 mg/ml) was layered over confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells prior to addition of 2 mM  in 4 mM sodium taurocholate. The epithelial cell injury induced by  was inhibited by mucin in a dose-dependent manner.

Linoleic  (LA; C-18, n-6 unsaturated fatty ) and elaidic  (EA; C-18, trans ), both known to affect  carcinogenesis and  progression, were administered by gavage to BALB/c mice, which were inoculated with CT26 syngeneic  cells in the back. Both EA and LA treatments enhanced tumor growth and metastasis. EA and LA also increased the number of CD133-positive stromal cells in the tumor capsule. Importantly, those  cells at the tumor periphery, physically attached to CD133-positive stromal cells, also expressed CD133. These findings suggest that EA and LA might induce stemness in  cells through physical association and promote  metastasis.© 2017 S.

The present study aimed to analyze precisely whether co-culture of two  cell lines, mucus-producing cells HT29-MTX and enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, ameliorate differentiation into an in vitro intestinal barrier model and the signaling pathways involved. Differentiated Caco-2 cells gene datasets were compared first to intestinal or  phenotypes and second to signaling pathway gene datasets. Experimental validations were performed in real-time experiments, immunochemistry, and gene expression analyses on Caco-2 versus co-cultures of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX (10%) cells. Partial maintenance of -cell phenotype in differentiated Caco-2 cells was confirmed and fatty acids merged as potential regulators of  signaling pathways. HT29-MTX cells induced morphological changes in Caco-2 cells, slightly increased their proliferation rate and profoundly modified gene transcription of phenotype markers, fatty  receptors, intracellular transporters, and lipid droplet components as well as functional responses to .

The phenolic profiles of the seed flours were also measured. The most abundant fatty  in the oils was linoleic , ranging from 66.0g/100g of total fatty acids in ruby red seed oil to 75.3g/100g of total fatty acids in concord seed oil. The oils were also high in  and low in saturated fat. Ruby red grape seed oil recorded the highest oxidative stability index of 40h under the accelerated conditions. Total phenolic content (TPC) was up to 100 times lower in the oils than in the flours. Lutein, zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, β-carotene, and α-tocopherol levels were also measured. DPPH radical-scavenging capacity ranged from 0.07 to 2.22mmol trolox equivalents (TE)/g of oil and 11.8 to 15.0mmol TE/g of flour. Oxidative stability of menhaden fish oil containing extracts of the seed flours was extended by up to 137%. HPLC analysis was conducted to determine the levels of free soluble, soluble conjugated and insoluble bound phenolics in the seed flours. The phenolic compounds analyzed included catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, quercetin, gallic , and procyanidins B1 and B2. Antiproliferative activity was tested against HT-29  cells. All of the seed flours and muscadine seed oil registered significant (P<0.05) inhibition of  cell growth. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of developing value-added uses for these seed oils and flours as dietary sources of natural antioxidants and antiproliferative agents for optimal health.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As a lipid droplet-associated protein, Cideb facilitated the export of lipids from enterocytes and promoted intestinal lipid absorption. We found that Cideb was upregulated in the  mucosa of both UC patients and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse colitis, but its roles in the pathogenesis of UC are still ill-defined.Acute colitis was induced with DSS in Cideb-null and wild-type mice, and the inflammation and oxidative stress were evaluated in the  mucosa. Moreover, triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress were further analyzed in polarized Caco-2 cells with overexpression of Cideb.Our present data indicated that Cideb-null mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, and consumption of a high-fat diet exacerbated the deterioration of DSS-induced colitis in Cideb-null mice. Moreover, Cideb deficiency increased the  oxidative stress in DSS-treated mice and more significant under a high-fat diet condition. In exploring the mechanism, we found that Cideb deficiency elevated the lipid content in both feces and the  mucosa of DSS-treated mice, especially those fed with a high-fat diet. The in vitro evidence proved that Cideb expression reduced triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress in polarized Caco-2 cells in the presence of .Our data suggest that Cideb plays a protective role against the development of UC by reducing the lipid accumulation and oxidative damage in the  mucosa.

Cell proliferation was higher in animals treated with a single sucrose bolus than in those given a starch bolus (15 g/kg body wt), with 4.3 +/- 0.64 and 2.17 +/- 0.57 (SE) mitotic figures (MF) per crypt in the sucrose and starch bolus groups, respectively (p < 0.01). When azoxymethane (AOM, 20 mg/kg) was administered 24 hours after a single sucrose or starch bolus, the number of ACF per  after 30 days was higher in the sucrose bolus group [107.5 +/- 9.5 (SE)] than in the starch bolus group (67.8 +/- 0.9, p < 0.01). In additional experiments,  cell proliferation (MF/crypt) was higher in rats given boluses of sucrose three times per week for 40 days after AOM (20 mg/kg) [5.9 +/- 0.7 (SE)] than in rats given starch boluses (2.96 +/- 0.4) or fed sucrose continuously (3.6 +/- 0.5). On the contrary, after 40 days of dietary treatment, the number, dimension, and percentage of ACF secreting sulfomucins and sialomucins were not varied among these three groups. However, the percentage of "large ACF" (ACF with > or = 4 crypts) secreting sialomucins or predominantly sialomucins was higher (p < 0.05) in the sucrose bolus group than in the starch group. The concentration of fecal bile acids and long-chain fatty acids was the same in the sucrose and starch groups, but the concentrations of deoxycholic and  were significantly higher in the sucrose bolus group. In conclusion, the administration of sucrose as a bolus had a stronger effect than continuous sucrose feeding on some parameters related to  carcinogenesis and might be considered a risk factor in  carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10953669>Antimutagenic and some other effects of conjugated linoleic .</a></h1><p>Conjugated linoleic  (CLA) is a collective term for positional and geometric isomers of octadecadienoic  in which the double bonds are conjugated, i.e. contiguous. CLA was identified as a component of milk and dairy products over 20 years ago. It is formed as an intermediate in the course of the conversion of linoleic  to  in the rumen. The predominant naturally occurring isomer is the cis-9, trans-11 modification. Treatment of linoleic -rich oils such as safflower oil, soybean oil, or maize oil with base and heat will result in the formation of CLA. Two isomers predominate in the synthetic preparation, c9,t11 and t10,c12. CLA has been shown to inhibit chemically-induced skin, stomach, mammary or  tumours in mice and rats. The inhibition of mammary tumours in rats is effective regardless of type of carcinogen or type or amount of dietary fat. CLA has also been shown to inhibit cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits. When young animals (mice, pigs) are placed on CLA-containing diets after weaning they accumulate more body protein and less fat. Since CLA is derived from the milk of ruminant animals and is found primarily in their meat and in products derived from their milk there is a concerted world-wide effort to increase CLA content of milk by dietary means. Its effect on growth (less fat, more protein) is also a subject of active research. The mechanisms underlying the effects of CLA are still moot.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24394948>Improvement of the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin on tumor cell lines by poly (monomethylitaconate)-based pH-sensitive, plasma stable liposomes.</a></h1><p>pH-responsive polymers produce liposomes with pH-sensitive property which can release their encapsulated drug under mild acidic conditions found inside the cellular endosomes, inflammatory tissues and cancerous cells. The aim of this study was preparing pH-sensitive and plasma stable liposomes in order to enhance the selectivity and antiproliferative effect of Rapamycin. In the present study we used PEG-poly (monomethylitaconate)-CholC6 (PEG-PMMI-CholC6) copolymer and  (OA) to induce pH-sensitive property in Rapamycin liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomal formulations bearing copolymer PEG-PMMI-CholC6 and OA were characterized in regard to physicochemical stability, pH-responsiveness and stability in human plasma. The ability of pH-sensitive liposomes in enhancing the cytotoxicity of Rapamycin was evaluated in vitro by using  cell line (HT-29) and compared with its cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line. Both formulations were found to release their contents under mild acidic conditions rapidly. However, unlike OA-based liposomes, the PEG-PMMI-CholC6 bearing liposomes preserved their pH-sensitivity in plasma. Both types of pH-sensitive Rapamycin-loaded liposomes exhibited high physicochemical stability and could deliver antiproliferative agent into HT-29 cells much more efficiently in comparison with conventional liposomes. Conversely, the antiproliferative effect of pH-sensitive liposomes on HUVEC cell line was less than conventional liposomes. This study showed that both OA and PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based vesicles could submit pH-sensitive property, however, only PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based liposomes could preserve pH-sensitive property after incubation in plasma. As a result pH-sensitive PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based liposomal formulation can improve the selectivity, stability and antiproliferative effect of Rapamycin.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When cells were incubated in the presence of VA at concentrations of 5 to 20 microg/mL, both VA and c9,t11-CLA increased in cellular lipids in a dose-dependent manner. After 4 d of incubation of SW480 and MCF-7 cells with VA (20 microg/mL), c9,t11-CLA increased from undetectable levels to 8.57 and 12.14 g/100 g FAME in cellular lipids, respectively. VA supplementation for 4 d at 5, 10, and 15 microg/mL had no effect on cell growth, whereas 20 microg/mL significantly (P < 0.05) reduced cell growth in both cell lines. VA (20 microg/mL) treatment induced DNA fragmentation and significantly (P < 0.05) depleted cytosolic GSH levels in the SW480 cell line after 4 d of incubation, suggesting that apoptosis was the mode of cell death induced by VA. Both VA and c9,t11-CLA reduced (P < 0.05) total ras expression in SW480 cells. 14C-Arachidonic  uptake into the MG fraction was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in both cell lines while uptake into the phospholipid fraction decreased in response to VA. VA treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha in both cell lines.

Exposure to the toxic lectin phytohemagglutinin (1 mg/mL),  (8 mmol/L) and taurocholic  (12 mmol/L), or Clostridium difficile toxin A (0.7 microgram/mL) resulted in loss of barrier function with 36%, 62%, and 45% of [3H]mannitol penetration, respectively.Addition of recombinant human intestinal trefoil factor in physiological concentrations (1-5 micrograms/microL) resulted in attenuation of the damage to monolayer integrity by up to 52%. Protection was enhanced (up to 95%) by the copresence of human  mucin glycoproteins. Similar effects were observed when rat intestinal trefoil factor or human spasmolysin, another human trefoil peptide, were added alone or in the presence of human mucin glycoproteins. Conversely, mucin glycoproteins isolated from the rat  or stomach facilitated protection when added with human spasmolysin or human intestinal trefoil factor.Trefoil peptides and mucin glycoproteins protect gastrointestinal mucosa from a variety of insults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21563175>Interactive effects of fatty  and butyrate-induced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ loading and apoptosis in colonocytes.</a></h1><p>The combination of fish oil-derived docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (22:6; omega 3 [n-3]) and butyrate (4:0), a fiber fermentation product, synergized to enhance colonocyte apoptosis by inducing a p53-independent, oxidation sensitive, mitochondrial Ca(2+) -dependent (intrinsic) pathway.In this study, the authors probed the specificity of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  induction of Ca(2+) -dependent proapoptotic events in immortalized young adult mouse colonocytes and determined whether combinations of polyunsaturated fatty  and butyrate could trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, thereby promoting mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload. Cultures were treated with 0 μM to 50 μM of DHA (22:6; n-3), EPA (20:5; n-3), arachidoinic  (AA) (20:4; n-6), linoleic  (18:2; n-6), or  (OA) (18:1; n-9) for a total of 72 hours with or without RU-360 (to inhibit the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter) for 30 minutes before cotreatment with butyrate (0 mM or 5 mM).Combined DHA and butyrate maximally induced apoptosis and mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. By comparison, EPA, a precursor to DHA, was minimally effective. Similarly, AA and OA in combination with butyrate had no effect on mitochondrial Ca(2+) or apoptosis compared with butyrate alone. DHA with or without butyrate cotreatment minimally altered the ER stress-regulated genes DNA damage-inducible transcript 3, the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α.The current data indicated that butyrate and DHA, but not EPA, worked in a coordinated fashion to trigger an ER-independent, Ca(2+) -dependent, intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway in colonocytes.Copyright © 2011 American  Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11905662>Olive-oil consumption and health: the possible role of antioxidants.</a></h1><p>In the Mediterranean basin, olive oil, along with fruits, vegetables, and fish, is an important constituent of the diet, and is considered a major factor in preserving a healthy and relatively disease-free population. Epidemiological data show that the Mediterranean diet has significant protective effects against  and coronary heart disease. We present evidence that it is the unique profile of the phenolic fraction, along with high intakes of squalene and the monounsaturated fatty , , which confer its health-promoting properties. The major phenolic compounds identified and quantified in olive oil belong to three different classes: simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol); secoiridoids (oleuropein, the aglycone of ligstroside, and their respective decarboxylated dialdehyde derivatives); and the lignans [(+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and pinoresinol]. All three classes have potent antioxidant properties. High consumption of extra-virgin olive oils, which are particularly rich in these phenolic antioxidants (as well as squalene and ), should afford considerable protection against  (, breast, skin), coronary heart disease, and ageing by inhibiting oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9118028>Lack of promotion of  carcinogenesis by high- safflower oil.</a></h1><p>The nonpromoting effect of olive oil on  carcinogenesis has been attributed to its high  content, whereas a positive association of monounsaturated fat in beef tallow with  tumors has been reported. The effect of constituents other than fatty acids could not be neglected in these experiments. In order to minimize the effects of minor constituents in the oils, the authors compared conventional safflower oil with oil from a mutant strain of safflower that is rich in .ICR mice were treated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 20 mg/kg body weight every week for 12 weeks) and then were fed either a high-fat diet (23.5% by weight), containing safflower oil (HF-LA) or high- safflower oil (HF-OA), or a low-fat diet (5% by weight), containing safflower oil (LF-LA) or high- safflower oil (LF-OA). The test diets were continued until termination of the experiment at 30 weeks after the first administration of DMH. Fatty  composition of  phospholipids was determined by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Tumor multiplicity in animals fed the HF-OA diet was indistinguishable from that in animals fed LF-LA or LF-OA. In contrast, animals fed the HF-LA diet had a significantly higher incidence of  tumors (mostly adenocarcinomas) than the other groups. Fatty  profiles of  phospholipids reflected those of the diet. Animals fed a HF-LA diet showed a marked decrease of nervonic  (C24:1, n-9) in the  sphingomyelin.These data indicate that  does not enhance DMH-induced  carcinogenesis in mice, even when they are fed a high-fat diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27227540>Serum Fatty Acids Are Correlated with Inflammatory Cytokines in Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with increased dietary intake of fat and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty  levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines.Dietary histories, serum, and  tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography.UC subjects had increased total fat and  (OA) intake, but decreased arachidonic  (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty  (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic , OA, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosapentaenoic  (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic  therapy blunted these associations.In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines. We propose that fatty acids may affect cytokine production and thus be immunomodulatory in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377058>Erythrocyte membrane fatty  composition in  patients.</a></h1><p>Essential fatty acids (EFA) have an important role in complex metabolic reactions.

To date, in addition to human and bovine α-LA, the ability to form such anti-tumor complexes with OA was described for goat and camel α-LA. Although the mechanisms of the anticancer activity of human and bovine α-LA are already well-studied, little is currently known about the anticancer action of this camel protein. The goal of this study was to fill this gap and to analyze the anticancer and pro-apoptotic activities of camel α-LA in its free form (α-cLA) and as an OA-containing complex (OA-α-cLA) using four human  cell lines, including Caco-2  cells, PC-3 prostate  cells, HepG-2 hepatoma cells, and MCF-7 breast  cells as targets. The anti-tumor activities of OA-α-cLA and α-cLA were analyzed using MTT test, annexin/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, nuclear staining, and tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition methods. We show here that the OA-α-cLA complex does not affect normal cells but has noticeable anti- activity, especially against MCF-7 cells, thus boosting the anticancer activity of α-cLA and improving the selectivity of OA. The OA-α-cLA complex mediated  cell death via selective induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at lower IC than that of free α-cLA by more than two folds. However, OA induced apoptosis at higher extent than OA-α-cLA and α-cLA. OA also caused unselective apoptosis-dependent cell death in both normal and  cells to a similar degree. The apoptosis and cell-cycle arresting effect of OA-α-cLA may be attributed to the TK inhibition activity of OA. Therefore, OA-α-cLA serves as efficient anticancer complex with two functional components, α-cLA and OA, possessing different activities. This study declared the effectiveness of OA-α-cLA complex as a promising entity with anticancer activity, and these formulated OA-camel protein complexes constitute an auspicious approach for  remedy, particularly for breast .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849534>Genistein and daidzein induce apoptosis of  cells by inhibiting the accumulation of lipid droplets.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of genistein (GEN) and daidzein (DAI) in inducing apoptosis of  cells by inhibition of lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation.HT-29 cells were used and treated by GEN or DAI in this paper. LDs accumulation was induced and inhibited by  (OA) and C75, respectively. The expression changes of LDs-related markers were confirmed by semiquantitative real time-PCR (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining.GEN and DAI effectively reduced the LDs accumulation and downregulated the expression of Perilipin-1, ADRP and Tip-47 family proteins and vimentin levels. GEN and DAI significantly induced the mRNA expression of PPAR-γ, Fas, FABP, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT3), and microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP), and reduced the mRNA expression of UCP2. Furthermore, the results showed a decrease of PI3K expression by GEN and DAI when compared with OA treatment, and both GEN and DAI can increase the expression of FOXO3a and caspase-8 significantly when these proteins were decreased by OA treatment. GEN is more effective than DAI in inducing cell apoptosis.Our results demonstrated that GEN and DAI inhibit the accumulation of LDs by regulating LDs-related factors and lead to a final apoptosis of  cells.

The edible olive fruit is also used for its oil, gained by the process of pressing, a nutrient with proven beneficial effects. Virgin olive oil is the natural juice of the olive fruit, which plays a major role in the healthy Mediterranean diet. The source of its health effects are the biophenols and squalenes (oleocanthal, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein) it contains. They provide an exceptional antioxidative activity, removing harmful compounds from the body. Oxidants are essential in the genesis of many diseases and conditions, such as cardiovascular disorders, , osteoporosis, Alzheimer disease, and premenstrual syndrome. , an unsaturated fatty , has demonstrated a significant effect in the prevention of malignant diseases such as  and breast . Biophenols from olive oil successfully suppress the synthesis of LDL, a protein that is crucial in the development of cardiovascular disease, by reducing blood pressure and the development of atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, there is strong evidence of the antimicrobic effect of the biphenols from olive oil that successfully destroy colonies of microorganisms which may cause respiratory tract, intestinal, and genital tract infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3349456>Structural requirements for stimulation of  cell proliferation by oxidized fatty acids.</a></h1><p>The primary autoxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to stimulate DNA synthesis and induce ornithine decarboxylase activity in  mucosa. In the present study we have determined the structural features of the oxidized fatty acids necessary for the stimulation of these two components of mitogenesis. Compounds were instilled intrarectally in either aqueous or mineral oil vehicles and 3 h later (ornithine decarboxylase activity) or 12 h later (tritiated thymidine incorporation), the animals were killed and the  mucosa harvested for measurement of the two parameters of cell proliferation. Hydroperoxy and hydroxy fatty acids derived from oleate and stearate were studied. Ricinoleic  and the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone derived from  were also investigated. The minimal requirement for stimulation of cell proliferation is the presence of an oxidized functionally adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond. All active compounds studied were roughly equipotent, which suggests a common mediator may be involved. These results imply that, in addition to biliary steroids, the autoxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids may play a role in the enhancement of tumorigenesis by high levels of dietary fat. Furthermore, the data suggest a possible mechanism of action for the active compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29345287>Intermittent calorie restriction enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the alteration of energy metabolism in a mouse tumor model.</a></h1><p>The effect of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) on  is controversial. In this study, we examined the effects of ICR and food content in syngeneic BALB/c mice injected with CT26 mouse  cells. Mice were subjected to 24-h fasting once a week for 4 weeks, and then provided with a control, high-calorie, or trans fatty -rich diet. While ICR resulted in increases in tumor weights, metastasis and in the number of  stem cells (CSCs) in the tumors or blood of mice fed the control and high-fat diets, it had no effect on body weight after 4 weeks. In particular, we detected increases in the numbers of CSCs in the tumor or blood on the day after starvation, when food overconsumption was detected. Conversely, continuous calorie restriction had no effect on tumor weight, metastasis, or the number of CSCs in tumors or blood. In the post-starvation period, energy metabolism in the tumor was altered from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis/lactate fermentation, with the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hyperglycemia at the post-starvation period induced the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, hypoxia-induced factor-1α and Nanog, as well as the phosphorylation of Stat3. Taken together, these findings suggest that ICR induces an increase in the number of CSCs and enhances EMT by promoting the Warburg/Crabtree effect following post-fasting food overconsumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8143994>Biochemical epidemiology of : effect of types of dietary fiber on  diacylglycerols in women.</a></h1><p>In view of the potential significance of dietary fat and fiber in  and the possible indirect involvement of diacylglycerols (DAGs) in the pathogenesis of , the effect of types of dietary fiber on fecal DAG in premenopausal women was investigated.Forty-eight women consuming a typical western diet provided two 24-hour stool specimens and two sets of preintervention 4-day food records.

Stool samples collected during the two periods were analyzed for total fat and DAG fatty acids.All sources of dietary fiber increased the amount of fecal fat excreted. Dietary wheat bran decreased the concentrations of total DAG and DAG containing lauric , myristic , palmitic , stearic , and linoleic , whereas oat bran increased the DAG composed of  and linoleic  compared with the control diet. Corn bran decreased the DAG containing stearic .These results show that the modifying effect of dietary fiber on DAG depends on the type of fiber consumed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26286349>In vitro fermentation of nuts results in the formation of butyrate and c9,t11 conjugated linoleic  as chemopreventive metabolites.</a></h1><p>The consumption of foods rich in dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as nuts can contribute to a healthy diet.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of vaccenic  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty  methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA deoxycholic-/iso-deoxycholic  (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal microbiota to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and lipid peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding  development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092978>Differential stress reaction of human  cells to -stabilized and unstabilized ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>Therapeutic engineered nanoparticles (NPs), including ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) NPs, may accumulate in the lower digestive tract following ingestion or injection.

First the biophysical characteristics of NS-USPIO NPs and OA-USPIO NPs in water, in cell culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, and in cell culture medium preconditioned by HT29 and CaCo₂ cells were determined. Then, stress responses of the cells were evaluated following exposure to NS-USPIO NPs, OA-USPIO NPs, and free OA. No modification of the cytoskeletal actin network was observed. Cell response to stress, including markers of apoptosis and DNA repair, oxidative stress and degradative/autophagic stress, induction of heat shock protein, or lipid metabolism was determined in cells exposed to the two NPs. Induction of an autophagic response was observed in the two cell lines for both NPs but not free OA, while the other stress responses were cell- and NP-specific. The formation of lipid vacuoles/droplets was demonstrated in HT29 and CaCo₂ cells exposed to OA-USPIO NPs but not to NS-USPIO NPs, and to a much lower level in cells exposed to equimolar concentrations of free OA. Therefore, the induction of lipid vacuoles in  cells exposed to OA utilized as a stabilizer for USPIO NPs is higly amplified compared to free OA, and is not observed in the absence of this lipid in NS-USPIO NPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2844941>Modification of CaCo-2 cell membrane fatty  composition by eicosapentaenoic  and palmitic : effect on cholesterol metabolism.</a></h1><p>Membrane fatty  composition of CaCo-2 cells was modified by incubating the cells for 8 days in medium containing 100 microM eicosapentaenoic  or palmitic .

Cells incubated with eicosapentaenoic  had significant changes in membrane fatty  composition with an accumulation of 20:5 and 22:5 and a reduction in monoenoic fatty acids compared to cells grown in palmitic . Intracellular cholesteryl esters could not be detected in CaCo-2 cells grown in the presence of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty . In contrast, cells incubated with the saturated fatty  contained 2 micrograms/mg protein of cholesteryl esters. Cells grown in eicosapentaenoic , however, accumulated significantly more triglycerides compared to cells modified with palmitic . The rate of  incorporation into triglycerides was significantly increased in cells incubated with eicosapentaenoic . CaCo-2 cells modified by eicosapentaenoic  had lower rates of HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT activities compared to cells modified with palmitic . The incorporation of the two fatty acids into cellular lipids also differed. Palmitic  was predominantly incorporated into cellular triglycerides, whereas eicosapentaenoic  was preferentially incorporated into phospholipids with 60% of it in the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction. The data indicate that membrane fatty  composition is significantly altered by growing CaCo-2 cells in eicosapentaenoic .

Previously, we have shown that RXR-α is downregulated in human and rodent  tumors, suggesting a potential target for  prevention (http://www..org//ColonandRectumCancer/DetailedGuide/colorectal--key-statistics). Experiments were designed to assess the chemopreventive efficacy of the selective RXR agonist bexarotene for the suppression of intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice. Before the efficacy studies, we determined that the maximal tolerated dose in C57BL/6J mice was less than 400 ppm. For the efficacy study, 6-week-old male and female C57BL/6J-Apc(Min/+) mice (nine mice per group) were fed diets containing 0, 30, and 60 ppm of bexarotene or 200 ppm of bexarotene for 80 days before intestinal tumors were evaluated. Dietary administration of 30 and 60 ppm of bexarotene suppressed the intestinal polyp formation by 38% (P < .015) and 60% (P < .0001) in males, respectively, and by 8.5% and 37% (P < .007) in females, respectively. Also, significant inhibition (50%-100%) of  tumor formation was observed in both male and female mice with bexarotene treatment.

Some groups also received sulindac in their food (80 mg/kg food) starting from the ninth week following the first DMH or vehicle administration. and linoleic  reached higher levels in plasma and liver lipids when rats were fed high concentrations of olive or soy oil, respectively. Rats fed a low or high soy oil-based diet showed no significant difference in the number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in proximal or distal  specimens. In contrast, rats fed a higher olive oil-based diet developed a significantly lower number of ACF than rats fed a low concentration of olive oil. Addition of sulindac reduced the number of ACF in rats fed the 4%, but not the 15%, soy oil diet. In contrast, the effect of sulindac was significant when combined with both the low and high concentrations of olive oil. High soy oil-based diet or DMH treatment upregulated  expression of Bcl-2, but not that of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In contrast, olive oil dose-dependently downregulated the expression of both Bcl-2 and COX-2 in  mucosa and also abrogated the upregulation of Bcl-2 by DMH. Olive oil/sulindac combinations were effective in downregulating  mucosa Bcl-2 expression (with the 4% oil diet) and COX-2 expression (with the 15% oil diet). These effects were not observed in rats fed the soy oil/sulindac combinations. Caspase-3 activity in  mucosa was unaffected by soy oil or soy oil/sulindac combinations. The addition of olive oil, on the other hand, significantly enhanced  caspase-3 activity.Diets containing high levels of olive oil exert a significant protective effect from tumor development that is additive with the inhibitory effect of sulindac. These inhibitory effects are mediated by regulating the expression and activity of key proteins involved in prostaglandin-biosynthesis and apoptosis-induction pathways. It may be concluded that appropriate dietary-pharmacological combination can improve anti-tumor efficacy over either dietary or pharmacological intervention alone.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2710659>Influence of dietary cis and trans fats on DMH-induced  tumors, steroid excretion, and eicosanoid production in rats prone to .</a></h1><p>The effect of geometrical isomerism of dietary fats on  tumorigenesis was studied in male and female rats of a strain prone to  (Wistar-Furth-Osaka). The rats were fed purified diets containing either partially hydrogenated corn oil (trans fat) or high- safflower (cis fat) at the 5% level for one week and received a single oral dose of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine.

After about 60 weeks, neither fat-type nor sex-dependent differences in the incidence of  and small intestinal tumors was observed. The fecal excretion of neutral but not acidic steroids was higher in male rats fed the trans fat than in those fed the cis fat, but the composition remained almost unchanged. Aortic production of prostacyclin and the plasma concentration of thromboxane B2 were not influenced by dietary fats, although these were significantly higher in females, irregardless of the fat source.

Caco-2 cells absorbed  bound to BSA from both the apical and basolateral surfaces at the same rate.  in micellar solution was absorbed more efficiently than  bound to BSA. Regardless of its site or mode of presentation, the majority of the incorporated  was found in triglycerides. Only a small fraction was subjected to beta-oxidation or esterification into phospholipids. Most of the incorporated  was still retained intracellularly at 24 h. The polarity of triglyceride secretion was influenced by the experimental conditions. Triglyceride secretion was not significantly polarized when -BSA was presented apically. However, the ratio of basolateral to apical secretion at 24 h was 9:1 for -BSA presented basolaterally. For  in taurocholate micelles there was a trend toward polarity of secretion to the apical media (apical to basolateral ratio = 2:1). The inclusion of 2-monoacylglycerol in -taurocholate micelles did not augment triglyceride synthesis or secretion. These differences indicate that compartmentation of FA metabolism in Caco-2 cells is influenced by the site of FA presentation. Northern and Western blot hybridization studies indicated that the liver fatty -binding protein but not the intestinal fatty -binding protein gene is expressed in these cells. The absence of this latter 15 kDa protein indicates that it is not required by Caco-2 cells for the synthesis of triglycerides or for the polarized export of triglyceride. These studies indicate that the Caco-2 cell line will be a useful model system for studying the polarization of FA trafficking/metabolism in enterocytes and defining the role of intracellular fatty  binding proteins in these processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30063922>Deletion of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase-1 From the Intestinal Epithelium Promotes Inflammation and Tumorigenesis, Reversed by Dietary Oleate.</a></h1><p>The enzyme stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD or SCD1) produces monounsaturated fatty acids by introducing double bonds into saturated bonds between carbons 9 and 10, with  as the main product. SCD1 is present in the intestinal epithelium, and fatty acids regulate cell proliferation, so we investigated the effects of SCD1-induced production of  in enterocytes in mice.We generated mice with disruption of Scd1 selectively in the intestinal epithelium (iScd1 mice) on a C57BL/6 background; iScd1 mice were used as controls. We also generated iScd1Apc mice and studied  susceptibility. Mice were fed a chow, -deficient, or -rich diet. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry, and tumors were quantified and measured.Compared with control mice, the ileal mucosa of iScd1 mice had a lower proportion of palmitoleic (C16:1 n-7) and  acids (C18:1 n-9), with accumulation of stearic  (C18:0); this resulted a reduction of the Δ9 desaturation ratio between monounsaturated (C16:1 n-7 and C18:1 n-9) and saturated (C16:0 and C18:0) fatty acids. Ileal tissues from iScd1 mice had increased expression of markers of inflammation activation and crypt proliferative genes compared with control mice. The iScd1Apc mice developed more and larger tumors than iScd1Apc mice. iScd1Apc mice fed the -rich diet had reduced intestinal inflammation and significantly lower tumor burden compared with mice fed a chow diet.In studies of mice, we found intestinal SCD1 to be required for synthesis of oleate in the enterocytes and maintenance of fatty  homeostasis.

In this study, we focused on plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), and chemically synthesized novel plumbagins conjugated with C2:0 to C22:6 fatty acids (5-O-acyl plumbagins). These chemically modified plumbagins enhanced mammalian pol inhibition and their cytotoxic activity. Plumbagin conjugated with chains consisting of more than C18-unsaturated fatty acids strongly inhibited the activities of calf pol α and human pol γ. Plumbagin conjugated with  (C18:1-acyl plumbagin) showed the strongest suppression of human  carcinoma (HCT116) cell proliferation among the ten synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins. The inhibitory activity on pol α, a DNA replicative pol, by these compounds showed high correlation with their  cell proliferation suppressive activity. C18:1-Acyl plumbagin selectively inhibited the activities of mammalian pol species, but did not influence the activities of other pols and DNA metabolic enzymes tested. This compound inhibited the proliferation of various human  cell lines, and was the cytotoxic inhibitor showing strongest inhibition towards HT-29  cells (LD50 = 2.9 µM) among the nine cell lines tested. In an in vivo anti-tumor assay conducted on nude mice bearing solid tumors of HT-29 cells, C18:1-acyl plumbagin was shown to be a promising tumor suppressor. These data indicate that novel 5-O-acyl plumbagins act as anti- agents based on mammalian DNA replicative pol α inhibition. Moreover, the results suggest that acylation of plumbagin is an effective chemical modification to improve the anti- activity of vitamin K3 derivatives, such as plumbagin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16771072>Dietary lipids and .</a></h1><p> is one of the main causes of death in Western countries.

On the contrary, a negative effect has been reported for polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6 serie and for saturated fatty acids. Nutrition constitutes an important aspect of the life of  patients. Currently, nutritional formulas are being designed with supplements of polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids and other components such as arginine, RNA, lysine, etc., with the aim of ameliorating the effects of this pathology.

GF5 appears to be the best serum-free medium as it supported continuous growth of all of the  tumor cell lines. GF5 also supported growth of five of the seven human  and stomach tumor xenografts as primary tissue cultures. However, the stomach xenograft cells had a very slow growth rate as compared to the  xenograft cells in the medium. Cells grown in GF5 retained their tumorigenicity in athymic (nude) mice and characteristic cellular morphology.

Examples of this class of compounds are the fecal diglycerides (DGs)(E. Friedman et al.,  Res., 49: 544-548, 1989), which may act as endogenous tumor promoters. At the concentration found in vivo, fecal DGs composed of , myristic, and palmitic fatty acids induced mitogenesis of all classes of benign tumor cells and of half of the resected carcinomas tested in primary culture, but induced no detectable mitogenesis of normal colonocytes.  tumor cells also exhibit selective responses to these endogenous modulators as measured by another biological parameter, secretion of urokinase from carcinomas than from normal colonocytes. Fecal DGs also induced a 13-fold increase in urokinase mRNA synthesis in  carcinoma cells and induced secretion of active urokinase from each of five resected carcinomas.  carcinomas, at both the primary site and metastatic to the liver, secreted the Mr 55,000 form of urokinase constitutively and secreted the same form upon treatment with fecal DGs. An increase in the steady-state level of urokinase secretion by saturated-chain DGs exhibited a strong dependency on the chain length of the fatty  residues, those of 14 and 16 carbons having the greatest activity. Thus, fecal DGs composed of , myristic, and palmitic  residues induce two biological activities selectively in  tumor cells, each of which would enhance tumor development. Selective mitogenesis would increase adenoma and carcinoma cell number relative to normal colonocyte number, and induction of the proteolytic enzyme urokinase would aid local invasion of the carcinoma within the bowel wall.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19969066>Estrogen down-regulates uncoupling proteins and increases oxidative stress in breast .</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress has been postulated as one of the mechanisms underlying the estrogen carcinogenic effect in breast . Estrogens are known to increase mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) by an unknown mechanism. Given that uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are key regulators of mitochondrial energy efficiency and ROS production, our aim was to check the presence and activity of UCPs in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast  cells and tumors, as well as their relation to oxidative stress. Estrogen (1 nM) induced higher oxidative stress in the ER-positive MCF-7 cell line, showing increased mitochondrial membrane potential, H(2)O(2) levels, and DNA and protein damage compared to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. All isoforms of uncoupling proteins were highly expressed in ER-positive breast  cells and tumors compared to negative ones. ROS production in mitochondria isolated from MCF-7 was increased by inhibition of UCPs with GDP, but not in mitochondria from MDA-MB-231. Estrogen treatment decreased uncoupling protein and catalase levels in MCF-7 and decreased GDP-dependent ROS production in isolated mitochondria. On the whole, these results suggest that estrogens, through an ER-dependent mechanism, may increase mitochondrial ROS production by repressing uncoupling proteins, which offers a new perspective on the understanding of why estrogens are a risk factor for breast .Copyright  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Incidences of FRCs, except for steeply increasing , have remained low in Japan. Similarly, Mediterranean people enjoy relatively low risks of FRCs compared with American people. The low risks of FRCs in Japanese may be explained by limited intake of fats and oils as a whole, and a low ratio of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) versus n-3 PUFAs through consumption of the latter from marine foods. They also frequently consume vegetables and fruit, and dietary fiber. Mediterranean people moderately consume fats and oils from a large amount of olive oil, containing not only  but also polyphenols (including flavonoids), &mgr;-tocopherol and carotenoids (including &mgr;-carotene), which are antioxidants and anti-carcinogenic as in red wine, vegetables (including herbs) and fruit. The diet also features medium intake of fish and shellfish along with cereals/pasta/bread. From the standpoint of intake of total fat, the low risks of FRCs in Japanese seem "plausible," while the low risks in Mediterranean people may be termed "paradoxical." In summary, limited consumption of fats and oils, moderate intakes of marine foods, and vegetables and fruit, in line with a modest intake of energy may be advocated for promoting health, prolonging life and prevention of lifestyle-related diseases including FRCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18069902>Active components and clinical applications of olive oil.</a></h1><p>The olive tree, Olea europaea, is native to the Mediterranean basin and parts of Asia Minor.

Since FASE synthesizes only saturated fatty acids, we hypothesized that  cells have a greater proportion of long-chain saturated fatty acids. We studied and found an unequivocal increase in saturated C18 fatty  (stearic ) in  adenocarcinoma compared to adjacent normal  mucosa. The increase is even more striking when measured as a ratio of stearic  to the unsaturated C18 fatty acids ( and linoleic ). This change in fatty  composition of the  cells should significantly alter their physical and biological properties. The increase in relative proportion of saturated fatty acids should make the  cells more susceptible to cryodamage and measurement of fatty  composition of  cells may help individualize the temperature for cryotherapy. Also, the lipid alterations may affect the structure and functions of lipid rafts, which may enable the  cells to affect signaling mechanisms such as those involved in cell growth and apoptosis. Dietary or therapeutic interventions targeting lipid rafts may thus be an option for  treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7656228>Dietary lipid and iron modify normal  mucosa without affecting phospholipase A2 activity.</a></h1><p>Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) functions as the rate-limiting step in arachidonic  metabolism and in the removal of damaged or peroxidized membrane lipids. It is elevated in some human tumors and may be involved with mechanisms of tumor promotion. In vitro systems have shown PLA2 activity to be altered by variations in fatty  and antioxidant components. This study encompassed two objectives. First, PLA2, activity in  tumors produced using azoxymethane (AOM) in Fischer-344 rats was examined. Secondly, this study tested the effect of iron supplementation as a potential pro-oxidant in diets of varied fatty  composition on PLA2 activity. Diets included 35 or 140 mg/kg or iron in AIN-76A based diets high in corn oil, menhaden oil, or beef tallow. Results for the first objective showed PLA2 activity to be significantly higher in  tumors than in normal mucosa with the increase due primarily to an increase in activity within a particulate subcellular fraction. In the second objective, fatty  composition of  mucosa was altered by both dietary fat and iron. Animals fed beef tallow had the highest level of  and corn oil-fed animals had the highest level of linoleic . Animals fed menhaden oil had the lowest level of arachidonic  and highest level of alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids. Iron supplementation in diets high in corn oil resulted in decreased membrane composition of palmitoleic and delta-linolenic . In spite of these changes in membrane composition, there were no changes in PLA2 activity. These results show that PLA2 activity is increased in AOM-induced tumors but that diet alone does not influence PLA2 activity in this model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6595440>Large intestinal carcinogenesis.

At 4 mM, trienes are more potent activators as compared to 18:2 and 18:1. The number of double bonds and the configuration around the double bond were found to be important factors in activation of the enzyme.
