In Exp. 1, 9 barrows (initial BW: 13.08 ± 1.98 kg) were prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a triplicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 3 diets and 3 periods. A nitrogen-free diet and 2 diets that contained corn starch and SPC or SBM as the sole source of CP and AA were formulated. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. The SID for , , , Pro, and Tyr was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC than in SBM, but for CP and all other AA, no difference between SPC and SBM was observed. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (initial BW: 13.94 ± 1.34 kg) were housed individually in metabolism crates and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. A corn-based diet (96.9% corn) and 2 diets that contained corn and SPC or corn and SBM were formulated. Each diet was fed to 8 pigs. Feces and urine samples were collected using the marker to marker method with 5-d adaptation and 5-d collection periods. The DE and ME in SPC and SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results indicated that the ATTD of GE was lower ( < 0.05) in SBM than in corn and the DE and ME in SPC were greater ( < 0.01) than in corn and SBM. In Exp. 3, 40 barrows (initial BW: 14.12 ± 2.08 kg) were placed in metabolism crates and allotted to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design with 10 pigs per diet. Two diets were based on SPC or SBM as the sole source of P. Two additional diets were formulated by adding microbial phytase to diets that were otherwise similar to the 2 initial diets. Feces were collected for 5 d after a 5-d adaptation period and values for ATTD and STTD of P were calculated. No differences were observed in ATTD and STTD of P between SPC and SBM, but the ATTD and STTD of P of both SPC and SBM were greater ( < 0.01) if microbial phytase was added to the diets. In conclusion, the concentrations of DE and ME are greater in SPC than in SBM, but the SID of most AA and the STTD of P are not different between SPC and SBM.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h2><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, , , Lys, , Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1282482>Structural characterization of tachykinins (neuropeptide gamma, neurokinin A, and substance P) from a reptile, Alligator mississipiensis.</a></h2><p>An extract of the whole brain of the alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) contained very high concentrations of substance P-like immunoreactivity (405 pmol/g wet tissue) and neurokinin A-like immunoreactivity (514 pmol/g), as measured with antisera raised against the mammalian peptides.

At pH 3.0 cleavage of the bovine protein occurred principally at three sites:  (88-89),  (42-43), and -Asp (36-37). Minor cleavages occurred at -Ser (110-111), Phe-Ser (113-114), and -Phe (152-153). A study of the time course of the hydrolysis showed that the reaction was biphasic; nearly all of the protein was cleaved at  (88-89) before significant cleavages at other sites occurred. At pH 6.0 cleavage of the bovine protein occurred almost exclusively at a single site, the  bond at position 88-89, resulting in bisection of the protein. Treatment of the guinea pig protein with pepsin under the same conditions resulted in the production of peptides which were identical with those of the bovine protein in chromatographic and electrophoretic properties and in N-terminal and C-terminal residues but which differed slightly in amino acid composition.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245409>Further characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus paracasei HL32.</a></h2><p>Purification, identification and partial characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus paracasei HL32. It has been shown to have activity against Porphyromonas sp.The purification of bacteriocin consisting of gel exclusion followed by anion exchange chromatography produced a single band upon an electrophoresis gel with a molecular weight corresponding to 56 kDa. The isolated protein contained 171 amino acids and the first 151 were sequenced. The bacteriocin contained a high percentage of cationic amino acids near the N-terminus, hydrophobic amino acids in the central region (, , Val, , Trp and Gly) and hydrophilic residues (Ser, Asn and Gln) at the C-terminus. This structure did not match with that of previously reported bacteriocins. The antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin was determined against some pathogens and normal  (P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, T. forsythensis, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis) found in saliva and crevicular fluid. The bacteriocin was found to inhibit P. gingivalis at the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 0.14 mmol l(-1), but was found not to inhibit the other oral micro-organisms. The bacteriocin was found from transmission electron microscopy studies to cause pore formation in the cytoplasmic membranes of P. gingivalis at the pole and induce potassium efflux. Bacteriocin concentrations of two to four times of MBC were shown to induce haemolysis. The bacteriocin was heat-stable, surviving at 110 degrees C under pressure and possessed activity over a pH range of 6.8-8.5. Only a small reduction of activity was found to occur after incubation in biological fluids (saliva and crevicular fluid).A novel bacteriocin has been identified that has selective activity against Porphyromonas sp. associated with periodontal disease.The findings of this work gained the knowledge of specific antibacterial activity of bacteriocin against Porphyromonas gingivalis.</p><p>Keyword:['microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2039477>Structure and receptor-binding activity of insulin from a holostean fish, the bowfin (Amia calva).</a></h2><p>The holostean fishes are the extant representatives of the primitive ray-finned fishes from which the present-day teleosts may have evolved. The primary structure of insulin from a holostean fish, the bowfin (Amia calva), was established as: A-chain: Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys--Lys-Pro-Cys-Thr--Tyr-Glu-Met-Glu- Lys-Tyr-Cys-Asn B-chain: Ala-Ala-Ser-Gln-His--Cys-Gly-Ser-His--Val-Glu-Ala--Phe-- Val-Cys-Gly-Glu-Ser-Gly--Tyr-Asn-Pro-Asn-Lys-Ser This amino acid sequence contains several substitutions (methionine at A16, phenylalanine at B16 and serine at B22) at sites that have been strongly conserved in other vertebrate species and that may be expected to influence biological activity.

All mutants comprised changes in beta-sheet residues, with sidechains at positions 5 (), 7 (), 52 () and 54 (Val) forming the beta-sheet side of the sheet-helix core interface. A solvent exposed position -6 was chosen as a control. Randomization of bases at codon positions 1 and 3 with thymine at position 2 introduces five possible hydrophobic amino acids, namely , Val, , , and Met. The distribution of encoded amino acids at all five positions is approximately as expected theoretically and indicates that no major bias was introduced towards particular residues. The overall structural integrity of several mutants, as assessed by NMR, ranges from very close to wild type to fully unfolded. Interestingly, the stability of the mutants is not strictly correlated with the number of changes or residue volume.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21974986>Design and development of a peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist for cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, a fat tissue-derived adipokine, exhibits beneficial effects against insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions, and cancer. Circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and this feature correlates with increased risk of developing several metabolic, immunological and neoplastic diseases. Thus, pharmacological replacement of adiponectin might prove clinically beneficial, especially for the obese patient population. At present, adiponectin-based therapeutics are not available, partly due to yet unclear structure/function relationships of the cytokine and difficulties in converting the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug.We aimed to generate adiponectin-based short peptide that can mimic adiponectin action and be suitable for preclinical and clinical development as a cancer therapeutic. Using a panel of 66 overlapping 10 amino acid-long peptides covering the entire adiponectin globular domain (residues 105-254), we identified the 149-166 region as the adiponectin active site. Three-dimensional modeling of the active site and functional screening of additional 330 peptide analogs covering this region resulted in the development of a lead peptidomimetic, ADP 355 (H-DAsn--Pro-Nva--Tyr-DSer--Ala-DSer-NH2). In several adiponectin receptor-positive cancer cell lines, ADP 355 restricted proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at 100 nM-10 μM concentrations (exceeding the effects of 50 ng/mL globular adiponectin). Furthermore, ADP 355 modulated several key signaling pathways (AMPK, Akt, STAT3, ERK1/2) in an adiponectin-like manner. siRNA knockdown experiments suggested that ADP 355 effects can be transmitted through both adiponectin receptors, with a greater contribution of AdipoR1. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of 1 mg/kg/day ADP 355 for 28 days suppressed the growth of orthotopic human breast cancer xenografts by ~31%. The peptide displayed excellent stability (at least 30 min) in mouse blood or serum and did not induce gross toxic effects at 5-50 mg/kg bolus doses in normal CBA/J mice.ADP 355 is a first-in-class adiponectin receptor agonist. Its biological activity, superior stability in biological fluids as well as acceptable toxicity profile indicate that the peptidomimetic represents a true lead compound for pharmaceutical development to replace low adiponectin levels in cancer and other malignancies.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436344>The synthesis and anticancer activity of selected diketopiperazines.</a></h2><p>Six selected diketopiperazines, cyclo(Gly-Val), cyclo(Gly-D-Val), cyclo(Gly-), cyclo(Gly-), cyclo(-Cys) and cyclo(Tyr-Cys), were synthesized via various synthetic routes.

The results showed that QIGLF could be absorbed intact through Caco-2 cell monolayers with a P value of (9.11 ± 0.19) × 10 cm/s (transport kinetic parameters: K, 32.37 ± 12.59 mM; V, 1.23 ± 0.49 μM/min cm). The transport was not significantly decreased by sodium azide and Gly-Pro, an ATP synthesis inhibitor and a peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) substrate, respectively, suggesting that transport of QIGLF was not energy-dependent and carrier-mediated. In addition, wortmannin, a transcytosis inhibitor, had little effect on the transport, suggesting that endocytosis was not involved in the transport of QIGLF. However, the transport of QIGLF was increased significantly in the presence of cytochalasin D, a   disruptor, suggesting that paracellular transport via  junctions was the major transport mechanism for intact QIGLF across Caco-2 cell monolayers.

S-2 (FERM ABP-10961) using HiTrap DEAE FF column and HiTrap Q HP column chromatography with azocasein as a substrate. Cap1 has a molecular mass of 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE. It was stable up to 50°C with maximum activity at 30°C. Maximum proteolytic activity was observed at pH 5.0. Cap1 was stable in the pH range 3.0-7.0. Its enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by pepstatin A, an inhibitor of aspartic proteases, indicating that Cap1 is an aspartic protease. Cap1 hydrolyzed protein substrates, including BSA, hemoglobin, α-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein. It showed activity on synthetic substrates, such as MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(Dnp)-D-Arg-NH₂ and MOCAc-Ala-Pro-Ala-Lys--Arg--Lys(Dnp)-NH₂. Hydrolysis of the oxidized insulin B chain followed by amino acid sequencing analysis of the cleavage products revealed that 9 of its 30 peptide bonds were hydrolyzed by Cap1. This result was similar to that observed with pig pepsin A and human pepsin A. Cap1 also exhibited milk-clotting activity. We cloned the cDNA of CAP1 gene, which contained a 1254 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 417 amino acid residues. Homology search in the NCBI database revealed that the amino acid sequence of Cap1 showed less than 39% identity to other known proteins. Therefore, we proposed that Cap1 is a novel aspartic protease.Copyright © 2011 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met,  (+Tyr), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, , , Lys, Thr, and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of +Tyr uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling  supply did not result in mammary oxidation of +Tyr and either limited or no contribution of peptides to  and Tyr mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (, , Val, and Lys) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of , induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary  oxidation. Decreasing Lys supply decreased Lys U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and Thr, does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the Thr U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than energy supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for energy provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as  and energy supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11319233>Importance of transmembrane segment M3 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase for control of the gateway to the Ca2+ sites.</a></h2><p>The specific functional roles of various parts of the third transmembrane segment (M3) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase were examined by functionally characterizing a series of mutants with multiple or single substitutions of M3 residues.

They have similar specificity and therefore it is difficult to distinguish between them, as known substrates are not exclusively specific for one or the other. In this paper we present a substrate-based assay, which is highly relevant for immunological investigations because it detects both CatE and CatD in antigen-processing organelles. Therefore it could be used to study the involvement of these proteinases in protein degradation and the processing of invariant chain. An assay combining a new monospecific CatE antibody and the substrate, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(Dnp)-D-Arg-NH2[where MOCAc is (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl and Dnp is dinitrophenyl], is presented. This substrate is digested by both proteinases and therefore can be used to detect total aspartic proteinase activity in biological samples. After depletion of CatE by immunoprecipitation, the remaining activity is due to CatD, and the decrease in activity can be assigned to CatE. The activity of CatE and CatD in cytosolic, endosomal and lysosomal fractions of B cells, dendritic cells and human keratinocytes was determined. The data clearly indicate that CatE activity is mainly located in endosomal compartments, and that of CatD in lysosomal compartments. Hence this assay can also be used to characterize subcellular fractions using CatE as an endosomal marker, whereas CatD is a well-known lysosomal marker.

Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected before and 76-h after the initiation of ISS and assayed for hematology and blood chemistry. Body temperature (BT) was monitored during the course of study. Blood chemistry, hematology, and BT results indicated that LPS induced effective ISS in pigs (P < 0.05). ISS tended to reduce N retention (P = 0.09) and the N retention-to-N intake ratio (P = 0.08). Apparent total tract digestibility of dietary  and AID of N were reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for  and  was reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Strong tendencies for decreased Lys flux and N retention were observed in ISS pigs (P < 0.10). ISS increased the pool size for  but reduced the pool size for  (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ISS alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size in growing pigs. The decrease in Lys, , and  flux during ISS may be attributed to a reduction in whole-body protein synthesis or decreased catabolism of these AA. Relative to other AA, dietary Lys, , and  requirements may decrease in ISS pigs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9446726>Purification and structural characterization of insulin and glucagon from the bichir Polypterus senegalis (Actinopterygii: Polypteriformes).</a></h2><p>The Polypteriformes (bichirs and reedfish) are a family of ray-finned fishes of ancient lineage.

We have screened 120 unrelated obese patients for variants of the MC4-R gene. Four heterozygous missense variants were detected, including two polymorphisms (Val(103) and (251)) previously described in the literature. A novel heterozygous mutation (Glu(308)Lys) was detected in a 36-yr-old female patient. Compared with the wild-type receptor, cells expressing the mutated receptor showed a reduced stimulation of cAMP production and a reduction of radioactive alpha MSH binding. No segregation of the mutation with the obese phenotype could be demonstrated. A second, potentially pathogenic mutation (Ser(30)) was detected in a 31-yr-old female patient. Functional analysis of the mutated receptor showed no change in the affinity to the natural ligand alpha MSH nor limited ability to stimulate cAMP production. Sixty lean subjects were also screened, and no additional variants of the MC4-R gene were observed, except for two individuals with the Val(103) polymorphism. In conclusion, we have screened a population of Italian obese subjects for MC4-R variants, demonstrating a 1.7% prevalence of potentially pathogenic mutations.

Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (initial BW: 38.7 ± 2.75 kg) were fed four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design to give 8 replicates per diet. Diets were positive control (PC) diet, negative control (NC) diet without or with multi-enzyme at 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg. The PC diet was formulated to meet or exceed NRC (2012) nutrient recommendations for grower pigs (25 to 50 kg), except for Ca and digestible P, which were lower than NRC (2012) recommendations by 0.13 and 0.17 percentage points, respectively, due to phytase supplementation at 1,000 FTU/kg. The NC diet was formulated to be lower in NE by 75 kcal/kg and standardized ileal digestible AA content by a mean of 3%. These reductions were achieved by partial replacement of corn and soybean meal (SBM) and complete replacement of soybean oil and monocalcium phosphate in PC diet with 25% corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and 3.6% soybean hulls. Multi-enzyme at 1.0 g/kg supplied 1,900 U of xylanase, 300 U of β-glucanase, 1,300 U of cellulase, 11,500 U of amylase, 120 U of mannanase, 850 U of pectinase, 6,000 U of protease, and 700 U of invertase per kilogram of diet.

Increasing dietary multi-enzyme from 0 to 1.0 g/kg linearly increased (P < 0.05) AID of total NSP and P by 53.7% and 19.2%, respectively; ATTD of GE by 8.4% and DE and NE values by 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively; tended to linearly increase (P < 0.10) AID of GE by 8.1%. The NE values for NC diet with multi-enzyme at 1.0 g/kg tended to be greater (P < 0.10) than that for PC diet (2,337 vs. 2,222 kcal/kg of DM). In conclusion, multi-enzyme supplementation improved  and nutrient digestibilities of a corn-SBM-corn DDGS-based diet, implying that the multi-enzyme fed in the current study can be used to enhance  and nutrient utilization of low- AA diets for grower pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

Phenol red exhibits modest inhibition toward fibril formation of human Islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) and its toxicity, which is associated with type II diabetes mellitus. However, the molecular level mechanisms of interactions remain elusive. The binding of phenol red molecules to the protofibrils of an amyloidogenic fragment (NFGAIL) of hIAPP has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. The phenol red molecules were observed to bind primarily along either beta-sheet stacking or beta-strand directions. Through its three aromatic rings, the phenol red molecule preferentially interacted with the hydrophobic side chains of , , and ; and the polar sulfone and hydroxyl groups were mainly exposed in solvent. Thus, phenol red improves the solubility of the early protofibrils and represses further growth. Interestingly, there was no obvious preference toward the aromatic  residue in comparison to the hydrophobic  or  residues. The lack of binding along the hydrogen bond direction indicates that phenol red does not directly block the beta-sheet extension. Further free energy analysis suggested that a phenol red analog may potentially improve the binding affinity.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042596>Structural basis for the association of the redox-sensitive target of rapamycin FATC domain with membrane-mimetic micelles.</a></h2><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and energy state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, , and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues -2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (-2456, -2459, -2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8010867>Synthesis and immunosuppressive activity of glycine containing linear analogs of cyclolinopeptide A.</a></h2><p>We demonstrated that a linear peptide Gly----Val-Pro-Pro-Phe, the analog of a cyclic nonapeptide c-(----Val-Pro-Pro-) possesses a distinct immunosuppressive activity.

In this study, we designed and constructed highly sensitive synthetic decapeptide substrates for assays of cathepsins E and D based on the known sequence specificities of their cleavage sites. These substrates contain a highly fluorescent (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (MOCAc) moiety and a quenching 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) group. When the  bond is cleaved, the fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 328 nm and emission wavelength of 393 increases due to diminished quenching resulting from the separation of the fluorescent and quenching moieties. The first substrate, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg-Le u-Lys(Dnp)gamma-NH2, in which the Lys-Pro combination at positions P5 and P4 was designed for specific interaction with cathepsin E, is hydrolyzed equally well by cathepsins E and D (kcat/Km = 10.9 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin E and 15.6 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin D). A very acidic pH optimum o was obtained for both enzymes. The second substrate, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg-Le u-Lys(Dnp)gamma-NH2, in which the isoleucine residue at position P2 was meant to increase the specificity for cathepsin E, is also hydrolyzed equally by both enzymes (kcat/Km = 12.2 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin E and 16.3 microM(-1) x s(-1) for cathepsin D). The kcat/Km values for both substrates are greater than those for the best substrates for cathepsins E and D described so far. Unfortunately, each substrate shows little discrimination between cathepsin E and cathepsin D, suggesting that amino acids at positions far from the cleavage site are important for discrimination between the two enzymes. However, in combination with aspartic proteinase inhibitors, such as pepstatin A and Ascaris pepsin inhibitor, these substrates enable a rapid and sensitive determination of the precise levels of cathepsins E and D in crude cell extracts of various tissues and cells. Thus these substrates represent a potentially valuable tool for routine assays and for mechanistic studies on cathepsins E and D.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8546696>Characterization of an insulin from the three-toed amphiuma (Amphibia: Urodela) with an N-terminally extended A-chain and high receptor-binding affinity.</a></h2><p>Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a urodele, the three-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma tridactylum), and its primary structure established as Ala-Arg-Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His10-Asn-Thr-Cys- Ser--Asn-Gln--Glu-Asn20-Tyr-Cys-Asn for the A-chain and -Thr-Asn-Gln-Tyr--Cys-Gly-Ser-His10--Val-Glu-Ala- -Tyr--Val-Cys-Gly20-Asp-Arg-Gly--Tyr-Ser-Pro-Lys for the B-chain.

Leptin interacts with its receptor through three different binding sites: I-III. Site I is crucial for the formation of an active leptin-leptin receptor complex and in its subsequent activation. Amino acids 39-42 (-Asp--- LDFI) were shown to contribute to leptin binding site I and their mutations in alanine resulted in muteins acting as typical antagonists. We synthesized a small peptide based on the wild-type sequence of leptin binding site I (LDFI) and evaluated its efficacy in antagonizing leptin actions in breast cancer using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. The peptide LDFI abolished the leptin-induced anchorage-dependent and -independent growth as well as the migration of ERα-positive (MCF-7) and -negative (SKBR3) breast cancer cells. These results were well correlated with a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of leptin downstream effectors, as JAK2/STAT3/AKT/MAPK. Importantly, the peptide LDFI reversed the leptin-mediated up-regulation of its gene expression, as an additional mechanism able to enhance the peptide antagonistic activity. The described effects were specific for leptin signalling, since the developed peptide was not able to antagonize the other growth factors' actions on signalling activation, proliferation and migration. Finally, we showed that the LDFI pegylated peptide markedly reduced breast tumour growth in xenograft models. The unmodified peptide LDFI acting as a full leptin antagonist could become an attractive option for breast cancer treatment, especially in obese women.© 2015 The Authors.

The presence of serine at position P'(1) and arginine at P'(2) resulted in the best substrate, Abz-Ala--Lys--Ser-Arg-Gln-EDDnp, which was derived from the kallistatin reactive-centre loop sequence and quencher groups o-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) and N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine (EDDnp). Serine and arginine are also the residues at positions P'(1) and P'(2) in human kininogen, from which hK1 releases Lys-bradykinin. Several peptide analogues of Abz-Ala--Lys--Ser-Arg-Gln-EDDnp, in which the Ser and Arg residues were substituted with various other amino acids, were synthesized and tested as substrates. Most of them were hydrolysed slowly, although they showed significant binding to hK1, as demonstrated by their competitive inhibition constants (K(i)).

Abz-Lys--Pro-Arg-Gln-EDDnp, Abz-Lys-Phe-Arg-Pro-Arg-Gln-EDDnp and acetyl-Lys--Pro--Glu-NH(2) inhibited hK1 in the range 20-30 nM (letters in italics denote the D-form of the amino acid). The peptide acetyl-Lys--Pro--Glu-NH(2) was a weak inhibitor for other serine proteases, as indicated by the higher K (i) values compared with hK1, but this peptide was a potent inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein, which has a K (i) value of 8 nM. This result was surprising, since this enzyme is known to be a restricted arginyl-hydrolase. In conclusion, acetyl-Lys--Pro--Glu-NH(2) can be used as a leader compound to design specific inhibitors for hK1, plasma kallikrein, or for both at same time, if the inhibition of kinin release is the main goal.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155652>Effects of increased  and amino acid intake in late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, metabolic, and redox status of sows1.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of increased AA and  intake during late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, and metabolic and redox status of sows. A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID Lys, SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2  levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on metabolism, redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of , AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of  (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high  had higher total litter birth weights (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low , which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: Lys, Met, Thr, Val, , , , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of  increased total litter weight of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved  status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher  intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter weight and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

The experimental design was a split plot, with cow as the whole plot, treatment as the whole-plot factor and days in milk (DIM) as the subplot factor. Cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control or infusion of 1,500 g/d of glucose into the abomasum from the day of calving to 29 DIM. Cows were sampled prepartum and at 4, 15, and 29 DIM. Postpartum dry matter intake increased at a lower rate with infusion compared with the control. Arterial concentrations of all essential AA (EAA) were lower with infusion compared with the control. Net portal fluxes of His, , , Lys, Met, , Thr, Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr were lower with infusion compared with the control and the net portal fluxes of these AA showed positive correlations with dry matter intake, whereas the net portal fluxes of Asp, Glu, and Gln were unaffected by treatment. Net hepatic fluxes of EAA were not affected by treatment but increased as lactation progressed with both treatments. On a net basis, all EAA were removed by the liver prepartum and at 4 DIM, whereas Met, , and Thr were the only EAA being removed at 29 DIM. Except for Ala, AA removed by the liver might be used primarily for noncatabolic processes, as exemplified by the 16% of hepatic Gly uptake accounted for as urinary hippurate. The measured hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors (glucogenic AA, volatile fatty acids, lactate, and glycerol) accounted for 50 to 90% of the hepatic release of glucose. The hepatic urea output accounted for more than 100% of the hepatic ureagenic precursor uptake, indicating that the glucogenic precursors unaccounted for are nonnitrogen-containing compounds. In conclusion, an increased exogenous glucose supply to the small intestine did not seem to affect the amount of EAA and non-EAA available for peripheral tissues in early lactation, and the study did not indicate an AA-sparing effect of small intestinal glucose absorption. In periparturient dairy cows, hepatic catabolism of AA was not driven by the increased whole-body demand for glucose, and Ala was the only AA that contributed substantially to hepatic . In very early lactation, the supply of EAA might be of greater concern than the supply of glucogenic substrates.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8810516>Purification and characterization of an extracellular aspartate protease from Phycomyces blakesleeanus.</a></h2><p>An acid protease has been found in the culture broth of Phycomyces blakesleeanus growing under standard conditions. It has been induced up to 70-fold with several complex growth media and the enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be 40 kDa. The acid protease of Phycomyces migrated as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding to a molecular mass of 35 kDa. The glycoprotein nature for the acid protease was deduced from its binding to a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column. The carbohydrate moiety is composed of mannose and rhamnose. Its amino acid composition was determined, and its isoelectric point was estimated to be 4.2, the optimum pH was 2.5 to 3, and the optimum temperature was 70 degrees C, using hemoglobin as a substrate. The enzyme showed thermal stability between 37 and 50 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters for hemoglobin hydrolysis and thermal inactivation were calculated. With Lys-Pro--Glu-(4-N02)-Arg- as the substrate, the Km, kcat, and Vmax values were 8.78 microM, 1.25 s(-1), and 2.12 mumol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. The protease was insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, O-phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, [ethyl-enebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, and trypsin inhibitor. However, pepstatin A established a strong competitive inhibition against it, with a K(i) value of 1.33 nM.

The protease cathepsin D is one such target involved in several diseases such as tumors, degenerative processes, and vital processes of parasites causing schistosomiasis. Herein, we describe the preparation of a fused silica capillary, cathepsin D (CatD)-immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) using in a multidimensional High Performance Liquid Chromatography-based method (2D-HPLC) and zonal affinity chromatography as an alternative in the search for new ligands. The activity and kinetic parameters of CatD-IMER were evaluated by monitoring the product MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro---Phe (P-MOCAc) (K = 81.9 ± 7.49 μmol/L) generated by cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(DNP)-d-Arg-NH2 (S-MOCAc). Stability studies have indicated that CatD-IMER retained 20% of activity after 5 months, a relevant result, because proteases are susceptible to autoproteolysis in solution assays with free enzyme. In the search for inhibitors, 12 crude natural product extracts were analyzed using CatD-IMER as the target, resulting in the isolation of different classes of natural products. In addition, 26 compounds obtained from different species of plants were also screened, demonstrating the efficiency and reproducibility of the herein reported assay even in the case of complex matrices such as plant crude extracts.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

IPE and RPE cells were isolated from Long Evans rat eyes. The origin of the isolated cells was determined by pigmentation and cytokeratin labelling. The mRNA expressions of cat D and cat S in cultured IPE or RPE cells were investigated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Enzyme activities of cat D and cat S in IPE or RPE cells were measured by using specific fluorogenic substrates, MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys-(Dnp)D-Arg-NH2 and Z-Val-Val-Arg-MCA, respectively. Western blot analysis of both proteins was also performed. The cultured cells, both of IPE and RPE cells were pigmented and showed positive labelling with an anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody. The cat D activity in RPE cells was 37 times that in IPE cells. The cat S activity in RPE cells was four times that in IPE cells. On the other hand, mRNA expression levels of cat D in RPE cells were at the same level with IPE cells, cat S mRNA expression in RPE cells were 10 times that in IPE cells. These results were also correlated with the Western blot analysis. In this study, we measured the characteristic expressions of cat D and S in IPE and RPE cells for the first time to compare their lysosomal activities. IPE cells have the lysosomal activities like RPE cells, however, the function of lysosomal activity in IPE cells is beneath RPE's.

Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly--Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Thr-Pro(10)-Cys-Ser--Tyr-Gln--G lu-Asn-Tyr-Cys(20)-Asn-Glu-Thr-Glu; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val-Asn-Gln-His--Cys-Gly-Ser(10)-His--Val-Glu-Ala-- Tyr-Phe-Val-Cys(20)-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly--Tyr--Pro- Lys(30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution ( --> Phe) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> Asn) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8759334>A comparison of the positive- and negative-ion mass spectra of bio-active peptides from the dorsal secretion of the Australian red tree frog, Litoria rubella.</a></h2><p>The collision-induced tandem mass spectral data for MH+ and [M-H]- ions from six bio-active peptides from Litoria rubella are compared.

Modification of antithrombin with limiting amounts of reagent yields an average incorporation of the phosphopyridoxyl label into 1 lysine/protein molecule (Pecon, J. M., and Blackburn, M. N. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 935-938). Fractionation of the labeled antithrombin by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose separated a phosphopyridoxylated antithrombin species devoid of heparin binding from modified protein which retained affinity for heparin. To generate peptide maps of the two antithrombin species, the proteins were reductively denatured, S-carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Fractionation of the tryptic digests by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated one peak in the chromatogram of the non-heparin-binding species to be clearly different when compared to the chromatogram of the heparin-binding species. The sequence of the unique peptide, determined by automated Edman degradation, was Thr-Ser-Asp-Gln--His--Phe-Ala-Lys--Asn-Cys-Arg. This peptide corresponds to a tryptic fragment including residues 115-129 in the sequence of antithrombin, with the modified residue identified as Lys-125. Additionally, phosphopyridoxylation of antithrombin in the presence of added heparin indicated that several other lysyl residues were "protected" from modification. Identification of this critical lysine for heparin binding strongly supports previous data which indicate that the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin is located at the NH2 terminus within one of the disulfide cross-linked loops of the protein.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5158504>-Crystallin.

Based on the amino acid compositions, specific radioactivities and sodium dodecyl sulphate-gel electrophoresis of the fractions, it was concluded that alpha-crystallin contains at least four different subunits: DU1A and DU1B, containing no cysteine; a third component represented by DU2B and DU3 containing one cysteine one cysteine residue per subunit; and DU4, which probably contains two residues of cysteine per subunit. Subunit DU1A was shown to be of sufficient purity for sequence studies. Cyanogen bromide cleavage yielded two peptides, CB-1 and CB-2, in approximately equal amounts as expected. The sum of the molecular weights and amino acid compositions of the peptides were both in excellent agreement with the results obtained for subunit DU1A. The amino acid sequence of the first sixteen residues of peptide CB-1 is: Ser--Thr-Lys-Asp-Phe-Asp-Glu-Val-Asn--Asp-Val-Ser-His-Phe-.

Knowledge-based potential functions are one type of the  functions which can be obtained from known protein structures. The pairwise potential between atom types is approximated using Boltzmann's law which relates the frequency of atom types to its potential. The total  is approximated as a summation of pairwise potential between the atomic pairs. In the present study, the performance of knowledge-based potential function was assessed based on the strength of interaction between groups of amino acids. The dominant energies involved in the pairwise potentials were revealed by eigenvalue analysis of the matrix, the elements of which represent the  between amino acids. For this purpose, the matrix including the mean of the energies of residue-residue interaction types was constructed using 500 native protein structures. The matrix has a dominant eigenvalue and amino acids, with , VAL, , , TYR, ALA and TRP having high values along the dominant eigenvector. The results show that the ranking of amino acids is consistent with the power of amino acids in discriminating native structures using K-alphabet reduced model. In the reduced interactions, only amino acids from a subset of all 20 amino acids, along with their interactions are considered to assess the . In the K-alphabet reduced model, the reduced structures are constructed based on only the K-amino acid types.

Degradation of human IAPP by neprilysin was followed by HPLC, and the degradation products were identified by MS.Neprilysin prevented IAPP fibrillisation by cleaving IAPP at Arg(11)-(12), (12)-Ala(13), Asn(14)-(15), (15)-(16), Asn(22)-(23) and Ala(25)-(26).

Comparative biochemical and bioinformatic evidence indicates that enkephalins are not limited to mammals. Various prodynorphin (PDYN) sequences in lower vertebrates revealed the presence of other enkephalin fingerprints in these precursor polypeptides. Among the novel enkephalins -enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-) was primarily observed in the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) PDYNs, while the structure of Phe-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-) was predicted by analyzing brain cDNA sequences encoding a PDYN of the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens). -enkephalin can also be found in the PDYNs of four other fish species including the eel, bichir, zebrafish and tilapia, but no further occurrence for the Phe-enkephalin motif is available as yet.

The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces.

In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL. The 2 novel peptides from 4-h hydrolysate fractions separated by successive chromatographic steps were characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The novel peptides Asn--Glu----Arg and Thr-Gln-Met-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu--Met-Glu-Lys--Arg, which corresponded to β-lactoglobulin 1 f(71-77) and β-lactoglobulin 1 f(143-155), demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 86.34 and 69.84 μM, respectively. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the 2 peptides was retained or even improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro.

Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to either a high body condition group (HBCS; n = 19) or a normal body condition group (NBCS; n = 19) and were fed different diets until dry-off (d -49 relative to calving) to amplify the difference. The groups were also stratified for comparable milk yields (NBCS: 10,361 ± 302 kg; HBCS: 10,315 ± 437 kg). At dry-off, the NBCS cows (parity: 2.42 ± 1.84; body weight: 665 ± 64 kg) had a body condition score (BCS) <3.5 and backfat thickness (BFT) <1.2 cm, whereas the HBCS cows (parity: 3.37 ± 1.67; body weight: 720 ± 57 kg) had a BCS >3.75 and BFT >1.4 cm. During the dry period and the subsequent lactation, both groups were fed identical diets but maintained the BCS and BFT differences. Blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies (semitendinosus) were repeatedly (d -49, +3, +21, and +84 relative to calving) collected for assessing the concentrations of free AA and the mRNA abundance of various components of mTOR and UPS. The differences in BCS and BFT were maintained throughout the study. The circulating concentrations of most AA with the exception of Gly, Gln, Met, and  increased in early lactation in both groups. The serum concentrations of Ala (d +21 and +84) and Orn (d +84) were lower in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, but those of Gly, His, , Val, Lys, Met, and Orn on d -49 and  on d +21 were greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. The serum concentrations of 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, and 3-methylhistidine:creatinine ratio increased after calving (d +3) but did not differ between the groups. The muscle concentrations of all AA (except for Cys) remained unchanged over time and did not differ between groups. The muscle concentrations of Cys were greater on d -49 but tended to be lower on d +21 in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. On d +21, mTOR and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 mRNA abundance was greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, whereas ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 was not different between the groups. The mRNA abundance of ubiquitin-activating enzyme 1 (d +21), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 1 (d +21), atrogin-1 (d +21), and ring finger protein-1 (d +3) enzymes was greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 was not different between the groups. The increased mRNA abundance of key components of mTOR signaling and of muscle-specific ligases of HBCS cows may indicate a simultaneous activation of anabolic and catabolic processes and thus increased muscle protein turnover, likely as a part of the adaptive response to prevent excessive loss of skeletal muscle mass during early lactation.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, Tyr, and , and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, , Val, , Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and  with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively). Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504604>Nutrient digestibility of soybean products in grower-finisher pigs.</a></h2><p>Solvent extraction of soybean creates soybean meal (SBM), but an array of other soybean products can be created using further processing of SBM or soybean. For accurate inclusion of these products in pig feed, characterization of digestible AA profile and  value is required. Soybean products from processes such as extrusion (EX) of soybean and thermo-mechanical (TM) treatment, bioconversion using fermentation or enzymes (BC), and ethanol-water extraction (EW) of soybean meal were collected together with SBM. These 9 soybean products were tested in cornstarch-based diets together with an N-free diet for a total of 10 diets. Ten ileal-cannulated barrows (30.4 ± 0.7 kg initial BW) were fed 10 diets at 2.8 times maintenance DE for six 9-day periods with a 6 (periods) × 10 (pigs) Youden square. The control SBM contained 47.0% CP, 1.4% ether extract, and ADF 6.0%. The 9 soybean products contained 35.6 to 66.4% CP, 0.9 to 21.6% ether extract, and 4.4 to 8.0% ADF. The EW soybean products were high in CP (> 61%), whereas the 2 EX soybean products were low in CP (< 36%) but high in ether extract (≥ 19%). Chemically-available Lys ranged from 92.6 to 100% of total Lys, indicating that minor Lys damage occurred during processing. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of  was lower (P < 0.05) for soybean products with greater ether extract and ADF content than SBM, and varied among soybean products. The standardized ileal digestibility (SID) did not differ (P > 0.05) among soybean products for most AA, except for lower SID of Arg, , , Lys, , and Tyr (P < 0.05) for EX2 and BC1 than other soybean products. The DE and predicted NE value did not differ (P > 0.05) among soybean products. The greater SID AA content (P < 0.05) in EW, BC, and TM1 soybean products than SBM was mainly a result of greater total AA content due to removal of other macronutrients. In conclusion, extrusion of soybean creates soybean products with a greater  value but lower ATTD of  and lower SID AA content than SBM. Further processing of SBM creates soybean products with greater CP and SID AA content but similar SID of AA than SBM. Thus, new technologies to process SBM or soybean create high value ingredients to be included in pig diets, especially for young pigs with high nutritional requirements.© The Author(s) 2019.

The enzyme was shown to be composed of two polypeptide chains (a 31-kDa heavy chain and a 23-kDa light chain) cross-linked by disulfide bond(s). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the heavy chain was determined to be Ala-Gly-Val- Asp-Gly-Tyr--Val-Pro-Tyr-Val--Phe-Asp--Tyr-Gly--Pro-Tyr and that of the light chain to be Ala-Glu-Pro-Pro-. The heavy chain contained carbohydrate moiety composed of mannose, glucosamine, fucose, and glucose. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 1.7 toward hemoglobin as a substrate. Among the proteinase inhibitors tested only diazoacetyl-D,L-norleucine methyl ester, a typical aspartic proteinase inhibitor, inhibited the acid proteinase in the presence of cupric ions. It was insensitive to the other typical aspartic proteinase inhibitors, pepstatin A and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane.

The enzyme showed a unique substrate specificity toward oxidized insulin B chain. The major cleavage sites were the bonds Gly8-Ser9, Leu11-Val12, Cya19-Gly20, and Phe24-Phe25, and the Gly8-Ser9 bond was most susceptible.

While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity.Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, , glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, , , Val, Trp, Tyr, , Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased.These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity.

We have developed a modification of the yeast two-hybrid system to study this interaction and have used it to characterize the interaction of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) with its receptor by using GAL4 transcriptional regulation with a beta-galactosidase assay as readout. In this system, IGF-1 and proIGF-1 bound to the cysteine-rich domain, extracellular domain, or entire IGF-1 proreceptor. This interaction was specific. Thus, proinsulin showed no significant interaction with the IGF-1 receptor, while a chimeric proinsulin containing the C-peptide of IGF-1 had an intermediate interaction, consistent with its affinity for the IGF-1 receptor. Over 2000 IGF-1 mutants were generated by PCR and screened for interaction with the color assay. About 40% showed a strong interaction, 20% showed an intermediate interaction, and 40% give little or no signal. Of 50 mutants that were sequenced, several (-5 --> His, Glu-9 --> Val, Arg-37 --> Gly, and Met-59 --> ) appeared to enhance receptor association, others resulted in weaker receptor interaction (Tyr-31 -->  and -43 --> ), and two gave no detectable signal (-14 --> Arg and Glu-46 --> Ala). Using PCR-based mutagenesis with proinsulin, we also identified a gain of function mutant (proinsulin -17 --> Pro) that allowed for a strong IGF-1-receptor interaction. These data demonstrate that the specificity of the interaction between a hormone and its receptor can be characterized with high efficiency in the two-hybrid system and that novel hormone analogues may be found by this method.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153883>Conformational dynamics and free  of BHRF1 binding to Bim BH3.</a></h2><p>The interaction between the Bim BH3 peptide and the viral protein BHRF1 is pivotal to understanding the fundamental molecular details of the mechanism used by the Epstein-Barr virus to trick the mammalian immune system. Here, we study the mechanism of binding/unbinding and compute the free  for the association of the Bim peptide to the BHRF1 protein. Key elements of the binding mechanism are the conformational rearrangement together with a main free  barrier of 11.5kcal/mol. The simulations show complete unbinding and rebinding of the Bim peptide to BHRF1. The peptide slowly dissociates, disrupting the hydrophobic contacts, then tilting to one side. The peptide then completely disrupts all the remaining interactions and moves into the bulk solvent. The rebinding of the peptide from the solvent to the receptor binding site occurs slowly. This is because the helix partially unfolds in the unbound state. Rebinding involves an intermediate state, in which the peptide interacts with the hydrophobic binding pocket, which mainly involves  62, Arg 63,  65, and  69. This novel intermediate structure forms 65 contacts with the receptor before the peptide again reaches the bound state. The standard binding free  value is close to the experimental Kd in the nanomolar range. Finally, we observe how the breathing motions of α3-α4 are coupled with the binding/unbinding of the Bim BH3 peptide. The structure of the intermediate can be used for designing novel peptide inhibitors of the BHRF1 protein.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The observed rate of peptide bond hydrolysis was found to decrease with increase of the side chain bulkiness, from 4.44 × 10(-7) s(-1) for Gly-Gly to 0.81 × 10(-7) s(-1) for Gly-. A thorough DFT investigation was performed to elucidate (a) the nature of the hydrolytically active species in solution, (b) the mechanism of peptide bond hydrolysis, and (c) the influence of the aliphatic residues on the rate of hydrolysis. Formation of substrate-catalyst complexes of the dimeric POM 1 was predicted as thermodynamically unlikely. Instead, the substrates prefer to bind to the monomerization product of 1, [α-PW11O39Zr(OH)(H2O)](4-) (2), which is also present in solution. In the hydrolytically active complex two dipeptide ligands are coordinated to the Zr(IV) center of 2. The first ligand is bidentate-bound through its amino nitrogen and amide oxygen atoms, while the second ligand is monodentate-bound through a carboxylic oxygen atom. The mechanism of hydrolysis involves nucleophilic attack by a solvent water molecule on the amide carbon atom of the bidentate-bound ligand. In this process the uncoordinated carboxylic group of the same ligand acts as a general base to abstract a proton from the attacking water molecule. The decrease of the hydrolysis rate with an increase in the side chain bulkiness is mostly due to the increased ligand conformational strain in the rate-limiting transition state, which elevates the reaction activation . The conformational strain increases first upon substitution of Hα in Gly-Gly with the aliphatic α substituent and second with the β branching of the α substituent.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727082>Comparison of amino acid digestibility in full-fat soybean, two soybean meals, and peanut flour between broiler chickens and growing pigs.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in full-fat soybean (FFSB), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 430 g/kg CP (SBM-43), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 470 g/kg CP (SBM-47), and peanut flour (PNF) fed to broiler chickens and pigs and to compare the digestibility of CP and AA between broiler chickens and pigs.

In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (initial BW: 52.80 ± 2.55 kg) were housed individually in metabolism crates and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. A corn-based basal diet (97.25% corn) and 2 diets that contained corn and DDGS-CV or corn and DDGS-HPLincolnway were formulated. Each diet was fed to 8 pigs. Feces and urine were collected using the marker to marker approach with 7-d adaptation and 5-d collection periods. The DE and ME in DDGS-CV and DDGS-HPLincolnway were calculated using the difference procedure. The DE and ME in DDGS-HPLincolnway on an as-fed basis were greater (P < 0.05) than in corn and DDGS-CV, but the ATTD of GE in DDGS-HPLincolnway and DDGS-CV was less (P < 0.01) than in corn. In conclusion, the SID of some AA and the DE and ME in DDGS-HPLincolnway were greater than in DDGS-CV.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1383130>Further studies on proteinases and alpha 2-macroglobulin activity in diabetic plasma.</a></h2><p>Loss of chymotrypsin binding capacity of alpha 2-macroglobulin in diabetic plasma on in vitro incubation, could be partially prevented by phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride and pepstatin A. Prior ten-fold dilution of plasma with 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) completely arrested the process. The phenomenon could not be reactivated by Ca2+, lecithin or bovine serum albumin. Diabetic plasma, like normal plasma, exhibited maximal hydrolytic activities on H-D-Pro--Arg-p-nitroanilide, H-D-Val--Arg-p-nitroanilide and H-D--Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The hydrolytic activities were not significantly diminished on incubation of plasma at 37 degrees C for 12 hr, unlike alpha 2-macroglobulin activity. On gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200, part of the proteolytic activity in diabetic plasma coeluted with alpha 2-macroglobulin in the VO region.

An initial fluorescence, due to incomplete energy transfer, of about 8% of the values attained after complete substrate hydrolysis; a non-linear standard curve even at microM concentrations and an exponential decay of the steady state fluorescence of reaction product of the order of 10(-4) x s(-1) were the main analytical problems encountered.

The origin of HMWP was also investigated. The molecular weight of HMWP was determined to be about 115 000 and 114 800 by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The sequence of 10 amino acids in N-terminal of HMWP was Ala--Val-Gln-Ser-Cys--Asn--Val. The sequence was blasted against GenBank. No protein showed significant similarity with this sequence suggesting the HMWP may be novel. The result of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) also proved HMWP could be a novel protein. By amino acid assay, HMWP was rich in glutamate (including glutamine), cysteine, glycine, aspartic acid (including asparagines) and proline. The content of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Val, , , Met,  and Pro) was lower at 18.59% of the total amino acids suggesting HMWP has high solubility in water. Western blots of lectins were used to identify the kinds of carbohydrate residues attached to HMWP qualitatively. The result showed that HMWP was a kind of glycoprotein containing N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), mannose (Man) and/or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). By isoelectric focusing, HMWP pI was found to be 5.1. Compared with milk fat globule membrane protein (MFGMP) isolated from the sow milk in SDS-PAGE, MFGMP did not contain HMWP. HMWP was assumed to be a secretory milk protein. HMWP was not found in bovine, goat, rabbit or human milk in SDS-PAGE gel suggesting HMWP may be unique to sow milk. By Western blot, HMWP could be detected in sow milk, not in sow serum, which suggests it is synthesized and secreted by the mammary gland. HMWP concentrations in sows milk were the lowest in the first day of lactation, rose significantly during lactation 1 to 7 days. The HMWP content of sows milk remained relatively constant ((1.95±0.13) g/l) during lactation 7 to 20 days. HMWP significantly inhibited Escherichia coli in a dose related manner in vitro. Overall, HMWP could be a novel sow milk protein with implications for the mammary gland and the piglet.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10578464>[Peptide synthesis catalyzed by subtilisin-72 in organic solvents].</a></h2><p>The solubility, stability, and activity of native subtilisin 72 and of its complex with SDS were comparatively studied in a number of polar organic solvents.

The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and  stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes. Docking of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 with arachidonic acid revealed that TYR 112, ALA 126,  222,  223, THR 312,  315, ALA 316, ASP 319, THR 320,  491 and  492 residues were actively participating in the interaction, while docking of CYP4X1 with anandamide showed that TYR 112, GLN 114, PRO 118, ALA 126,  222,  223, SER 251,  315, ALA 316 and  491 key residues were involved in strong interaction.From this study, several key residues were identified to be responsible for the binding of arachidonic acid and anandamide with orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1. Both substrates obeyed Lipinski rule of five in drug-likeness test and biological spectrum prediction showed anticarcinogenic activity. Compared to anandamide, arachidonic acid showed strong interaction with cytochrome P450 4X1 and also less health effect in certain human system in ADME-Tox prediction.

Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly-Lys--Thr, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly-Glu-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln and Tyr-Glu--Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence Tyr-Glu--Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences -Thr--Tyr-Glu-Asp-Arg, Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln-Tyr---Arg and Val-Val-Asp--Tyr, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence Val-Val-Asp--Tyr only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980503>Stability of targeted metabolite profiles of urine samples under different storage conditions.</a></h2><p>Few studies have investigated the influence of storage conditions on urine samples and none of them used targeted mass spectrometry (MS).We investigated the stability of metabolite profiles in urine samples under different storage conditions using targeted metabolomics.Pooled, fasting urine samples were collected and stored at -80 °C (biobank standard), -20 °C (freezer), 4 °C (fridge), ~9 °C (cool pack), and ~20 °C (room temperature) for 0, 2, 8 and 24 h.

The circular dichroism spectra indicated the ellipticity of CaM increased at 208 and 222 nm upon complex formation with the synthetic peptide. 1H NMR studies showed that the peptide interacts with the aromatic residues in domains I and III of CaM. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence that the structurally conserved basic amphiphilic alpha-helix CaM-binding domain of the recombinant tobacco CaM-binding protein interacts with CaM at physiologically significant nanomolar concentrations and the microenvironments of both CaM and the synthetic binding domain are modified upon complex formation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7479953>An unmodified heptadecapeptide pheromone induces competence for genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae.</a></h2><p>Competence for genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae has been known for three decades to arise in growing cultures at a critical cell density, in response to a secreted protease-sensitive signal. We show that strain CP1200 produces a 17-residue peptide that induces cells of the species to develop competence. The sequence of the peptide was found to be H-Glu-Met-Arg--Ser-Lys--Arg-Asp-Phe---Gln-Arg- Lys-Lys-OH. A synthetic peptide of the same sequence was shown to be biologically active in small quantities and to extend the range of conditions suitable for development of competence. Cognate codons in the pneumococcal chromosome indicate that the peptide is made ribosomally. As the gene encodes a prepeptide containing the Gly-Gly consensus processing site found in peptide bacteriocins, the peptide is likely to be exported by a specialized ATP-binding cassette transport protein as is characteristic of these bacteriocins. The hypothesis is presented that this transport protein is encoded by comA, previously shown to be required for elaboration of the pneumococcal competence activator.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561730>Ligand binding pocket formed by evolutionarily conserved residues in the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor core domain.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis through its receptor GLP1R. Due to its multiple beneficial effects, GLP-1 has gained great attention for treatment of type 2 diabetes and . However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of GLP-1 with the heptahelical core domain of GLP1R conferring high affinity ligand binding and ligand-induced receptor activation. Here, using chimeric and point-mutated GLP1R, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue Arg(380) flanked by hydrophobic (379) and (381) in extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) may have an interaction with Asp(9) and Gly(4) of the GLP-1 peptide. The molecular modeling study showed that (196) at transmembrane helix 2, Met(233) at ECL1, and Asn(302) at ECL2 of GLP1R have contacts with His(1) and Thr(7) of GLP-1. This study may shed light on the mechanism underlying high affinity interaction between the ligand and the binding pocket that is formed by these conserved residues in the GLP1R core domain.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3290486>Synthesis and renin inhibitory activity of angiotensinogen analogues having dehydrostatine,  psi [CH2S]Val, or  psi [CH2SO]Val at the P1-P1' cleavage site.</a></h2><p>The synthesis and in vitro renin inhibitory potencies of angiotensinogen (ANG) analogues having amide (CONH) bond replacements at P1-P1', the -Val cleavage site, corresponding to  psi[CH2SO]Val, and the trans olefinic analogue of statine (Sta), 4(S)-amino-6-methyl-2(E)-heptenoic acid (dehydrostatine, Dhs), are reported.

The goal of the current research was to estimate possible changes in amino acid profiles in rat serum and liver. We also studied whether nicotinamide (NAm), as a drug with the wide range of metabolic effects, can influence metabolic impairments associated with diabetes.After 4 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes (60 mg/kg, i.p.), male Wistar rats were injected for 14 days with or without NAm (100 mg/kg, i.p.). The free amino acids were assayed by cation exchange chromatography. The thiol-active reagent, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), was used to determine reduced glutathione (GSH).Diabetes was associated with derangement of protein and amino acid metabolism as evidenced by 1.72- and 1.16-fold increase in the total amount of free amino acids in liver and serum and Fischer index (++Val/Tyr+) raised in serum (3.58 vs. 1.73 in control). This was accompanied by increased ratio of essential/nonessential free amino acids, which was more profound in serum. Diabetes led to elevation of hepatic glutamine content, whereas the activity of glutamine synthetase was shown to be decreased. It was also shown a considerable reduction of brain GSH level. Diabetes-related changes in compositions of free amino acids and the ratio of essential/ nonessential free amino acids were partially reversed towards normalisation after NAm supplementation with the efficacy greater in liver than in serum. Furthermore, Fisher index in blood serum was not influenced by drug treatment. NAm exerted slight glucose lowering effect without any effect on decreased body weight in diabetes.The study confirms diabetes-induced derangements in protein and amino acid metabolism in animals. The beneficial effects of NAm on these processes, additionally with other possible contributing factors, may be attributed to metabolic improvements in type I diabetes.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9326380>Bactericidal action of lysozymes attached with various sizes of hydrophobic peptides to the C-terminal using genetic modification.</a></h2><p>The genetic modification of lysozyme was attempted to improve the bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli. The different lengths of hydrophobic peptides were attached to the C-terminus of the hen egg white lysozyme to investigate the most effective length of the hydrophobic peptides for killing bacteria. The oligonucleotides encoding Phe-Val-Pro (H3), -Val-Ala-Pro (H5) and -Val-Ala---Pro (H7) were fused to the C-terminus  129 of lysozyme cDNA. The reconstructed cDNAs were inserted into the yeast expression vector. The hydrophobic peptide-fused lysozymes were secreted in the yeast carrying the reconstructed cDNA. Although the hydrophobic peptide-fused lysozymes retained 75 80% lytic activity of the wild-type protein, the bactericidal action to E. coli was greatly increased with the length of hydrophobic peptides. These results suggest that the hydrophobic peptides play an important role in killing Gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of catalytic domain in bactericidal action of the hydrophobic fusion lysozyme (H5-Lz), the mutant hydrophobic lysozyme (H5/E35A-Lz) whose glutamic acid was substituted with alanine at the position 35 was constructed to diminish the catalytic activity.

To confirm the contribution of dispersion forces on quantum chemical data, the long-range corrected (LC) hybrid density functional (ωB97X-D) was also probed for some amino acid derivatives. The ωB97X functional gave similar results.

To identify the molecular determinants of folding and assembly of these classic claudins, Cldn3/Cldn5 chimeric mutants were generated and analyzed by cellular reconstitution of TJ strands, live cell confocal imaging, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. A comprehensive screening was performed on the basis of the rescue of mutants deficient for strand formation. Cldn3/Cldn5 residues in transmembrane segment 3, TM3 (Ala-127/Cys-128, Ser-136/Cys-137, Ser-138/-139), and the transition of TM3 to extracellular loop 2, ECL2 (Thr-141/-142) and ECL2 (Asn-148/Asp-149, -150/Thr-151, Arg-157/Tyr-158), were identified to be involved in claudin folding and/or assembly. Blue native PAGE and FRET assays revealed 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-resistant cis-dimerization for Cldn5 but not for Cldn3. This homophilic interaction was found to be stabilized by residues in TM3. The resulting subtype-specific cis-dimer is suggested to be a subunit of polymeric TJ strands and contributes to the specific ultrastructure of the TJ detected by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In particular, the Cldn5-like exoplasmic face-associated and particle-type strands were found to be related to cis-dimerization.

A recent study of six different modeling software packages showed that they are more successful at predicting side chain conformations of core compared to surface residues. All the modeling software tested have multicomponent  functions, typically including contributions from solvation, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding and Lennard-Jones interactions in addition to statistical terms based on observed protein structures. We investigated to what extent a simplified  function that includes only stereochemical constraints and repulsive hard-sphere interactions can correctly repack protein cores. For single residue and collective repacking, the hard-sphere model accurately recapitulates the observed side chain conformations for , , , Thr, Trp, Tyr and Val. This result shows that there are no alternative, sterically allowed side chain conformations of core residues. Analysis of the same set of protein cores using the Rosetta software suite revealed that the hard-sphere model and Rosetta perform equally well on , , , Thr and Val; the hard-sphere model performs better on Trp and Tyr and Rosetta performs better on Ser.

Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory  virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (, , Lys, Met, , Thr, Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and Thr was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased Val flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, , Val, and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in Thr and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, Thr, and Val requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

The linear peptide was less active than its cyclic counterpart in the humoral, and equally active in the cellular immune response.

In the in vivo humoral immune response their activities were much less differentiated than it was observed in the in vitro experiments. All alanine analogs retain the immunosuppressive activity in the cellular immune response. However, their activities are practically not differentiated, and it is impossible to decide which amino acid side chains of the parent peptide are the most important for generation of the immunosuppressive effects. CD spectra of alanine analogs show that, in comparison with the parent peptide, conformational equilibria of these peptides are shifted towards unordered conformations. This finding correspond well to the results of the biological tests which show that all alanine analogs are less biologically active than the parent peptide.

A total mixed ration consisting of 58% corn silage, 16% alfalfa hay, and 26% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net  and MP requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (SAL) or 562 g/d of essential AA delivered in 4 profiles where individual AA content corresponded to their relative content in casein. The profiles were (1) a complete essential amino acid mixture (EAAC), (2) , , and Val (ILV), (3) His, , , Met, , Trp, Val (GR1+ILV), and (4) Arg, His, Lys, Met, , Thr, Trp (GR1+ALT). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine  and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, digestibility, and plasma constituents. Compared with SAL, infusion of EAAC increased milk, protein, and lactose yield, increased  retained as body protein, and did not affect milk N efficiency. Total N intake and urine N output was higher with all AA infusions relative to SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusions of GR1+ILV and GR1+ALT produced the same milk yield and the same yield and content of milk fat, protein, and lactose, and had similar  and N retention. Milk N efficiency was not different between EAAC and GR1+ILV, but was lower with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC, and tended to be lower with GR1+ALT compared with GR1+ILV. Infusion of ILV tended to decrease dry matter intake compared with the other AA infusions. Milk production and composition was not different between ILV and SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusion of ILV decreased or tended to decrease milk, protein, and lactose yields and milk protein content, and increased milk fat and lactose content. Milk N efficiency decreased with ILV compared with SAL, EAAC, and GR1+ILV. Milk urea concentration was not affected by essential amino acid (EAA) infusions. Plasma urea concentration did not differ between EAAC and SAL, tended to increase with ILV and GR1+ILV over SAL, and increased with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC and SAL. In conclusion, removing Arg, Lys, and Thr or removing , , and Val from a complete EAA profile when the total amount of EAA infused remained constant did not impair milk production, but milk N efficiency decreased when , , and Val were absent. Infusion of only , , and Val decreased milk protein yield and content and reduced milk N efficiency compared with a complete EAA profile.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

During the last decade, several reports have highlighted the involvement of these nanovesicles in many aspects of breast cancer development and progression, but the extracellular signals governing their generation in breast cancer cells have not been completely unraveled. Here, we investigated the role of the  hormone leptin, a well-known adipokine implicated in mammary tumorigenesis, on the mechanisms regulating exosome biogenesis and release in both estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive MCF-7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We found that leptin treatment enhanced the number of MVBs in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells and increased the amount of exosomes released in cell conditioned media. At molecular level, leptin increased the protein expression of Tsg101-a key component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I)-by a post-transcriptional mechanism involving its direct interaction with the chaperone protein Hsp90. Targeting leptin signaling, by a selective leptin receptor antagonist the peptide LDFI (-Asp--), abrogated leptin effects on Tsg101 expression and on exosome secretion in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings, identifying for the first time leptin/leptin receptor/Hsp90 axis as an important regulator of exosome generation in mammary carcinoma cells, suggest that targeting this signaling pathway might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to impair exosome secretion and interrupt the dangerous cell-to-cell communication in breast cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293707>Viscous and fermentable nonstarch polysaccharides affect intestinal nutrient and  flow and hindgut fermentation in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of viscosity and fermentability of purified nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) on intestinal nutrient and  flow and hindgut fermentation in growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 15 ileal-cannulated pigs (50.5 ± 2.9 kg BW) were allotted to 5 diets in a 2-period incompletely randomized design. Pigs were provided a cornstarch N-free diet (CST) or a diet containing 5% inulin (INU), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), or Solka-Floc (SFC). Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, ash, and GE were greater ( < 0.05) in the MCC and SFC diets than in the INU and CMC diets. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, carbohydrates (CHO), and GE and the DE content in the CST and INU diets were greater ( < 0.01) than in the CMC, MCC, and SFC diets. Hindgut disappearance of DM, CHO, and GE in the INU diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other N-free diets. The ileal endogenous flow of His, , , Met, Thr, Val, and all dispensable AA in the CMC diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other diets. In Exp. 2, 6 ileal-cannulated pigs were allotted to 3 diets containing either a corn-soybean meal control diet or the control diet with 5% INU or CMC in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gly, His, , , Lys, , Ser, Thr, and Val were greater ( < 0.05) in the CMC diet than in the control and INU diets. Incorporation of 5% INU or CMC in the control diet reduced ( < 0.01) the AID of arabinoxylan and insoluble and total NSP. The ATTD of NSP and cellulose and the hindgut disappearance of NSP, β-glucan, and cellulose in the CMC diet were less ( < 0.01) than in the control and INU diets. Inclusion of 5% INU in the diet increased ( < 0.01) hindgut fermentation of insoluble and total NSP compared with the control and CMC diets. In conclusion, depending on the viscosity and fermentability of the NSP, different sources will have different effects on nutrient digestibility and hindgut fermentation. Addition of 5% INU to a corn-soybean meal diet reduced digestibility of the NSP component in the ileum and increased hindgut fermentation of total NSP. In contrast, the inclusion of CMC increased the AID and SID of the diet and reduced total tract digestion and hindgut fermentation of NSP component. Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not recommended as a source of synthetic fiber in a N-free diet to determine the SID of AA of diets.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28378845>Central adiposity-induced plasma-free amino acid alterations are associated with increased insulin resistance in healthy Singaporean adults.</a></h2><p>Recent metabolomics technique reveals a plasma-free amino acid (PFAA)-based metabolite signature that is suggestive of altered PFAAs being an early manifestation of -related insulin resistance. However, the PFAA profiles within non-obese, but more insulin-resistant Asians are not well researched. Compared with Caucasians, Asian populations have more central adiposity, which is generally regarded as metabolically more adverse, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined whether PFAA profiling was at least one important factor mediating central adiposity and insulin resistance, and aid in cardiovascular risk assessment in healthy Asians with normal body weight.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 190 healthy men (n=87 with a mean±s.d. body mass index (BMI) of 23.5±3.5 kg/m) and women (n=103 with a mean±s.d. BMI of 21.4±3.7 kg/m) residing in Singapore took part in this study. PFAA levels were measured by using an amino acid analyzer. Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.Seven out of 18 amino acids were significantly correlated with measures of  (for example, waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio and BMI) in current participants. Among them, the plasma concentrations of five amino acids, including , Tyr, Met, Ala and His were positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio. With the exception of His, which had no association with insulin resistance, , Tyr, Met and Ala were significantly associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P<0.05). In contrast, no associations were observed between circulating BCAAs (that is, Val, , ), measures of  and insulin resistance. However, significant inverse associations were observed between BCAAs and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein.We found that central adiposity was associated with alterations of specific amino acids. As a result, PFAAs may serve as metabolite predictors of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in healthy participants.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2411869>Cleavage of rabbit myelin basic protein by plasmin: isolation and identification of the major products.</a></h2><p>Rabbit myelin basic protein (BP) was subjected to partial cleavage with plasmin, and 15 cleavage products were isolated by a combination of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Their identification was achieved by amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide mapping, supplemented in some instances by carboxy-terminal analyses with carboxypeptidases A, B, and Y and amino-terminal analyses with dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I. The results showed that major plasmic cleavage sites included the Lys89-Asn90, Lys133-Ser134, and Lys153-Leu154 bonds. Cleavages also occurred at the Arg31-His32, Lys53-Arg54, and Arg25-His26 bonds, but these appeared to be less extensive. A large number of additional peptides were produced in relatively low yield. The smaller of these were isolated from heterogeneous fractions by high-voltage electrophoresis-TLC. Amino acid analysis of these peptides showed that minor cleavage sites included the Arg9-His10, Lys13-Tyr14, Lys103-Gly104, Lys137-Gly138, Lys140-Gly141, and Arg160-Ser161 bonds. In spite of a lower selectivity toward peptide bonds in BP as compared with pepsin, cathepsin D, and thrombin, plasmin has the advantage over the former proteinases in that it does not cleave at or near the Phe44-Phe45 bond. Instead it cleaves at the Arg31-His32 and Lys53-Arg54 bonds, thus preserving the entire hydrophobic sequence --Asp-Ser--Gly-Arg- as well as short sequences to either side.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3688881>Rat brain cathepsin L: characterization and differentiation from cathepsin B utilizing opioid peptides.</a></h2><p>The specificity of purified rat brain cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) was mapped by the use of synthetic and opioid peptides and some properties were compared to rat brain cathepsin B, rat kidney cathepsin L, and bovine spleen cathepsin C. Brain and kidney cathepsin L cleaved leucine or methionine enkephalin (LE or ME) at the Gly-Gly bond to release Tyr-Gly and Gly-Phe- (-Met). In studies on pro-opioids, the brain enzyme also recognized Met-Arg, Arg-Arg, and Arg- bonds; the best substrates on a relative basis were ME-Arg-Phe, LE- or ME-Arg-Arg, and LE-Arg-Arg-. Measurement of kinetic values in relation to the sites of opioid cleavage provided a basis to differentiate brain cathepsins B and L. Cathepsin L acted with high affinity toward LE to cleave Gly2-Gly3 (Km 82.5 microM, kcat 2034 min-1), in contrast to low affinity cleavage by cathepsin B at Gly3-Phe4. Kapp, the second-order rate constant of enzyme inactivation by Z--CHN2 with LE as substrate was 31,530 M-1 s-1 or 10(3) higher than its effect on cathepsin B-mediated hydrolysis of ME-Arg-Phe at the Met-Arg site. Gly-Gly cleavage by cathepsin L was blocked by D-Ala2, did not require the presence of free end groups, and was the only site recognized within opioid peptides having a C-terminal Arg-COOH. The use of opioid peptides as substrates provides further insight into cathepsin L specificity.

Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, Lys, total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and . Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, , , Lys, , Thr, and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and Tyr), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, , , Lys, , and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and Tyr) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA.

In the rabbit protein, however, rapid cleavages occur elsewhere in addition to the Phe87-Phe88 bond in regions in which there are amino acid substitutions. Rapid cleavage occurs at the Leu151-Phe152 bond, at which -151 has been replaced by , the residue that actually contributes the scissile bond. Rapid cleavages occur at the Phe44-Phe45 and Leu109-Ser110 bonds, which in the bovine and guinea pig proteins are relatively resistant under the experimental conditions (pH 6.0). The increased susceptibility of these bonds in the rabbit protein appears to be related to the replacement of Gly-46 by Ser and the change in the sequence immediately NH2-terminal to -109, from -Ser to Thr-Val. These cleavages of the rabbit protein at the four very susceptible bonds have permitted us to isolate peptides (1-44), (45-87), (88-109), (110-151), and (152-168) in high yield.

Plasma and brain regions were sampled from mice at 7 and 16 weeks of age, and analysed for free d- and l-amino acids, which are believed to affect many physiological functions. At 7 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of d-aspartic acid (d-Asp), l-alanine (l-Ala), l-glutamine (l-Gln) and taurine were higher in SPF mice than in GF mice, but no differences were found at 16 weeks of age. Similar patterns were observed for the concentrations of l-Asp in striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and l-arginine (l-Arg), l-Ala and l-valine (l-Val) in striatum. In addition, the concentrations of l-Asp, d-Ala, l-histidine, l-isoleucine (l-), l-leucine (l-), l-phenylalanine and l-Val were significantly higher in plasma of SPF mice when compared with those of GF mice. The concentrations of l-Arg, l-Gln, l- and l- were significantly higher in SPF than in GF mice, but those of d-Asp, d-serine and l-serine were higher in some brain regions of GF mice than in those of SPF mice.

While the NH2 terminus of alpha-amylase is blocked, that of the 58,000-dalton product evidently is not, and automated sequence analysis has yielded its partial sequence as: Met-X-----X---X--X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-Phe-X-X-X-X-X--X-X--Phe. The highly hydrophobic nature of the NH2 terminus of the 58,000-dalton, cell-free product suggests that, like other secreted polypeptides, the extra piece may play a role in the transport and secretion of the mature alpha-amylase.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250878>Postprandial insulin and nutrient concentrations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged growing pigs reared in thermoneutral and high ambient temperatures1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated effects of ambient temperature and inflammation caused by repeated administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on insulin, , and AA metabolism. Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, , , , Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, , , Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, Thr, and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, , and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, two independent groups reported frameshift mutations associated with a dominant form of  (1, 2). We screened the coding region of the MC4-R in 306 extremely obese children and adolescents (mean body mass index: BMI 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m2), 25 healthy underweight students (mean BMI 17.1 +/- 0.8 kg/m2), 52 normal weight individuals (mean BMI 22.0 +/- 1.0 kg/m2), 51 inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 14.3 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) and 27 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 21.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m2) by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Several mutations were identified, including the frameshift mutation described (1). The mutations were as follows: a) The deletion of 4 bp (delta of CTCT at codon 211) results in a frameshift, thus rendering a truncated protein. This mutation has been assumed to be associated with dominantly-inherited morbid  in humans (1). Both the index patient (BMI 42.06 kg/m2, height 171 cm, age 19.6 years) and her mother (BMI 37.55 kg/m2, height 164 cm, age 42.5 years) were heterozygous for the deletion. b) A nonsense mutation at position 35 of the MC4-R was detected in two obese probands (BMI 31.29 kg/m2 and BMI 45.91 kg/m2). This mutation leads to a truncated protein that encompasses the N-terminal extracellular domain. Both carriers additionally showed (c) a missense mutation (Asp-37-Val). In both of these cases Tyr-35-Stop and Asp-37-Val were maternally transmitted, thus these variations form a haplotype. d) e) A male obese proband harbored two missense mutations (Ser-30-, Gly-252-Ser). f)-i) Four different missense mutations (Pro-78-, Thr-112-Met, Arg-165-Trp, -317-Thr) were detected in four different male probands, respectively. All of these mutations (a to i) were found solely in extremely obese individuals whose BMIs were all above the 99th percentile. j) A silent mutation (C-579-T, Val-193-Val) was detected in a male underweight individual. k) A previously described polymorphism (Val-103-; 3) was detected with similar frequencies in all different study groups. 1) We identified a novel polymorphism (-251-) with similar allele frequencies in all groups under study. In conclusion, our data indicate that mutations in the MC4-R are not uncommon. Whereas our data support the evidence for dominantly inherited  as revealed by the three obese probands with haplo-insufficiency, the functional significance of the missense mutations remains to be determined.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351078>Asymmetric peptidomimetics containing L-tartaric acid core inhibit the aspartyl peptidase activity and growth of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes.</a></h2><p>Aspartyl-type peptidases are promising chemotherapeutic targets in protozoan parasites. In the present work, we identified an aspartyl peptidase activity from the soluble extract of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes, which cleaved the fluorogenic peptide 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Gly-Lys-Pro----Arg--Lys(DNP)-D-Arg-amide (cathepsin D substrate) under acidic pH conditions at 37°C, showing a KM of 0.58 μM and Vmax of 129.87 fluorescence arbitrary units/s mg protein. The leishmanial aspartyl peptidase activity was blocked by pepstatin A (IC50 = 6.8 μM) and diazo-acetyl-norleucinemetilester (IC50 = 10.2 μM), two classical aspartyl peptidase inhibitors. Subsequently, the effects of 6 asymmetric peptidomimetics, containing L-tartaric acid core, were tested on both aspartyl peptidase and growth of L. amazonensis promastigotes. The peptidomimetics named 88, 154 and 158 promoted a reduction of 50% on the leishmanial aspartyl peptidase activity at concentrations ranging from 40 to 85 μM, whereas the peptidomimetic 157 was by far the most effective, presenting IC50 of 0.04 μM. Furthermore, the peptidomimetics 157 and 154 reduced the parasite proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, displaying IC50 values of 33.7 and 44.5 μM, respectively. Collectively, the peptidomimetic 157 was the most efficient compound able to arrest both aspartyl peptidase activity and leishmanial proliferation, which raises excellent perspectives regarding its use against this human pathogenic protozoan.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p></html>
