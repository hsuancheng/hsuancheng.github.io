We evaluated the effect of rehydrated and ensiled corn (REC), , and ST on intake, lactation performance, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation profile, and chewing behavior of dairy cows. Kernels from an 84% vitreousness hybrid were finely (FN) or coarsely (CS) ground, yielding geometric mean particle sizes of 1,591 and 2,185 µm, respectively. Ground kernels were rehydrated [60% dry matter (DM)] and ensiled in 200-L buckets for ≥205 d. The grinding rate (t/h) was 3.9 for FN and 11.7 for CS. The  did not affect DM loss (11.3% of ensiled) or silage pH (3.8). Samples of each bucket (n = /) before and after silage fermentation were incubated in situ for , 3, 6, 18, and 48 h in 4 rumen-cannulated lactating cows. Ensiling increased the effective ruminal in situ DM degradation (63.7 vs. 34.1%), regardless of . Sixteen Holstein cows (152 ± 96 d in milk) in 4 × 4 Latin squares (21-d periods) were individually fed a 2 × 2 factorial combination of low (LO) or high (HI) starch diets with FN or CS. Cows were fed the same REC incubated in situ. Varied concentration of starch in the diet (29.2 vs. 23.5% of DM) was achieved by partial replacement of REC (22. vs. 14.2% of DM) with citrus pulp ( vs. 8.2% of DM). Milk, protein, fat, and lactose yields did not differ. Milk fat percentage was reduced and protein percentage was increased by HI. Treatment FN increased feed efficiency (-corrected milk/digestible organic matter intake) when fed with HI. Total-tract starch digestibility tended to be reduced by CS (96.4 vs. 97.2% of starch intake). Serum β-hydroxybutyrate was increased by LO. High-starch diet reduced the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate in ruminal fluid and increased propionate and isoacids. Particle size did not affect ruminal fermentation profile. Coarse grinding reduced plasma d-lactate concentration with HI. Diet HI reduced the proportion of daily intake from 1900 to 0700 h and induced preferential intake of feed particles <8 mm and greater refusal of particles >19 mm in the morning. Fine REC reduced rumination time per day and increased eating time per DM intake. Milk and plasma urea-N did not differ. Ensiling of mature flint corn for >200 d largely eliminated the effect of the  of REC on the studied outcomes. The proportion of REC in the diet affected ruminal fermentation profile and milk solids concentration, but did not affect short-term performance and digestibility. Coarse grinding of REC may allow increasing the grinding rate and thus save labor and  during ensiling.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The photolysis of these azides after 267 nm light excitation leads to the population of each respective azide S1 excited state. Decay of the S1 excited state gives rise to singlet nitrene formation. In the case of BsN3, the decay was found to correlate with the formation of a pseudo-Curtius photoproduct (PCP) BrC6H4NSO2. Transient electronic ground states of the three azides on their way to singlet nitrenes and PCPs were shown by locating the corresponding transition states on the potential  surfaces. The lifetime of singlet (1)(BsN) and (1)(TsN) nitrenes is τ(S) = ∼20  in CH2Cl2 and ∼700  in CCl4. Singlet (1)(MsN) was not detected. Due to fast intersystem crossing (ISC), singlet nitrenes are converted into the triplet spin isomers lying lower in , the formation time constants being equal to the corresponding singlet nitrene lifetime. The formation of (3)(MsN) was shown and the formation time constant in CH2Cl2 was found to be τ(ISC) = 34 ± 3 . Internal conversion of the S1 excited state to the ground state of the azide was low (Φ ≈ .) for BsN3 and TsN3 and was not found in the case of MsN3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28382312>Highly multiplexed signal readout for a time-of-flight positron emission tomography detector based on silicon photomultipliers.</a></h2><p>Maintaining excellent timing resolution in the generation of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) systems requires a large number of high-speed, high-bandwidth electronic channels and components. To minimize the cost and complexity of a system's back-end architecture and data acquisition, many analog signals are often multiplexed to fewer channels using techniques that encode timing, , and position information. With progress in the development SiPMs having lower dark noise, after pulsing, and cross talk along with higher photodetection efficiency, a coincidence timing resolution (CTR) well below 200  FWHM is now easily achievable in single pixel, bench-top setups using 20-mm length, lutetium-based inorganic scintillators. However, multiplexing the output of many SiPMs to a single channel will significantly degrade CTR without appropriate signal processing. We test the performance of a PET detector readout concept that multiplexes 16 SiPMs to two channels. One channel provides timing information with fast comparators, and the second channel encodes both position and  information in a time-over-threshold-based pulse sequence. This multiplexing readout concept was constructed with discrete components to process signals from a [Formula: see text] array of SensL MicroFC-30035 SiPMs coupled to [Formula: see text] LuGdSiO (LGSO):Ce (.025 mol. %) scintillators. This readout method yielded a calibrated, global  resolution of .3% FWHM at 511 keV with a CTR of [Formula: see text] FWHM between the 16-pixel multiplexed detector array and a [Formula: see text] LGSO-SiPM reference detector. In summary, results indicate this multiplexing scheme is a scalable readout technique that provides excellent coincidence timing performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590822>Sorption of sulfamethazine onto different types of microplastics: A combined experimental and molecular dynamics simulation study.</a></h2><p>Microplastics are becoming a global concern due to their potential to accumulate pollutants in aquatic environments. In this paper, sulfamethazine (SMT) sorption onto six types of microplastics, including polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was investigated by experimental and molecular dynamics simulation methods. The experimental results indicated that SMX sorption reached equilibrium within 16 h. The kinetics of SMT sorption by PA, PVC, PE, and PP could be fitted by pseudo first-order model, while SMT sorption by PA and PET could be described by pseudo second-order model. The partition coefficient K values were 38.7, 23.5, 21., 22.6, 18.6 and .1 L·kg for PA, PE, , PET, PVC and PP, respectively. SMT sorption onto microplastics decreased when pH and salinity increased. The molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that the main mechanisms involved in sorption are electrostatic and Van der Waals interaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulations are performed at collision energies Ei of 5., 13.5, 22.5, 30.00, and 70 eV, and incident angles ° (normal) and 45° (grazing). Excellent agreement with experiment (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 9703-9714) is found for both the average fraction and distribution of the collision  transferred to the ala2-H(+) internal degrees of freedom. The dominant pathway for this  transfer is to ala2-H(+) vibration, but for Ei = 5. eV ∼20% of the  transfer is to ala2-H(+) rotation.  transfer to ala2-H(+) rotation decreases with increase in Ei and becomes negligible at high Ei. Three types of collisions are observed in the simulations: i.e. those for which ala2-H(+) (1) directly scatters off the F-SAM surface; (2) sticks/physisorbs on/in the surface, but desorbs within the 10  numerical integration of the simulations; and (3) remains trapped (i.e. soft-landed) on/in the surface when the simulations are terminated. Penetration of the F-SAM by ala2-H(+) is important for the latter two types of events. The trapped trajectories are expected to have relatively long residence times on the surface, since a previous molecular dynamics simulation (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2014, 118, 5577-5588) shows that thermally accommodated ala2-H(+) ions have an binding  with the F-SAM surface of at least ∼ kcal mol(-1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310128>Temperature Dependence of the  Transfer in LHCII Studied by Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>We measured two-dimensional electronic spectra of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) at various temperatures (77, 110, 150, 230, and 295 K) under conditions free from singlet-singlet annihilation. We elucidated the temperature-dependent excitation  transfer dynamics in the Chl  manifold of LHCII. Global analysis revealed that the dynamics can be summarized in distinct time scales from 200 fs up to  . While the fastest dynamics with a decay time of ∼.2-.3  are relatively temperature-independent, the lifetimes and relative contributions of slower components showed considerable temperature dependence. The slowest time scale of equilibration with the lowest- Chl  increased from ∼5  at 295 K to ∼  at 77 K. The final excited state is independent of initial excitation at 230 K and above, whereas static  disorder is apparent at lower temperatures. A clear temperature dependence of uphill  transfer processes was also discerned, which is consistent with the detailed-balance condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29041426>Spectroscopic characteristics, continuous-wave and mode-locking laser performances of Tm,Y:CaF disordered crystal.</a></h2><p>The spectroscopic characteristics, continuous-wave (CW) and mode-locking laser performances of Tm,Y:CaF disordered crystal were studied. A maximum CW output power of 586 mW was obtained with a slope efficiency of 26%. The Tm,Y:CaF mode-locked laser could operate in two states: single-wavelength mode locking or dual-wavelength synchronous mode locking. The single-wavelength mode-locked laser generated pulses with pulse duration of 22 , repetition rate of 99 MHz, and pulse  of 1. nJ at 1887 nm. Alternatively, the laser could also be mode-locked simultaneously at 1880.7 nm and 1889. nm wavelengths.

An 8 keV Talbot-Lau interferometer consisting of free standing ultrathin gratings was deployed at an ultra-short, high-intensity laser system using K-shell emission from a 1-30 J, 8  laser pulse focused on thin Cu foil targets. Grating survival was demonstrated for 30 J, 8  laser pulses. The first x-ray deflectometry images obtained under laser backlighting showed up to 25% image contrast and thus enabled detection of electron areal density gradients with a maximum value of 8.1 ± .5 × 10(23) cm(-3) in a low-Z millimeter sized sample. An electron density profile was obtained from refraction measurements with an error of <8%.

The behavior of fish was accurately recorded by video behavior tracking technology. Results showed that changes in behavior (e.g. cluster, the reduction of swimming speed and range of movement) were significantly greater in -μm -exposed fish, which may affect hunting behavior and exploration competence. Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion of fish was significantly greater in -μm  treatment than in .5-μm  treatment, suggesting respiration and metabolism stress. Moreover, the abnormal behavior, respiration and ammonia excretion of -exposed fish had recovered modestly. In addition, abnormal symptoms of bile, liver and lumen of intestine were detected in -μm  exposure. Importantly, the growth and gross  of fish were reduced in -μm  exposure than .5-μm  exposure. Both .5-μm and -μm  exposures led to significantly lower protein and lipid contents, suggesting  reserve and nutrition quality reduction of fish. Overall, microplastics had the negative impact at greater levels than nanoplastics. Altered behavior,  reserve and nutritional quality of fish indicated the potential risk on biological functions, the development of fishery and food safety.Copyright © 2019.

Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that an increase in the pulse duration from 1 to 10  leads to the formation of a low-density shelf (about 10% of the critical density). The shelf extends over 100  μm toward the vacuum side, with a nonstationary potential barrier forming in that area. Electrons reflected from the barrier gain superponderomotive  from the potential. Some electrons experience an even greater  gain due to ponderomotive acceleration when their "dephasing rate" R=γ-p_{x}/m_{e}c drops well below unity, thus increasing acceleration by a factor of 1/R.

In this study, we presented a novel low-cost DOI detector design with four crystals coupling to one SiPM, based on the method of rectangular light-sharing window (RLSW). A prototype detector was constructed, calibrated, and assessed using the methods of homogeneous radiation and flood map analysis.The DOI detector was constructed with a 4 × 4 array of lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals (2.95 mm × 2.95 mm × 20 mm ), barium sulfate (BaSO ) reflectors, and optical glues. A RLSW 7 mm in height was deployed in the BaSO reflectors. A non-DOI detector with identical dimensions and without RLSW was also constructed for comparison. The light-output surface of the detector was air-coupled with a 4 × 4 array of SiPMs (3 mm × 3 mm ). The signals generated from the 16 SiPMs were read out by a custom-designed electronic system, and the signals from four adjacent 3 mm SiPMs were summed into one signal to emulate a 2 × 2 array of 6 mm SiPMs. The RLSW caused the DOI-related position shifts of the crystal spots in the flood map. A homogeneous radiation method was used to establish the transfer functions to convert the spot shifts measured from the flood map into DOI measurements. The accuracy of the DOI measurements was assessed with data acquired using the conventional collimated radiation method.All 16 crystals are distinctly separated from each other in the flood map. Twelve crystals, including four central crystals and eight edge crystals, have the DOI capability. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the DOI measurements of the central crystals and the edge crystals are 3.06 ± .08 and 3.79 ± . mm, respectively, for the configuration with four crystals coupling to one SiPM. By contrast, the FWHMs (3.98 ± .16 and 5.12 ± .38 mm, respectively) are slightly worse for the configuration with one crystal coupling to one SiPM. The average and standard deviation (STD) of the FWHM  resolutions of the DOI detector and non-DOI detector were 10.2% ± .7% and 10.7% ± 1.7%, respectively. Their FWHM coincidence timing resolutions were 197. ± 9.6 and 206.4 ± 13.3 , respectively. The RLSW had no significant impact on the  resolutions and timing resolutions of the DOI detector.The novel four-crystals-to-one-SiPM coupling technology is a cost-efficient approach to construct high-performance detector modules with DOI capability. The methods of homogeneous radiation and flood map analysis are easy to perform and of good performance. Those methods can be adapted in the clinic PET scanners to enable the capability of DOI measurements.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686424>Sub-ppt Mass Spectrometric Detection of Therapeutic Drugs in Complex Biological Matrixes Using Polystyrene-Microsphere-Coated Paper Spray.</a></h2><p>Polystyrene () is a class of polymer materials that offers great potential for various applications. However, the applications of  microspheres in paper spray mass spectrometry are largely underexplored. Herein we prepared a series of  microspheres via a simple dispersion polymerization and then used them as coating materials for paper spray mass spectrometry (MS) in high-sensitivity analysis of various therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrixes. In the preparation of -coated papers, the coating method was found playing a key role in determining the performance of the resulting paper substrate in addition to other parameters (e.g., starch type and amount,  coating amount, and spray solvent). We also found that as a solvent was applied on -coated paper for paper spray, the analytes of interest would be first extracted out and then moved to the tip of paper triangle for spray along with the applied solvent. In the process, the surface  of  particles had a strong impact on the desorption performance of analytes from -coated paper substrate, and the  with a high surface  favored the elution of analytes to allow a high MS sensitivity. When the prepared  coated paper was used as a substrate for paper spray, it gave high sensitivity in analysis of therapeutic drugs in various biological matrixes such as whole blood, serum, and urine with excellent repeatability and reproducibility. In contrast to uncoated filter paper, an improvement of 10-546-fold in sensitivity was achieved using -coated paper for paper spray, and an estimated lower limit of quantitation (LLOQs) in the range of .004-.084 ng mL was obtained.

Compared to typical ligand systems, the NHC ligands provide Fe complexes with longer-lived metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. This increased lifetime is ascribed to strong ligand field splitting provided by the NHC ligands that raises the  levels of the metal centered (MC) states and therefore reduces the deactivation efficiency of MLCT states. Among currently known NHC systems, [Fe(btbip)] (btbip = 2,6-bis(3--butyl-imidazol-1-ylidene)pyridine) is a unique complex as it exhibits a short-lived MC state with a lifetime on the scale of a few hundreds of picoseconds. Hence, this complex allows for a detailed investigation, using 100  X-ray pulses from a synchrotron, of strong ligand field effects on the intermediate MC state in an NHC complex. Here, we use time-resolved wide angle X-ray scattering (TRWAXS) aided by density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the molecular structure, energetics and lifetime of the high- MC state in the Fe-NHC complex [Fe(btbip)] after excitation to the MLCT manifold. We identify it as a 260  metal-centered quintet (MC) state, and we refine the molecular structure of the excited-state complex verifying the DFT results. Using information about the hydrodynamic state of the solvent, we also determine, for the first time, the  of the MC state as .75 ± . eV. Our results demonstrate that due to the increased ligand field strength caused by NHC ligands, upon transition from the ground state to the MC state, the metal to ligand bonds extend by unusually large values: by .29 Å in the axial and .21 Å in the equatorial direction. These results imply that the transition in the photochemical properties from typical Fe complexes to novel NHC compounds is manifested not only in the destabilization of the MC states, but also in structural distortion of these states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502350>Ultrafast Dynamics of Long Homologues of Carotenoid Zeaxanthin.</a></h2><p>Three zeaxanthin homologues with conjugation lengths N of , 19, and 23 denoted as Z15, Z19, and Z23 were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and the results were compared to those obtained for zeaxanthin (Z11).

Fitting the N dependence of the S2 energies allowed the estimation of [Formula: see text], the S2  of a hypothetical infinite zeaxanthin, to be ∼14 000 cm(-1).

The red shift of the S1-Sn transition with increasing conjugation length is caused by a decrease in the S1 state , resulting in S1 lifetimes of 9  (Z11), .9  (Z15), .35  (Z19), and .19  (Z23). Essentially the same lifetimes were obtained after excess  excitation at 400 nm, but S1-Sn becomes broader, indicating a larger conformation disorder in the S1 state after 400 nm excitation compared to excitation into the - band of the S2 state. An S* signal was observed in all samples, but only for Z15, Z19, and Z23 does the S* signal decay with a lifetime different from that of the S1 state. The S* lifetimes are 2.9 and 1.6  for Z15 and Z19, respectively. In Z23 the S* signal needs two decay components yielding lifetimes of .24 and 2.3 .

Herein we have synthesized colloidal CIS NCs that show defect-induced emission between donor (antisite) and acceptor (internal/surface) states as indicated from steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Subpicosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra of CIS NCs reveal a gradient of electronic states that exists above the conduction band edge. The electron cooling rate has been determined to be ∼.1-. eV/. The cascade of electron cooling dynamics was monitored after following the TA kinetics at different electronic states. Interestingly, the kinetics at the antisite state unveil a biexcitonic feature, which has been enlightened through a probe-induced biexciton mechanism. With progressively higher fluence (⟨N⟩), the biexciton binding  increases, and the electron cooling to the antisite state considerably slows down.

The reaction follows the Criegee mechanism with an initial addition of O to the [double bond splayed left]C[double bond, length as m-dash]C[double bond splayed right] bond, followed by a chain of unimolecular isomerizations, as 3-carene + O→ POZs (primary ozonides) → CIs (Criegee intermediates, 4 conformers) →  (products).

When a rubrene microcrystal was excited to higher  levels than that of the lowest singlet excited (S) state with a 397 nm femtosecond laser pulse, a triplet excited state was formed through two pathways of the singlet fission, i.e. the direct fission from higher vibrational levels of the S state with a time constant of 2.2  and the thermally activated fission from the S state in a few tens of . The time constant of the thermally activated fission changed from 35 to 17  for increasing of the laser fluence from .65 to 18 mJ cm per pulse, although that of the direct fission was constant with the excitation laser intensity. On the other hand, the yield of the triplet formation was independent of the intensity. We also examined the temperature dependence of the singlet fission and demonstrated the activation  of the thermally activated fission to be .21 eV. Based on the experimental results, we considered the excitation intensity dependence of the singlet fission of the rubrene crystal in terms of the effect of transient local heating on a  time scale after femtosecond laser excitation owing to the nonradiative vibrational relaxation from the higher vibrational level to the lower one in the S state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542023>Solvated electron formation from the conduction band of liquid methanol: Transformation from a shallow to deep trap state.</a></h2><p>We report solvated electron (e ) formation dynamics from the conduction band of liquid methanol studied using femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Liquid methanol is excited with vacuum UV (9.3 eV) pump pulses, and the subsequent electron dynamics are probed with UV pulses. The photoelectron signal exhibits a short-lived component (τ = 85 fs) without spectral evolution followed by a long-lived component with continuous spectral evolution over tens of picoseconds. We ascribe the former to a superexcited state, most likely the Wannier exciton, and the latter to the ground electronic state of e . In order to extract accurate energetics from the observed photoelectron spectra, we employ a spectral retrieval method to account for spectral broadening and shifting due to inelastic scattering of photoelectrons in the liquid. The electron binding  (eBE) of the initial trap state of an electron is determined to be about 1.5 eV, and its biexponential increase up to 3.4 eV is observed with time constants of 2 and 31 , which are greater than .27 and 13  observed for e  created by the charge-transfer-to-solvent reaction from CHO to liquid methanol. The solvation dynamics of e  created by the electron trapping exhibit a pseudoisosbestic point at a pump-probe delay time of around  , and the peak  of the eBE distribution rapidly changes around that time. These results indicate that there exist two trap states, both of which exhibit increasing eBE with time; however, the eBE of the shallow trap state increases only up to 2.1 eV, and transformation to a deep trap state at 25  occurs to reach an eBE of 3.4 eV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27318451>Efficacy of zero-valent copper (Cu()) nanoparticles and reducing agents for dechlorination of mono chloroaromatics.</a></h2><p>The zero-valent copper (Cu()) nanoparticles were prepared by chemical reduction method. The morphology of nanoparticles was investigated by using X ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy- dispersive X ray, UV-visible spectrophotometer and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyser. The Cu() nanoparticles along with reducing agents, NaBH4/5% acidified alcohol were used for the dechlorination of chloroaromatics at room temperature. Chlorobenzene (Cl-B), chlorotoluene (Cl-T), chloropyridine (Cl-Py) and chlorobiphenyl (Cl-BPh) were selected as the contaminants. The effect of various operating parameters such as pH, concentration of the catalyst and reducing agent (NaBH4), and recycling of the catalyst on dechlorination were studied. Nearly complete dechlorination of all the chloroaromatics were achieved in the presence of Cu() nanoparticles (2.5 g L(-1)) and NaBH4 (1. g L(-1)) within 12 h. On the contrary, approximately 70% of dechlorination was observed in the presence of 5% acidified alcohol at similar experimental conditions. The dechlorination mechanism highlighted the importance of Cu() nanoparticles as a surface mediator. The kinetics of the dechlorination of chloroaromatics was investigated and compared with chloroaliphatics. The dechlorination rate differed from .23 h(-1) (Cl-B) to . h(-1) (Cl-BPh) in the presence of Cu() nanoparticles and NaBH4. The effectiveness of Cu() nanoparticles with NaBH4 (1 g L(-1)) and 5% acidified alcohol as electron donors were studied by oxidation-reduction potential and observed to be -1016 mV and -670 mV, respectively. Final products of the dechlorination were benzene, toluene, pyridine and biphenyl, as identified by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a next step, we compared the bactericidal effects of low molecular weight (LMW) combined with Photodynamic Therapy to high molecular weight (HMW) chitosan.To perform PDT to kill H. pylori, we used endoscopic light as light source, methylene blue (MB) as a photosensitizer and chitosan (310-375, 50-190 kDa). We evaluated bacterial removal rate and its membrane damage by ethidium bromide monoazide PCR method (EMA q-PCR). 8-oxo-2'-dexoyguanosine by ELISA was measured for oxidative stress.At a chitosan concentration of ≤.05%, the killing effect did not differ between the two molecular weights, and 100% bacterial removal rate was observed at a light  ≥ 6.23 mJ/cm powers under .02% MB. After  min irradiation, LMW chitosan with high concentration of MB (.004%) showed highest killing effects, which were consistent with the results of EMA q-PCR but not with the level of 8-OHdG. Bactericidal effects of LMW chitosan plus PDT using .002 and .004% MB for  min irradiation were significantly higher than those using HMW chitosan plus PDT.We found that PDT using methylene blue with LMW chitosan to kill H. pylori exerted greater bactericidal effects through bacterial membrane damage than PDT with HMW chitosan. These results suggest that it would be better to choose LMW chitosan to enhance the effect of PDT for clinical application, even at a very low concentration of .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The simulation was performed for an ion and 593 ammonia molecules in a box with a length of 29.03 Å corresponding to a liquid ammonia density of .69 g/mL at 235.16 K. The quantum mechanical calculation was carried out for atomic interactions in the radius of 6.4 Å from the ion using LANL2DZ ECP and DZP (Dunning) basis sets for Rb(I) ion and ammonia respectively. The trajectories of the simulation were analyzed in terms of radial, angular, and coordination number distribution functions, vibration, and mean residence time (MRT). Two solvation shell regions are observed for the Rb(I)-N as well as the Rb(I)-H. The maximum distance of Rb(I)-N in the first solvation shell is in accordance with experimental data where a coordination number of 8 is favorable. A non-single coordination number of the first and second shell indicates dynamic solvation structure. It is confirmed by frequent exchange ligand processes observed within a simulation time of  .

The grade of the stenoses was assessed in axial multiplanar reformations (MPR) before and multi-intensity projections (MIP) after plaque subtraction () and compared with results from CE-MRA and DSA according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial.Average grades of stenoses were 80.7 ± 16.1 % (DSA), 81.4 ± .3 % (MRA), 80. ± 16.7 % (DE-CTA-MPR), and 85.2 ± 14.7 % (DE-CTA--MIP). Of 21 stenoses, 6 were filiform (stenosis grade, 99 %) in the DSA examination. Five of these cases were identified as pseudo-occlusions in MRA, while four were considered as occlusions in DE-CTA--MIP. Another four cases were identified as pseudo-occlusion in DE-CTA--MIP, which were identified as 90 % stenosis in the DSA examination.In comparison with the gold standard DSA, DE-CTA-MPR had a slightly better agreement in measuring the degree of stenosis of the internal carotid arteries than CE-MRA. In DE-CTA--MIP images, a systematic overestimation has to be taken into account due to partial extinction of the lumen by the  algorithm.

This study investigated the PDT activity of a new water-soluble, anionic porphyrin (1-Zn), which possesses four negative charges. The photodynamic anticancer activity of 1-Zn was investigated by the MTT assay, with mTHPC as a positive control. The cellular distribution was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Holographic and phase contrast images were recorded after 1-Zn treatment with a HoloMonitor™ M3 instrument. The inhibition of A549 cell growth achieved by inducing apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. DNA damage was investigated by the comet assay. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was also measured by western blot assays. 1-Zn had better phototoxicity against A549 cells than HeLa and HepG2 cancer cells. Interestingly, 1-Zn was clearly located almost entirely in the cell cytoplasmic region/organelles. The late apoptotic population was less than 1.% at baseline in the untreated and only light-treated cells and increased to 40.5% after 1-Zn treatment and irradiation (P < .05). 1-Zn triggered significant ROS generation after irradiation, causing ΔΨm disruption (P < .01) and DNA damage. 1-Zn induced A549 cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In addition, 1-Zn bound in the groove of DNA via an outside binding mode by pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding. 1-Zn exhibits good photonuclease activity and might serve as a potential photosensitizer () for lung cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

To measure DOI information from a mono-layer array of scintillation crystals with a single-ended readout, our group has previously proposed and developed a new method based on light spread using triangular reflectors. Since this method relies on measurement of the light distribution, dSiPM, which has a fully digital interface, has several merits for our DOI measurement. The DOI PET detector comprised of a dSiPM sensor (DPC-3200-22-44) coupled with a 14   ×   14 array of 2 mm  ×  2 mm  ×  20 mm unpolished LGSO crystals. All crystals were covered with triangular reflectors. To obtain a good performance of the DOI PET detector, several parameters of detector were selected as a preliminary experiment. Detector performance was evaluated with the selected parameters and the optimal experimental setup, and a DOI measurement was conducted by irradiating the crystal block at five DOI positions spaced at intervals of 4 mm. Maximum-likelihood estimation was employed for DOI positioning and the optimal DOI estimation scheme was also investigated in this study. As a result, the DOI PET detector showed clear crystal identification. The  resolution (full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)) averaged over all depths was 10.21%  ±  .% at 511 keV, and time resolution averaged over all depths was 1198.61   ±   39.70  FWHM. The average DOI positioning accuracy for all depths was 74.22%  ±  6.77%, which equates to DOI resolution of 4.67 mm.  and DOI resolutions were uniform over all crystal positions except for the back parts of the array. Furthermore, additional simulation studies were conducted to verify the results of our DOI measurement method that is combined with dSiPM technology. In conclusion, our continuous DOI PET detector coupled with dSiPM is a promising PET/MRI detector with DOI-encoding capability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759321>The impact of driving force on electron transfer rates in photovoltaic donor-acceptor blends.</a></h2><p>The effect of acceptor  level on electron transfer rate in blends of the polymer solar-cell material poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) is studied using time-resolved fluorescence.

Don. Endl.) have been measured. We have shown that surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be used to study the fast subpicosecond dynamics of DNA in the proximity of a metallic surface. The dependencies of the total half band widths and the global relaxation times, on the DNA molecular subgroup structure and on the type of genomic DNA, are reported. In our study, the full widths at half-maximum (FWHMs) for the SERS bands of genomic DNAs from different leaf tissues are typically in the wavenumber range from  to 55 cm(-1). Besides, it can be observed that molecular relaxation processes studied in this work have a global relaxation time smaller than .71  and larger than .19 . A comparison between different ranges of FT-Raman and SERS band parameters, respectively, corresponding to DNA extracted from leaf tissues is given. It is shown that the interaction between DNA and a metallic surface has the potential to lead to a shortening of the global relaxation times, as compared with molecular dynamics in solution. We have found that the surface dynamics of molecular subgroups in plant DNA is, in some cases, about two times faster than the solution dynamics of nucleic acids. This can be rationalized in a qualitative manner by invoking the complex landscape of the interaction  between the molecule and the silver surface.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26510641>Synthesis of [n]Cyclo-5,-porphyrinylene-4,4'-biphenylenes Displaying Size-Dependent Excitation- Hopping.</a></h2><p>A set of 5,-biphenylene-bridged porphyrin wheels, namely, [n]cyclo-5,-porphyrinylene-4,4'-biphenylenes [n]CPB, have been synthesized through the platination of 5,-bis(4-(pinacolboranyl)phenyl) nickel(II) porphyrin and subsequent reductive elimination of Pt(II) (cod)-bridged cyclic porphyrin intermediates.

Systematic studies of time-resolved fluorescence quenching dependent on the donor concentration in the concentration range of .01-2 M and finally in neat donor solvents broadly enabled us to determine the electron transfer dynamics in three regimes of electron transfer: stationary or diffusion-controlled electron transfer, non-stationary electron transfer and intrinsic or ultrafast electron transfer. Depending upon the electron-donating ability of the studied donors, intrinsic electron transfer was found to occur in the time domain of ∼1-9  and diffusion-controlled ET dynamics was observed in the time domain of 200-500 , whereas the maximum limit of non-stationary electron transfer could be observed in the time domain of -50 . Femtosecond transient absorption studies together with global and target analysis helped to identify the spectral signature of the (HFTPP˙) radical anion as the product of ET. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever evidence that shows the spectra of an anion as the product of ET for any porphyrin-based electron transfer dynamics. However, transient absorption measurements confirm that intrinsic ET occurs in the Q state, whereas diffusion-controlled ET occurs in the hot Q as well as in the thermal equilibrium Q state. The most remarkable fact derived from the measurements of transient absorption was that the rate of the forward electron transfer (CS) is exactly the same as the rate of the backward electron transfer (CR) for all three regimes of ET. The thermodynamic driving force for CR was found to lie in the range of the total reorganization  for the studied systems and hence falls in the Marcus optimal region, and the CR process is barrierless. The dependence on the driving force of the combination of forward and reverse electron transfer exhibited a bell-shaped curve for all three regimes of electron transfer, even though the rate of intrinsic ET is higher by a factor of ∼10 than that of diffusion-controlled ET. These results unambiguously favour the Marcus theory, in particular the controversial Marcus inverted region, of outer-sphere electron transfer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27442986>Mineralization of naphtenic acids with thermally-activated persulfate: The important role of oxygen.</a></h2><p>This study reports on the mineralization of model naphtenic acids (NAs) in aqueous solution by catalyst-free thermally-activated persulfate () oxidation. These species are found to be pollutants in oil sands process-affected waters. The NAs tested include saturated-ring (cyclohexanecarboxylic and cyclohexanebutyric acids) and aromatic (2-naphthoic and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acids) structures, at 50mgL(-1)starting concentration. The effect of  dose within a wide range (10-100% of the theoretical stoichiometric) and working temperature (40-97°C) was investigated. At 80°C and intitial pH=8 complete mineralization of the four NAs was achieved with 40-60% of the stoichiometric  dose. This is explained because of the important contribution of oxygen, which was experimentally verified and was found to be more effective toward the NAs with a single cyclohexane ring than for the bicyclic aromatic-ring-bearing ones. The effect of chloride and bicarbonate was also checked. The former showed negative effect on the degradation rate of NAs whereas it was negligible or even positive for bicarbonate. The rate of mineralization was well described by simple pseudo-first order kinetics with values of the rate constants normalized to the  dose within the range of .062-.099h(-1).

The semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector has the advantage of measuring the depth of interaction with single-ended readout as compared to the traditional pixelated scintillator detector, and significantly reducing the edge effect that deteriorates the spatial resolution at edges of the detector as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector if a long rectangular semi-monolithic detector is used. In this work, depth-encoding PET detector modules were built by using long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillators and single-ended readout by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The performance of the detector modules was measured.The rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator detector has an outside dimension of 11.6 × 37.6 × 10 mm and consists of 11 polished lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) slices measuring 1 × 37.6 × 10 mm . The enhanced specular reflector (ESR) was glued on both cross-sectional surfaces of each crystal slice. For the face opposite to the SiPM array and the two end faces of the detectors, surface treatments with and without black paint were implemented for performance comparison. The bottom face of the semi-monolithic detector was coupled to a 4 × 12 SiPM array that was grouped along rows and columns separately into 16 signals. The four row signals were used to identify the slices, and the 12 column signals were used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth direction) interaction positions. The detector was irradiated at multiple positions with a collimated 511 keV gamma beam. The collimated beam was obtained with electronic collimation by using a  Na point source and a reference detector. The estimated width of the gamma beam is around .5 mm. The flood histogram for crystal slices was measured by using the center of gravity (COG) method. The COG method and the squared COG method were used for y position estimation. The standard deviation of the column signals, the ratio of maximum to the sum of the column signals, and the sum of squared column signals were used for z position estimation.All slices were clearly resolved from the measured flood histograms for both detectors with different crystal surface treatments. The estimated y positions roughly linearly change with the true positions at the middle of the detector until ~5 mm from both ends of the detector. The y and z spatial resolutions of the detectors were estimated for all middle positions located more than 5 mm from both ends of the detector. The squared COG method provides better y position resolution than the COG method. The three z estimation methods provide similar depth of interaction (DOI) resolution. Surface treatment with black paint significantly improves both y and z position resolution but degrades the  and timing resolution of the detectors. The average full width half maxima (FWHM) spatial resolution is improved from 1.77 to 1.07 mm in the y direction by using the squared COG method and from 2.71 to 1.55 mm in the z direction by using the standard deviation method. The slice-based average  resolution degrades from .8% to 24.9%. The timing resolution of the entire detector module degrades from 596 to 788 .The performance of rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors with two different crystal surface treatments was measured. The detectors provide superior spatial resolution and depth-encoding capability and can be used to develop small animal and dedicated breast and brain PET scanners that can simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26836144>A novel depth-of-interaction block detector for positron emission tomography using a dichotomous orthogonal symmetry decoding concept.</a></h2><p>Conventionally, a dual-end depth-of-interaction (DOI) block detector readout requires two two-dimensional silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, one on top and one on the bottom, to define the XYZ positions. However, because both the top and bottom SiPM arrays are reading the same pixels, this creates information redundancy. We propose a dichotomous orthogonal symmetric (DOS) dual-end readout block detector design, which removes this redundancy by reducing the number of SiPMs and still achieves XY and DOI (Z) decoding for positron emission tomography (PET) block detector. Reflecting films are used within the block detector to channel photons going to the top of the block to go only in the X direction, and photons going to the bottom are channeled along the Y direction. Despite the unidirectional channeling on each end, the top readout provides both X and Y information using two one-dimensional SiPM arrays instead of a two-dimensional SiPM array; similarly, the bottom readout also provides both X and Y information with just two one-dimensional SiPM arrays. Thus, a total of four one-dimensional SiPM arrays (4  ×  N SiPMs) are used to decode the XYZ positions of the firing pixels instead of two two-dimensional SiPM arrays (2  ×  N  ×  N SiPMs), reducing the number of SiPM arrays per block from 2N(2) to 4 N for PET/MR or PET/CT systems. Moreover, the SiPM arrays on one end can be replaced by two regular photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), so that a block needs only 2 N SiPMs  +  2 half-PMTs; this hybrid-DOS DOI block detector can be used in PET/CT systems. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to study the performance of our DOS DOI block detector design, including the XY-decoding quality,  resolution, and DOI resolution. Both BGO and LSO scintillators were studied. We found that 4 mm pixels were well decoded for 5  ×  5 BGO and 9  ×  9 LSO arrays with 4 to 5 mm DOI resolution and 16-20%  resolution. By adding light-channel decoding, we modified the DOS design to a high-resolution design, which resolved scintillator pixels smaller than the SiPM dimensions. Detector pixels of 2.4 mm were decoded for 8  ×  8 BGO and   ×   LSO arrays with 5 mm DOI resolution and 20-23%  resolution. Time performance was also studied for the 8  ×  8 BGO and   ×   LSO HR-DOS arrays. The timing resolution for the corner and central crystals is 986  ±  122  and 1.89  ±  .17 μs respectively with BGO, 137  ±  42  and 458  ±  67  respectively with LSO. Monte Carlo simulations with GATE/Geant4 demonstrated the feasibility of our DOS DOI block detector design. In conclusion, our novel design achieved good performance except the time performance while using fewer SiPMs and supporting electronic channels than the current non-DOI PET detectors. This novel design can significantly reduce the cost, heat, and readout complexity of DOI block detectors for PET/MR/CT systems that don't require the time-of-flight capability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197604>Influence of Age on Cardiorespiratory Kinetics During Sinusoidal Walking in Humans.</a></h2><p>We sought to determine the influence of age on cardiorespiratory kinetics during sinusoidal walking in two groups: 13 healthy young subjects (YG; 7 men and 6 women, age 21 ± 2 years) and  healthy elderly subjects (ELD; 9 men and 6 women, age 67 ± 5 years).

All binding events ended with a rapid (<10 ) lock-in of the fatty acid due to formation of a hydrogen bond with Tyr401. The kinetics and energetics of the penetration process both depended linearly on the positional shift of the fatty acid, with an average insertion time and free  reduction of, respectively, 32 ± 20  and .70 ± . kcal/mol per methylene group absorbed. Binding events of longer duration (tbind>1 ns) were characterized by a slow exploration of the pocket entry and, frequently, of a nearby protein crevice corresponding to a metastable state along the route to the binding site. Taken all together, these findings reconstruct the following pathway for the binding process of stearic acid: (i) contact with the protein surface, possibly facilitated by the presence of an intermediate location, (ii) probing of the site entry, (iii) insertion into the protein, and (iv) lock-in at the final position. This general description may also apply to other long-chain fatty acids binding into any of the high-affinity sites of albumin, or to specific sites of other lipid-binding proteins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The pulse length has been measured using a resonant 3 GHz deflecting cavity in TM mode. We have measured the pulse length in three ionization regimes. The first is direct two-photon photoionization using only a 480 nm femtosecond laser pulse, which results in short (∼ ) but hot (∼10K) electron bunches. The second regime is just-above-threshold femtosecond photoionization employing the combination of a continuous-wave 780 nm excitation laser and a tunable 480 nm femtosecond ionization laser which results in  ultracold (∼10 K)  ultrafast (∼25 ) electron bunches. These pulses typically contain ∼10 electrons and have a root-mean-square normalized transverse beam emittance of 1.5 ± .1 nm rad. The measured pulse lengths are limited by the  spread associated with the longitudinal size of the ionization volume, as expected.

Considering sub-lethal doses of PSs and photo-irradiation time of the diode laser, the expression of esp was evaluated through quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).ICG at a concentration of 31.2-1000 μg/mL and both TBO and MB at 6.2-100 μg/mL significantly reducedE. faecalis growth. 660, 635, and 810 nm diode laser with  density of 93.75-140.62, 137.5-206.25, and 31.25-62.5 J/cm, reduced the bacterial count. ICG with a concentration of .6 μg/mL and irradiation time of .5 min, TBO with a concentration of 3.1 μg/mL and irradiation time of 3 min, and MB with a concentration of 3.1 μg/mL and irradiation time of 3 min were found as a sPDT dose against E. faecalis. The esp expression was significantly reduced at sub-lethal doses of ICG compared to TBO (2 fold) and MB (2.4 fold).Although all tested PSs showed bacterial reduction, ICG may be considered as the best  in treating endodontic infection due to its higher efficacy in reduction of esp expression which has a main role in biofilm formation of E. faecalis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The E. coli K-12 inactivation kinetics observed in batch experiments was well described with first-order reaction. The optimum inactivation rate (k = .47 log/min) attained at a NP dose of 1 g/L and a  dose of 1 mM, corresponding to total inactivation of 7 log cfu/mL cells within  min. Measured k increased > 2-fold when temperature increased from 20 to 50 °C; and > 4-fold when pH decreased from 9 to 3. Aerobic conditions were more beneficial to cell inactivation than anaerobic conditions due to more reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated. ROS responsible for the inactivation were identified to be SO > OH > HO based on a positive scavenging test and in situ ROS determination. In situ characterization suggested that  effectively bind to NP surface was likely to form charge transfer complex (≡Fe(II)⋯OSOOSO), which mediated ROS generation and E. coli K-12 oxidation. The increased cell-envelope lesions consequently aggravated intracellular protein depletion and genome damage to cause definite bacterial death. The NP still maintained good physiochemical structure and stable activity even after 4 cycle. Moreover, NP/ system also exhibited good E. coli K-12 inactivation efficiency in authentic water matrices like surface water and effluents of secondary wastewater.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Core-shell nanoparticles, in which  nm crystalline Si is embedded within the amorphous SiO matrix, form under typical -PVD conditions, while 10 nm amorphous particles are formed when processed with an increased degree of non-equilibrium effect. Addition of CH promotes reduction in the oxygen content  of SiO  , and thereby increases the Si volume in a nanocomposite particle. As a result, core-shell nanoparticles with  = .46 as anode exhibit increased initial efficiency and the capacity of lithium ion batteries while maintaining cyclability. Furthermore, it is revealed that the disproportionation reaction of SiO is promoted in nanosized particles attaining increased Si diffusivity by two orders of magnitude compared to that in bulk, which facilitates instantaneous composite nanoparticle formation during -PVD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263947>Development of capacitive multiplexing circuit for SiPM-based time-of-flight (TOF) PET detector.</a></h2><p>There has been great interest in developing a time-of-flight (TOF) PET to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of PET image relative to that of non-TOF PET. Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays have attracted attention for use as a fast TOF PET photosensor. Since numerous SiPM arrays are needed to construct a modern human PET, a multiplexing method providing both good timing performance and high channel reduction capability is required to develop a SiPM-based TOF PET. The purpose of this study was to develop a capacitive multiplexing circuit for the SiPM-based TOF PET. The proposed multiplexing circuit was evaluated by measuring the coincidence resolving time (CRT) and the  resolution as a function of the overvoltage using three different capacitor values of , 30, and 51 pF. A flood histogram was also obtained and quantitatively assessed. Experiments were performed using a [Formula: see text] array of [Formula: see text] mm SiPMs. Regarding the capacitor values, the multiplexing circuit using a smaller capacitor value showed the best timing performance. On the other hand, the  resolution and flood histogram quality of the multiplexing circuit deteriorated as the capacitor value became smaller. The proposed circuit was able to achieve a CRT of [Formula: see text]  FWHM and an  resolution of 17.1[Formula: see text] with a pair of [Formula: see text] mm LYSO crystals using a capacitor value of 30 pF at an overvoltage of 3. V. It was also possible to clearly resolve a [Formula: see text] array of LYSO crystals in the flood histogram using the multiplexing circuit. The experiment results indicate that the proposed capacitive multiplexing circuit is useful to obtain an excellent timing performance and a crystal-resolving capability in the flood histogram with a minimal degradation of the  resolution, as well as to reduce the number of the readout channels of the SiPM-based TOF PET detector.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25774956>Picosecond  transfer and multiexciton transfer outpaces Auger recombination in binary CdSe nanoplatelet solids.</a></h2><p>Fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) enables photosynthetic light harvesting, wavelength downconversion in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and optical biosensing schemes. The rate and efficiency of this donor to acceptor transfer of excitation between chromophores dictates the utility of FRET and can unlock new device operation motifs including quantum-funnel solar cells, non-contact chromophore pumping from a proximal LED, and markedly reduced gain thresholds. However, the fastest reported FRET time constants involving spherical quantum dots (.12-1 ns; refs 7-9) do not outpace biexciton Auger recombination (.01-.1 ns; ref. 10), which impedes multiexciton-driven applications including electrically pumped lasers and carrier-multiplication-enhanced photovoltaics. Few-monolayer-thick semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with tens-of-nanometre lateral dimensions exhibit intense optical transitions and hundreds-of-picosecond Auger recombination, but heretofore lack FRET characterizations.

This study investigated the performance of the 5-ring system and compared it to 3- and 4-ring systems; the GE Discovery IQ system that uses conventional photomultiplier tubes; and the GE Signa PET/MR system that has a reduced transaxial FOV.PET performance was evaluated at three different institutions. Spatial resolution, sensitivity, counting rate performance, accuracy, and image quality were measured in accordance with National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU 2-2012 standards. The mean  resolution, mean timing resolution, and PET/CT subsystem alignment were also measured. Phantoms were used to determine the effects of varying acquisition time and reconstruction parameters on image quality. Retrospective patient scans were reconstructed with various scan durations to evaluate the impact on image quality.Results from all three institutions were similar. Radial/tangential/axial full width at half maximum spatial resolution measurements using the filtered back projection algorithm were 4.3/4.3/5. mm, 5.5/4.6/6.5 mm, and 7.4/5./6.6 mm at 1, 10, and 20 cm from the center of the FOV, respectively. Measured sensitivity at the center of the FOV (20.84 cps/kBq) was significantly higher than systems with reduced axial FOV. The peak noise-equivalent counting rate was 266.3 kcps at 20.8 kBq/ml, with a corresponding scatter fraction of 40.2%. The correction accuracy for count losses up to the peak noise-equivalent counting rate was 3.6%. For the 10-, 13-, 17-, 22-, 28-, and 37-mm spheres, contrast recoveries in the image quality phantom were measured to be 46.2%, 54.3%, 66.1%, 71.1%, 85.3%, and 89.3%, respectively. The mean  and timing resolution were 9.55% and 381.7 , respectively. Phantom and patient images demonstrated excellent image quality, even at short acquisition times or low injected activity.Compared to other PET/CT models, the extended axial FOV improved the overall PET performance of the 5-ring GE Discovery MI scanner.

The five readouts include reading out the 20 signals (16 position and 4 timing) individually, two signal multiplexing readouts, and two position decoding readouts. Flood histogram quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and  resolution were compared at different bias voltage (27. V to 32. V, at .5 V intervals) and at a fixed temperature of  °C by coupling a 6 × 6 array of 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm × 20 mm polished LSO crystals to the center of the -SSPM array. The timing resolution was measured at a bias voltage of 31. V (optimal bias voltage in terms of flood histogram quality). The best flood histogram quality value and signal-to-noise were 7.3 ± 1.6 and 33.5 ± 3.1, respectively, and were obtained by shaping and digitizing the 16 position signals individually. The capacitive charge-division readout is the simplest readout among the five evaluated but still resulted in good performance with a flood histogram quality value of 3.3 ± .4 and a SNR of 18.3 ± 1.3. The average  resolution and the average timing resolution were .2 ± 1.2 % and 8.4 ± 1.6 ns for individual signal readout and .9 ± 1.2 % and 8.8 ± 1.3 ns by using the capacitive charge-division readout method.

Photoexcitation of PTZ in CHCN with a 517 nm laser pulse populates a D electronically excited doublet state that decays first to the unrelaxed lowest electronic excited state, D' (τ < .3 ), followed by relaxation to D (τ = 10.9 ± .4 ), which finally decays to D (τ = 32.3 ± .8 ). D' can also be populated directly using a lower  900 nm laser pulse, which results in a longer D'→D relaxation time (τ = 19 ± 2 ). To probe the oxidative power of PTZ photoexcited doublet states, PTZ was covalently linked to each of three hole acceptors, perylene (Per), 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA), and 10-phenyl-9-anthracenecarbonitrile (ACN), which have oxidation potentials of 1.04, 1.27, and 1.6 V vs SCE, respectively. In all three cases, photoexcitation wavelength dependent ultrafast hole transfer occurs from D, D', or D of PTZ to Per, DPA, and ACN. The ability to take advantage of the additional oxidative power provided by the upper excited doublet states of PTZ will enable applications using this chromophore as a super-oxidant for -demanding reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668764>Robustness of an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor for low strength and salinity wastewater treatment at ambient to winter temperatures.</a></h2><p>Acclimation performances and characteristics of aerobic granular sludge to salt and temperature were investigated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) performing simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal (SNDPR). The aerobic granular SNDPR system was firstly subjected to low salinity (.5%, w/v) at moderate temperature (>  ℃) and subsequent low temperature (<  ℃). The shock loading of salinity temporarily deteriorated biological phosphorus removal, while dual stresses of salinity and low temperature induced temporary inhibition on both nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Both salinity and low temperature stimulated the settleability of aerobic granules, accompanied with decreased ratios of protein to polysaccharide (PN/). Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that salinity rarely affected bacterial richness, but significantly decreased the diversity. Whereas low temperature strengthened both bacterial richness and diversity. Phyla Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and their sub-groups acted as the main halophilic bacteria while Proteobacteria was also psychrophilic. The functional bacteria such as nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and phosphorus removal bacteria exhibited greater tolerance to salt and low temperature than glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs). Overall, the present study demonstrated the resilience and robustness of aerobic granular sludge toward salinity and low temperature, which could aid the knowledge of saline wastewater treatment by aerobic granular sludge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Chem. Phys. 2011 , 134 , 104503 ] is further explored with ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and the results are compared with recently reported high-level theoretical calculations. Three types of experiments are reported. First, variation of the excitation wavelength from 297 to 266 nm leaves the excited state dynamics unaffected. The biexponential decay of the excited state absorption is independent of excitation wavelength with time constants of .57 ± .06 and 1.88 ± .09 , in excellent agreement with the results reported earlier (.56 ± .06 and 1.81 ± . ) following excitation at 266 nm. Second, variation of the chirp of the excitation pulse influences the relative amplitude of the fast and slow decay components but has no influence on the photoproduct yield. Third, a 545 nm pulse delayed by .64  with respect to the initial 266 nm pulse was used to perturb the "slow" population and probe the influence of additional electronic or vibrational  on the reaction process. The results show ultrafast internal conversion Sn → S1 on a ca. 150 fs time scale but no subsequent effect on the reaction dynamics. The experiments reported here are consistent with the recent state averaged complete active space self-consistent field ab initio multiple spawning (SA-CASSCF-AIMS) calculations of Snyder et al. [ J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2016 , 7 , 2444 ] that assign the biexponential decay to nonequilibrium dynamics related to the opening and closing motion of the cyclohexadiene ring moiety on the excited state surface.

A critical need exists to develop and test the psychometrics of brief quantitative tools for minority pediatric populations.To modify the adult beverage intake questionnaire (BEVQ-) for Hispanic preschool-aged children (BEVQ-) and test its validity and test-retest reliability in children aged 3 to 5 years.Cross-sectional. The modified quantitative 12-beverage category questionnaire assessed consumption of water, fruit juice, sweetened juice drinks, whole milk, reduced-fat milk, low-fat milk, flavored milk, carbonated sweetened drinks, diet carbonated drinks, sweet tea, tea with or without artificial sweetener, and sport drinks consumed during the past month. Hispanic mothers (n=109) recruited from day-care centers provided one 4-day food intake record (FIR) and completed two BEVQ- surveys during a 2-week period for their preschool-aged child. Data collection was conducted through one-on-one interviews in Spanish. Validity was assessed by comparing amounts (in grams) and  intake (in kilocalories) for each beverage category between the first BEVQ- and the mean of the FIRs using paired t tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Criteria for validity were nonsignificant mean differences in grams and kilocalories from the first BEVQ- and mean of the FIRs beverage categories, and significant correlation coefficients between beverage categories. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing grams and kilocalories for each beverage category in the first BEVQ- with those from the second BEVQ- using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The criterion for reliability was a significant correlation coefficient between beverage categories. Significance was set at P<.05.Mean differences between the first BEVQ- and FIR for water (42.4±23.1 g), sweetened juice drinks (-1.6±11. g), whole milk (18.3±9.91 g), sweetened carbonated drinks (-13.±7.9 g), and total sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) (1.4±8.9 g) were not significantly different, but were significantly correlated (r=.20 to .37; P<.05). Thus, validity criteria were met. With the exception of flavored milk and tea with or without artificial sweeteners, the remaining beverage categories-total beverages and SSB-in the first BEVQ- were correlated with those from the second BEVQ- (r=.20 to .68; P<.05), meeting reliability criteria.Researchers and clinicians may use the BEVQ- to assess SSB, water, and whole-milk intake in Hispanic children.

A photosensitizing site (Ru()) was introduced by treating cis-[Ru(bpy) (dimethylsulfoxide)Cl]Cl with BPy-PMO. Then a catalytic site (Ru(Cat)) was brought in Ru() -BPy-PMO by reaction with a ruthenium polymer [Ru(CO) Cl ] . The stepwise modification of BPy-PMO successfully affords a novel photocatalyst Ru() -Ru(Cat) -BPy-PMO. The molar fractions (x, y) of Ru() and Ru(Cat) were determined by  dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement and quantification of the amount of CO emitted in the photo-decarbonylation of Ru(Cat), respectively. Photochemical CO reduction (λ >430 nm) by Ru() -Ru(Cat) -BPy-PMO in a CO -saturated N,N-dimethylacetamide/water solution containing 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide catalytically produced CO and formate. The total turnover frequency of CO and formate reached more than 162 h on x=.11 and y=.0055. The product selectivity (CO/formate) became large when the ratio of Ru()-to-Ru(Cat) (x/y) was increased. The photocatalysts can be recycled at least three times without losing their catalytic activity, demonstrating that the Ru() and Ru(Cat) units were strongly immobilized on the BPy-PMO framework.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Ground State Amino Twist Not Essential for ICT.</a></h2><p>From X-ray structure analysis, amino twist angles of 90.° for 2,4-dimethyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (mMMD), 82.7° for 4-(di-tert-butylamino)benzonitrile (DTABN), and 88.7° for 6-cyanobenzoquinuclidine (CBQ) are determined, all considerably larger than the 57.4° of 3,5-dimethyl-4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (MMD). This large twist leads to lengthening of the amino-phenyl bond, 143.5 pm (mMMD), 144.1 pm (DTABN), 144.6 pm (CBQ), and 141.4 pm (MMD), as compared with 136.5 pm for the planar 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN). As a consequence, the electronic coupling between the amino and phenyl subgroups in mMMD, DTABN, CBQ, and MMD is much weaker than in DMABN, as seen from the strongly reduced molar absorption coefficients. The fluorescence spectrum of MMD in n-hexane at 25 °C consists of two emissions, from a locally excited (LE) and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state, with a fluorescence quantum yield ratio Φ'(ICT)/Φ(LE) of 12.8. In MeCN, a single ICT emission is found. With mMMD in n-hexane, in contrast, only LE fluorescence is observed, whereas the spectrum in MeCN originates from the ICT state. These differences are also seen from the half-widths of the overall fluorescence bands, which in n-hexane are larger for MMD than for mMMD, decreasing with solvent polarity for MMD and increasing for mMMD, reflecting the disappearance of LE and the onset of ICT in the overall spectra, respectively. From solvatochromic measurements the dipole moments μe(ICT) of MMD (16 D) and mMMD ( D) are obtained. Femtosecond excited state absorption (ESA) spectra at 22 °C, together with the dual (LE + ICT) fluorescence, reveal that MMD in n-hexane undergoes a reversible LE ⇄ ICT reaction, with LE as the precursor, with a forward rate constant ka = 5.6 × 10(12) s(-1) and a back-reaction kd ∼ .05 × 10(12) s(-1). With MMD in the strongly polar solvent MeCN, ICT is faster: ka = 10 × 10(12) s(-1). In the case of mMMD in n-hexane, the ESA spectra show that ICT does not take place, contrary to MeCN, in which ka = 2.5 × 10(12) s(-1). The ICT reactions with MMD and mMMD are much faster than that of the parent compound DMABN in MeCN, with ka = .24 × 10(12) s(-1). Because of the very short ICT reaction times of 180 fs (MMD, n-hexane), 100 fs (MMD, MeCN), and 400 fs (mMMD, MeCN), it is clear that the picosecond fluorescence decays of these systems appear to be single exponential, due to the insufficient time resolution of 3 . It is concluded that the faster LE → ICT reaction of MMD as compared with DMABN (ka = .24 × 10(12) s(-1) in MeCN) is caused by a smaller  gap ΔE(S1,S2) between the lowest singlet excited states and not by the large amino twist angle. Similarly, the larger ΔE(S1,S2) of mMMD as compared with MMD is held responsible for its smaller ICT efficiency (no reaction in n-hexane).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861927>Comparison of rhenium-porphyrin dyads for CO photoreduction: photocatalytic studies and charge separation dynamics studied by time-resolved IR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>We report a study of the photocatalytic reduction of CO to CO by zinc porphyrins covalently linked to [Re(2,2'-bipyridine)(CO)L] moieties with visible light of wavelength >520 nm.  contains an amide CHNHC(O) link from porphyrin to bipyridine (Bpy),  contains an additional methoxybenzamide within the bridge CHNHC(O)CH(OMe)NHC(O), while  has a saturated bridge CHNHC(O)CH; each dyad is studied with either L = Br or 3-picoline.

The performance of the dyads with Re-Br units is very similar to that of the dyads with [Re-pic] units in spite of the adverse free  of electron transfer. The dyads undergo reactions during photocatalysis: hydrogenation of the porphyrin to form chlorin and isobacteriochlorin units is detected by visible absorption spectroscopy, while IR spectroscopy reveals replacement of the axial ligand by a triethanolaminato group and insertion of CO into the latter to form a carbonate. Time-resolved IR spectra of  and  (560 nm excitation in CHCl) demonstrated electron transfer from porphyrin to Re(Bpy) units resulting in a shift of (CO) bands to low wavenumbers.

The TRIR spectra of  and  are quite different showing a mixture of MLCT, IL and charge-separated excited states. In the case of , the charge-separated state is absent altogether. The TRIR spectra emphasize the very different excited states of the bromide complexes and the picoline complexes. Thus, the similarity of the photocatalytic data for bromide and picoline dyads suggests that they share common intermediates.

Q4D059 shows low sequence similarity with mammal proteins and because of its essentiality demonstrated in T. brucei, it is a potential target for anti-parasitic drugs. The 11 hypothetical proteins homologous to Q4D059 are all uncharacterized proteins of unknown function. Here, the solution structure of Q4D059 was solved by NMR and its backbone dynamics was characterized by ()N relaxation parameters. The structure is composed by a parallel/anti-parallel three-stranded β-sheet packed against four helical regions. The structure is well defined by ca. 9 NOEs per residue and a backbone rmsd of .50±.05 Å for the representative ensemble of 20 lowest- structures. The structure is overall rigid except for N-terminal residues A(9) to D(11) at the beginning of β1, K(38), V(39) at the end of helix H3 with rapid motion in the -ns timescale and G(25) (helix H2), I(68) (β2) and V(78) (loop 3) undergoing internal motion in the μs-ms timescale. Limited structural similarities were found in protein structures deposited in the PDB, therefore functional inferences based on protein structure information are not clear. Q4D059 adopts a α/β fold that is slightly similar to the ATPase sub-domain IIB of the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and to the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L11.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This time-of-flight (TOF) PET camera is based on silicon photomultipliers instead of photomultiplier tubes.The NEMA NU2-2012 standard was used to evaluate spatial resolution, sensitivity, image quality (IQ) and count rate curves of the system. Timing and  resolution were determined.Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of spatial resolution in radial, tangential and axial direction was 4.69, 4.08 and 4.68 mm at 1 cm; 5.58, 4.64 and 5.83 mm at 10 cm; and 7.53, 5.08 and 5.47 mm at 20 cm from the centre of the field of view (FOV) for the filtered backprojection reconstruction. For non-TOF ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction without point spread function (PSF) correction, FWHM was 3.87, 3.69 and 4. mm at 1 cm; 4.80, 3.81 and 4.87 mm at 10 cm; and 7.38, 4.16 and 3.98 mm at 20 cm. Sensitivity was 7.258 cps/kBq at the centre of the FOV and 7.117 cps/kBq at 10-cm radial offset. Contrast recovery (CR) using the IQ phantom for the TOF OSEM reconstruction without PSF correction was 47.4, 59.3, 67. and 77.% for the 10-, 13-, 17- and 22-mm radioactive spheres and 82.5 and 85.1% for the 28- and 37-mm non-radioactive spheres. Background variability (BV) was 16.4, 12.1, 9.1, 6.6, 5.1 and 3.8% for the 10-, 13-, 17-, 22-, 28- and 37-mm spheres. Lung error was 8.5%. Peak noise equivalent count rate (NECR) was 102.3 kcps at 23. kBq/ml with a scatter fraction of 41.2%. Maximum accuracy error was 3.88%. Coincidence timing resolution was 375.6  FWHM.  resolution was 9.3% FWHM. Q.Clear reconstruction significantly improved CR and reduced BV compared with OSEM.System sensitivity and NECR are lower and IQ phantom's BV is higher compared with larger axial FOV (AFOV) scanners like the 4-ring discovery MI, as expected from the smaller solid angle of the 3-ring system. The other NEMA performance parameters are all comparable with those of the larger AFOV scanners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084213>Spectral lineshapes in nonlinear electronic spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>We outline a computational approach for nonlinear electronic spectra, which accounts for the electronic  fluctuations due to nuclear degrees of freedom and explicitly incorporates the fluctuations of higher excited states, induced by the dynamics in the photoactive state(s). This approach is based on mixed quantum-classical dynamics simulations. Tedious averaging over multiple trajectories is avoided by employing the linearly displaced Brownian harmonic oscillator to model the correlation functions. The present strategy couples accurate computations of the high-lying excited state manifold with dynamics simulations. The application is made to the two-dimensional electronic spectra of pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon characterized by an ultrafast (few tens of femtoseconds) decay from the bright S2 state to the dark S1 state. The spectra for waiting times t2 =  and t2 = 1  demonstrate the ability of this approach to model electronic state fluctuations and realistic lineshapes. Comparison with experimental spectra [Krebs et al., New Journal of Physics, 2013, , 085016] shows excellent agreement and allows us to unambiguously assign the excited state absorption features.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059250>Massively Parallel Implementation of Steered Molecular Dynamics in Tinker-HP: Comparisons of Polarizable and Non-Polarizable Simulations of Realistic Systems.</a></h2><p>Steered molecular dynamic (SMD) is a powerful technique able to accelerate rare event sampling in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations by applying an external force to a set of chosen atoms. Despite generating nonequilibrium simulations, SMD remains capable of reconstructing equilibrium properties such as the Potential of Mean Force (PMF). Of course, one would like to use all types of force fields (FF) ranging from classical ones to more advanced polarizable models using point induced dipoles and distributed multipoles such as AMOEBA. To enable such studies, the SMD methodology has been implemented in the framework of the massively parallel Tinker-HP software allowing for both long polarizable and non-polarizable MD simulations of large proteins. To validate this new implementation, we first compared the Tinker-HP SMD results to the literature. Tests have been performed on three different benchmark systems: the M-A deca-alanine (112 atoms), the ubiquitin (9737 atoms), and the CD2CD58 complex (97594 atoms). Non-polarizable (AMBER99, AMBER99SB, CHARMM22/CMAP, and OPLS-AA/L) and polarizable (AMOEBAPRO13 and AMOEBABIO18) force fields have been used. For each one of them, PMFs have been reconstructed and compared in terms of free  barrier and hydrogen bonding fluctuations behavior over time. Using a SMD velocity of .01 Å/ applied to a set of 20 trajectories, we show that polarizable and non-polarizable force fields do not always agree. As it could be anticipated, strong discrepancies are noticed between polarizable and non-polarizable models when considered in vacuum, whereas results are more comparable when a water environment is added. However, for the largest system, i.e., the CD2CD58 complex, strong differences related to the modeling of a salt bridge are noticed exhibiting some potential issues with classical FFs. Overall, such simulations highlight the importance of the inclusion of polarization effects as PMF free  barriers computed with AMOEBA always decrease compared to non-polarizable force fields.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930799>Mechanical Efficiency at Different Exercise Intensities Among Adolescent Boys With Different Body Fat Levels.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the mechanical efficiency (ME) and associated factors in obese, overweight, and normal-weight adolescent boys during incremental cycle exercise test to exhaustion. Forty-five sedentary adolescent boys (13-14 years old) were separated in three groups according to the percentage of fat mass as follows:  normal-weight (NW) (body fat: 16. ± 1.9%),  overweight (OW) (body fat: 24. ± 1.6%), and  obese (OB) (body fat: 31. ± 3.%). All groups completed an incremental cycle exercise to exhaustion in which  consumption (E, W), ME (%), lipid oxidation rate (LO, %), plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were determined consecutively at rest and at three intensity levels corresponding to 50 and 75% of each participant's maximal heart rate (50%HRmax and 75%HRmax) and peak oxygen consumption (  O). During the incremental cycle exercise test, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine responses as well as ME determined at 50%HRmax, 75%HRmax, and at VO stages were significantly lower in OB compared to NW and OW individuals ( < .01). Multiple linear regressions showed that body weight (ß = -.64,  < .001),  consumption (ß = -.24,  < .05) and lipid oxidation (ß = .69,  < .01) were significant predictors of ME at 50%HRmax. However, at 75%HRmax and  O, significant predictors of ME were epinephrine (ß = .34, ß = .49, respectively,  = .01), norepinephrine (ß = .26, ß = .60, respectively,  < .05) and power output (ß = .62, ß = .71, respectively,  < .01). These findings suggest that excess in body weight exerts a negative effect on ME at a low intensity by increasing  consumption for obese and overweight adolescent boys, while at higher intensities (75%HRmax and VO) the lower ME could be better explained by the lower power output and catecholamine responses that were attenuated among obese and overweight adolescent boys.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094396>Nanostructuration of ionic liquids: impact on the cation mobility. A multi-scale study.</a></h2><p>When probed at the macroscopic scale, Ionic Liquids (ILs) behave as highly dissociated (i.e. strong) electrolytes while, at the molecular scale, they show clear characteristics of weak ionic solutions. The multi-scale analysis we report in this paper reconciles these apparently at odds behaviors. We investigate by quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and neutron spin-echo (NSE), the nanometer/nanosecond dynamics of OMIM-BF, an imidazolium-based IL showing strong nanostructuration. We also probe the same IL on the microscopic (μm and ms) scale by pulsed field gradient NMR. To interpret the neutron data, we introduce a new physical model to account for the dynamics of the side-chains and for the diffusion of the whole molecule. This model describes the observables over the whole and unprecedented investigated spatial ([.-1.65] Å) and time ([.5-2000] ) ranges. We arrive at a coherent and unified structural/dynamical description of the local cation dynamics: a localized motion within the IL nanometric domains is combined with a genuine long-range translational motion. The QENS, NSE and NMR experiments describe the same long-range translational process, but probed at different scales. The associated diffusion coefficients are more than one order of magnitude different. We show how this apparent discrepancy is a manifestation of the IL nanostructuration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29783203>Mechanical characterization and ion release of bioactive dental composites containing calcium phosphate particles.</a></h2><p>to verify the effect of the addition of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) particles functionalized with di- or triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA or TEGDMA) on the degree of conversion (DC), post-gel shrinkage (), mechanical properties, and ion release of experimental composites.Four composites were prepared containing a BisGMA/TEGDMA matrix and 60 vol% of fillers. The positive control contained only barium glass fillers, while in the other composites  vol% of the barium was replaced by DCPD. Besides the functionalized particles, non-functionalized DCPD was also tested. DC after 24 h (n = 3) was determined by FTIR spectroscopy. The strain gage method was used to obtain  5 min after photoactivation (n = 5). Flexural strength and modulus (n = 10) were calculated based on the biaxial flexural test results, after specimen storage for 24 h or 60 days in water. The same storage times were used for fracture toughness testing (FT, n = 10). Calcium and phosphate release up to 60 days was quantified by ICP-OES (n = 3). Data were analyzed by ANOVA/Tukey test (alpha: 5%).Composites containing functionalized DCPD presented higher DC than the control (p < .001). The material containing DEGDMA-functionalized particles showed higher  than the other composites (p < .001). After 60 days, only the composite with DEGDMA-functionalized DCPD presented fracture strength similar to the control, while for flexural modulus only the composite with TEGDMA-functionalized particles was lower than the control (p < .001). FT of all composites containing DCPD was higher than the control after 60 days (p < .005). Calcium release was higher for the composite with non-functionalized DCPD at  days and no significant reductions were observed for composites with functionalized DCPD during the observation period (p < .001). For all the tested composites, phosphate release was higher at  days than in the subsequent periods, and no difference among them was recorded at 45 and 60 days (p < .001).DCPD functionalization affected all the studied variables. The composite with DEGDMA-functionalized particles was the only material with strength similar to the control after 60 days in water; however, it also presented the highest shrinkage. The presence of DCPD improved FT, regardless of functionalization. DCPD functionalization reduced ion release only during the first  days.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, many physical and chemical properties of N2O5 at the surface or in bulk water are unknown or not microscopically understood. This study presents extensive new results on the physical properties of N2O5 in water and at the surface of water, with a focus on their microscopic basis. The main results are obtained using ab initio molecular dynamics and calculations of a potential of mean force. These include: (1) collisions of N2O5 with water at 300 K lead to trapping at the surface for at least 20  and with 95% probability. (2) During that time, there is no N2O5 hydrolysis, evaporation, or entry into the bulk. (3) Charge separation between the NO2 and NO3 groups of N2O5, fluctuates significantly with time. (4)  accommodation of the colliding N2O5 at the surface takes place within picoseconds. (5) The binding  of N2O5 to a nanosize amorphous ice particle at  K is on the order of  kcal mol-1 for the main surface site. N2O5 binding to the cluster is due to one weak hydrogen bond and to interactions between partial charges on the N2O5 and on water. (6) The free- profile was calculated for transporting N2O5 from the gas phase through the interface and into bulk water. The corresponding concentration profile exhibits a propensity for N2O5 at the aqueous surface. The free  barrier for entry from the surface into the bulk was determined to be 1.8 kcal mol-1. These findings are used to interpret recent experiments. We conclude with implications of this study for atmospheric chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017156>Study of  transfer by different light curing units into a class III restoration as a function of tilt angle and distance, using a MARC Patient Simulator ().</a></h2><p>The MARC Patient Simulator (MARC ) enables researchers to observe the influence of handling errors on the radiant exposure that is delivered by light curing units (LCUs). Changes in the tilt angle and distance of the light guide exit face in relation to the surface of the composite increment have a distinct effect on the total amount of light delivered during polymerization and may cause insufficient conversion of the material. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the influence of the tilt angle and distance of irradiance on the efficiency of light application by recording the total amount of  using the anterior tooth sensor of the MARC .The influence of the tilt angle and distance of the light guide to the sensor surface on the delivered radiant exposure was examined for three different LCUs (Celalux 2 [C2], Bluephase [BP] and Translux Powerblue [TPB]). The measurements were performed for 20 s each with five different tilt angles (α=°, 5°, 10°, °, 20°) and nine different distances (L=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 mm).For all LCUs, a distinct influence of the tilt angle on the delivered amount of fluence was found. At ° tilt the C2 delivered a total light  of 38.55 J/cm(2). By increasing the tilt of the light guide the amount of  applied significantly decreased. At 20° tilt a reduction by 31.2% of the original light fluence was recorded. However, the C2 was the most powerful LCU measured. Even under optimum measurement conditions, the BP delivered a fluence of only 14.8 J/cm(2). At a tilt angle of 20°, though, the light sensor still registered 92.7% of the original output power. Under the same conditions, the TPB delivered 81.4%. With increasing distance of the light guide exit face to the surface of the sensor all LCUs showed a significant loss in delivered light . At a distance of 2mm the C2 showed a reduction by 46.7%, whereas total fluence of BP and TPB were reduced by 3.8% and 4.8%, respectively.The choice of LCU and the application of an appropriate curing time are important for successful polymerization. Nevertheless, a perpendicular positioning of the light guide as close as possible to the surface of the composite increment is of essential importance in order to ensure sufficient delivery of light.Copyright © 2016 Academy of Dental Materials.

Related molecules with identical end groups, triphenylamine-C≡C-1,4-C6H2(OR)2-C≡C-triphenylamine (R = C6H13; 6) and diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-[C≡C-C6H2(OR)2]2-C≡C-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (R = C6H13; 7) were also studied. These D-B-A 1-5, D-B-D 6 and A-B-A 7 (D = electron donor, B = bridge, A = electron acceptor) systems were synthesized using palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions of new p-phenyleneethynylene building blocks. Steady-state emission studies on the dyads 1-5 reveal a complicated behavior of the emission that is strongly medium dependent. In low polarity solvents the emission is characterized by a sharp high- peak attributed to fluorescence from a locally excited (LE) state. In more polar environments the LE state is effectively quenched by transfer into an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state. The medium dependence is also observed in the quantum yields (QYs) which are high in cyclohexane and low in acetonitrile, thus also indicating charge-transfer character. Low-temperature emission spectra for 2-5 in dichloromethane and diethyl ether also reveal two distinct excited states, namely the LE state and the conventional ICT state, depending on solvent and temperature. Hybrid DFT calculations for 1-7 establish that the OPE bridge is involved in both frontier orbitals where the bridge character increases as the bridge length increases. Computed TD-DFT data on 1-5 assign the emission maxima in cyclohexane as LE transitions. Each time-resolved emission measurement on 2-7 in cyclohexane and diethyl ether reveals a wavelength dependent bi-exponential decay of the emission with a fast component in the 5-61  range on blue detection and a slower approximately 1 ns phase, independent of detection wavelength. The fast component is attributed to LE fluorescence and this emission component is rate limited and quenched by transfer into an ICT state. The fast LE fluorescence component varies systematically with conjugation length for the series of D-B-A dyads 2-5. An attenuation factor β of . Å(-1) was determined in accordance with an ICT superexchange mechanism.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Fat-free mass index in a diverse sample of male collegiate athletes. J Strength Cond Res 33(6): 1474-1479, 2019-Fat-free mass index (FFMI) is a body composition metric that has been used to assess relative muscularity in athletes. Fat-free mass index is calculated by dividing FFM by height squared, although further height corrections through linear regression may be needed in taller individuals. This study reported height-adjusted FFMI (FFMIAdj) data in 209 male collegiate athletes from 10 sports (baseball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, weightlifting, rugby, swimming, track and field, and water polo) and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit for sports with sufficient sample size. The body composition of all subjects (mean ± SD; age: 20.7 ± 1.9 years, height: 182.9 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 90.8 ± 16.8 kg, and percent body fat: .6 ± 5.3) was measured using dual- x-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression was used to adjust for height, and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit was determined by calculating the 97.5th percentile of all values. One-way analyses of variance with Games-Howell post hoc comparisons were used to determine between-sport differences. A paired-samples t-test revealed a significant difference (p < .001) between unadjusted and adjusted mean FFMI values. The overall mean FFMIAdj was 22.8 ± 2.8 kg·m. Significant between-sport differences (p < .001) in FFMIAdj were identified. Average FFMIAdj was highest in football athletes (24.28 ± 2.39 kg·m) and lowest in water polo athletes (20.68 ± 3.56 kg·m). The FFMIAdj upper limit was calculated for all athletes (28.32 kg·m), rugby (29.1 kg·m), and baseball (25.5 kg·m). This study reported FFMIAdj values in a diverse cohort of male collegiate athletes, providing data for the first time in several sports.

The absorbance of the secondary radical H2PO4(•) formed within 7  of the electron pulse is observed using pulse-probe method in the visible. Kinetic analysis shows that the radicals of phosphoric acid are formed via two mechanisms: direct electron detachment and oxidation by the radical cation of water, H2O(•+).

This model has been successful in predicting the radiation drive in vacuum hohlraums, but for gas-filled hohlraums used to drive capsule implosions, the model consistently predicts too much drive and capsule bang times earlier than measured. In this work, we introduce a new model that brings the calculated bang time into better agreement with the measured bang time. The new model employs (1) a numerical grid that is fully converged in space, , and time, (2) a modified approximate NLTE model that includes more physics and is in better agreement with more detailed offline emissivity models, and (3) a reduced flux limiter value of .03. We applied this model to gas-filled hohlraum experiments using high density carbon and plastic ablator capsules that had hohlraum He fill gas densities ranging from .06 to 1.6 mg/cc and hohlraum diameters of 5.75 or 6.72 mm. The new model predicts bang times to within ±100  for most experiments with low to intermediate fill densities (up to .85 mg/cc). This model predicts higher temperatures in the plasma than the old model and also predicts that at higher gas fill densities, a significant amount of inner beam laser  escapes the hohlraum through the opposite laser entrance hole.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27764714>Propulsion strategy in the gait of primary school children; the effect of age and speed.</a></h2><p>The strategy used to generate power for forward propulsion in walking and running has recently been highlighted as a marker of gait maturation and elastic  recycling. This study investigated ankle and hip power generation as a propulsion strategy () during the late stance/early swing phases of walking and running in typically developing (TD) children (: six to nine years; 17: nine to 13years) using three-dimensional gait analysis. Peak ankle power generation at push-off (peakA2), peak hip power generation in early swing (peakH3) and propulsion strategy () [peakA2/(peakA2+peakH3)] were calculated to provide the relative contribution of ankle power to total propulsion. Mean  values decreased as speed increased for comfortable walking (p<.001), fast walking (p<.001) and fast running (p<.001), and less consistently during jogging (p=.054).  varied with age (p<.001) only during fast walking. At any speed of fast walking, older children generated more peakA2 (p=.001) and less peakH3 (p=.001) than younger children. While the kinetics of running propulsion appear to be developed by age six years, the skills of fast walking appeared to require additional neuromuscular maturity. These findings support the concept that running is a skill that matures early for TD children.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The undoped and Mn-doped CdZnSSe alloy NCs have been characterized by employing high-resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction, -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. A low-temperature injection of chalcogens led to a gradient interface in the alloy, comprised of a CdSe/CdS/ZnSe/ZnS nanostructure. Both steady-state and ultrafast time-resolved absorption studies suggested the formation of a charge-transfer (CT) state due to the inner quasi-type II CdSe/CdS part of the gradient CdZnSSe alloy NCs, in which electrons are delocalized throughout the conduction band (CB) of both CdSe and CdS. The CT-state bleach recovery kinetics gave an additional slow electron cooling component (8 ) in the undoped alloy NCs, which has been assigned to electron equilibration in the delocalized CB before recombination (or trapping). Interestingly, in the presence of dopant Mn, the slow electron cooling component became even more sluggish at 10  due to Mn-mediated electron cooling, in which Mn acts as an electron storage center. An unprecedented increase in the photocurrent conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 30 % from (3.3±.11) to (4.29±.07) % was observed in the Mn-doped gradient alloy compared with the undoped alloy.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The semi-monolithic scintillator detector consists of 11 polished LYSO slices measuring 1  ×  11.6  ×  10 mm. The slices are glued together with enhanced specular reflector (ESR) in between and outside of the slices. The bottom surface of the slices is coupled to a 4  ×  4 SiPM array with a 1 mm light guide and silicon grease between them. No reflector is used on the top surface and two sides of the slices to reduce the scintillation photon reflection. The signals of the 4  ×  4 SiPM array are grouped along rows and columns separately into eight signals. Four SiPM column signals are used to identify the slices according to the center of the gravity of the scintillation photon distribution in the pixelated direction. Four SiPM row signals are used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth of interaction) positions according to the center of the gravity and the width of the scintillation photon distribution in the monolithic direction, respectively. The detector was measured with 1 mm sampling interval in both the y and z directions with electronic collimation by using a .25 mm diameter Na point source and a 1  ×  1  ×  20 mm LYSO crystal detector. An average slice based  resolution of 14.9% was obtained. All slices of 1 mm thick were clearly resolved and a detector with even thinner slices could be used. The y positions calculated with the center of gravity method are different for interactions happening at the same y, but different z positions due to depth dependent edge effects. The least-square minimization and the maximum likelihood positioning algorithms were developed and both methods improved the spatial resolution at the edges of the detector as compared with the center of gravity method. A mean absolute error (MAE) which is defined as the probability-weighted mean of the absolute value of the positioning error is used to evaluate the spatial resolution. An average MAE spatial resolution of ~1. mm was obtained in both y and z directions without rejection of the multiple scattering events. The average MAE spatial resolution was ~.7 mm in both y and z directions after the multiple scattering events were rejected. The timing resolution of the detector is 575 . In the next step, long rectangle detector will be built to reduce edge effects and improve the spatial resolution of the semi-monolithic detector. Thick detector up to 20 mm will be explored and the positioning algorithms will be further optimized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717785>The effects of high concentrations of ionic liquid on GB1 protein structure and dynamics probed by high-resolution magic-angle-spinning NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Ionic liquids have great potential in biological applications and biocatalysis, as some ionic liquids can stabilize proteins and enhance enzyme activity, while others have the opposite effect. However, on the molecular level, probing ionic liquid interactions with proteins, especially in solutions containing high concentration of ionic liquids, has been challenging. In the present work the C, N-enriched GB1 model protein was used to demonstrate applicability of high-resolution magic-angle-spinning (HR-MAS) NMR spectroscopy to investigate ionic liquid - protein interactions. Effect of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, [C-mim]Br) on GB1was studied over a wide range of the ionic liquid concentrations (.6 to 3.5 M, which corresponds to 10%-60% v/v). Interactions between GB1 and [C-mim]Br were observed from changes in the chemical shifts of the protein backbone as well as the changes in N -ns dynamics and rotational correlation times. Site-specific interactions between the protein and [C-mim]Br were assigned using 3D methods under HR-MAS conditions. Thus, HR-MAS NMR is a viable tool that could aid in elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ionic liquid - protein interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176705>Changes in Temperature Sensitivity and Activation  of Soil Organic Matter Decomposition in Different Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Grasslands.</a></h2><p>Qinghai-Tibet Plateau grasslands are unique geographical regions and store substantial soil organic matter (SOM) in the soil surface, which make them very sensitive to global climate change. Here, we focused on three main grassland types (alpine meadow, steppe, and desert) and conducted a soil incubation experiment at five different temperatures (5, 10, , 20, and 25°C) to investigate SOM decomposition rates (R), temperature sensitivity (Q10), and activation  (Ea). The results showed that grassland type and incubation temperature had significant impact on R (P < .001), and the values of R were exponential correlated with incubation temperature in three alpine grasslands. At the same temperature, R was in the following order: alpine meadow > alpinesteppe > alpine desert. The Q10 values differed significantly among different grasslands, and the overall trends were as follows: alpine meadow (1.56 ± .09) < alpine steppe (1.88 ± .23) < alpine desert (2.39 ± .32). Moreover, the Ea values differed significantly across different grassland types (P < .001) and increased with increasing incubation time. The exponential negative correlations between Ea and R at 20°C across all grassland types (all  < .001) indicated that the substrate-quality temperature hypothesis is applicable to the alpine grasslands. Our findings provide new insights for understanding the responses of SOM decomposition and storage to warming scenarios in this Plateau.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29873297>An improved time over threshold method using bipolar signals.</a></h2><p>The time over threshold (TOT) method has been recently proposed as a signal processing method used to calculate time and  information by measuring the pulse arrival time and pulse duration over a preset threshold. Although TOT has been reported as an effective method for front end readout in PET applications, it has several limitations, including its non-linearity, lower dynamic range, and a trade-off between  resolution and coincidence resolving time (CRT). In this study, we propose a novel design we developed to improve performance with regard to these problems occurring in the conventional TOT by employing a bipolar signal and two comparators. Using a high frequency CR shaping filter, a detected signal was converted into a bipolar signal, and the positive pulse of the converted bipolar signal had a fast rising time, while the negative pulse had a linear slope. The bipolar TOT circuit was composed of a preamplifier, a CR shaping filter, and two comparators. The PET detector was composed of a single LYSO coupled with 4  ×  4 SiPM arrays, a bipolar TOT circuit, and an FPGA based TDC. And this was constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed bipolar TOT method. A 16-ch PET detector module consisting of a 4  ×  4 array LYSO coupled to a 4  ×  4 SiPM arrays, an Anger logic discretized positioning circuit, and a 4-ch bipolar TOT circuit was also constructed to evaluate the functionality of the bipolar TOT method for PET applications. The pulse height resolution and CRT were measured using both the bipolar TOT method and the conventional TOT method. While the bipolar TOT method provided a similar pulse height resolution (10.4%  ±  .1%), the integral non-linearity (1.4%) and CRT (168  ±  4 ) measured using the bipolar TOT method were greatly improved compared to those (17.2% and 258  ±   , respectively) measured with the conventional TOT method. The positions of the crystals were clearly identified, as seen in the flood histogram acquired using the 4-ch bipolar TOT circuit. The measured average pulse height resolution and average CRT for the 16-ch detector module were 11.5%  ±  .2% and 516  ±  24 . The results obtained in this study indicate that the bipolar TOT method requiring a relatively small number of electronic components could effectively improve the CRT, linearity and dynamic range. Furthermore, they also demonstrated the extendibility allowing the development of a PET system that consists of a large number of detectors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25606675>Functional rearrangement of the light-harvesting antenna upon state transitions in a green alga.</a></h2><p>State transitions in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serve to balance excitation  transfer to photosystem I (PSI) and to photosystem II (PSII) and possibly play a role as a photoprotective mechanism. Thus, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) can switch between the photosystems consequently transferring more excitation  to PSII (state 1) or to PSI (state 2) or can end up in LHCII-only domains. In this study, low-temperature (77 K) steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measured on intact cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii shows that independently of the state excitation  transfer from LHCII to PSI or to PSII occurs on two main timescales of <  and ∼ 100 . Moreover, in state 1 almost all LHCIIs are functionally connected to PSII, whereas the transition from state 1 to a state 2 chemically locked by .1 M sodium fluoride leads to an almost complete functional release of LHCIIs from PSII. About 2/3 of the released LHCIIs transfer  to PSI and ∼ 1/3 of the released LHCIIs form a component designated X-685 peaking at 685 nm that decays with time constants of .28 and 5.8 ns and does not transfer  to PSI or to PSII. A less complete state 2 was obtained in cells incubated under anaerobic conditions without chemical locking. In this state about half of all LHCIIs remained functionally connected to PSII, whereas the remaining half became functionally connected to PSI or formed X-685 in similar amounts as with chemical locking. We demonstrate that X-685 originates from LHCII domains not connected to a photosystem and that its presence introduces a change in the interpretation of 77 K steady-state fluorescence emission measured upon state transitions in Chalamydomonas reinhardtii.Copyright © 2015 Biophysical Society.

The clusters were created in a pulsed supersonic beam and two-photon excited by femtosecond laser pulses with a wavelength of 263 nm. The measurements were performed using the pump-probe method and electron spectroscopy. It is shown that relaxation of light clusters Xe (N < ) predominantly occurs by desorption of excited xenon atoms with a characteristic time constant of 3 . Heavier electronically excited clusters (N > 10) vibrationally relax to the lowest electronically excited state at a rate of about .075 eV/. Multiply excited clusters are deactivated via  exchange between excited centers with the ionization of one of them.

An aqueous phenol solution (100 mg L) was selected as model effluent. The studied variables include current density (1-10 mA cm), persulfate concentration (.7-2.85 g L), temperature (30-90°C) and the solution conductivity (2.7-20.7 mS cm) using NaSO and NaCl as supporting electrolyte. A mineralization degree of around 80% with NaSO and 92% in presence of NaCl was achieved at 30°C using 2. g L  at the lowest current density tested (1 mA cm). Besides  concentration, temperature was the main variable affecting the process. In the range of 30-70°C, it showed a positive effect, achieving TOC conversion above 95% (using NaSO under the previous conditions) along with a significant increase in iron sludge, which adversely affects the economy of the process. A lumped and simplified kinetic model based on persulfate consumption and TOC mineralization is suggested. The activation  obtained for the TOC decay was 29 kJ mol. An estimated operating cost of US$ 3.00 per m was obtained, demonstrating the economic feasibility of this process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26613472>Separating Exchange Splitting from Spin Mixing in Gadolinium by Femtosecond Laser Excitation.</a></h2><p>Employing spin-, time-, and -resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present the first study on the spin polarization of a single electronic state after ultrafast optical excitation.

In this study, the rhenium compound Re(dcbyp)(CO)3NCS (Re-NCS), which served as a model CO2 reduction catalyst, was investigated using two dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. The vibrational relaxation dynamics and rotational dynamics of Re-NCS were measured by monitoring both the CO and NCS vibrational modes. The rotational dynamics measurement of the CO vibrational stretch shows a single exponential decay with a time constant of 140 ± 10 . In contrast, a bi-exponential decay is needed to describe the rotational dynamics of the NCS stretching mode with time constants of 1.5 ± .3  and 189 ±  . The 2D IR experiment indicated that the carbonyl CO vibrational modes in Re-NCS are strongly coupled. Furthermore, the intramolecular vibrational  transfer between CO and NCS stretching modes was observed and analyzed based on an  exchange model. The  down flowing transfer from CN to CO stretching mode was determined using time constants of 50 . The relatively slow intramolecular vibrational  transfer rate suggests that there is a weak coupling between CO and NCS ligands. Further theoretical calculation showed that the coupling strength between CO and CN is relatively weak and is about 5-6 times smaller than the coupling strength between the CO vibrational modes in Re-NCS. The distinct structural dynamics of the NCS ligand in Re-NCS presented in this study should provide a fundamental understanding of the role of an anionic ligand in rhenium photo-catalysts, which is believed to play an important role in the photo-catalytic reduction of CO2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26242232>Trajectories of length, weight, and bone mineral density among preterm infants during the first 12 months of corrected age in China.</a></h2><p>Limited evidence has been provided on the trajectories of length, weight, and bone mineral density (BMD) among preterm infants in early life in Asian countries.We conducted a longitudinal study, which included 652 late preterm (gestational age: 34-36.9 weeks), 486 moderate preterm (32-33.9), 291 very preterm (28-31.9), 149 extremely preterm infants (≤ 28.9) and 1434 full-term peers (≥ 37) during the first 12 months of corrected age in Wuhan, China.

Position-specific body composition values in female collegiate rugby union athletes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Rugby union is a full-contact, intermittent team sport. Anthropometric characteristics of rugby union athletes have been shown to influence suitability for a given position and affect performance. However, little anthropometric data exist in female rugby union athletes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to report position-specific anthropometric, body composition, and bone density values in female collegiate rugby union athletes and to identify between-position differences in these variables. This investigation was a cross-sectional study involving 101 female collegiate rugby union athletes, categorized as forwards and backs as well as by position (props, hookers, locks, flankers, number 8 forwards, halfback, fly-half, centers, wings, and fullbacks). Anthropometric characteristics of all athletes were measured, and body composition was assessed via dual- x-ray absorptiometry. Outcome variables included age, height, body mass, BMI, body fat percentage, fat mass (FM), FM index, fat-free mass (FFM), FFM index, lean soft tissue, bone mineral content, bone mineral area, and bone mineral density. Anthropometric and body composition differences between forwards and backs were identified via independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, depending on normality of the variable. Between-position differences were assessed using one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons or Welch's ANOVA with Dunnett's T3 post-hoc test. Significant differences (p < .014) were identified between forwards and backs for every anthropometric variable, with forwards displaying greater height (167.7 ± 7.2 cm), body mass (81.5 ± .1 kg), and body fat percentage (28.2 ± 6.1%) relative to backs (164.5 ± 5.1 cm; 64.5 ± 7.7 kg; 21.9 ± 3.7%). Likewise, significant differences were identified for every anthropometric variable between several positions (p < .01). Significant (p < .05) interposition differences were identified within the subgroup of forwards, but not within the subgroup of backs. The present investigation is the first to report position-specific anthropometric and body composition data in female collegiate rugby union athletes.

Direct Red 23.</a></h2><p>Effluents from the paper printing and textile industries are often heavily contaminated with azo dyes. Azo dyes are difficult to oxidize biologically. This work investigated the decolorization of an azo dye, C.I. Direct Red 23 (DR23), by persulfate () activated with Fe() aggregates (/Fe()). Ultrasound (US) and heat were used as enhancement tools in the  oxidation system. Neither US-activated  nor thermally activated  was effective in oxidizing DR23. However, the decolorization was significantly enhanced by /Fe() combined with US (/Fe()/US) or heat (/Fe()/55 °C). Approximately 95% decolorization of 1×10(-4) M DR23 was achieved within  min in the /Fe()/US system at an initial pH of 6.,  of 5×10(-3) M, Fe() of .5 g/L and US irradiation of 106 W/cm(2) (60 kHz). Complete decolorization was achieved within 10 min in the Fe()//55 °C system. The rate of decolorization doubled when US was introduced in the /Fe() system during the treatment of different initial dye concentrations. The dependence of dye and true color (ADMI) depletion on  concentration has been discussed. DR23 was completely degraded based on the disappearance of aromatic groups of UV-vis spectra and the variation of TOC mineralization. The observed pseudo-first-order decolorization rate was substantially enhanced by increasing temperature. The Arrhenius activation  for the  activated with Fe() was estimated as 8.98 kcal/mol, implying that higher temperature is beneficial for the DR23 decolorization. The addition of US into the /Fe() system did not incur a substantial increase in electricity, whereas the mineralization of DR23 occurred quickly. Thus, both /Fe()/US and heated /Fe() systems are practically feasible for the effective degradation of the direct azo dye in textile wastewater.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The type of dietary protein may modulate postprandial metabolism.We studied the effect of dietary protein type on postprandial changes in the metabolome after a high-fat meal.In a 3-period, crossover, postprandial study, 10 healthy overweight men with an elevated waist circumference (>94 cm) ingested high-fat meals made up of cream fat (70% of ), sucrose (% ), and protein (% ) from either casein (CAS), whey protein (WHE), or α-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein (LAC). Urine collected immediately before and 2, 4, and 6 h after the meal was analyzed for metabolomics, a secondary outcome of the clinical study. We used mixed-effect models, partial least-square regression, and pathway enrichment analysis.At 4 and 6 h after the meal, the postprandial metabolome was found to be fully discriminated according to protein type. We identified 17 metabolites that significantly explained the effect of protein type on postprandial metabolomic changes (protein-time interaction). Among this signature, acylcarnitines and other acylated metabolites related to fatty acid or amino acid oxidation were the main discriminant features. The difference in metabolic profiles was mainly explained by urinary acylcarnitines and some other acylated products (protein type,  < .0001), with a dramatically greater increase (100- to 1000-fold) after WHE, and to a lesser extent after LAC, as compared with CAS. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that the type of protein had modified fatty acid oxidation (P < .05).Taken together, our results indicate that, in healthy overweight men, the type of protein in a high-fat meal interplays with fatty acid oxidation with a differential accumulation of incomplete oxidation products. A high-fat meal containing WHE, but not CAS, resulted in this outpacing of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

In the reported experiments, SAv coated Polystyrene () particles are deposited on a layer of Bi.PEG receptors, bound to a silicon (Si) substrate by silanization. The substrate and the bonded particles are subjected to a pulsed ultrasonic excitation field and their nanometer scale out-of-plane dynamic responses are acquired using a laser vibrometer. The acquired waveforms are processed to obtain the resonance frequencies of the particle motion. Employing a particle adhesion model, the average spring constant of the single ligand-receptor complex and the effective Young's modulus and work-of-adhesion of the SAv-Bi.PEG ligand-receptor layer are extracted from the resonance frequencies. The average spring constant of an individual SAv-Bi.PEG bond is approximated as .1-.4 mN/m.

In this study, a molecularly imprinted polymer was obtained by incorporating fluorescent nanodiamond into a creatinine-imprinted polyacrylamide hydrogel. The quenching of peak nanodiamond fluorescence was significantly higher in the creatinine-imprinted polymer compared to the non-imprinted polymer, indicative of higher creatinine affinity in the imprinted polymer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and microscopic imaging was used to investigate the nature of chemical bonding and distribution of nanodiamonds inside the hydrogel network. Nanodiamonds bind strongly to the hydrogel network, but as aggregates with average particle diameter of 3.4 ± 1.8 µm and 3.1 ± 1.9 µm for the non-imprinted and molecularly imprinted polymer, respectively. Nanodiamond fluorescence from nitrogen-vacancy color centers (NV and NV) was also used to detect creatinine based on nanodiamond-creatinine surface charge interaction. Results show a % decrease of NV/NV emission ratio for the creatinine-imprinted polymer compared to the non-imprinted polymer, and are explained in terms of changes in the near-surface band structure of diamond with addition of creatinine. With further improvement of sensor design to better disperse nanodiamond within the hydrogel, fluorescent sensing from nitrogen-vacancy centers is expected to yield higher sensitivity with a longer range (Coulombic) interaction to imprinted sites than that for a sensor based on acceptor/donor resonance  transfer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772036>Sarcopaenia is associated with NAFLD independently of obesity and insulin resistance: Nationwide surveys (KNHANES 2008-2011).</a></h2><p>Although sarcopaenia is associated with obesity-related comorbidities, its influence on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis has not been fully determined. We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual- X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of obesity (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to obesity or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of obesity or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The results were compared to the control group for statistical proposes. Scanning electronic microscope analysis was used to access structural changes in biofilm.Red laser alone and MB alone were not able to inactivate bacterial biofilm. APDI groups showed differences when compared to the control group and they were dependent on the exposure time. No statistically significant differences were observed among the APDI groups at 1 and 3min of irradiation. On the other hand, 5min of APDI showed 99.85% of bacterial reduction (p=.0004). In addition, the biofilm loose its structure following 5min APDI.The results of this study suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm can be inactivated by MB mediated APDI.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), consisting of a blend of amorphous polymer and dielectric nanofillers, have been studied intensely to satisfy these goals; however, nanoparticle aggregates, field localization due to dielectric mismatch between particle and matrix, and the poorly understood role of interface compatibilization have challenged progress. To expand the understanding of the inter-relation between these factors and, thus, enable rational optimization of low and high contrast PNC dielectrics, we compare the dielectric performance of matrix-free hairy nanoparticle assemblies (aHNPs) to blended PNCs in the regime of low dielectric contrast to establish how morphology and interface impact  storage and breakdown across different polymer matrices (polystyrene, , and poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and nanoparticle loadings (-50% (v/v) silica). The findings indicate that the route (aHNP versus blending) to well-dispersed morphology has, at most, a minor impact on breakdown strength trends with nanoparticle volume fraction; the only exception being at intermediate loadings of silica in PMMA (% (v/v)). Conversely, aHNPs show substantial improvements in reducing dielectric loss and maintaining charge/discharge efficiency. For example, low-frequency dielectric loss (1 Hz-1 kHz) of  and PMMA aHNP films was essentially unchanged up to a silica content of 50% (v/v), whereas traditional blends showed a monotonically increasing loss with silica loading. Similar benefits are seen via high-field polarization loop measurements where  storage for ∼% (v/v) silica loaded PMMA and  aHNPs were 50% and 200% greater than respective comparable PNC blends. Overall, these findings on low dielectric contrast PNCs clearly point to the performance benefits of functionalizing the nanoparticle surface with high-molecular-weight polymers for polymer nanostructured dielectrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650043>Proton beam therapy delivered using pencil beam scanning vs. passive scattering/uniform scanning for localized prostate cancer: Comparative toxicity analysis of PCG 001-09.</a></h2><p>Patient-level benefits of proton beam therapy (PBT) relative to photon therapy for prostate cancer (PC) continue to be the focus of debate. Although trials comparing the two modalities are underway, most are being conducted using "conventional" PBT (passive scattering/uniform scanning [/US]) rather than pencil beam scanning (PBS). The dosimetric benefits of PBS are well-known, but comparative data are limited. This analysis compares PBS toxicity rates with those of /US in a prospective multicenter registry.We evaluated acute/late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity rates for men with low-to-intermediate risk PC enrolled in PCG 001-09. Acute toxicities with the two techniques were compared using χ tests, and the cumulative incidence methods for late toxicity. Multivariable analyses (MVAs) for acute toxicity were performed using logistic regression, and cox proportional hazards models for late toxicity.Patients were treated using /US (n = 1105) or PBS (n = 238). Acute grade ≥2 GI toxicity in PBS did not significantly differ from that with /US (2.9% and 2.1%, respectively; P = .47). Acute grade ≥2 GU toxicity was significantly higher with PBS (21.9% and .1%; P < .01). In MVA, PBS was significantly associated with increased acute grade ≥2 GU toxicity (RR = 1.57, p < .001). Late grade ≥2 GI and GU toxicities did not differ significantly between groups.This is the first multi-institutional comparative effectiveness evaluation of PBT techniques in PC. Differences in acute GU toxicity warrant further evaluation, and highlight the urgent need for prospective data using PBT.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26165478>The paravertebral muscle and psoas for the maintenance of global spinal alignment in patient with degenerative lumbar scoliosis.</a></h2><p>Various factors are reported to affect the spinal alignment in degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS). Although trunk muscles also appear to affect spinal alignment, the role of the trunk muscles is not yet clear.The aim was to elucidate the role of the multifidus (MF) and psoas () in maintaining global spinal alignment in patients with DLS.This was a multicenter retrospective matched cohort study.Surgically treated 60 paired DLS and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) female (120 patients), matched for age and body mass index (BMI; DLS age 68.±6.8 vs. LSS 67.1±8.9 years; BMI 21.6±3.3 vs. 23.2±3.8 kg/m(2)), were included and were followed for at least 2 years.Spinal alignment, muscle area, and volume were measured from radiographs, magnetic resonance images (MRIs), and whole-body dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Muscle strength was measured by grip power and peak expiratory flow (PEF).As a surrogate of muscle area, we obtained the cross-sectional area (CSA) at the L5-S level from preoperative MRIs.The MF and  CSAs were significantly smaller in the DLS group than in the LSS group (MF 477.7±192.5 vs. 779.8±248.6 mm(2), p<.01;  692.3±201.2 vs. 943.4±272.4 mm(2), p=.002), whereas percentage of difference between the right and left sides was significantly larger in the DLS group (MF 18.4±30.6 vs. 2.4±3.3%, p<.01;  14.4±.8 vs. 2.1±2.2%, p<.01). In the extremities, there were no significant differences in the left- or right-side lean composition and grip strength or PEF tests between the groups. Correlation coefficient tests showed moderate correlations between the MF average CSA (avCSA) and global spinal alignment and spinopelvic alignment (pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis; R=-.37, -.38) in the DLS group. The MF avCSA was correlated with the postoperative progression of kyphosis at the unfused thoracic vertebrae in the DLS group (R=.34).The CSAs of the MF and  were significantly smaller in the DLS group. Whole-body DXA showed no significant difference in the lean composition between the groups. There were significant correlations in the DLS patients between the MF CSA and sagittal spinal alignment. These findings suggest the causal relationship between muscles and global spine alignment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The storage (G') and loss (G″) moduli, creep and creep-recovery behavior of these films were studied. The creep behavior of these films at long time frame was studied using time-temperature superposition (TTS). The CNFs were uniformly distributed within these films up to % of CNFs. The -only and the /CNFs nanocomposite films exhibited dominant elastic behavior. The incorporation of CNFs increased both the G' and G″. The CNFs improved the creep resistance and reduced the creep recovery rate of the /CNFs nanocomposite films. TTS method was successfully used to predict the creep behavior of these films at longer time frame.

The dual-ended readout is one of the common methods that can achieve good DOI resolution. The aim of this study is to evaluate a dual-ended readout detector based on silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) and TOFPET2 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The detector is based on 4 [Formula: see text] 4 lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) units, each unit contained 6 [Formula: see text] 6 LYSO crystals, and the crystal size was 1 [Formula: see text] 1 [Formula: see text] 20 mm. The four lateral surfaces of LYSO crystals were mechanically ground to W14 (surface roughness 10-14 [Formula: see text]m), and the two ended surfaces were polished (surface roughness  <.5 [Formula: see text]m). The reflector was Toray Lumirror E60, and the packing fraction of the LYSO block was 86.5%. Each LYSO unit was read out from both ends with two Hamamatsu S13361-3050AE-08 SiPM arrays. The analog output signals of SiPM were digitized by PETsys TOFPET2 ASIC and acquired by PETsys SiPM Readout System. The ASIC and SiPM were cooled by a fan and a Peltier element. To investigate the crystal resolvability, different light guide thicknesses including .8, 1, 1.2 and 2 mm were tested. The light guide was made of optical glass (H-K9L-Foctek Photoincs), and the size and refractive index were 6.45 [Formula: see text] 6.45 mm and 1.53 (at 420 nm), respectively. To characterize the detector performance at different depths, another 1 [Formula: see text] 25.8 [Formula: see text] 20 mm single LYSO slab was used. Data were acquired at 10 depths (1, 3, …, 19 mm), and each depth had a 10 min acquisition time and about 40 thousand coincidence events. During the experiment, the SiPM temperature was controlled as 27.6 [Formula: see text] .4 °C. The results showed that the 1.2 mm light guide offered the best crystal resolvability.

At pH 5., the UASB reactor showed a 20-30% decrease in reactor performance compared to operation at pH 5.5 to 7., reaching removal efficiencies of 79%, %, 43% and 61% for NO, SO, Se and Se, respectively. However, the reactor stability was an issue upon lowering the pH to 5. and further experiments are recommended. The sludge formed during low pH operation had a fluffy, floc-like appearance with filamentous structure, possibly due to the low polysaccharide () to protein (PN) ratio (.01 /PN) in the soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of the biomass. Scanning electron microscopy with  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis of the sludge confirmed Se oxyanion reduction and deposition of Se particles inside the biomass. Microbial community analysis using Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that the families of Campylobacteraceae and Desulfomicrobiaceae were the dominant phylotypes throughout the reactor operation at approximately 23% and 10% relative abundance, respectively. Furthermore, approximately 10% relative abundance of both Geobacteraceae and Spirochaetaceae was observed in the granular sludge during the pH 5. operation. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of UASB operation at pH values ranging from 7. to 5. for removing Se and other oxyanions from wastewaters.Copyright © 2018.

In addition to detailed structural characterization obtained by using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cryogenic TEM techniques, ultrafast fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) from coumarin 153 (C153) as a donor (D) to rhodamine 6G (R6G) as an acceptor (A) is also used to study micelle-vesicle transitions in the present system. Structural transitions of SAIL micelles ([C4mim][C8SO4] or [C12mim]Cl micelles) to mixed SAIL vesicles resulted in significantly increased D-A distances, and therefore, increased timescale of FRET. In [C4mim][C8SO4] micelles, FRET between C153 and R6G occurs on an ultrafast timescale of 3.3 , which corresponds to a D-A distance of about  Å. As [C4mim][C8SO4] micelles are transformed into mixed micelles upon the addition of a .25 molar fraction of [C12mim]Cl, the timescale of FRET increases to 300 , which suggests an increase in the D-A distance to 31 Å. At a .5 molar fraction of [C12mim]Cl, unilamellar vesicles are formed in which FRET occurs on multiple timescales of about 250 and 2100 , which correspond to D-A distances of 33 and 47 Å. Although in micelles and mixed micelles the obtained D-A distances are well correlated with their radius, in vesicles the obtained D-A distance is within the range of the bilayer thickness.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We hypothesized that baseline IR would be positively associated with follow-up body mass index (BMI) and fat mass.Two hundred and forty-nine healthy African American and Caucasian children aged 6-12 years at high risk for adult obesity because of early-onset childhood overweight and/or parental overweight were followed for up to  years with repeated BMI and fat mass measurements. We examined baseline serum insulin and homeostasis model of assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) as predictors of follow-up BMI Z-score and fat mass by dual- X-ray absorptiometry in mixed model longitudinal analyses accounting for baseline body composition, pubertal stage, sociodemographic factors and follow-up interval.At baseline, 39% were obese (BMI⩾95th percentile for age/sex). Data from 1335 annual visits were examined. Children were followed for an average of 7.2±4.3 years, with a maximum follow-up of  years. After accounting for covariates, neither baseline insulin nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up BMI (>.26), BMIz score (>.22), fat mass (>.78) or fat mass percentage (>.71). In all models, baseline BMI (P<.0001), body fat mass (P<.0001) and percentage of fat (P<.001) were strong positive predictors for change in BMI and fat mass. In models restricted to children without obesity at baseline, some but not all models had significant interaction terms between body adiposity and insulinemia/HOMA-IR that suggested less gain in mass among those with greater insulin or IR. The opposite was found in some models restricted to children with obesity at baseline.In middle childhood, BMI and fat mass, but not insulin or IR, are strong predictors of children's gains in BMI and fat mass during adolescence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25493511>Development of image quality assurance measures of the ExacTrac localization system using commercially available image evaluation software and hardware for image-guided radiotherapy.</a></h2><p>Quality assurance (QA) of the image quality for image-guided localization systems is crucial to ensure accurate visualization and localization of target volumes. In this study, a methodology was developed to assess and evaluate the constancy of the high-contrast spatial resolution, dose, , contrast, and geometrical accuracy of the BrainLAB ExacTrac system. An in-house fixation device was constructed to hold the QCkV-1 phantom firmly and reproducibly against the face of the flat panel detectors. Two image sets per detector were acquired using ExacTrac preset console settings over a period of three months. The image sets were analyzed in PIPSpro and the following metrics were recorded: high-contrast spatial resolution (f30, f40, f50 (lp/mm)), noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. Geometrical image accu- racy was evaluated by assessing the length between to predetermined points of the QCkV-1 phantom. Dose and kVp were recorded using the Unfors RaySafe Xi R/F Detector. The kVp and dose were evaluated for the following: Cranial Standard (CS) (80 kV,80 mA,80 ms), Thorax Standard (TS) (120 kV,160 mA,160 ms), Abdomen Standard (AS) (120 kV,160 mA,130 ms), and Pelvis Standard () (120 kV,160 mA,160 ms). With regard to high-contrast spatial resolution, the mean values of the f30 (lp/mm), f40 (lp/mm) and f50 (lp/mm) for the left detector were 1.39 ± .04, 1.24 ± .05, and 1.09 ± .04, respectively, while for the right detector they were 1.38 ± .04, 1.22 ± .05, and 1.09 ± .05, respectively. Mean CNRs for the left and right detectors were 148 ± 3 and 143 ± 4, respectively. For geometrical accuracy, both detectors had a measured image length of the QCkV-1 of 57.9 ± .5 mm. The left detector showed dose measurements of 20.4 ± .2 μGy (CS), 191.8 ± .7 μGy (TS), 154.2 ± .7 μGy (AS), and 192.2 ± .6 μGy (), while the right detector showed 20.3 ± .3 μGy (CS), 189.7 ± .8 μGy (TS), 151. ± .7 μGy (AS), and 189.7 ± .8 μGy (), respectively.

The present study compared how well participants could estimate the sugar and  content of foods, the weight of foods, and approximate portion size (using a hand measure estimation aid). The study had three aims. First, it aimed to investigate differences in accuracy across the four measures. Second, it aimed to examine whether these differences in accuracy between estimation measures were accurately perceived by the participants. Third, it aimed to test if estimation accuracy was related to food journaling experience, body-mass index or gender. One hundred and ninety-seven participants took part in an estimation task and filled in a questionnaire. While the participants were inaccurate when using all four estimation measures, inaccuracy was most pronounced for sugar content (s ≥ .39), which was consistently overestimated by between 62.1% and 98.5% of the sample. None of the other measures showed a consistent pattern of under- or overestimation. Participants' perceived accuracy did not match their actual accuracy (s ≤ |.20|, s ≥ .005). Actual accuracy showed only marginal covariation with food journaling experience (s ≤ 2.01, s ≥ .049, s ≤ .14), body-mass index (s ≤ |.|, s ≥ .041) or gender (s ≤ 3.17, s ≥ .002, s ≤ .46). It is particularly challenging for consumers to estimate the sugar content of food, which might have negative consequences for health and well-being. Thus, more education about sugar content and misperceptions is needed to support consumers so that they can make healthy food choices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218295>Linear and Multi-Photon Fluorescence of Thiophene Based Copolymer with Electron-Accepting Side Chains.</a></h2><p>A novel copolymer poly(thiophene-2,5-diyl-2,5-di-n-octyloxycarbonyl-1,4-phenylene), denoted as P33, is introduced as potential material for photovoltaics, polymer light-emitting diodes, and/or organic transistors.

Noteworthily, the emission of 12 falls in the near infrared window, suitable for potential biological applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633537>Ultrafast relaxation dynamics of 5,10,,20-meso-tetrakis pentafluorophenyl porphyrin studied by fluorescence up-conversion and transient absorption spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>The ultrafast photophysical characterization of 5,10,,20-meso-tetrakis pentafluorophenyl porphyrin (H2F20TPP) in 4:1 dichloromethane (DCM) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution has been done in the femtosecond-picosecond time domain, by combining fluorescence up-conversion and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence up-conversion studies on H2F20TPP were done demonstrating fluorescence dynamics over the whole spectral range from 440 to 650 nm when excited at 405 nm, 360.5 cm(-1) excess vibrational  of Soret band (411 nm). Single-exponential decay with ∼160 ± 50 fs lifetime of Soret fluorescence (also called S2 fluorescence or B band fluorescence) at around 440 nm was observed. On going from 440 nm, S2 fluorescence to S1 fluorescence, (Q-band) around 640 nm (wavelength of - transition in the stationary spectrum), single-exponential fluorescence time profile turns into a multiexponential time profile and it could be resolved critically into five-exponential components. An ultrafast rise component with ∼160 ± 50 fs followed by two decay components: a very fast decay component with 200 ± 50 fs time constant and another relatively slower 1.8 ± .5  decay component. Next, a very prominent rise component with 105 ± 30  lifetime followed by long-lived 10 ns decay component. The initial rise of S1 (Q-band) fluorescence around 640 nm agreed with the decay time of S2 (Soret or B band) fluorescence indicates that internal conversion (IC) from relaxed S2 to vibrationally excited S1 occurs in the ∼160 fs time scale and subsequent very fast decay with 200 fs time constant, which is assigned to be intramolecular vibrational dephasing or redistribution. The 1.8  decay component of S1 fluorescence is attributed to be "hot" fluorescence from vibrationally excited S1 state, and it reveals the vibrational relaxation time induced by elastic or quasi-elastic collision with solvent molecules. The 105  rise component is the creation time of the thermally equilibrated S1 state population, and it could be attributed either to an excited state conformational relaxation/intramolecular charge transfer or a molecular cooling process by dissipation of excess  within the solvent by inelastic collision. Finally, the decay of equilibrated S1(Qx state) occurs on 10 ns to S0 by fluorescence. Femtosecond resolved transient absorption studies on H2F20TPP in the spectral range 390-620 nm following both S2 (Soret band) and S1 (Qx) band excitation have been done and they complement the observations found in fluorescence up-conversion studies. The stimulated emission (SE) kinetics observed at 640 nm, S1 emission peak, in 2-10  time domain rebuilds a dynamic similar to that observed by fluorescence up-conversion study. The transient absorption kinetics upon S1 excitation were observed mainly to be biexponential with decay constants 105  and 10 ns, respectively. At a long time window (6 ns), a long-lived rise component could be predicted followed by two long-lived decay components for both the excitations in between 450 and 500 nm probe wavelengths. The lifetimes of these components were longer-lived than were possible to exactly measure using our existing femtosecond transient absorption system. However, this apparent rise component is assigned to be a Tn ← T1 transition, and the longest decay component is attributed to the lifetime of the T1 state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305851>Polymer thin film adhesion utilizing the transition from surface wrinkling to delamination.</a></h2><p>Understanding the adhesion of rigid thin films to compliant substrates is critical for the development and implementation of flexible electronic devices and wearable sensor technologies. Quantifying the strength of a film-substrate interface can be challenging due to the brittleness of glassy films which can greatly complicate sample preparation, handling, and testing. Here, a method for measuring the adhesion of glassy thin films to soft elastomeric substrates is explored that exploits an understanding of surface buckling instabilities, specifically the transition from wrinkling to delamination. The adhesion (given by the critical strain  release rate (G)) for two model materials' interfaces is quantified by determining the critical delamination strain for thin glassy polymer films (polystyrene () and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) from an elastomeric substrate (poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS)). By accounting for edge defects that greatly reduce the critical strain for delamination, reasonable adjusted G values of 21. ± 5.1 mJ m and 32.2 ± 4.9 mJ m are found for -PDMS and PMMA-PDMS interfaces, respectively. The utilization of this method to characterize film modulus and adhesion could be used as a facile measurement technique for more applied polymer thin film systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602529>[The use of social media modifies teenagers' sleep-related behavior].</a></h2><p>Modification of sleep behaviors in teenagers has been observed over the past 30years with a reduction in overall sleep time and an increasing number of teenagers suffering from sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is linked to physical problems such as obesity but also to change in performance at school and mood disorders. Changes have been associated with the use of screens, cell phones, Internet and social media. Use of screens has been shown to delay sleep onset and melatonin secretion and stimulation of wake systems by interaction with social media may exacerbate these effects. The links between the use of social media and sleep patterns have not been fully explored. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of social media on teenagers' sleep and the impact of sleep deprivation.As part of a sleep education program conducted in middle schools, teenagers from 6th to 9th grade were invited to complete an online questionnaire on sleep habits with teacher supervision and after parental consent. Outcome measures were sleep and wake times with estimated sleep duration in school (SP) and rest periods (RP), use of screens (computers, tablets, smartphones and video game consoles), the use of social media and impact on visual analogue scales of sleep quality, mood and daytime functioning. Students were divided into those with clear sleep deprivation (sleep time<6hours in SP) and those whose sleep time was in line with the National Sleep Foundations recommended sleep needs for teenagers (9hours or more).A total of 786 questionnaires were completed and 776 were exploitable. Four schools took part with 408/786 girls (64.2 %) and a mean age of 12.4±1.24. Internet access was almost universal (98.3 %), 85.2 % had cell phones and 42.7 % had a personal computer in their bedroom. Social media was used by 64.6 %. After dinner, 52.6 % spent more than an hour and 14.7 % spent more than 2hours in front of a screen. After bedtime, 51.7 % regularly used electronic devices of which 25.6 % had a screen-based activity (e.g. texts, social media, video games or television). During the night, some teens woke up to continue screen-based activities: 6.1 % in order to play online video games, .3 % to send texts and 11 % to use social media. Bedtimes were later in PR compared with  (22h06±132 vs. 23h54±02; P<.0001) as were wake times (7h06±36 vs. 10h06±102; P<.0001). Sleep time was clearly longer in PR (10h12±126 P<.0001) compared to . For students in 6th grade compared to 9th grade in sleep duration in SP decreased (8:55±90 vs. 7:25±93; P<.0001), whereas sleep duration during RP was stable (10h08±118 vs. 10h08±90 P<.029). No significant difference was found between girls and boys for sleep duration, sleep quality, performance during the day or mood. Sleep deprivation during the week (6hours or less) was less common in 6th graders 5 % vs.  % (P<.0001). In sleep deprived teens compared to teens sleeping, the recommended ≥9hours, difficulties falling asleep were reported with 33 % vs. 9 % taking over an hour to fall asleep (P<.0001) and difficulties getting up in the morning were more common (7.05±3.27 vs. 5.74±2.97; P=.0003). Sleep deprivation had an effect on daytime performance: teenagers deprived of sleep were more likely to report a need to fight sleepiness, (5.93±3.24 vs. 2.84±2.44 P<.0001) and had reduced  during the day (6.21±2.86 vs. 7.77±2.07 P<.0001). A negative effect on mood was evident: in sleep, deprived teenagers irritability (5.28±3.12 vs. 3.30±2.34; P<.0001) and feelings of sadness (3.97±2.99 vs. 2.59±2.; P=.003) were more common. There was a clear association between sleep deprivation and access to screens and social media: sleep deprived teens were at more risk of nocturnal disruption with a higher prevalence of computers (67 % vs. 33 %; P<.0001), cell phones (99 % vs. 80 %; P=.0001) and smart phones (85 % vs. 66 %; P=.0001) in their bedrooms.Access to social media and especially a cell phone in teenagers' bedrooms is associated with a reduction in sleep time during the school week with negative effects on daily functioning and mood which increases with increasing age. Education about use of social media and sleep for teenagers needs to start early as modifications in sleep and evening use of screens was present on our population from 11years on and to involve parents as setting parent controlled bedtimes has been shown to increase teenage sleep time.Copyright © 2017 L'Encéphale, Paris.

In the warm dense matter regime, experimental data are very scarce so that many theoretical models remain untested. Here we present the first thermal conductivity measurements of aluminum at .5-2.7 g/cc and 2-10 eV, using a recently developed platform of differential heating. A temperature gradient is induced in a Au/Al dual-layer target by proton heating, and subsequent heat flow from the hotter Au to the Al rear surface is detected by two simultaneous time-resolved diagnostics. A systematic data set allows for constraining both thermal conductivity and equation-of-state models. Simulations using Purgatorio model or Sesame S27314 for Al thermal conductivity and LEOS for Au/Al release equation-of-state show good agreement with data after  . Discrepancy still exists at early time - , likely due to non-equilibrium conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701791>Multi-photon absorption enhancement by dual-wavelength double-pulse laser irradiation for efficient dicing of sapphire wafers.</a></h2><p>The evidence of multi-photon absorption enhancement by the dual-wavelength double-pulse laser irradiation in transparent sapphire was demonstrated experimentally and explained theoretically for the first time. Two collinearly combined laser beams with the wavelengths of 1064 nm and 355 nm, inter-pulse delay of .1 ns, and pulse duration of 10  were used to induce intra-volume modifications in sapphire. The theoretical prediction of using a particular orientation angle of  degrees of the half-wave plate for the most efficient absorption of laser irradiation is in good agreement with the experimental data. The new innovative effect of multi-photon absorption enhancement by dual-wavelength double-pulse irradiation allowed utilisation of the laser  up to four times more efficiently for initiation of internal modifications in sapphire. The new absorption enhancement effect has been used for efficient intra-volume dicing and singulation of transparent sapphire wafers. The dicing speed of 150 mm/s was achieved for the 430 μm thick sapphire wafer by using the laser power of 6.8 W at the repetition rate of 100 kHz. This method opens new opportunities for the manufacturers of the GaN-based light-emitting diodes by fast and precise separation of sapphire substrates.</p></html>
