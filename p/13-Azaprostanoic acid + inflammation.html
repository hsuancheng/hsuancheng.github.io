Plasma thromboxane A(2) was determined by radioimmunoassay of its stable metabolite thromboxane B(2). After intravenous administration of Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin (20 mg/kg), plasma thromboxane B(2) levels increased from nondetectable levels (<375 pg/ml) in normal control rats to 2,054+/-524 pg/ml (n = 8), within 30 min to 2,071+/-429 at 60 min, and decreased to 1,119+/-319 pg/ml, at 120 min. Plasma levels of prostaglandin E also increased from 146+/-33 pg/ml in normal controls (n = 5) to 2,161+/-606 pg/ml 30 min after endotoxin (n = 5). In contrast to shocked controls, rats pretreated with imidazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, or essential fatty acid-deficient rats, which are deficient in arachidonate and its metabolites, did not exhibit significant elevations in plasma levels of thromboxane B(2). Imidazole did not however inhibit endotoxin-induced elevations in plasma prostaglandin E. Essential fatty acid deficiency significantly reduced mortality to lethal endotoxic shock. This refractoriness could be duplicated in normal rats pretreated with the fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 mg/kg), intravenously 30 min before endotoxin injection. Imidazole (30 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally 1 h before or intravenously 30 min before endotoxin, also significantly (P < 0.01) reduced mortality from lethal endotoxin shock to 40% compared to a control mortality of 95% at 24 h. Likewise pretreatment with  (30 mg/kg), a thromboxane antagonist, reduced mortality from endotoxic shock at 24 h from 100% in control rats to only 50% (P < 0.01). The results suggest that endotoxin induces increased synthesis of thromboxane A(2) that may contribute to the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3155816>Acetyl glycerylphosphorylcholine aggregates human platelets through two distinct pathways, both dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC) is a mediator of  and anaphylaxis, released from IgE-sensitized basophils when exposed to antigens. Convincing evidence shows that AGEPC is synthesized by inflammatory cells, and its mechanism of action has been extensively studied with particular interest focusing on platelet stimulation, the key event initiating the inflammatory cascade. However, widely different results have been reported so that the mode of action of AGEPC in activating platelets is still largely obscure. The objective of this investigation was to elucidate whether AGEPC stimulates human platelets independently from arachidonate metabolism, as previously suggested, and to define the role of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in inhibiting AGEPC-mediated platelet activation. Irreversible platelet aggregation in vitro occurred at low AGEPC concentrations, was dose dependent, and was accompanied by thromboxane A2 formation. Aspirin inhibited irreversible aggregation induced by low AGEPC concentrations. A thromboxane inhibitor, UK-37, 248-01, failed to affect AGEPC aggregation, suggesting a crucial role for cyclic endoperoxides in AGEPC's mechanism of action. A thromboxane/endoperoxide receptor antagonist  prevented irreversible platelet aggregation induced by low AGEPC concentrations. The inhibiting effect of aspirin on AGEPC aggregation could be overcome by increasing the concentration of the agonist by a factor of 10, unless a lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid was previously added to platelet-rich plasmas. The phospholipase inhibitor, mepacrine, completely suppressed human platelet aggregation induced by AGEPC. These results indicate that AGEPC induces irreversible aggregation in human platelets by two distinct pathways, both dependent upon arachidonic acid metabolism: a cyclooxygenase-dependent one at low AGEPC concentrations and a cyclooxygenase-independent one, possibly mediated through the formation of lipoxygenase products, at high AGEPC concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3000944>Eicosanoid modulation of stress fibers in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes (LT) B4, LTD4, and thromboxanes (TX) are cytotoxic, and increase microvascular permeability. Because endothelial stress fibers are theorized to be part of the cytoskeletal mechanism by which microvessels maintain their barrier function, the effect of these eicosanoids on stress fibers in bovine aortic endothelial cells was tested. LTB4, LTD4, and TXB2 each decreased stress fiber numbers by 93%, 62%, and 66%, respectively, when compared to controls (P less than 0.01). In contrast, endothelial cells treated with prostacyclin (PGI2) at 10(-7) M, produced a significant increase (P greater than 0.01) in stress fiber numbers, 211% to that of controls. Azaprostanoic acid (13-APA) and FPL55712, receptor antagonists to TX and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS) receptors, respectively, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen, and the TX synthase inhibitors imidazole and ketoconazole were used to test for possible endothelial cell receptor mediation and de novo prostanoid synthesis associated with inflammatory eicosanoid-induced disassembly of stress fibers. Each pharmacologic agent inhibited the LTD4- and TXB2-induced decreases in stress fibers; LTB4-stimulated stress fiber decreases were inhibited only by pretreatment with TX synthase blockers. These data suggest that increased permeability associated with inflammatory eicosanoid metabolites may have as a common target stress fiber disassembly, and the mechanism may be receptor-mediated. That cyclooxygenase and TX synthase blockers inhibited the eicosanoid action suggests that endogenous TX synthesis may be a step in the mechanism. PGI2 enhancement of the microvascular barrier may be related to the effect of PGI2 on promoting stress fiber assembly. In summary, endothelial cell synthesized autocoids derived from arachidonic acid may help to regulate microvascular permeability by way of their action on stress fiber assembly/disassembly, and unbalanced prostanoid secretion by way of LT stimulation may result in a loss of the microvascular barrier and increased permeability.</p></html>
