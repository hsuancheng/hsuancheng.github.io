The rotatable central composite design applying desirability  was used to assess the effect of  (2.5-4.5%), GG (.2-.8%) and glycerol (-35%). The optimisation was performed considering minimization of film solubility, opacity, yellowness index and water vapour permeability; and maximization tensile strength and percentage elongation at break. Viscosity of film forming solution; thickness, moisture content and whiteness index of the films were also evaluated. The optimum value of , GG and glycerol was 3.7%, .4% and % (of total solids), respectively. All the independent variables depicted significant effect on the responses (p < .05) except starch which did not exhibit any statistically significant effect on WVP. The structural characterisation of the optimised film was also analysed by FESEM and XRD which point to the semi-crystalline nature of the developed film.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, the 10 mg/mL -treated animals were infused intravesically with 100, 300, or 500 mM KCl. Some animals were pretreated with capsaicin (125 mg/kg subcutaneously) 4 days before the experiments.Unlike KCl (100 or 500 mM) or a low concentration of  (10 mg/mL) alone, the intravesical administration of a high concentration of  (30 mg/mL) produced irritative effects with a decreased intercontraction interval (by 80.6%). After infusion of a low concentration of , infusion of 300 or 500 mM KCl produced irritative effects (intercontraction interval decreased by 76.9% or 82.9%, respectively). The onset of irritation occurred more rapidly after 500 mM KCl (10 to  minutes) than after 300 mM KCl (20 to 30 minutes). Capsaicin pretreatment delayed the onset (approximately 60 minutes) and reduced the magnitude (intercontraction interval decreased by 35.5%) of irritative effects.Intravesical administration of KCl after  treatment activates capsaicin-sensitive afferents and detrusor muscle and presumably capsaicin-resistant afferents. Modest, noncytotoxic affronts to urothelial   can result in dramatic irritative responses. This model may be useful in the study of bladder irritation and hyperactivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294112>Feeding of phytosterols reduced testosterone production by modulating GnRH and GnIH expression in the brain and testes of male Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica).</a></h1><p>Phytosterols (), or plant sterols used as cholesterol-lowering agents, have been shown to act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals in some laboratory animals. Moreover, dietary  efficiently pass through the blood-brain  and accumulate in brain cell membranes. We asked whether the accumulation of  affects reproduction through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Thirty male quail chicks were randomly divided into 3 groups (control, 80 mg/kg BW, and 800 mg/kg BW), and daily single doses of  or vehicle were gavaged into the crop sac from  to 100 d of age. At the end of the entire period, half of each group was injected intramuscularly with either 10 μg of chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (cGnRH-1) or phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as the vehicle. Blood was collected before and 30 min after cGnRH-1 challenge by jugular venipuncture and decapitation, respectively. The results indicated that testosterone concentrations were low (P < .05) before (800 mg/kg BW) and after GnRH challenge in -treated quails compared with controls (P < .001). However, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were not different among the groups before cGnRH-1 challenge. In addition, -gavaged animals failed to manifest increased LH levels after cGnRH-1 injection (P < .01). The same trends were observed in pituitary LH levels at 800 mg/kg BW  after cGnRH-1 injection (P < .05). Real-time PCR results revealed that  (800 mg/kg BW) feeding reduced expression of GnRH-1 in the brain and testes compared to controls. However, gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) expression was significantly elevated before and after GnRH-1 challenges in the brain and testes. Collectively, these results suggest that brain-mediated effects of  on gonadal  occurs via the induction of GnIH gene expression, and these indirect effects are less potent than direct effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9929469>Structure- study on a de novo synthetic hydrophobic ion channel.</a></h1><p>Ion conduction properties of a de novo synthesized channel, formed from cyclic octa-peptides consisting of four alternate L-alanine (Ala) and N'-acylated 3-aminobenzoic acid (Aba) moieties, were studied in bilayer membranes. The single-channel conductance was 9  in symmetrical 500 mM KCl. The channel favored permeation of cations over anions with a permeability ratio (PCl-/PK+) of .. The selectivity sequence among monovalent cations based on permeability ratio (PX+/PK+) fell into an order: NH4+(1.4) > Cs+(1. 1) >/= K+(1.) > Na+(.4) >> Li+(). The conductance-activity relationship of the channel in K+ solutions followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a half-maximal saturating activity of 8 mM and a maximal conductance of 9 . The permeability ratio PNa+/PK+ remained constant ( approximately .40) under biionic concentrations from 10 to 500 mM. These results suggests that the channel is a one-ion channel. The pore diameter probed by a set of organic cations was approximately 6 A. The single-channel current was blocked by Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner that followed a single-site titration curve with a voltage-dependent dissociation constant of .6 mM at 100 mV. The electric distance of the binding site for Ca2+ was .07 from both entrances of the channel, indicating the presence of two symmetrical binding sites in each vicinity of the channel entrance. Correlations between conduction properties and structural aspects of the channel are discussed in terms of a three- and two-binding-site (3B2S) model of Eyring rate theory. All available structural information supported an idea that the channel was formed from a tail-to-tail associated dimer of the molecule, the pore of which was lined with hydrophobic acyl chains. This is the first report to have made a systematic analysis of ion permeation through a hydrophobic pore.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7775114>Measurement of blood-retinal  breakdown in endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis.</a></h1><p>Endophthalmitis is a severe inflammatory disorder with profound visual consequences. Treatment of this disorder has been limited by the lack of quantitative information regarding retinal responses to severe inflammation. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis on blood-retinal  (BRB)  in vivo using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Endophthalmitis was produced by injecting Escherichia coli endotoxin into the midvitreous of pigmented rabbits. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed at selected intervals thereafter. In all cases, a clinical grading system was used to assess the severity of inflammation before imaging. In a dose-response experiment, total vitreous protein was measured from vitreous specimens obtained 1 day after endotoxin injection and immediately after the imaging procedure.At 1 day after injection, endotoxin produced a selective breakdown of the inner BRB at all doses evaluated (.01 microgram to 500 micrograms). Permeability-surface area product normalized to the area of leaky retina (') increased from 1.35 +/- .78 x 10(-4) cm/minute (mean +/- SEM, n = 4 eyes) at a dose of .01 microgram to 8. +/- 2.22 x 10(-4) cm/minute n = 4) eyes) at a dose of 10 micrograms. Inner BRB integrity was restored by day 28 after injection. In general, changes in ', blood-aqueous  leakage, mean clinical score, and vitreous protein concentration were found, but the correlation between any two of these parameters was poor.Leakage of contrast appears early in the course of endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis and is a self-limited process. In future studies, these quantifiable changes in BRB permeability should prove useful in the assessment of various therapeutic interventions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790419>Nicotine raises the influx of permeable solutes across the rat blood-brain  with little or no capillary recruitment.</a></h1><p>Nicotine (1.75 mg/kg s.c.) was administered to rats to raise local CBF (lCBF) in various parts of the brain, test the capillary recruitment hypothesis, and determine the effects of this increase in lCBF on local solute uptake by brain. lCBF as well as the local influx rate constants (K1) and permeability-surface area () products of [14C]antipyrine and [14C]-3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3OMG) were estimated by quantitative autoradiography in 44 brain areas. For this testing, the finding of significantly increased  products supports the capillary recruitment hypothesis. In 17 of 44 areas, nicotine treatment increased lCBF by 30-150%, K1 of antipyrine by 7-40%, K1 of 3OMG by 5-27%,  product of antipyrine by .20% (mean 7%), and  product of 3OMG by -23% (mean 8%). Nicotine had no effect on blood flow or influx in the remaining 27 areas. The increases in lCBF and K1 of antipyrine were significant, whereas those in K1 of 3OMG and in  for both antipyrine and 3OMG were not statistically significant. The lack of significant changes in  products implies that in brain areas where nicotine increased blood flow: (a) essentially no additional capillaries were recruited and (b) blood flow within brain capillary beds rises by elevating linear velocity. The K1 results indicate that the flow increase generated by nicotine will greatly raise the influx and washout rates of highly permeable materials, modestly elevate those of moderately permeable substances, and negligibly change those of solutes with extraction fractions of < .2, thereby preserving the   of the blood-brain .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19431871>Single-channel analysis of the anion channel-forming protein from the plant pathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganense ssp. nebraskense.</a></h1><p>The anion channel protein from Clavibacter michiganense ssp. nebraskense (Schürholz, Th. et al. 1991, J. Membrane Biol. 123: 1-8) was analyzed at different concentrations of KCl and KF. At .8 M KCl the conductance G(V(m)) increases exponentially from 21  at 50 mV up to 53  at V(m) = 200 mV, 20 degrees C. The concentration dependence of G(V(m)) corresponds to a Michaelis-Menten type saturation  at all membrane voltage values applied (-200 mV). The anion concentration K(.5), where G(V(m)) has its half-maximum value, increases from .12 M at 50 mV to .24 M at 175 mV for channels in a soybean phospholipid bilayer. The voltage dependence of the single channel conductance, which is different for charged and neutral lipid bilayers, can be described either by a two-state flicker (2SF) model and the Nernst-Planck continuum theory, or by a two , one-site (2B1S) model with asymmetric barriers. The increase in the number of open channels after a voltage jump from 50 mV to 150 mV has a time constant of .8 s. The changes of the single-channel conductance are much faster (<1 ms). The electric part of the gating process is characterized by the (reversible) molar electrical work DeltaG(theta) (el) = rhoZ(g)FV(m) approximately -1.3 RT, which corresponds to the movement of one charge of the gating charge number Z(g) = 1 across the fraction rho = DeltaV(m)/V(m) = . of the membrane voltage V(m) = 200 mV. Unlike with chloride, the single channel conductance of fluoride has a maximum at about 150 mV in the presence of the buffer PIPES (>/=5 mM, pH 6.8) with K(.5) approximately 1 M. It is shown that the decrease in conductance is due to a blocking of the channel by the PIPES anion. In summary, the results indicate that the anion transport by the Clavibacter anion channel (CAC) does not require a voltage dependent conformation change of the CAC.</p></html>
