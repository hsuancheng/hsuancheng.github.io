As revealed by NMR and molecular dynamics simulations, the fCS repeating unit adopts a conformation similar to that of the Le(x) blood group determinant, bringing several sulfate groups into close proximity and creating large negative patches distributed along the helical skeleton of the CS backbone. This may explain the high affinity of fCS oligosaccharides for L- and P-selectins as determined by microarray binding of fCS oligosaccharides prepared by Cu(2+)-catalyzed Fenton-type and photochemical depolymerization. No binding to E-selectin was observed. fCS poly- and oligosaccharides display low cytotoxicity in vitro, inhibit human neutrophil elastase activity, and inhibit the migration of neutrophils through an endothelial cell layer in vitro. Although the polysaccharide showed some anti-coagulant activity, small oligosaccharide fCS fragments had much reduced anticoagulant properties, with activity mainly via heparin cofactor II. The fCS polysaccharides showed prekallikrein activation comparable with dextran sulfate, whereas the fCS oligosaccharides caused almost no effect. The H. forskali fCS oligosaccharides were also tested in a mouse peritoneal  model, where they caused a reduction in neutrophil infiltration. Overall, the data presented support the action of fCS as an inhibitor of selectin interactions, which play vital roles in  and metastasis progression. Future studies of fCS-selectin interaction using fCS fragments or their mimetics may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882313>Bioassay-guided isolation and identification of cytotoxic compounds from Bolbostemma paniculatum.</a></h2><p>Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim.) Franquet (B. paniculatum), also named "Tu-bei-mu" in Chinese folk medicines, has been described in application for the treatment of tumors, warts,  and toxication in traditional Chinese medicinal books. The major constituents in B. paniculatum are triterpenoid saponins, which have been proved to possess dramatically cytotoxic activity and antivirus activity. The aim of this study is to isolate and identify the active triterpenoid saponin from the bulb of B. paniculatum by a bioassay-guided method.Four cucurbitacine triterpenoid sapogenins and 11 triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the active EtOAc and n-BuOH extract of B. paniculatum by using bioassay-guided screening. Their structures were elucidated based on the spectroscopic methods and compared with published data. Cytotoxic activities of isolated compounds were determined by MTT assay.Four cucurbitacine triterpenoid sapogenins, isocucurbitacin B(1), 23,24-dihydroisocucurbitacin B(2), cucurbitacin E(3), 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin E(4), and 11 triterpenoid saponins, tubeimosideI(5), tubeimoside III(6), tubeimoside V(7), dexylosyltubeimoside III(8), lobatoside C(9), tubeimoside A(10), tumeimoside B(11), lobatoside A(12), tubeimoside C(13), tubeimoside IV(14), 7β,18,20,26-tetrahydroxy-(20S)-dammar-24E-en-3-O-α-L-(4-acetyl)arabinopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranoside(15) were isolated from the active EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts. Of them, compounds 2, 4, 9 and 12 were firstly isolated from the Bolbostemma genus. MTT assay revealed that compounds 1, 3 and 4 had significantly activities against HeLa and HT-29 human cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.93 to 9.73μM. It is worth mentioning that compound 4׳s activities against the two cell lines are 12- and 8-fold that of the positive control drug (5-Fu). Whereas, the cyclic bisdesmosides 5-9 exerted significantly activities on BGC-823, HeLa, HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 1.30 to 15.64μM. And 6׳s activities against the four cell lines are 6-, 3-, 10- and 16-fold that of 5-Fu and 8׳s activities against the four cell lines are 5-, 3-, 14- and 9-fold that of 5-Fu.The cytotoxic activity of the bulbs of B. paniculatum is mainly ascribable to cucurbitacine triterpenoid sapogenins (1-4) and the cyclic bisdesmosides (5-9). The cyclic bisdesmosides are the main anti-cancer active compounds of B. paniculatum. The above results provide scientific evidence to support, to some extent, the ethnomedicinal use of B. paniculatum as anticancer remedies in traditional Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Arginine is a substrate for NO, whereas the methylated arginines-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA)-are endogenous by-products of proteolysis that inhibit NO production.We investigated if high-plasma levels of ADMA, SDMA, and arginine/ADMA ratio were associated with 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.We included 267 adult patients admitted to intensive care unit with severe sepsis or septic shock. The patients had previously been included in the randomized controlled trial "Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock ()." ADMA, SDMA, and arginine/ADMA ratio were measured in plasma. The risk of death within 90 days was estimated in multivariate Cox regression analyses adjusted for gender, age ≥65 years, major cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory failure, vasopressor treatment, highest quartile of creatinine and bilirubin, and lowest quartile of platelet count. In the regression analyses missing values were estimated using multiple imputation.Twenty-five patients had missing data in one or more of the baseline variables and 44 patients had missing methylarginine values. Both ADMA and SDMA were independently associated with 90-day mortality (ADMA: hazard ratio 1.54; 95% CI, 1.00-2.38; P = 0.046, and SDMA: hazard ratio 1.78; 95% CI, 1.14-2.72; P = 0.011). Arginine/ADMA ratio was not associated with 90-day mortality neither in univariate nor in multivariate analyses. The difference in mortality between patients with high and low ADMA was most pronounced in the first week after inclusion.High levels of ADMA and SDMA in plasma were associated with increased 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Interfering with the methylarginine-NO systems may be a novel target in these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269526>Comparing the effect of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 with balanced crystalloid solution on mortality and kidney failure in patients with severe sepsis (--Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock trial): study protocol, design and rationale for a double-blinded, randomised clinical trial.</a></h2><p>By tradition colloid solutions have been used to obtain fast circulatory stabilisation in shock, but high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES) may cause acute kidney failure in patients with severe sepsis. Now lower molecular weight HES 130/0.4 is the preferred colloid in Scandinavian intensive care units (ICUs) and 1st choice fluid for patients with severe sepsis. However, HES 130/0.4 is largely unstudied in patients with severe sepsis.The  trial will randomize 800 patients with severe sepsis in 30 Scandinavian ICUs to masked fluid resuscitation using either 6% HES 130/0.4 in Ringer's acetate or Ringer's acetate alone. The composite endpoint of 90-day mortality or end-stage kidney failure is the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures are severe bleeding or allergic reactions, organ failure, acute kidney failure, days alive without renal replacement therapy or ventilator support and 28-day and 1/2- and one-year mortality. The sample size will allow the detection of a 10% absolute difference between the two groups in the composite endpoint with a power of 80%.The  trial will provide important safety and efficacy data on the use of HES 130/0.4 in patients with severe sepsis.

In this study we present an imaging approach using near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in combination with a polyanionic macromolecular conjugate as a dedicated probe, known to target L- and P-selectin and C3/C5 complement factors.We investigated the suitability of dendritic polyglycerol sulfates (dPGS), conjugated with a hydrophilic version of the indocyanine green label with 6 sulfonate groups (-ICG) to monitor sites of  using an experimental mouse model of allergic asthma. Accumulation of the NIRF-conjugated dPGS (dPGS-NIRF) in the inflamed lungs was analyzed in and ex vivo in comparison with the free NIRF dye using optical imaging. Commercially available smart probes activated by matrix metalloproteinase's (MMP) and cathepsins were used as a comparative control. The fluorescence intensity ratio between lung areas of asthmatic and healthy mice was four times higher for the dPGS in comparison to the free dye in vivo at four hrs post intravenous administration. No significant difference in fluorescence intensity between healthy and asthmatic mice was observed 24 hrs post injection for dPGS-NIRF. At this time point ex-vivo scans of asthmatic mice confirmed that the fluorescence within the lungs was reduced to approximately 30% of the intensity observed at 4 hrs post injection.Compared with smart-probes resulting in a high fluorescence level at 24 hrs post injection optical imaging with dPGS-NIRF conjugates is characterized by fast uptake of the probe at inflammatory sites and represents a novel approach to monitor lung  as demonstrated in mice with allergic asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146715>Differential effects of intravesical resiniferatoxin on excitability of bladder spinal neurons upon colon-bladder cross-sensitization.</a></h2><p>Cross-sensitization in the pelvis may contribute to etiology of functional pelvic pain disorders such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors in the development of neurogenic  in the pelvis and pelvic organ cross-sensitization. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that desensitization of TRPV1 receptors in the urinary bladder can minimize the effects of cross-sensitization induced by experimental colitis on excitability of bladder spinal neurons. Extracellular activity of bladder neurons was recorded in response to graded urinary bladder distension (UBD) in rats pretreated with intravesical resiniferatoxin (RTX, 10(-7)M). Colonic  was induced by intracolonic instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The duration of excitatory responses to noxious UBD during acute colonic  (3 days post-TNBS) was significantly shortened in the group with RTX pretreatment (25.3±1.5s, n=49) when compared to the control group (35.1±4.2s, n=43, p<0.05). The duration of long-lasting excitatory responses, but not short-lasting responses of bladder spinal neurons during acute colitis was significantly reduced by RTX from 52.9±6. (n=21, vehicle group) to 34.4±2.1s (RTX group, n=21, p<0.05). However, activation of TRPV1 receptors in the urinary bladder prior to acute colitis increased the number of bladder neurons receiving input from large somatic fields from 22.7% to 58.2% (p<0.01). The results of our study provide evidence that intravesical RTX reduces the effects of viscerovisceral cross-talk induced by colonic  on bladder spinal neurons. However, RTX enhances the responses of bladder neurons to somatic stimulation, thereby limiting its therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The utility of these implants is limited by the subsequent foreign body response (FBR), beginning with  and terminating in a collagen envelope around the device, known as the capsule. This capsule then can contract and distort the shape of the device or limit its effectiveness in interacting with the surrounding host tissues. In the current study, we investigated the effect of therapeutic collagen-coated silicone discs in a rat model of the FBR.A 3-dimensional printed mold was used to fabricate collagen-coated silicone discs incorporating 3 therapeutic agents: colchicine, a function-blocking antibody against interleukin 8 (IL-8) receptor B, and a powerful anti-inflammatory steroid, dexamethasone. Discs were implanted submuscularly into a well-characterized rat model of the FBR and evaluated for inflammatory response, fibrotic development, and cytokine release.Coated silicone discs exhibited reduced collagen deposition and little to no foreign body giant cells at the host-silicone interface when compared with the silicone-only group. Therapeutic hydrogels demonstrate a significant decrease in cellular infiltration into the coatings over the 2-week time point in contrast to therapeutic-free hydrogel coatings. Cytokine analysis revealed significant differences between therapeutic-free and therapeutic-containing coatings when compared with silicone-only controls. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α were affected 48 hours after implantation, while differences in IL-18, growth-regulated oncogene/keratinocyte chemoattractant, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α were observed 1 week after implantation.By utilizing the host's innate immune response, our engineered hydrogel coatings delivered therapeutic moieties directly to the implant microenvironment, thus delaying the FBR up to 2 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26287129>New Polyprenylated Phloroglucinol and Other Compounds Isolated from the Fruits of Clusia nemorosa (Clusiaceae).</a></h2><p>Clusia nemorosa has been widely used in folk medicine to treat various ailments, including headaches and .

Among them, LASSBio-873 was the most potent to produce analgesic, sedative and hypnotic effects. Thus, we investigated the possible mechanisms involved in LASSBio-873-induced sedation, as well as its effects on different models of inflammatory pain. LASSBio-873 (4 mg/kg) reduced locomotor activity of mice in the open field test from 205.2+/-25.6 to 87.6+/-16.2 movements/min. Atropine, a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, prevented the LASSBio-873-induced sedation and increased locomotor activity to 192.9+/-30.2 movements/min. In the formalin test, LASSBio-873 (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced the duration of nociceptive behavior during the inflammatory phase, reducing the control reactivity from 197.6+/-14.5s to 84.4+/-10.3s. Carrageenan reduced the latency for the animal reaction from 5.1+/-0.2s (control) to 2.1+/-0.3s which was completely reverted by LASSBio-873 (6 mg/kg) to 5.6+/-0.. Atropine prevented the LASSBio-873-induced antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic activities, indicating the interference of the cholinergic system.

It is seldom that only one type of lesion is present, but one may often dominate. In chronic bronchitis, the major disease of large airways, chronic mucus hypersecretion, is reflected by an increase in size of bronchial mucous glands. This may be a factor in airway narrowing, especially with coexisting edema of the airway wall. Excess intralumenal mucus compounds the obstruction. Increased airways reactivity is present in 15 to 70 percent of patients with chronic airflow obstruction. Increased airway muscle and cartilage atrophy are features of chronic bronchitis, but the association of increased muscle with increased airway reactivity is poor.  of the small airways (bronchiolitis) is a significant complication for cigarette smokers and is an important cause of mild chronic airflow obstruction. Goblet cell metaplasia is a reflection of chronic small airways  and, together with intralumenal mucus, is an important feature. Permanent narrowing of the small airways presumably results from  with consequent fibrosis, while functional narrowing results from release of mediators of . Increased muscle mass is present in some cases. Distortion and irregularity of small airways related to emphysema are major factors in severe obstruction. Lesser degrees of emphysema may be associated with a diminished number of alveolar attachments and mild chronic airflow obstruction. Emphysema, the dominant lesion in patients with severe chronic airflow obstruction, results from parenchymal lesions. Centrilobular emphysema, in which the respiratory bronchioles are selectively or dominantly involved, is the most common form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146952>Inhibitory effect of the compounds from the water extract of Curcuma longa on the production of PGE2 and NO in a macrophage cell line stimulated by LPS.</a></h2><p>We wished to search for the compounds contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects of the water extract of Curcuma longa (WEC). WEC was fractioned and the fractions were evaluated with regard to their inhibitory effect on the production of nitric oxide (NO) from the macrophage cell line stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. Compounds in the active fractions were isolated and identified. One isolated compound was identified as new: ()-2-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-(3-hydroxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-heptene-4-one (1). Four isolated compounds were identified as known: ()-2-methyl-6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-heptene-4-one (4), bisabolone-4-one (5), curcumenone (6), and turmeronol A (8).

Different effects of the fluids on the endothelium may have contributed to the observed outcome. We aimed to investigate associations between HES vs Ringer and changes in plasma biomarkers reflecting endothelial damage and coagulation impairment.Six biomarkers, including soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), were assessed in a subgroup of 208 patients from the  trial. We analyzed differences in plasma concentration in the 2 intervention groups using linear or logistic regression models.The increase in plasma sTM was lower in the HES group (-1.8 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval, -2.9 to -0.7; P = .002). The change was not statistically significant associated with mortality whereas increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was (odds ratio for 1-unit increase, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08; P = .01).Resuscitation with HES vs Ringer decreased early endothelial damage. Although this finding should be interpreted with caution, it indicates that the increased mortality observed with HES in the  trial may not be explained by endothelial damage and it emphasizes the challenge of using surrogate markers as outcome.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs continues to be nebulous. The relationship between OPN and -suppressing lymphocytes present in the human AAA condition was investigated and presented herein.Serum OPN concentrations were measured in healthy, risk factor-matched non-AAA and AAA patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the source of OPN secretion using aortic tissue collected from multiorgan donors and AAA patients undergoing open surgical repair. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to various inflammatory mediators, and OPN expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. The inflammatory nature of OPN and the aortic wall was determined using a TR1 suppressor cell induction assay as a surrogate and characterized by ELISA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.OPN was found to be elevated in both the plasma and aortic homogenate of AAA patients compared with controls. On immunohistochemistry, OPN localized to the tunica media of the diseased aorta but was minimally expressed in healthy aorta. In vitro, cigarette smoke extract was the most potent stimulator of OPN secretion by VSMCs and increased both messenger RNA and supernatant concentrations. OPN demonstrated an ability to inhibit the induction of interleukin 10-secreting TR1 lymphocytes, a depleted population in the AAA patient, from naive precursors. Last, neutralizing receptor targets of OPN in the setting of AAA homogenate coincubation abrogated the inhibition of TR1 induction.OPN, secreted by the VSMCs of the tunica media, is elevated in the circulating plasma and aortic wall of patients with AAA. It can inhibit the induction of the TR1 suppressor cell, leading to an overall proinflammatory state contributing to progressive aortic wall breakdown and dilation.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Kinins are inflammatory mediators of potential relevance in IBD, because at least the kinin B1 receptor subtype is upregulated in human or animal intestinal  and also both B1 and B2 receptors for kinins support  and epithelial electrogenic ion transport that leads to secretory diarrhoea. In this issue of the BJP, Hara et al. report the therapeutic effect of a modern and selective nonpeptide kinin B1 receptor antagonist, SSR240612 ((2R)-2-(((3R)-3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3-(((6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)sulphonyl)amino)propanoyl)amino)-3-(4-((2R,)-2,6-dimethylpiperidinyl)methyl)phenyl)-N-isopropyl-N-methylpropanamide hydrochloride), with benefits such as decreased neutrophil influx and improved macroscopic tissue scoring. The results were corroborated using kinin B1 receptor gene-knockout mice. Further, kinin B1 receptor upregulation in this inflammatory model is partially dependent on TNF-alpha, a recognized target for IBD pharmacotherapy. More work is warranted to evaluate the value of the kinin B1 receptor antagonists as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic option for IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24163441>Induction of regulator of G-protein signaling 2 expression by long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists and glucocorticoids in human airway epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) multiple mediators act on Gαq-linked G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to cause bronchoconstriction. However, acting on the airway epithelium, such mediators may also elicit inflammatory responses. In human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells (bronchial epithelium + adenovirus 12-SV40 hybrid), regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 2 mRNA and protein were synergistically induced in response to combinations of long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) (salmeterol, formoterol) plus glucocorticoid (dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, budesonide). Equivalent responses occurred in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Concentrations of glucocorticoid plus LABA required to induce RGS2 expression in BEAS-2B cells were consistent with the levels achieved therapeutically in the lungs. As RGS2 is a GTPase-activating protein that switches off Gαq, intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) flux was used as a surrogate of responses induced by histamine, methacholine, and the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619 [(Z)-7-[(1S,4R,5R,)-5-[(E,3S)-3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl]-3-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-6-yl]hept-5-enoic acid]. This was significantly attenuated by salmeterol plus dexamethasone pretreatment, or RGS2 overexpression, and the protective effect of salmeterol plus dexamethasone was abolished by RGS2 RNA silencing. Although methacholine and U46619 induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) release and this was inhibited by RGS2 overexpression, the repression of U46619-induced IL-8 release by salmeterol plus dexamethasone was unaffected by RGS2 knockdown. Given a role for Gαq-mediated pathways in inducing IL-8 release, we propose that RGS2 acts redundantly with other effector processes to repress IL-8 expression. Thus, RGS2 expression is a novel effector mechanism in the airway epithelium that is induced by glucocorticoid/LABA combinations. This could contribute to the efficacy of glucocorticoid/LABA combinations in asthma and COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524831>Acute kidney injury with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 in severe sepsis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to detail the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) vs. Ringer's on kidney function including the interaction with mortality in post-hoc analyses as resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 increased mortality in the Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock () trial.In all 798 randomised patients, we assessed the incidence and effect on mortality of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the HES vs. Ringer's acetate groups using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome criteria. We also assessed the intervention effect on time to and duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT).At baseline, the intervention groups were similar. The maximal AKI stage was higher in the HES vs. Ringer's group within the first 5 days after randomisation (P = 0.03), the average difference being 0.2 points (P < 0.01). An increase in AKI stage was associated with mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.35; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49; P < 0.01). Significantly, more patients in the HES group received RRT within the first 5 days (P = 0.01), and the time to initiation of RRT was also shorter compared with the Ringer's group (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.01-1.93; P = 0.04). The intervention effect of HES on mortality was reduced when adjusting for AKI stage as a time-dependent covariate (P = 0.15).In patients with severe sepsis, HES appeared to increase the rate of severe AKI and use of RRT within the first 5 days. The increased mortality observed with HES may have been partly mediated through acute kidney impairment.© 2014 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

The experiment started by randomly assigning weaned pigs to groups V (n=24) and U (n=26). V pigs were vaccinated with a commercial live attenuated PRRSV vaccine and the U animals were kept as unvaccinated controls. Twenty-eight days later, 6U pigs were separated and allocated in individual boxes. The remaining 20U pigs were intranasally inoculated with PRRSV isolate 3267 (from now on designated as seeder (S) pigs) and 48h later were distributed in boxes where they were commingled with either V or U pigs in 1:1 groups (first contact phase), resulting in :U and 14S:V pairs. As soon as a V pig was detected to be viremic because of contact with a S, the infected V (from now on designated as V) was transferred (<24h after detection) to a new pen where it was comingled with a new V pig (designated as V) in a second contact phase. For the first contact phase, pigs were maintained 21days at maximum and for the second contact phase the maximum exposure period was 14days. Two V pigs tested positive for the vaccine virus (>99.5% similarity) when they were relocated with the corresponding V pigs and they were removed; thus, only 12V were finally considered. All V pigs (12/12) exposed to S animals became infected although the first detection of viremia occurred at 13.6±3.6days, one week later than in U (p<0.05). Also, duration of viremia was shorter for V compared to U, (5.5±4.3days versus 12.5±2.7days). The V group showed remarkable individual variability: eight animals had a viremic period of 5 or less days (3.0±1.4) while the remaining four had a longer viremic period of more than one week (10.8±2.9). This situation was not observed in U. In the second contact phase, transmission from V to V pigs occurred in 7/8 cases (87.5%). The mean duration of viremia for V was 4.8±3.4 and two different patterns were again observed: two animals had viremias of 9-10days and the rest averaged 3.0±1.4days (range: 2-5days). Vaccinated groups V and V had a significantly lower PRRSV shedding in oral fluids for at least the first 9days after the onset of the viremia compared to U, and shedding for V2 was even significantly lower (p<0.05) than shedding for V. Our experimental design reproduced the worst-case scenario for evaluating the effect of vaccination and, under such conditions; it was still efficacious in slowering PRRSV transmission and decreasing the global viral load and particularly oral shedding.Copyright © 2016.

Whereas the injurious effects of surgical preparation of the vein conduit have been extensively studied, little is known about the influence of the clinical environment of the donor leg from which the vein is obtained.We studied the cellular responses of fresh saphenous vein samples obtained before implantation in 46 patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass surgery. Using an ex vivo model of response to injury, we quantified the outgrowth of cells from explants of the adventitial and medial layers of the vein. We correlated this cellular outgrowth with the clinical characteristics of the patients, including the Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification of the donor leg for ischemia, wounds, and infection as well as smoking and diabetes.Cellular outgrowth was significantly faster and more robust from the adventitial layer than from the medial layer. The factors of leg ischemia (P < .001), smoking (P = .042), and leg infection (P = .045) were associated with impaired overall outgrowth from the adventitial tissue on multivariable analysis. Only ischemia (P = .046) was associated with impaired outgrowth of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the medial tissue. Co-culture of adventitial cells and SMCs propagated from vein explants revealed that adventitial cells significantly inhibited the growth of SMCs, whereas SMCs promoted the growth of adventitial cells. The AA genotype of the -838C>A p27 polymorphism (previously associated with superior graft patency) enhanced these effects, whereas the factor of smoking attenuated adventitial cell inhibition of SMC growth. Comparing gene expression, the cells cultured from the media overexpress Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with  and infection, whereas those from the adventitia overexpress gene families associated with development and stem/progenitor cell maintenance.The adverse clinical environment of the leg may influence the biologic behavior of the cells in the vein wall, especially the adventitial cells. Chronic ischemia was the most significant factor that retards adventitial cell outgrowth. The cells arising from the vein adventitia may be key players in determining a healthy adaptive or a pathologic response to the injuries associated with vein grafting.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Exacerbations are frequently associated with right heart decompensation and accelerate disease progression. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) might have therapeutic potential as pulmonary vasodilators and anti-inflammatory agents, but utility in exacerbations of chronic lung diseases is unknown. We hypothesized that cytokine releases induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major bacterial trigger of , are reduced by ERAs in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (PVSMCs). Ex vivo cultivated human PVSMCs were preincubated with the endothelin-A-receptor selective inhibitor ambrisentan, with the endothelin-B-receptor selective inhibitor BQ788 [sodium (2R)-2-{[(2S)-2-({[(2R,)-2,6-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}amino)-4,4-dimethylpentanoyl][1-(methoxycarbonyl)-d-tryptophyl]amino}hexanoate], or with the dual blocker bosentan before stimulation with smooth LPS (S-LPS), rough LPS (Re-LPS), or a mixture of long and short forms (M-LPS). Expression of cytokines and LPS receptors (TLR4, CD14) were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and/or quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All LPS forms induced interleukin (IL)-6-, IL-8-, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release. Bosentan and BQ788 inhibited M-LPS-induced release of all cytokines and soluble CD14 (sCD14) but not TLR4 expression. Ambrisentan blocked M-LPS-induced IL-6 release but not IL-8, GM-CSF, or LPS receptors. IL-8 release induced by S-LPS, which requires CD14 to activate TLR4, was blocked by bosentan and BQ788. IL-8 release induced by Re-LPS, which does not require CD14 to activate TLR4, was insensitive to both bosentan and BQ788. In conclusion, PVSMCs contribute to  in bacteria-induced exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. Inhibition of the endothelin-B receptor suppresses cytokine release induced by long/smooth LPS attributable to sCD14 downregulation. ERAs, particularly when targeting the endothelin-B receptor, might have therapeutic utility in exacerbations of chronic lung diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28739506>Glycosaminoglycans from marine sources as therapeutic agents.</a></h2><p>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in marine animals are different to those of terrestrial organisms, mainly in terms of molecular weight and sulfation. The therapeutic properties of GAGs are related to their ability to interact with proteins, which is very much influenced by sulfation position and patterns. Since currently GAGs cannot be chemically synthesized, they are sourced from natural products, with high intra- but also inter-species variability, in terms of chain length, disaccharide composition and sulfation pattern. Consequently, sulfated GAGs are the most interesting molecules in the marine environment and constitute the focus of the present review. In particular, chondroitin sulfate (CS) appears as the most promising compound. CS-E chains [GlcA-GalNAc(4S,)] extracted from squid possess antiviral and anti-metastatic activities and seem to impart signalling properties and improve the mechanical performance of cartilage engineering constructs; Squid CS-E and octopus CS-K [GlcA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)], dermatan sulfate (DS) from sea squirts [-iK units, IdoA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)] and sea urchins [-iE units, IdoA-GalNAc(4S,)] and hybrids CS/DS from sharks (-B/iB [GlcA/IdoA(2S)-GalNAc(4S)], -D/iD [GlcA/IdoA(2S)-GalNAc()] and -E/iE units [GlcA/IdoA-GalNAc(4S,)]) promote neurite outgrowth and could be valuable materials for nerve regeneration. Also displaying antiviral and anti-metastatic properties, a rare CS with fucosylated branches isolated from sea cucumbers is an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agent. In this same line, marine heparin extracted from shrimp and sea squirt has proven anti-inflammatory properties, with the added advantage of decreased risk of bleeding because of its low anticoagulant activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Given the critical role of the endothelium in balancing hemostasis, we investigated single-point associations between whole blood coagulopathy by thrombelastography (TEG) and plasma/serum markers of endothelial activation and damage in patients with severe sepsis.A post-hoc multicenter prospective observational study in a subgroup of 184 patients from the Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock () Trial. Study patients were admitted to two Danish intensive care units. Inclusion criteria were severe sepsis, pre-intervention whole blood TEG measurement and a plasma/serum research sample available from baseline (pre-intervention) for analysis of endothelial-derived biomarkers. Endothelial-derived biomarkers were measured in plasma/serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (syndecan-1, thrombomodulin, protein C (PC), tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Pre-intervention TEG, functional fibrinogen (FF) and laboratory and clinical data, including mortality, were retrieved from the trial database.Most patients presented with septic shock (86%) and pulmonary (60%) or abdominal (30%) focus of infection. The median (IQR) age was 67 years (59 to 75), and 55% were males. The median SOFA and SAPS II scores were 8 (6 to 10) and 56 (41 to 68), respectively, with 7-, 28- and 90-day mortality rates being 21%, 39% and 53%, respectively. Pre-intervention (before treatment with different fluids), TEG reaction (R)-time, angle and maximum amplitude (MA) and FF MA all correlated with syndecan-1, thrombomodulin and PC levels. By multivariate linear regression analyses, higher syndecan-1 and lower PC were independently associated with TEG and FF hypocoagulability at the same time-point: 100 ng/ml higher syndecan-1 predicted 0.64 minutes higher R-time (SE 0.25), 1.78 mm lower TEG MA (SE 0.87) and 0.84 mm lower FF MA (SE 0.42; all P < 0.05), and 10% lower protein C predicted 1.24 mm lower TEG MA (SE 0.31).In our cohort of patients with severe sepsis, higher circulating levels of biomarkers of mainly endothelial damage were independently associated with hypocoagulability assessed by TEG and FF.

The use of light and immunofluorescent microscopy, the measurement of the volume of the fluid in the intestinal loops and the quantitative inoculation of their contents resulted in revealing the differences in the properties of the virulent and vaccine strains. The vaccine strains, in contrast to the virulent strains, did not proliferate in the lumen and did not cause the accumulation of fluid in the intestinal loops. They retained sharply limited, especially in the streptomycin-dependent bacteria, ability to penetrate into enterocytes and, via their cytoplasm, into the basement membrane, but lost their ability to proliferate in the cytoplasm of enterocytes (and probably even deteriorated there) and to cause plurulent ulcerous .

Recent work demonstrates that specialized proresolving lipid mediators biosynthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as resolvin D1 (RvD1), actively orchestrate the process of  resolution. We investigated the effects of local perivascular delivery of RvD1 in a rabbit vein graft model.Ipsilateral jugular veins were implanted as carotid interposition grafts through an anastomotic cuff technique in New Zealand white rabbits (3-4 kg; N = 80). RvD1 (1 μg) was delivered to the vein bypass grafts in a perivascular fashion, using either 25% Pluronic F127 gel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo) or a thin bilayered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) film. No treatment (bypass only) and vehicle-loaded Pluronic gels or PLGA films served as controls. Delivery of RvD1 to venous tissue was evaluated 3 days later by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Total leukocyte infiltration, macrophage infiltration, and cell proliferation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Elastin and trichrome staining was performed on grafts harvested at 28 days after bypass to evaluate neointimal hyperplasia and vein graft remodeling.Perivascular treatments did not influence rates of graft thrombosis (23%), major wound complications (4%), or death (3%). Leukocyte (CD45) and macrophage (RAM11) infiltration was significantly reduced in the RvD1 treatment groups vs controls at 3 days (60%-72% reduction; P < .01). Cellular proliferation (Ki67 index) was also significantly lower in RvD1-treated vs control grafts at 3 days (40%-50% reduction; P < .01). Treatment of vein grafts with RvD1-loaded gels reduced neointimal thickness at 28 days by 61% vs bypass only (P < .001) and by 63% vs vehicle gel (P < .001). RvD1-loaded PLGA films reduced neointimal formation at 28 days by 50% vs bypass only (P < .001). RvD1 treatment was also associated with reduced collagen deposition in vein grafts at 28 days.Local perivascular delivery of RvD1 attenuates vein graft hyperplasia without associated toxicity in a rabbit carotid bypass model. This effect appears to be mediated by both reduced leukocyte recruitment and decreased cell proliferation within the graft. Perivascular PLGA films may also impart protection through biomechanical scaffolding in this venous arterialization model.

We hypothesized that ASC-based therapies would accelerate wound healing.Diabetes was induced in four Yorkshire swine through intravenous injection of streptozotocin. ASCs were harvested from flank fat and cultured in either M199 or EGM-2 medium. A duplicate series of seven full-thickness dorsal wounds were surgically created on each swine. The wounds in the cellular treatment group underwent injection of low-dose or high-dose ASCs or EC/ASCs on day 0, with a repeat injection of one half of the initial dose on day 15. Wounds assigned to the topical CM therapy were covered with 2 mL of either serum-free M199 primed by ASCs or human umbilical vein endothelial cells every 3 days. Wounds were assessed at day 0, 10, 15, 20, and 28. The swine were sacrificed on day 28. ImageJ software was used to evaluate the percentage of wound healing. The wounded skin underwent histologic, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examinations to evaluate markers of angiogenesis and .We found an increase in the percentage of wound closure rates in cell-based treatments and topical therapies at various points compared with the untreated control wounds (P < .05).

Although the cloned enzyme has been demonstrated to have a critical role in tumor metastasis, the substrate specificity has been poorly understood. In the present study, the specificity of the purified recombinant human heparanase was investigated for the first time using a series of structurally defined oligosaccharides isolated from heparin/heparan sulfate. The best substrates were deltaHexUA(+/-2S)-GlcN(NS,)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,) and deltaHexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,) (where deltaHexUA, GlcN, GlcUA, NS, 2S, and  represent unsaturated hexuronic acid, d-glucosamine, d-glucuronic acid, 2-N-sulfate, 2-O-sulfate, and 6-O-disulfate, respectively). Based on the percentage conversion of the substrates to products under identical assay conditions, several aspects of the recognition structures were revealed. 1) The minimum recognition backbone is the trisaccharide GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN. 2) The target GlcUA residues are in the sulfated region. 3) The -GlcN()-GlcUA-GlcN(NS)- sequence is essential but not sufficient as the cleavage site. 4) The IdoUA(2S) residue, located two saccharides away from the target GlcUA residue, claimed previously to be essential, is not indispensable. 5) The 3-O-sulfate group on the GlcN is dispensable and even has an inhibitory effect when located in a highly sulfated region. 6) Based on these and previous results, HexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,)-IdoUA-GlcNAc()-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,+/-)-IdoUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,) (where HexUA represents hexuronic acid) has been proposed as a probable physiological target octasaccharide sequence.

Individual trial sites administered significantly different volumes of fluid resuscitation and total fluid input after adjusting for baseline variables (P<0.001). Increased lactate, higher cardiovascular and renal SOFA subscores, lower respiratory SOFA subscore and surgery were all independently associated with increased fluid resuscitation volumes.Hospital characteristics adjusted for patient baseline values were associated with differences in fluid resuscitation volumes given in the first 3 days of severe sepsis.

TEG (standard and functional fibrinogen) was measured consecutively for 5 days, and clinical data including bleeding and death was retrieved from the trial database. Statistical analyses included Cox regression with time-dependent covariates and joint modelling techniques.Of 267 eligible patients, we analysed 260 patients with TEG data. At 90 days, 68 (26 %) had bled and 139 (53 %) had died. For all TEG variables, hypocoagulability according to the reference range was significantly associated with increased risk of death. In a linear model, hazard ratios for death were 6.03 (95 % confidence interval, 1.64-22.17) for increased clot formation speed, 1.10 (1.04-1.16) for decreased angle, 1.09 (1.05-1.14) for decreased clot strength and 1.12 (1.06-1.18) for decreased fibrinogen contribution to clot strength (functional fibrinogen MA), showing that deterioration towards hypocoagulability in any TEG variable significantly increased the risk of death. Patients treated with HES had lower functional fibrinogen MA than those treated Ringer's acetate, which significantly increased the risk of subsequent bleeding [HR 2.43 (1.16-5.07)] and possibly explained the excess bleeding with HES in the  trial.In our cohort of patients with severe sepsis, progressive hypocoagulability defined by TEG variables was associated with increased risk of death and increased risk of bleeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940692>Translation of Inhaled Drug Optimization Strategies into Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Using GSK2292767A, a Novel Inhaled Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase  Inhibitor.</a></h2><p>This study describes the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmaco-dynamic (PD) profile of -(5-(4-(5-(((2,6)-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)methyl)oxazol-2-yl)-1-indazol-6-yl)-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanesulfonamide (GSK2292767A), a novel low-solubility inhaled phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K) inhibitor developed as an alternative to 2-(6-(1H-indol-4-yl)-1H-indazol-4-yl)-5-((4-isopropylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)oxazole (nemiralisib), which is a highly soluble inhaled inhibitor of PI3K with a lung profile consistent with once-daily dosing. GSK2292767A has a similar in vitro cellular profile to nemiralisib and reduces eosinophilia in a murine PD model by 63% ( = 5,  < 0.05). To explore whether a low-soluble compound results in effective PI3K inhibition in humans, a first time in human study was conducted with GSK2292767A in healthy volunteers who smoke. GSK2292767A was generally well tolerated, with headache being the most common reported adverse event. PD changes in induced sputum were measured in combination with drug concentrations in plasma from single (0.05-2 mg,  = 37), and 14-day repeat (2 mg,  = 12) doses of GSK2292767A. Trough bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for PK was taken after 14 days of repeat dosing. GSK2292767A displayed a linear increase in plasma exposure with dose, with marginal accumulation after 14 days. Induced sputum showed a 27% (90% confidence interval 15%, 37%) reduction in phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate (the product of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation) 3 hours after a single dose. Reduction was not maintained 24 hours after single or repeat dosing. BAL analysis confirmed the presence of GSK2292767A in lung at 24 hours, consistent with the preclinical lung retention profile. Despite good lung retention, target engagement was only present at 3 hours. This exposure-response disconnect is an important observation for future inhaled drug design strategies considering low solubility to drive lung retention.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363361>Predictive value of NGAL for use of renal replacement therapy in patients with severe sepsis.</a></h2><p>The predictive value of plasma and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and acute kidney injury (AKI) is not established in patients with severe sepsis.This was a prospective observational study in three general intensive care units (ICUs) in adult ICU patients with severe sepsis needing fluid resuscitation and a sub-study of the  trial. Plasma and urine were sampled at baseline and NGAL was measured using particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (The NGAL Test). Outcome measures were use of RRT in ICU, development of AKI according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes plasma creatinine criteria within 48 h and 90-day mortality.Two-hundred- twenty-two patients had samples taken (211 had plasma and 162 urine sampled); simplified acute physiology score II was 54 (39-66). Forty patients (18%) had RRT in the ICU, 91 patients had AKI at enrollment; of the remaining 131 patients 24% developed AKI during the first 48 h, and 55% had died at 90 days. Areas under receiver-operating characteristics curve (AuROC) for predicting use of RRT in ICU were 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.78) and 0.62 (0.51-0.73) for plasma and urine NGAL, respectively. AuROC of plasma and urine NGAL for AKI were 0.66 (0.54-0.77) and 0.71 (0.59-0.82), respectively, and for 90-day mortality 0.55 (0.47-0.63) and 0.61 (0.53-0.70), respectively. Combining NGAL values with plasma creatinine did not improve AuROCs.In ICU patients with severe sepsis, plasma and urine NGAL had low predictive power for use of RRT, AKI and 90-day mortality.

The inflammatory response is involved in the occurrence and development of TAD, possibly potentiated by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). This study aimed to determine whether expression of PDGF-B (a subunit of PDGF-BB) was increased in TAD patients and to explore the factors responsible for its upregulation and subsequent effects on TAD.Full-thickness ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients (n = 15) and control patients (n = 10) were examined for expression of PDGF-B and its receptor (PDGFRB) and in terms of morphology, , and fibrosis. Blood samples from TAD and control patients were collected to detect plasma levels of PDGF-BB and soluble elastins.Expression levels of PDGF-B, PDGFRB, and collagen I were significantly enhanced in ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients compared with controls. Furthermore, soluble elastic fragments and PDGF-BB were significantly increased in plasma from TAD patients compared with controls, and numerous irregular elastic fibers and macrophages were seen in the ascending aorta wall in TAD patients.An increase in elastic fragments in the aorta wall might be responsible for inducing the activation and migration of macrophages to injured sites, leading to elevated expression of PDGF-B, which in turn induces deposition of collagen, disrupts extracellular matrix homeostasis, and increases the stiffness of the aorta wall, resulting in compromised aorta compliance.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

The clinically significant impact of infection and capsular contracture after breast implant surgery has brought clinicians to create infection reduction protocols for both oncologic and cosmetic operations alike. The use of triple-antibiotic saline irrigation has become a recommended intraoperative maneuver within these protocols to minimize surgical site infections, but the constituents of the irrigation, its individual efficacy, and the acceptability of including povidone-iodine within irrigation recipes have been debated. This review will investigate the microbiological data behind the selection of the constituents of triple-antibiotic saline. In vitro testing of the effectiveness of topical antibiotics used in saline irrigation against microorganisms responsible for breast implant infection is reviewed. Clinical data are presented describing the impact of triple-antibiotic saline on implant infection and capsular contracture after cosmetic and reconstructive surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30439299>Approach to the Assessment and Management of Adult Patients With Atopic Dermatitis: A Consensus Document.

IL-6 secretion in the J774.1 cells was markedly increased by Pam3CS4, LPS, and CpG, the ligands to TLR1/2, 4, and 9 respectively. Among these three ligands, CpG-induced IL-6 was most clearly suppressed by CSs and their digests. Suppression of IL-6 secretion by smaller sized CS-A was stronger than that by intact CS-A, whereas no such size-dependent suppression was apparent for CS-C. Di-4S, the disaccharide unit of the CS-A digest, also showed much stronger suppression than Di-, the disaccharide unit of the CS-C digest, and the non-sulfated disaccharide unit, Di-0S.

This study shows: (i) that the non-terminal trisaccharide of heparin is sufficient to initiate the same responses as intact heparin, (ii) that a fully sulfated tetrasaccharide isolated from bacterial heparin lyase 1 digests of heparin that contains a Δ-2S-iduronate on the non-reducing end does not initiate the same responses as intact heparin, and (iii) that removal of the Δ-2S-iduronate to expose the fully sulfated trisaccharide (GlcNS()-IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS()) does initiate the same responses as intact heparin.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary metabolism in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the metabolic-, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation, metabolic dysregulation, or  and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal metabolic alteration, fat accumulation,  and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease.

Transgenic mice were generated with the beta-galactosidase (LacZ) reporter gene inserted in-frame in the exon II of Hec-6st within the isolated BAC DNA fragment. LacZ was expressed specifically on HEV in LN, as indicated by its colocalization with peripheral node vascular addressin.

Formation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide may be injurious to tissue directly; however, it is thought that the primary mediators of tissue damage are the secondarily derived oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and hypohalous acid. The gastrointestinal tract is particularly well endowed with the enzymatic machinery necessary to form large amounts of ROMs. Sources of ROMs in the gastrointestinal tract include mucosal oxidases such as xanthine oxidase, amine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase as well as the NADPH oxidase found in the resident phagocytic leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) of the lamina propria. We have demonstrated that reperfusion of ischemic small intestine results in substantial mucosal injury that is mediated by oxy radicals generated from xanthine oxidase and inflammatory leukocytes. The final mediator of toxicity appears to be the hydroxyl radical derived from the iron-catalyzed interaction between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Data from our laboratories as well as other laboratories suggest that reactive oxygen metabolites may play an important role in mediating mucosal injury during active episodes of ulcerative colitis. We present a working hypothesis which states that transient ischemic episodes in the bowel initiate a cascade of self-perpetuating cycles of ROM formation,  and, ultimately, mucosal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28525415>Effects of Collagenase Digestion and Stromal Vascular Fraction Supplementation on Volume Retention of Fat Grafts.</a></h2><p>The use of autologous fat as a soft tissue filler has increased over the past decade in both reconstructive and aesthetic surgeries. Enhancement of autologous fat grafts with the addition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has been reported to improve long-term volume retention. Stromal vascular fraction is most commonly isolated using enzymatic digestion, but it is unknown what effect the digestion process has on the adipocytes and SVF cells that comprise the graft. Some clinicians have reported use of enzymatically digested fat grafts to alter the physical properties of the tissue in specialized applications. We have previously reported that increasing collagenase digestion duration adversely affects the viability of adipocytes and SVF cells. Here, we aimed to determine if collagenase digestion of adipocytes before grafting is detrimental to long-term graft retention and if SVF supplementation can abrogate these potential deleterious effects.We used a published xenograft model in which human lipoaspirate was implanted into the scalp of immunocompromised mice to study the effects of collagenase digestion on in vivo graft survival after 12 weeks. We used 4 experimental groups: grafts composed of collagenase-digested and nondigested adipocytes (50-minute digestion) and grafts with and without SVF supplementation. We used microcomputed tomography to serially and noninvasively quantify graft volume, in conjunction with hematoxylin-eosin staining of histological cross-sections of implanted and excised grafts to assess overall tissue viability. We found that adipocytes that were collagenase-digested before implantation had significantly lower retention rates at 12 weeks and poorer tissue health, which was assessed by quantifying the number of intact adipocytes, the number of cystic formations, and by scoring the degree of  and fibrosis. Further, we found that SVF supplementation of the digested grafts improved graft survival, but not to the level observed in undigested grafts.We conclude that collagenase digestion adversely affects the long-term volume retention of fat grafts, but that graft retention is improved by SVF supplementation. These experimental results can serve as an initial framework to further elucidate the reported efficacy and safety of using collagenase-digested fat grafts and SVF in the clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376127>Functional biomarkers of musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS) for early in vivo screening of selective MMP-13 inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Long-term administration of non-selective matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, such as marimastat, in humans elicits musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS), a syndrome characterized by joint damage including pain, stiffness, and . This pathology is a significant obstacle to the clinical development of MMP inhibitors and in pre-clinical models MSS can be verified only after terminal histopathology. Consequently, we devised a longitudinal and functional readout of MSS in conscious rats treated with marimastat that was validated against terminal histological assessment.MSS was induced by minipump infusion of marimastat (5-10mg/kg/day). In marimastat-treated or vehicle-control groups, three possible functional biomarkers were assessed: paw volume (PV), landing foot splay separation (LFSS), and rotarod performance (n=6 rats/group for each endpoint).Histologically, fibrosis scores in the synovium and ligament increased from 0 on Day 1 (D1) to 4.6±0.2 and 4.7±0.1, respectively, on D15; growth plate thickness was also elevated from 215.0±6.3μm (D1) to 253.3±8.0μm (D15). While neither PV nor LFSS were correlative with MSS histopathology, marimastat (10mg/kg/day) reduced rotarod performance from 180±0s (D0) to 135±30s (D9) using a constant speed protocol (10rpm, 180s) and from 180±0s (D0) to 96± (D6) employing a variable speed protocol (increasing from 5 to 25rpm over 180s).Results of the present study demonstrate that rotarod performance can be used as a predictive longitudinal, in vivo functional biomarker of MSS concomitant with histological evidence of joint damage to effectively facilitate compound selection during drug discovery. Moreover, for targets with a mechanistic risk for MSS, the model is also conducive to inclusion in secondary pharmacodynamic studies during lead optimization to identify the best (safest) compounds for advancement into clinical trials.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This is a frequent complication in patients older than 75 years old. The two neurological pictures are often inter-related. The pathophysiology of both entities is similar and related to post-operative neuro-; therefore onset may occur independently of any surgical complication. Post-operative cerebral dysfunction is a serious organic complication. Reduction of  represents the most logical preventive measure but currently there are no studies that show this to be effective. Prevention therefore means combining several minor measures, elements that fit well into programs of enhanced post-operative recovery after surgery. Diminished pre-operative cognitive status being a major risk factor, pre-operative rehabilitation combining nutritional, physical and cognitive support can be helpful.Copyright Â© 2016.

There is a continuous search for new pharmacologically active analgesic agents with minor adverse effects. Recently, the synthesis of (-)-(2S,)-(6-ethyl-tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-formic acid [tetrahydropyran derivative (TD)] was described. The objective of this study was to investigate antinociceptive effects of TD. Its activity was compared with the activity of morphine. The effects of TD and morphine were evaluated in models of inflammatory and noninflammatory pain. TD (6-1200 μmol/kg, intraperitoneally) significantly reduced the nociceptive effects induced by acetic acid or formalin in mice. TD also demonstrated an antinociceptive effect in the tail-flick and hot-plate model. The opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (at 15 μmol/kg, intraperitoneally), reversed the antinociceptive activity of TD in all the models evaluated. Morphine and TD induced tolerance in mice. However, the onset of tolerance to TD was delayed compared with that induced by morphine. These results indicate that TD develops significant antinociceptive activity and, at least part of its effects seems to be mediated by the opioid system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321605>Tear film inflammatory cytokine upregulation in contact lens discomfort.</a></h2><p>To investigate the ocular inflammatory response, using clinical and immunological techniques, in people experiencing contact lens (CL) discomfort.This study involved 38 adults who were full-time, silicone-hydrogel CL wearers. Participants were categorized into groups based upon a validated CL dry-eye questionnaire (CLDEQ-8) (n = 17 'asymptomatic', CLDEQ-8 score <9; n = 21 'symptomatic', CLDEQ-8 score ≥13). Examinations were performed at two visits (one with, and one without, CL wear), separated by one-week. Testing included: tear osmolarity, ocular redness, tear stability, ocular surface staining, meibography, tear production and tear collection. Tear osmolarity was taken from the inferior-lateral and superior-lateral menisci. The 'Inferior-Superior Osmotic Difference', I-SOD, was the absolute osmolarity difference between these menisci. Concentrations of seven cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were assayed from basal tears using multiplex cytometric bead array.At baseline, there was no significant difference in key clinical signs between asymptomatic and symptomatic CL wearers (p > 0.05). The I-SOD was greater in symptomatic than asymptomatic CL wearers (23.1 ± 2.6 versus 11.3 ± 1.4 mOsmol/L, p = 0.001). People experiencing CL discomfort had higher tear IL-17A (122.6 ± 23.7 versus 44.0 ± 10.0 pg/mL, p = 0.02) and reduced tear stability (6.3 ± 1.1 versus 10.4 ± 1.6 s, p = 0.03) after several hours of CL wear. Tear IL-17A levels correlated with both the I-SOD (r = 0.43, p = 0.01) and CLDEQ-8 score (r = 0.40, p = 0.01).CL discomfort occurs in individuals having no clinical dry eye signs, and is associated with higher tear levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A.

In normal animals, spinal administration of 100 microg of LY382884 produced a significant inhibition of both the C-fibre-evoked response and post-discharge of dorsal horn neurons, with the wind-up of the neurons being reduced by both 50 and 100 microg of LY382884. The spinal actions of LY382884 were enhanced following 3 h of carrageenan , such that doses of 20 microg and above were able to produce significant inhibitions of the noxious-evoked response of the neurons. Spinal administration of NBQX in normal animals (5-50 microg) inhibited the C-fibre-evoked response of the dorsal horn neurons, but only 50 microg of NBQX was able to inhibit the wind-up and post-discharge of the neurons. Following 3 h of carrageenan , the ability of NBQX to inhibit the wind-up and post-discharge of the neurons was markedly enhanced. These data suggest that both AMPA and kainate GluR5 receptors play an enhanced role in spinal nociceptive processing following the development of peripheral , as antagonists at both receptors are more effective against nociceptive responses, including wind-up under these inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23926905>Hydroxyethyl starch - the importance of being earnest.</a></h2><p>Despite ongoing controversial expert discussions the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently recommended to suspend marketing authorisations for hydroxyethyl starch. This comment critically evaluates the line of arguments. Basically, the only indication for a colloid is intravascular hypovolemia. Crystalloid use appears reasonable to compensate ongoing extracellular losses beyond. In the hemodynamically instable patient this leads to the distinction between an initial resuscitation phase where colloids might be indicated and a crystalloidal maintenance phase thereafter. It is important to bear this in mind when reevaluating the studies the EMA referred to in the context of its recent decision: i) VISEP compared ringer's lactate to 10% HES 200/0.5 in septic patients and found an increased incidence of renal failure in HES receivers. Unfortunately, study treatment was started only after initial stabilization with HES, randomizing hemodynamically stable patients into a rational (crystalloids) and an irrational (high dose starch until ICU discharge) maintenance treatment. ii)  compared ringer's acetate to 6% HES 130/0.42 for fluid resuscitation in septic patients and found an increased need of renal replacement therapy and a higher mortality in the HES group. However, patients of both groups were again randomized only after initial stabilization with colloids, the actual comparison was, therefore, again rational vs. irrational. Beyond that, the documentation is partly fragmentary, leaving many important questions around the fate of the patients unanswered. iii) CHEST randomized ICU patients to receive saline or 6% HES 130/0.4 for fluid resuscitation. Actually, despite partly discussed in a different way, this trial showed no relevant differences in outcome. In all, two studies showed what happens to septic patients if starches are used in a way we do not observe in daily practice. The third one actually proves their safety. The benefit of perioperative goal-directed preload optimization using starches is unquestioned. Taking these informations into account, the recommendation of the EMA starches to be generally dangerous remains mysterious and incomprehensible. An authority being able to dictate behavior should stand clear from oppressively ending a worldwide expert discussion and step back into the role of the observer until science achieves an agreement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1997278>Apoptosis (programmed cell death) and functional changes in aging neutrophils.

The aim of this cross-sectional study is to clarify the factors important for impairment of blood rheology in obese subjects using MC-FAN.One hundred and fifty-nine obese subjects and 100 non-obese subjects with no history of cardiovascular diseases were enrolled. Blood passage time (BPT) was measured using MC-FAN and relationships between BPT and various clinical parameters were examined.BPT was significantly higher in obese subjects than in non-obese subjects (obesity vs. non-obesity: 62.8 ± 17.9s vs. 54.1 ± 14., p<0.001); however, there were no significant relationships between BPT and body mass index or waist circumference in obese subjects. BPT was significantly related to systolic blood pressure levels (r=0.21; p<0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations (r=0.37; p<0.001), a marker of , and derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites test (r=0.38; p<0.001), a marker of oxidative stress, smoking, and exercise habits in obese subjects.

It is hypothesized that treatment of animals with resolvin D1 (RvD1) would reduce abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation by inhibiting NETosis.Wild-type 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 47) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) mice (n = 20) were used in two models to demonstrate the effects of RvD1 on AAA growth. In the topical elastase AAA model, wild-type mice were divided into three groups: a deactivated elastase control group, in which sham surgery was performed using deactivated elastase and mice were intravenously injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once a day until harvest; an elastase group, in which active elastase was used to induce AAA and mice were injected with PBS daily until harvest; and an RvD1-treated group, in which AAA was induced and mice were injected with RvD1 daily until harvest. In the angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA model, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet and implanted with osmotic infusion pumps containing Ang II (1000 ng/kg/min). The Ang II model was divided into two groups: an Ang II control group, in which Ang II was delivered and mice were injected with PBS daily until harvest; and an RvD1-treated group, in which Ang II was delivered and mice were injected with RvD1 daily until harvest. On postoperative day 3, day 14, or day 28, aortic and blood samples were collected for Western blot, histology, cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gelatin zymography after aortic diameter measurement.The day 14 RvD1-treated group demonstrated 42% reduced AAA diameter compared with the elastase group (P < .001). On postoperative day 3, the RvD1-treated group showed decreased levels of NETosis markers citrullinated histone H3 (P = .04) and neutrophil elastase (P = .002) compared with the elastase group. Among important cytokines involved in AAA formation, interleukin (IL) 1β was downregulated (P = .02) whereas IL-10, a protective cytokine, was upregulated (P = .01) in the RvD1-treated group. Active matrix metalloproteinase 2 also decreased in the RvD1-treated group (P = .03). The RvD1-treated group in the Ang II AAA model, a second model, demonstrated reduced AAA diameter compared with the Ang II control group on day 28 (P < .046). The RvD1-treated group showed decreased levels of citrullinated histone H3 on day 3 (P = .002). Cytokines interferon γ, IL-1β, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were all decreased on day 28 (P < .05).RvD1-mediated inhibition of NETosis may represent a future medical treatment for the attenuation of AAA growth.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

As a MMP-9 inhibitor, ATIQCTPC inhibited the metastasis of LLC, and slowed the growth of the primary tumor of LLC implanted C57BL/6 in mice. The activities of ATIQCTPC to inhibit the ear edema and to decrease the serum levels of TNF-Î± and IL-8 of the mice treated with xylene were explored. The minimal effective dose of ATIQCTPC that can inhibit the primary tumour growth, prevent the metastasis of LLC and reduce the inflammatory response was 0.01 Î¼mol/kg.

To explore the underlying pathophysiology, we compared early changes in plasma cytokine concentrations between patients resuscitated with HES vs. Ringer's acetate.In a subgroup of 226 patients from the  trial, we calculated delta plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 from randomization to day 2. We used multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to assess differences between the groups and associations between delta cytokine concentrations and 90-day mortality, respectively.Baseline characteristics and day 2 mortality were comparable between the groups. We observed similar delta cytokine concentrations in the HES vs. Ringer's group (mean difference in delta TNF-α: -1.5 pg/ml (95% CI, -4.9 to 1.9), P = 0.39; IL-6: 36.0 pg/ml (-24.1 to 96.1), P = 0.24; IL-10: -3.9 pg/ml (-21.1 to 28.9), P = 0.76).
