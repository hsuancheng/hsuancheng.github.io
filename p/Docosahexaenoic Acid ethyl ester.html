Therefore, we studied the effects of a low dose, short term dietary supplementation with highly purified (n-3) ethyl esters with regard to murine T lymphocyte function. A 10-day dietary supplementation with low dose, highly purified (n-3) fatty acid ethyl esters was examined for effects on murine splenic lymphocyte function and membrane composition. Mice were fed diets containing either 3% safflower oil (SAF) ethyl esters, 2% SAF plus 1% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl esters (EPA) (99% pure), or 2% SAF plus 1% docosahexaenoic acid ethyl esters (DHA) (97% pure). Fatty acid analysis of the lymphocyte membranes showed that membrane compositions of the EPA- and DHA-fed mice were subsequently enriched with these (n-3) fatty acids. Con A-induced lymphoproliferative assays (Con A, 5 and 10 micrograms/ml) revealed that splenic lymphocytes from the EPA group had significantly higher mitogenic responses relative to lymphocytes from the DHA or SAF groups (p < 0.05). In contrast, DHA splenocytes had the highest level of 3H-labeled diradylglycerol as a percentage of total lipid. Macrophage-lymphocyte co-cultures demonstrated that the dietary effect on proliferation in response to Con A was influenced by lymphocyte source, but apparently not by macrophage source. In addition, cells from Mycobacterium bovis vaccine-vaccinated mice were placed in culture with purified protein derivative (PPD) (10, 20, and 40 micrograms/ml), as well as Con A (5 and 10 micrograms/ml) to allow comparison between mitogenic and antigenic stimulation. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) existed between the diet groups upon PPD stimulation. However, lymphocytes from the DHA group exhibited significantly higher proliferative responses to Con A than cells from the EPA and SAF groups (p < 0.05). M. bovis vaccine-immunized EPA and DHA fed mice also exhibited significantly reduced delayed-type hypersensitive reactivity to footpad testing with PPD in comparison to that demonstrated by SAF-fed mice (p < 0.05). EPA-fed mice demonstrated the most decreased response. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time that: 1) low dose, short term dietary supplementation with highly purified EPA or DHA can modulate select functional and transmembrane signaling responses of murine splenic lymphocytes; and 2) that these dietary agents have differing effects on mitogen vs Ag receptors.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9603213>Intraamniotic ethyl docosahexaenoate administration protects fetal rat brain from ischemic stress.</a></h2><p>Studies were conducted on the prenatal rat given a single intraamniotic injection of ethyl docosahexaenoate (Et-DHA; 9.6-12 mmol per fetus) or subjected to an n-3 fatty acid-deficient diet to assess the role of docosahexaenoate on oxidative stress during episodes of ischemia. A time-dependent decrease in the ability of brain slices from animals treated with Et-DHA to produce thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS), most pronounced after 1 day (from 58.1 +/- 4.22 to 15.9 +/- 1.6 nmol/mg of DNA), was noticed on stimulation with Fe2+. Brain slices from fetuses treated for 1 day with Et-DHA and those from untreated fetuses produced TBARS levels of 46.7 +/- 6.5 and 114.8 +/- 10.8 nmol/mg of DNA, respectively, after a 20-min occlusion of the fetal-maternal circulation at embryonic day 20, suggesting a protective effect of Et-DHA. The protective effect of a single dose of Et-DHA in utero remained high up to 3 days after injection (p < 0.001) and was long-lasting, yet not significant, up to 3 days following birth. In agreement with a reduction in TBARS production by slices, the endogenous levels of TBARS in brains of Et-DHA-treated animals were lower than in the controls. Et-DHA-injected fetuses exhibited significantly higher levels of esterified DHA than the noninjected controls. n-3-deficient diet given to dams for 2 weeks before birth did not affect the levels of TBARS production in control fetal brain slices but abolished the increase caused by ischemia. Et-DHA administration for 24 h to n-3-deficient fetuses reduced the amount of TBARS produced by the fetal brain slices from 49.1 +/- 8.5 to 31.7 +/- 4.1 nmol/mg of DNA. A protective effect from oxidative damage after postischemic oxidative stress in fetal brain following DHA supplements is suggested, whereas the effect of n-3 fatty acid deficiency in this regard is more ambiguous.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23487785>Omega-3 fatty acids lower blood pressure by directly activating large-conductance Ca²⁺-dependent K⁺ channels.</a></h2><p>Long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), found abundantly in oily fish, may have diverse health-promoting effects, potentially protecting the immune, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. However, the mechanisms underlying the purported health-promoting effects of DHA remain largely unclear, in part because molecular signaling  and effectors of DHA are only beginning to be revealed. In vascular smooth muscle cells, large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K(+) (BK) channels provide a critical vasodilatory influence. We report here that DHA with an EC50 of ∼500 nM rapidly and reversibly activates BK channels composed of the pore-forming Slo1 subunit and the auxiliary subunit β1, increasing currents by up to ∼20-fold. The DHA action is observed in cell-free patches and does not require voltage-sensor activation or Ca(2+) binding but involves destabilization of the closed conformation of the ion conduction gate. DHA lowers blood pressure in anesthetized wild-type but not in Slo1 knockout mice. DHA ethyl ester, contained in dietary supplements, fails to activate BK channels and antagonizes the stimulatory effect of DHA. Slo1 BK channels are thus receptors for long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, and these fatty acids--unlike their ethyl ester derivatives--activate the channels and lower blood pressure. This finding has practical implications for the use of omega-3 fatty acids as nutraceuticals for the general public and also for the critically ill receiving omega-3-enriched formulas.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11278180>Ethyl docosahexaenoate-associated decrease in fetal brain lipid peroxide production is mediated by activation of prostanoid and nitric oxide .</a></h2><p>Previously we have shown that intraamniotic administration of ethyl docosahexaenoate (Et-DHA) to pregnant rats resulted in decreased lipid peroxidation in the fetal brain, under a variety of conditions (S. Glozman, P. Green, E. Yavin, J. Neurochem. 70 (1998) 2482-2491). In the present study we examine the potential mechanisms to explain this effect. This was done by a pharmacological approach, utilizing brain slice preparations from Et-DHA treated or control rats in the presence of various agents and examining the formation of products in the tissue slices or incubation medium. Et-DHA treated brains produced 2-3-fold more prostanoids (PN) than control brains, indicating cyclooxygenase (COX) activation. Indomethacin at 50 microM inhibited PN formation and also abolished Et-DHA induced decrease in lipid peroxides, as evident by the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) released in the medium. The phospholipase A2 inhibitors quinacrine and p-bromophenacyl bromide added at 0.1 mM concentration each to either slices from controls or Et-DHA treated fetal brains, decreased TBARS production. Et-DHA treated brains released 2.2-fold more nitric oxide (NO) than control brains and NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors abolished this effect. Increasing the concentration of NO by the addition of an NO donor greatly decreased the concentration of the TBARS in the medium. These results suggest that at least some of the effect of Et-DHA on decreased lipid peroxidation may be explained by a shift of oxygen species utilization via enzymatically regulated, therefore metabolically controlled, COX and NOS activities.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11223421>Enhanced level of n-3 fatty acid in membrane phospholipids induces lipid peroxidation in rats fed dietary docosahexaenoic acid oil.</a></h2><p>The effect of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) oil with different lipid types on lipid peroxidation was studied in rats. Each group of male Sprague-Dawley rats was pair fed 15% (w/w) of either DHA-triglycerides (DHA-TG), DHA-ethyl esters (DHA-EE) or DHA-phospholipids (DHA-PL) for up to 3 weeks. The palm oil (supplemented with 20% soybean oil) diet without DHA was fed as the control. Dietary DHA oils lowered plasma triglyceride concentrations in rats fed DHA-TG (by 30%), DHA-EE (by 45%) and DHA-PL (by 27%), compared to control. The incorporation of dietary DHA into plasma and liver phospholipids was more pronounced in the DHA-TG and DHA-EE group than in the DHA-PL group. However, DHA oil intake negatively influenced lipid peroxidation in both plasma and liver. Phospholipid peroxidation in plasma and liver was significantly higher than control in rats fed DHA-TG or DHA-EE, but not DHA-PL. These results are consistent with increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and decreased alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma and liver. In addition, liver microsomes from rats of each group were exposed to a mixture of chelated iron (Fe(3+)/ADP) and NADPH to determine the rate of peroxidative damage. During NADPH-dependent peroxidation of microsomes, the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides, as well as TBARS, were elevated and alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly exhausted in DHA-TG and DHA-EE groups. During microsomal lipid peroxidation, there was a greater loss of n-3 fatty acids (mainly DHA) than of n-6 fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). These results indicate that polyunsaturation of n-3 fatty acids is the most important target for lipid peroxidation. This suggests that the ingestion of large amounts of DHA oil enhances lipid peroxidation in the target membranes where greater amounts of n-3 fatty acids are incorporated, thereby increasing the peroxidizability and possibly accelerating the atherosclerotic process.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780261>Mechanisms increasing n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in the heart.</a></h2><p>Due to ambiguous findings on cardiovascular benefits of systemic omega-3 fatty  therapy, endogenous mechanisms contributing to local organ-specific concentrations of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) were examined. Using gas chromatography, 43 fatty acids were analyzed in atrial and ventricular myocardium and in pericardial fluid of male Wistar rats. To examine the endogenous fatty  metabolism, precursors were administered into the pericardial sac. Pro- and anti-inflammatory actions were induced by talc or fenofibrate, respectively. Physical exercise and a sedentary obese state were used for increased beta-oxidation. DHA (22:6n-3) was increased in ventricular when compared with atrial myocardium (9.0 ± 2.1% vs. 4.7 ± 1.0%, p < 0.001). Intrapericardial EPA (20:5n-3) application lead to an increase of the succeeding tetracosapentaenoic  (24:5n-3) in atrial myocardium, which is a key precursor of DHA. In contrast, proinflammatory stimulation of the n-6 HUFA pathway did not influence the n-3 metabolism. Exercise- and -induced increased beta-oxidation, the finalizing step of DHA synthesis, was associated with increased ventricular DHA concentrations (6.7 ± 1.0% vs. 8.4 ± 1.2%, p < 0.01). It is concluded that the endogenous metabolism contributes markedly to myocardial HUFA concentrations. The findings are supposed to influence the efficacy of oral HUFA treatment and provide a rationale for divergent findings of previous trials on omega-3 therapy.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523492>Oral administration of eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid modifies cardiac function and ameliorates congestive heart failure in male rats.</a></h2><p>This study assessed the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on normal cardiac function (part 1) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (part 2) through electrocardiogram analysis and determination of EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations in rat hearts. In part 2, pathologic assessments were also performed. For part 1 of this study, 4-wk-old male rats were divided into a control group and 2 experimental groups. The rats daily were orally administered (1 g/kg body weight) saline, EPA-ethyl ester (EPA-Et; E group), or DHA-ethyl ester (DHA-Et; D group), respectively, for 28 d. ECGs revealed that QT intervals were significantly shorter for groups E and D compared with the control group (P ≤ 0.05). Relative to the control group, the concentration of EPA was higher in the E group and concentrations of EPA and DHA were higher in the D group, although AA concentrations were lower (P ≤ 0.05). In part 2, CHF was produced by subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline into 5-wk-old rats. At 3 d before monocrotaline injection, rats were administered either saline, EPA-Et, or DHA-Et as mentioned above and then killed at 21 d. The study groups were as follows: normal + saline (control), CHF + saline (H group), CHF + EPA-Et (HE group), and CHF + DHA-Et (HD group). QT intervals were significantly shorter (P ≤ 0.05) in the control and HD groups compared with the H and HE groups. Relative to the H group, concentrations of EPA were higher in the HE group and those of DHA were higher in the control and HD groups (P ≤ 0.05). There was less mononuclear cell infiltration in the myocytes of the HD group than in the H group (P = 0.06). The right ventricles in the H, HE, and HD groups showed significantly increased weights (P ≤ 0.05) compared with controls. The administration of EPA-Et or DHA-Et may affect cardiac function by modification of heart fatty acid composition, and the administration of DHA-Et may ameliorate CHF.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21894325>Protective effects of prescription n-3 fatty acids against impairment of spatial cognitive learning ability in amyloid β-infused rats.</a></h2><p>Deposition of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) into the brain causes cognitive impairment. We investigated whether prescription pre-administration of n-3 fatty acids improves cognitive learning ability in young rats and whether it protects against learning ability impairments in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease that was prepared by infusion of Aβ(1-40) into the cerebral ventricles of rats. Pre-administration of TAK-085 (highly purified and concentrated n-3 fatty acids containing eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester and ) at 300 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 12 weeks significantly reduced the number of reference memory errors in an 8-arm radial maze, suggesting that long-term administration of TAK-085 improves cognitive leaning ability in rats. After pre-administration, the control group was divided into the vehicle and Aβ-infused groups, whereas the TAK-085 pre-administration group was divided into the TAK-085 and TAK-085 + Aβ groups (TAK-085-pre-administered Aβ-infused rats). Aβ(1-40) or vehicle was infused into the cerebral ventricle using a mini osmotic pump. Pre-administration of TAK-085 to the Aβ-infused rats significantly suppressed the number of reference and working memory errors and decreased the levels of lipid peroxide and reactive oxygen species in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Aβ-infused rats, suggesting that TAK-085 increases antioxidative defenses.

Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the area of intimal lesions was only 21 +/- 6% in this group, while in the group fed cholesterol without fish oil, the lesioned area attained 76 +/- 5%. Endothelial swelling was less marked, probably due to reduced intracellular lipid accumulation into the foam cells. Adherent macrophages were also fewer.

When arachidonic acid (AA) concentration decreased, AA was added to the diet. Thereafter, a combined treatment with DHA plus AA followed, in a variable proportion that allowed the high levels of DHA in erythrocytes to be maintained. In the patient with Zellweger syndrome, DHA therapy produced an increase in plasmalogen and a decrease in 26:0 and 26:1. No clear clinical improvement could be detected in this patient during the short period of treatment with DHA-EE. The most consistent clinical effect produced by DHA therapy in the other patients with disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis was visual improvement, even in those patients that were virtually blind before the treatment. In general, the developmental curve began to accelerate. The infants became more alert, acquired better visual and social contact and muscular tone improved, with the beginning of good head control.

DHA treatment reduces sickle cell crisis (SCC) rate and ameliorates the inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypercoagulable state of SCD. SC411 is a novel DHA ethyl ester formulation with a proprietary delivery platform (Advanced Lipid Technology) that enhances DHA bioavailability. The SCOT trial investigated the effect of 3 different doses of SC411 on clinical and biochemical endpoints in 67 children with SCD (5-17 years old). Seventy-six percent of subjects were also receiving hydroxyurea. After 4 weeks of treatment with SC411 at 20, 36, and 60 mg DHA/kg per day or placebo a statistically significant ( < .001) mean percentage increase of blood cell membrane DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid was seen vs baseline: 109.0% (confidence interval [CI], 46.7-171.3), 163.8% (CI, 108.3-219.2), 170.8% (CI, 90.2-251.4), and 28.6% (CI, 250.1 to 107.3), respectively.

For the fasting study, the primary measures of BE are baseline-adjusted EPA and DHA levels in total plasma lipids. For the fed study, the primary measures of BE are EPA and DHA ethyl esters in plasma. This guidance differs from that established for icosapent ethyl (EPA ethyl esters) in which the primary measure of BE is baseline-adjusted total EPA in plasma lipids for both the fasting and fed states. The FDA guidance for ω-3 acid ethyl esters is not supported by their physiologic characteristics and triglyceride-lowering mechanisms because EPA and DHA ethyl esters are best characterized as pro-drugs. This article presents an argument for amending the FDA draft guidance for ω-3 acid ethyl esters to use baseline-adjusted EPA and DHA in total plasma lipids as the primary measures of BE for both fasting and fed conditions. This change would harmonize the approaches for demonstration of BE for ω-3 acid ethyl esters and icosapent ethyl (EPA ethyl esters) products for future development programs and is the most physiologically rational approach to BE testing.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

In Erlenmeyer flasks, a natural seawater medium, the Provasoli 1/3 medium, was compared to the classical Jones medium for DHA production. The Provasoli 1/3 medium stimulated growth (0.44 d(-1)), but influenced DHA accumulation negatively (0.240 pg cell(-1)). However, DHA production per liter of culture medium were of the same order of magnitude with both media (0.961 mg l(-1)). In a 2-l bioreactor, DHA production per liter of culture medium did not increase significantly between 4 and 8 days of culture. With a view to optimize DHA productivity, cells should be harvested at the end of exponential phase i.e. after 4 days of culture. Two strategies were then attempted to produce DHA ethyl esters. First, lipids from I. galbana were submitted to lipase-catalyzed transesterification with ethanol. Secondly, fatty acids from I. galbana were submitted to lipase catalyzed esterification with ethanol. In both cases, lipase from Candida antarctica was shown to be the best candidate, among the five tested, with conversion yields of 20 and 60% after 24 h of transesterification and esterification respectively.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657346>Yarrowia lipolytica lipase Lip2: an efficient enzyme for the production of concentrates of .</a></h2><p>The production of Omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) rich in cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was studied using lipase-catalysed hydrolysis of a mixture of ethyl esters from tuna oil.

C. rugosa lipases discriminated esters on the basis of their chain length, with less affinity for γ-linolenate, 11-eicosenoate, arachidonate, EPA, DPA and DHA ethyl esters. However, YLL2 and TLL improved discrimination towards DHA, as enzyme selectivity was shown to be mainly based on the position of the double bond closest to the carboxylic group. From the point of view of kinetics, purity and yield, YLL2 was the most effective lipase for DHA purification.

Prescription omega-3 fatty  formulations containing the  esters of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus   (DHA) (omega-3-  esters; Lovaza®) or high-purity EPA   (icosapent ; Vascepa®) are TG-lowering treatments that may be administered in addition to statins. Here we describe the effects of switching from omega-3-  esters to icosapent  in a 44-year-old obese man with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient was receiving stable treatment with medications, including atorvastatin 40 mg/day and extended-release niacin 1000 mg/day. Owing to persistently elevated TG levels and other cardiovascular risk factors, the patient was initiated on omega-3-  esters 4 g/day. After approximately 2 years on omega-3-  esters, his total cholesterol (TC) level was 184 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 81 mg/dL, TG level was elevated at 307 mg/dL despite statin therapy, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) level was 144 mg/dL. After the switch to icosapent , TC level decreased by 34% to 121 mg/dL, LDL-C level decreased by 28% to 58 mg/dL, TG level decreased by 41% to 180 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C level decreased by 44% to 81 mg/dL. Switching from omega-3-  esters containing both EPA and DHA to icosapent  containing high-purity EPA resulted in beneficial and substantial changes in the lipid profile with a notable reduction of TG levels along with additional reductions in LDL-C levels in a statin-treated obese patient with persistently high TG levels.

Appearance of 14C-labelled plasma polar and neutral lipids over 4 h and retention of 14C-activity (R) in the tissues at 4 h were measured.Compared to OM3EE, OM3CA resulted in 2- and 3-fold higher areas under the plasma 14C-labelled polar and neutral lipid curves (exposures), respectively, as well as, higher R in all tissues examined. For both OM3CA and OM3EE, R varied in a tissue specific manner; highest in liver, followed by red skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, brain and white skeletal muscle. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that R in each tissue (except liver) was dependent on polar lipid exposure alone (r2>0.87 and P<0.001), but not neutral lipid exposure, and furthermore this dependence was indistinguishable for OM3CA and OM3EE. In the liver, R was found to be dependent on both polar and neutral lipid exposures (r2 = 0.97, P<0.001), with relative contributions of 85±2% and 15±2%, respectively. As for the other tissues, these dependencies were indistinguishable for OM3CA and OM3EE.The present results, in fasted low-fat diet fed rats, are consistent with higher oral bioavailability of OM3CA versus OM3EE forms of DHA. Once DHA has entered the circulation, the tissue distribution is independent of the dosed form and uptake in the skeletal muscle, fat and brain is driven by the polar pools of DHA in plasma, while DHA accretion in liver is supplied by both polar and neutral plasma lipids.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9674774>MRI evidence that  improves myelination in generalized peroxisomal disorders.</a></h2><p>We have found that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), an important constituent of the CNS and retina, is dramatically decreased in patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders. Such a DHA deficiency could be pathogenic. Our aim was to test the possible beneficial effects of normalizing the DHA levels in these patients. The current report focuses on MRI changes during the treatment and reports follow-up evidence of myelin improvement in five peroxisomal disorder patients treated with DHA.DHA ethyl ester (DHA-EE), about 90% pure, was used at daily oral doses of 100 to 600 mg. The treatment was monitored both clinically and biochemically, with periodic neurophysiologic and MRI examinations and repeated controls of  tests and blood  acids by capillary column gas chromatography.DHA-EE normalized the blood levels of DHA in a few weeks. The levels of very-long-chain  acids decreased in plasma and those of plasmalogens increased in erythrocytes. Visual and  function improved. On MRI, a virtual normalization of the brain myelin images was found in the three youngest patients. A clear improvement was noticed in the other two.The beneficial effects obtained indicate that DHA deficiency plays an important role in the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disease, probably in relation to myelinogenesis. Early initiation of DHA therapy is thus strongly recommended in patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11478386>Restoring the DHA levels in the brains of Zellweger patients.</a></h2><p>Patients with the Zellweger syndrome and its variants have very low levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the brain, retina, and other tissues. Such a marked DHA deficiency could be related to the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disorders. Therefore, restoring the DHA levels in these patients can probably improve the clinical course of the disease. With this rationale, 20 patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders have been treated to date with DHA ethyl ester, at daily doses of 100-500 mg, for variable periods of time. Treatment has been always accompanied by a nutritious diet, normal for the age, in order to provide all the necessary nutrients and avoid a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) imbalance. The most constant improvement has been normalization of the DHA levels and liver function. Vision has improved in about half the patients and muscle tone has generally increased. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed improvement of myelination in 9 patients. Significantly, the clinical improvement has been most marked in those patients who started the treatment before 6 mo of age. Biochemically, the plasma very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) 26:0 and 26:1n-9 decreased markedly despite the complete diet provided. In erythrocytes, the plasmalogen ratio 18: ODMA/18:0 increased in most cases, and sometimes even normalized. All these beneficial effects suggest that DHA deficiency plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disease. Because DHA accretion is maximal during early brain development, it is essential to initiate the treatment as soon as possible. Otherwise, restoration of brain DHA levels and prevention of further damage will not be possible.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8914943>The formation of diradylglycerol molecular species in murine peritoneal macrophages varies dose-dependently with dietary purified eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic ethyl esters.</a></h2><p>Substantial effects of dietary fish oil-derived fatty acid ethyl esters on the  of diradylglycerol (DG) have recently been described.

Peritoneal macrophages were analyzed for DG content and for molecular species distributions of DG and phospholipid classes. We found that the degree of incorporation of EPA and DHA into DG in macrophages was dependent on the dietary concentration of EPEE and DHEE, under basal conditions and after stimulation with platelet-activating factor, phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. Incorporation of EPA and DHA into phospholipids was also significant and dose dependent in each phospholipid class. For both DG and phospholipid molecular species, the incorporation of EPA in the sn-2 position was considerably greater than that of species with DHA under conditions of equimolar dietary content. These results demonstrate that 1) incorporation of EPA and DHA into DG are independent and dependent on dietary content, 2) EPA is incorporated with greater affinity than DHA and 3) these effects on DG  seem to result from corresponding effects on parent membrane phospholipids.

C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet (HFD; 45% energy from fat). After 7 wk, the diet was supplemented with either 1% (wt:wt) WE or 0.2% (wt:wt) E/D. The amount of EPA + DHA in the E/D diet was matched to the total amount of n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the WE diet. A third group was given an unsupplemented HFD throughout the entire 27-wk feeding period. WE reduced body weight gain, abdominal fat, and liver triacylglycerol by 21%, 34%, and 52%, respectively, and significantly improved glucose tolerance and aerobic capacity. In abdominal fat depots, WE reduced macrophage infiltration by 74% and downregulated expression of proinflammatory genes (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), whereas adiponectin expression was significantly upregulated. By comparison, E/D primarily suppressed the expression of proinflammatory genes but had less influence on glucose tolerance than WE. E/D affected  parameters, aerobic capacity, or adiponectin expression by <10%. These results show that the wax  component of Calanus oil can account for the biologic effects shown previously for the crude oil.

Accordingly, patients at risk are often advised to take both aspirin and n-3 FA. However, both of these agents can increase bleeding times, and the extent to which the combination inhibits platelet function is unknown. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effects of a prescription omega-3 FA product (P-OM3) and aspirin, alone and in combination, on platelet aggregation assessed by whole blood impedance aggregometry (WBA). Ten healthy volunteers provided blood samples on four separate occasions: Day 1, baseline; Day 2, one day after taking aspirin (2 x 325 mg tablets); Day 29, after 28 days of P-OM3 (4 capsules/day); and Day 30, after one day of combined P-OM3 and aspirin. WBA was tested with two concentrations of collagen, with ADP and with a thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP). Compared to baseline, aspirin alone inhibited aggregation only with low-dose collagen stimulation; P-OM3 alone did not inhibit aggregation with any agonist; and combined therapy inhibited aggregation with all agonists but TRAP. Significant interactions between interventions were not observed in response to any agonist. In conclusion, P-OM3 alone did not inhibit platelet aggregation, but did (with two agonists) when combined with aspirin.

In addition, only treatment with DHA-H prevented the abnormal climbing behavior and enhanced the lifespan of these transgenic flies. These benefits of DHA-H were confirmed in the well characterized transgenic PS1/APP mouse model of familial AD (5xFAD mice), mice that develop defects in spatial learning and in memory, as well as behavioral deficits. Hence, it appears that the modulation of brain lipid composition by DHA-H could have remedial effects on AD associated neurodegeneration.

Male Crlj:CD-1 (ICR) mice were fed experimental diets containing 6% lard (LD), 6% fish oil (FO) or 4.1% lard plus 1.5%  and 0.4% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (DE) for 12 weeks. There were no marked differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentration changes on glucose tolerance test between the three dietary groups. At the end of the feeding trial, plasma glucose concentration was significantly lower in fasted mice in the FO group than in those in the LD group (P<.005). Plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in the FO group than in the LD group (P<.05). Hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities in skeletal muscle tended to be lower in the FO group than in the LD group, while there were no differences in glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities in liver between the three dietary groups. However, hepatic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was 53-fold and 4.2-fold higher in the FO group than in the LD and DE groups, respectively (P<.0005 and P<.05, respectively). These results suggest that the reduction in plasma glucose concentration in mice fed n-3 PUFAs is mainly caused by acceleration of glucose uptake and glycerol synthesis in the liver rather than in the skeletal muscle.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210121>Dietary effects of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid esters on lipid  and immune parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were fed eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ethyl esters at the 2% level for 3 weeks to clarify their effects on immune functions.

Increased dietary consumption of n-3, and possibly some n-6, LCPUFAs may limit postmenopausal bone loss. The aim of this study was to determine the effects on bone of specific fatty acids within the n-3 and n-6 LCPUFA families in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Rats were OVX or sham-operated and fed either a control diet (OVX and sham) or a diet supplemented with 0.5 g/kg body weight/day of gamma-linolenic (GLA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA) ethyl esters or a mixture of all three (MIX) for 16 weeks. Bone mineral content (BMC), area, and density and plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I, vitamin D, selected biochemical markers of bone , and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were determined. The OVX-induced decrease in lumbar spine BMC was significantly attenuated by DHA but not by EPA or GLA supplementation or supplementation with a mixture of all three LCPUFAs. Endosteal circumferences of tibiae were significantly greater in DHA and EPA compared to OVX. Plasma C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin concentrations were not significantly different in the DHA group compared to OVX. Femur BMC decreased by a significantly greater amount in GLA than OVX, and final plasma PTH concentrations were significantly higher in GLA compared to all other groups. In conclusion, DHA ameliorated OVX-induced bone mineral loss. GLA exacerbated post-OVX bone mineral loss, possibly as a result of PTH-induced bone catabolism.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8869009> and its ultraviolet degradation products showed DNA-breaking activity in vitro and cytotoxic effects on the HSC-4 cell line.</a></h2><p>The DNA-breaking activity and cytotoxicity of  (DHAE) and its degradation products (dDHAE) induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, were demonstrated in this study. The major component of dDHAE was identified as 4-hydroxyvaleric acid ethyl ester. DHAE and dHAE solutions at a concentration of 100 mg/ml induced single-strand breaks of plasmid DNA after an incubation at 37 degrees C and pH 7.6 for 15 hours. DHAE transformed a plasmid supercoiled DNA (Form I) into an open circular relaxed form (Form II), and dDHAE completely destroyed DNA molecules. HSC-4 cells, which were derived from human prickle cell carcinoma, were cultured with various concentrations (10, 30 and 50 micrograms/ml) of DHAE and dDHAE. Both inhibited the proliferation of HSC-4 cells. The potency of their cytotoxicity was dependent on their concentration. It is noteworthy that the lethal effects of DHAE and dDHAE on HSC-4 cells were quite similar, although the DNA-breaking activity of dDHAE was much greater than that of DHAE.

Separating chemicals with molecular  between 100 and 300 g mol(-1) remains a significant challenge in the field of organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) due to their similar sizes and rotational flexibility. In this work, we report the fabrication of poly(epoxy) membranes that show excellent selectivity of over 100:1 for chemicals in this range. The membranes are easily tuned to obtain different flux and selectivity by using interchangeable amine and epoxide monomers. These membranes were used to separate the important nutritional omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters eicosapentaenoic ethyl ester (EPA-EE) and  (DHA-EE) from each other, despite a small difference in molecular  (26 g mol(-1)).

Autoimmune mice, the (NZB x NZW)F1 strain, were fed with experimental diets for 14 weeks, after which spleen phospholipids were extracted and separated into classes by HPLC, and the alkenylacyl, alkylacyl, and diacyl subclasses of glycerylphosphatidylethanolamine and glycerylphosphatidylcholine were resolved as their benzoyl esters by HPLC. Fatty acids were analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography of their methyl esters. Each of the marine lipid diets suppressed n-6 fatty acids and elevated n-3 fatty acids in all phospholipids. The eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester diets led to high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-3), but little or no increase in docosahexaenoic acid. The  diets elevated docosahexaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid in all phospholipids, indicating that extensive retroconversion of 22 carbon n-3 fatty acids had occurred.

Oxidation progress was followed by determination of conjugated dienes and FTIR measurements. Analyses showed that DHA-EE was rapidly oxidised under all storage conditions in comparison with DHA-VE and crude reaction medium, whatever the temperature and the storage time. The grafting of vanillyl alcohol appeared as a powerful way to stabilize DHA against oxidation.

The oral co-administration of DHA-EE and CsA increased the blood CsA concentration in a dose-dependent manner, and the AUC and C(max) both increased by about 2-fold with 100mg/kg DHA-EE. The microemulsion formulation of CsA consisted of Tween-20, ethanol, water, and DHA-EE (53.3/6.5/35.9/3.3 w/w%) (namely DHA-ME) was transparent and stable with an average particle size of 50 nm, which was similar to that of the control formulation incorporating vitamin E instead of DHA-EE (namely VE-ME). The permeabilities of CsA from DHA-ME, VE-ME and Neoral formulations across an artificial membrane were not significantly different. The C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) of CsA in rats administered DHA-ME significantly increased by approximately 2-fold in comparison to that of VE-ME.

As a marker of oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in DNA was analyzed. Young (5-week-old) and aged (100-week-old) female Wistar rats were given DHA (300mg/kg body weight/day) or vehicle (control) orally for 12 weeks. The 8-OHdG in the bone marrow in the aged DHA group was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Vitamin E concentrations, however, did not differ among the groups regardless of the DHA supplementation. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentrations in the aged control group were approximately 1/2 those in the young control group. The concentrations of vitamin C tended to be higher in the young DHA group and lower in the aged DHA group when compared to their respective control groups. Changes in the concentrations of vitamin C and vitamin E in plasma were similar to those in the bone marrow. The activity of hepatic l-gulono- gamma -lactone oxidase, an enzyme responsible for vitamin C synthesis, corresponded well to the concentrations of vitamin C in the bone marrow and the plasma. These results suggest that in aged rats, but not young rats, excess supplementation of DHA induces oxidative DNA damage in bone marrow and that the decrease in vitamin C synthesis in aged rats is involved in the mechanisms of DNA damage.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8409774>Suppression of autoimmune disease by dietary n-3 fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that dietary fish oil preparations have anti-inflammatory effects in humans and in experimental animals, but the individual components of fish oils that are responsible for their anti-inflammatory effects have not been documented. We therefore investigated in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, a model for human systemic lupus erythematosus, the effects of diets containing ethyl esters of two purified n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-E) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-E), a refined fish oil triglyceride (FO) which contained 55% n-3 fatty acids, and beef tallow (BT) which contains no n-3 fatty acids. The diets were initiated prior to the development of overt renal disease at age 22 weeks, and continued for 14 weeks. The extent of the renal disease was quantified by light microscopy and by proteinuria. Diets containing either 10 wt% FO, 10% EPA-E, or 6% or 10% DHA-E alleviated the severity of the renal disease, compared to the BT diet, whereas diets containing either 3% or 6% EPA-E or 3% DHA-E were less effective. Two diets containing approximately 3:1 mixtures of EPA-E and DHA-E alleviated the renal disease to a greater extent than expected for either of these fatty acids given singly. We believe that these experiments provide the first demonstration of anti-inflammatory effects of individual dietary n-3 fatty acids.

In addition, we aimed to obtain preliminary information regarding EPA half-life, which is needed to establish an optimal dosing schedule. Five healthy volunteers ingested two 8.5 g doses of n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters daily for 7 d, supplying 6.0 g EPA/d and 5.3 g DHA/d. The fatty acid compositions of plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesteryl esters (CE) and triacylglycerols (TAG) were determined during supplementation and during a washout period of 7 d. Half-lives of EPA and DHA were calculated. The proportion of EPA in PL showed a 15-fold increase after 7 d (P < 0.001), while DHA showed a smaller increase (P < 0.01). In CE, EPA also increased (P < 0.05), while DHA did not increase at all. Remarkably, incorporation of DHA into TAG was even higher than that of EPA. Half-life of EPA in PL ranged from 1.63 to 2.31 d (mean 1.97 (SE 0.15) d), whereas mean half-life of EPA in CE was 3.27 (SE 0.56) d. In three subjects, washout of EPA and DHA from TAG seemed to follow a bi-exponential pattern, with a short half-life (< 1 d) in the initial phase and a half-life of several days in the second phase. In conclusion, EPA ethyl esters are rapidly incorporated into plasma lipids, especially into PL.

DHA-MG supplementation increased plasma and erythrocyte DHA by 24 and 23.8%, respectively, but reduced AA by 5.5 and 3%, respectively.We conclude that in the rat, DHA-MG supplementation allows a higher plasma and erythrocyte DHA content than DHA-EE with minor modification of AA content.Copyright 2005 S.

Currently, ω-3 fatty acids are commercially available in many parts of the world containing the same active ingredients as Lotriga(®) (ω-3-acid ethyl esters 90 [O3AE highly concentrated ω-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, consisting of eicosapentaenoic acid-ethyl ester and  [EPA-E/DHA-E]). A recent head-to-head comparative study of O3AEE90 versus EPA-E demonstrated that O3AEE90 4g/day led to a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides (TG) than EPA-E 1.8g/day and that O3AEE90 2g/day produced comparable effects on TG to those with EPA-E 1.8g/day. While both agents were shown to be useful in lowering TG, the hallmark feature of O3AEE90, that is, the presence of the DHA-E component versus its absence in EPA-E, needs to be further examined for its clinical implications.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2139859>Effects of dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated ethyl ester lipids (Angiosan) in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.</a></h2><p>A total of 80 patients with chronic, stable psoriasis, 34 of whom also had psoriatic arthritis, were treated with 1122 mg/day eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester and 756 mg/day . Before the study and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment a Psoriatic Association scoring index (PASI) score was assessed. Before treatment the mean PASI score was 3.56, after 4 weeks 1.98 and after 8 weeks 1.24; the decrease in the score was highly significant (P less than 0.001). The degree of pruritus decreased most rapidly, followed by scaling and induration of the plaques, and erythema was most persistent. At the end of the trial, seven patients were completely healed and in 13 other patients more than 75% healing was observed but in 14 patients the result was poor. The majority of patients with psoriatic arthritis reported a subjective improvement in joint pain during the study. It is concluded that polyunsaturated ethyl ester lipids may be useful for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and may provide an important adjuvant to standard therapy of both conditions.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676394>Short term effects of different omega-3 fatty acid formulation on lipid  in mice fed high or low fat diet.</a></h2><p>Bioactivities of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) depend on their chemical forms. The present study was to investigate short term effects of triglyceride (TG), ethyl ester (EE), free fatty acid (FFA) and phospholipid (PL) forms of omega-3 fatty acid (FA) on lipid  in mice, fed high fat or low fat diet.Male Balb/c mice were fed with 0.7% different Omega-3 fatty acid formulation: DHA bound free fatty acid (DHA-FFA), DHA bound triglyceride (DHA-TG), DHA bound ethyl ester (DHA-EE) and DHA bound phospholipid (DHA-PL) for 1 week, with dietary fat levels at 5% and 22.5%. Serum and hepatic lipid concentrations were analyzed, as well as the fatty acid composition of liver and brain.At low fat level, serum total cholesterol (TC) level in mice fed diets with DHA-FFA, DHA-EE and DHA-PL were significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Hepatic TG level decreased significantly in mice fed diets with DHA-TG (P < 0.05), DHA-EE (P < 0.05) and DHA-PL (P < 0.05), while TC level in liver was significantly lower in mice fed diets with TG and EE compared with the control group (P < 0.05). At high fat level, mice fed diets with DHA-EE and DHA-PL had significantly lower hepatic TC level compared with the control diet (P < 0.05). Hepatic PL concentration experienced a significant increase in mice fed the diet with PL at high fat level (P < 0.05). Furthermore, both at low and high fat levels, hepatic DHA level significantly increased and AA level significantly decreased in all forms of DHA groups (P < 0.05), compared to control groups at two different fat levels, respectively. Additionally, cerebral DHA level in mice fed diets with DHA-FFA, DHA-EE and DHA-PL significantly increased compared with the control at high fat level (P < 0.05), but no significant differences were observed among dietary treatments for mice fed diets with low fat level.The present study suggested that not only total dietary fat content but also the molecular forms of omega-3 fatty acids contributed to lipid  in mice. DHA-PL showed effective bioactivity in decreasing hepatic and serum TC, TG levels and increasing omega-3 concentration in liver and brain.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19933185>Visual follow-up in peroxisomal-disorder patients treated with .</a></h2><p>To assess the possible beneficial effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ethyl ester on visual function in DHA-deficient patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs).A total of 23 patients were studied, of whom 2 had classic Zellweger syndrome and 1 had a D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency. Most of the PBD patients could be followed up, but for only nine of them was there ophthalmic baseline data to enable a full evaluation of the visual effects of the treatment. A daily dose of 200 mg of DHA ethyl ester was given to all patients. Clinical examination, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and electroretinogram (ERG) were obtained in all cases.Nystagmus disappeared very quickly in all the patients. The retinal appearance remained stable in all but one. Visual acuity was maintained without deterioration in all the patients. The electrophysiological examination showed a general improvement in retinoneural function, better documented in those patients who had undergone a baseline examination, but also in two children whose ERG continued to improve many years after the treatment was initiated.The visual improvement obtained with DHA therapy emphasizes the deleterious role that a DHA deficiency plays on the retina, especially in PBD patients, with retinas virtually devoid of DHA. These data, together with those reported previously, indicate that the DHA deficiency is an important pathogenic factor in peroxisomal disorders and should always be corrected. Treatment with DHA ethyl ester, given as early as possible, is strongly recommended, before the damage becomes irreversible.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1825741>Changes in fatty acid composition in rat blood and organs after infusion of .</a></h2><p>An infusible emulsion of  (DHA-EE) was prepared.

They were killed 1, 6, and 24 h and 3 and 7 d after the infusion, and fatty acid composition of various organs and plasma was analyzed along with that of control rats.

DHA did not increase at all in cardiac phospholipid fraction. However, DHA concentrations increased markedly (from 0.7% to 11%) in the free fatty acid fraction of heart 1 h after the infusion.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a key component of the cell membrane, and its peroxidation is inducible due to the double-bond chemical structure. However, DHA has neuroprotective effects. In this study, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection (ipi) of DHA ethyl ester (DHA-Et) on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced dopamine (DA) reduction in the mouse striatum. DHA-Et ipi for 7 days before and 7 days after a single intracerebroventricular injection of 6-OHDA enhanced 6-OHDA-induced reduction of striatal DA level. On the other hand, ipi of DHA-Et for 7 days increased its concentration in the striatum. Co-injection of DHA-Et and 6-OHDA increased the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (a marker of lipid peroxidation) in the striatum. Our results suggest that DHA-Et enhances 6-OHDA-induced DA depression by increasing lipid peroxidation, and that excessive use of DHA-Et may increase the susceptibility of Parkinson disease in animal model.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10618001>Therapeutic effects of  in patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders.</a></h2><p>Generalized peroxisomal disorders are severe congenital diseases that involve the central nervous system, leading to severe psychomotor retardation, retinopathy, liver disease, and early death. In these disorders, peroxisomes are not normally formed and their enzymes are deficient. Characteristically, plasmalogen synthesis and beta-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are affected. We found that patients with generalized peroxisomal disorders have a profound brain deficiency of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and low DHA concentrations in all tissues and the blood. Given the fundamental role of DHA in neuronal and retinal membranes, a DHA deficiency of this magnitude might be pathogenic. Thus, we studied the possible therapeutic effect of normalizing DHA concentrations in patients with peroxisomal disorders. We chose the DHA ethyl ester (DHA-EE) because of its high degree of purity at daily oral doses of 100-500 mg. This article summarizes the results of treatment of 13 patients with DHA-EE, with some follow-up evidence of clinical improvement. Supplementation with DHA-EE normalized blood DHA values within a few weeks. Plasmalogen concentrations increased in erythrocytes in most patients and after DHA concentrations were normalized, amounts of VLCFAs decreased in plasma. Liver enzymes returned almost to normal in most cases. From a clinical viewpoint, most patients showed improvement in vision, liver function, muscle tone, and social contact. In 3 patients, normalization of brain myelin was detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In 3 others, myelination improved. In a seventh patient, myelination is progressing at a normal rate. These results suggest a fundamental role of DHA in the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome. DHA therapy is thus strongly recommended, not only to alleviate symptoms in patients with life-threatening diseases, but also to clarify remaining questions regarding the role of DHA in health and disease.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8996873>An experimental study on transcutaneous absorption of ethylesters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) in pigs.</a></h2><p>Twenty-two pigs with an average weight of 24.2 kg were divided into two groups. Five grams of an ointment containing 40% of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) as ethylesters, was administered cutaneously to the experimental group and orally to the control group twice daily over a 3 day period. Surgical biopsies of subcutaneous fat of all 22 pigs were taken before and after the ethylester administration period. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein.

No increase of EPA and DHA in subcutaneous fat was found in either group. In the oral group the content of EPA had increased in the total plasma lipids on the first day after the end of the experiment.

GLA and DHA were incorporated in the phospholipids to the same extent, but GLA disappeared more rapidly than DHA in both cell lines. GLAe induced about twice as much intracellular TBARS as DHAe in both cell lines, but killed ZR-75-1 cells four times more effectively than DHAe. DHAe induced 11-15 fmoles malondialdehyde-equivalents (MDA-eq)/cell in both ZR-75-1 and CV-1 cells, whereas GLAe induced 5-6 times more TBARS in ZR-75-1 cells (26-30 fmoles MDA-eq/cell) than in CV-1 cells (5-6 fmoles MDA-eq/cell). The results show that there is no difference in GLA and DHA incorporation into phospholipids, but that their  differs in the two cell types. The data also suggest that the cytocidal potential is related to TBARS levels in a nonlinear fashion. The relationship between excess prostaglandin production and excessive cell death due to GLA is discussed.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10419167>Ethyl docosahexaenoic acid administration during intrauterine life enhances prostanoid production and reduces free radicals generation in the fetal rat brain.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12036046>Autoxidation kinetic analysis of  and docosahexaenoic triglyceride with oxygen sensor.</a></h2><p>The application of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as food additives is restricted by their chemically quite reactive properties.

Therefore, 4 wk after myocardial infarction, dogs were randomly assigned to either placebo (corn oil, 1 g/day, n = 16) or n-3 PUFAs supplement [docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) + eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl esters; 1, 2, or 4 g/day; n = 7, 8, and 12, respectively] groups. In vivo, ventricular function was evaluated by echocardiography before and after 3 mo of treatment. At the end of the 3-mo period, hearts were removed and in vitro function was evaluated using right ventricular trabeculae and isolated left ventricular myocytes. The treatment elicited significant (P < 0.0001) dose-dependent increases (16.4-fold increase with 4 g/day) in left ventricular tissue and red blood cell n-3 PUFA levels (EPA + DHA, placebo, 0.42 +/- 0.04; 1 g/day, 3.02 +/- 0.23; 2 g/day, 3.63 +/- 0.17; and 4 g/day, 6.97 +/- 0.33%). Regardless of the dose, n-3 PUFA treatment did not alter ventricular function in the intact animal (e.g., 4 g/day, fractional shortening: pre, 42.9 +/- 1.6 vs. post, 40.1 +/- 1.7%; placebo: pre, 39.2 +/- 1.3 vs. post, 38.4 +/- 1.6%). The developed force per cross-sectional area, changes in length- and frequency-dependent behavior in contractile force, and the inotropic response to beta-adrenoceptor activation were also similar for trabeculae obtained from placebo- or n-3 PUFA-treated dogs. Finally, calcium currents and calcium transients were the same in myocytes from n-3 PUFA- and placebo-treated dogs.

We aimed to determine whether these lipid mediators are present in bone marrow and whether their lipidomic profiles are altered following ovariectomy or dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ethyl esters. Female rats were ovariectomised or sham-operated. Shams and one ovariectomised group received a diet devoid of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The remaining ovariectomised rats received either 0.5 g EPA or DHA ethyl ester/kg body weight/day for 4 months. Bone marrow was analyzed using both GC to determine fatty acid composition and mediator lipidomics by LC/MS/MS profiling for the presence of LOX-pathway lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid (AA), EPA, and DHA. LOX-derived products including lipoxins, resolvin D1, resolvin E1, and protectin D1 were identified in bone marrow by the presence of diagnostic ions in their corresponding MS-MS spectra. The proportion of AA relative to DHA and of AA-derived relative to DHA-derived mediators in bone marrow was higher in ovariectomised compared to sham-operated rats. DHA or EPA ethyl ester supplementation increased the percentage of DHA and EPA in bone marrow and increased the proportion of LOX mediators biosynthesized from DHA or EPA, respectively. Given the potent bioactivities of the lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins, the presence and changes in profile postovariectomy and with EPA and DHA ethyl ester supplementation may be of interest in bone marrow function and as a potential source of these mediators in vivo.Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9566775>Docosahexaenoic acid exhibits a potent protection of small intestine from methotrexate-induced damage in mice.</a></h2><p>Oral administration of methotrexate (MTX) to mice causes the damage of small intestine.
