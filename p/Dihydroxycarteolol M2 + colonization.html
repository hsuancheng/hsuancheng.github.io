Engineered FlaB-secreting bacteria effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models and prolonged survival. By using Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-negative colon cancer cell lines, we provided evidence that the FlaB-mediated tumor suppression upon bacterial  is associated with TLR5-mediated host reactions in the tumor microenvironment. These therapeutic effects were completely abrogated in TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice, and partly in TLR5 knockout mice, indicating that TLR4 signaling is a requisite for tumor suppression mediated by FlaB-secreting bacteria, whereas TLR5 signaling augmented tumor-suppressive host reactions. Tumor microenvironment  by engineered  appeared to induce the infiltration of abundant immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils via TLR4 signaling. Subsequent secretion of FlaB from colonizing  resulted in phenotypic and functional activation of intratumoral macrophages with M1 phenotypes and a reciprocal reduction in -like suppressive activities. Together, these findings provide evidence that nonvirulent tumor-targeting bacteria releasing multiple TLR ligands can be used as cancer immunotherapeutics.Copyright © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419180>Impact of gestational nicotine exposure on intrauterine and fetal infection in a rodent model.</a></h2><p>We investigated the interaction between prenatal nicotine exposure and intrauterine infection using established rat models. Beginning at gestation day (GD) 6, dams were continuously infused with either saline or 6 mg/kg/day nicotine (Nic). At GD 14, dams received either sterile broth or 105 colony-forming units Mycoplasma pulmonis (MP), resulting in four treatment groups: control (4 dams, 33 fetal units); MP only (5 dams, 55 fetal units); Nic only (5 dams, 61 fetal units), and Nic + MP (7 dams, 82 fetal units). At GD 18, nicotine exposure significantly increased (P ≤ 0.02) the percentage of amniotic fluids and fetuses infected by MP but did not impact  rates of maternal sites. Nicotine exposure significantly reduced the numbers of MP in the placenta required for high microbial loads (≥104 color-changing units) in the amniotic fluid (P < 0.01). Fetal inflammatory response lesions were most extensive in the Nic only and Nic + MP groups (P < 0.0001). Control and MP only placentas were interleukin (IL)10-dominant, consistent with an /Th2 environment. Placentas exposed to nicotine shifted to a neutral environment, with equivalent levels of interferon gamma (IFNG) and IL10. Both IL6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in amniotic fluid were highly elevated when both nicotine and infection were present. Our study suggests that prenatal exposure to nicotine increases the risk for intrauterine infection, lowers the infectious dose required to breach the placental barrier and infect the amniotic fluid and fetus, and alters the pathology and inflammatory profile associated with maternal and fetal sites.© The Authors 2017.

Chronic human infection and asymptomatic  have been reported. However, renal involvement in those with leptospira chronic exposure remains undetermined.In 2007, a multistage sampling survey for chronic kidney disease (CKD) was conducted in a southern county of Taiwan, an area with a high prevalence of dialysis. Additionally, an independent cohort of 88 participants from a leptospira-endemic town was followed for two years after a flooding in 2009. Risks of CKD, stages of CKD, associated risk factors as well as kidney injury markers were compared among adults with anti-leptospira antibody as defined by titers of microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Of 3045 survey participants, the individuals with previous leptospira exposure disclosed a lower level of eGFR (98.3 ± 0.4 vs 100.8 ± 0.6 ml/min per 1.73 , P < 0.001) and a higher percentage of CKD, particularly at stage 3a-5 (14.4% vs 8.5%), than those without leptospira exposure. Multivariable linear regression analyses indicated the association of leptospiral infection and lower eGFR (95% CI -4.15 to -1.93, P < 0.001). In a leptospiral endemic town, subjects with a MAT titer ≥ 400 showed a decreased eGFR and higher urinary kidney injury molecule-1 creatinine ratio (KIM1/Cr) level as compared with those having lower titers of MAT (P < 0.05). Furthermore, two participants with persistently high MAT titers had positive urine leptospira DNA and deteriorating renal function.Our data are the first to show that chronic human exposure of leptospirosis is associated significantly with prevalence and severity of CKD and may lead to deterioration of renal function. This study also shed light on the search of underlying factors in areas experiencing CKD of unknown aetiology (CKDu) such as Mesoamerican Nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26573796>Obesity Contributes to Ovarian Cancer Metastatic Success through Increased Lipogenesis, Enhanced Vascularity, and Decreased Infiltration of M1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy, with high mortality attributable to widespread intraperitoneal metastases. Recent meta-analyses report an association between obesity, ovarian cancer incidence, and ovarian cancer survival, but the effect of obesity on metastasis has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to use an integrative approach combining in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies to test the hypothesis that obesity contributes to ovarian cancer metastatic success. Initial in vitro studies using three-dimensional mesomimetic cultures showed enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the lipid-loaded mesothelium. Furthermore, in an ex vivo  assay, ovarian cancer cells exhibited increased adhesion to mesothelial explants excised from mice modeling diet-induced obesity (DIO), in which they were fed a "Western" diet. Examination of mesothelial ultrastructure revealed a substantial increase in the density of microvilli in DIO mice. Moreover, enhanced intraperitoneal tumor burden was observed in overweight or obese animals in three distinct in vivo models. Further histologic analyses suggested that alterations in lipid regulatory factors, enhanced vascularity, and decreased M1/ macrophage ratios may account for the enhanced tumorigenicity. Together, these findings show that obesity potently affects ovarian cancer metastatic success, which likely contributes to the negative correlation between obesity and ovarian cancer survival.©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25710915>Myeloid HIF-1 is protective in Helicobacter pylori-mediated gastritis.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori infection triggers chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa that may progress to gastric cancer. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the central mediators of cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels (hypoxia), but they have emerged recently as major transcriptional regulators of immunity and inflammation. No studies have investigated whether H. pylori affects HIF signaling in immune cells and a potential role for HIF in H. pylori-mediated gastritis. HIF-1 and HIF-2 expression was examined in human H. pylori-positive gastritis biopsies. Subsequent experiments were performed in naive and polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type (WT) and myeloid HIF-1α-null mice (HIF-1(Δmyel)). WT and HIF-1(Δmyel) mice were inoculated with H. pylori by oral gavage and sacrificed 6 mo postinfection. HIF-1 was specifically expressed in macrophages of human H. pylori-positive gastritis biopsies. Macrophage HIF-1 strongly contributed to the induction of proinflammatory genes (IL-6, IL-1β) and inducible NO synthase in response to H. pylori. HIF-2 expression and markers of  macrophage differentiation were decreased in response to H. pylori. HIF-1(Δmyel) mice inoculated with H. pylori for 6 mo presented with a similar bacterial  than WT mice but, surprisingly, a global increase of inflammation, leading to a worsening of the gastritis, measured by an increased epithelial cell proliferation. In conclusion, myeloid HIF-1 is protective in H. pylori-mediated gastritis, pointing to the complex counterbalancing roles of innate immune and inflammatory phenotypes in driving this pathology.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141492>Effect of maternal obesity on pregnancy outcomes in women delivering singleton babies: a historical cohort study.</a></h2><p>Background Obesity in pregnancy is increasing worldwide, reaching epidemic proportions in many countries and frequently creating challenges for obstetricians. We conducted this study to assess the effects of maternal obesity on maternal and perinatal outcomes. Methods A historical cohort study was performed on 16,609 women who delivered singleton babies in a 5-year period (2013-2017). Data were retrieved from the Cruces Perinatal Database (CPD) and only women whose prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was known were included. Women were categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification: normal weight (BMI 20-24.9 kg/) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/). Obstetric, perinatal and neonatal outcomes were compared, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the normal-weight group as the reference. Results Compared to women of normal weight (n = 9778), obese women (n = 2207) had a higher risk of preeclampsia (aOR 2.199, 95% CI: 1.46-3.29), rectovaginal group B streptococcus  (aOR 1.299, 95% CI: 1.14-1.47), induction of labor (aOR 1.593, 95% CI: 1.44-1.75), cesarean section (aOR 2.755, 95% CI: 2.46-3.08), cesarean section in women with a history of cesarean delivery (aOR 1.409, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92), fetal weight ≥4000 g (aOR 2.090, 95% CI: 1.803-2.422) and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (aOR 1.341, 95% CI: 1.12-1.59). No association was found with preterm birth (aOR 0.936, 95% CI: 0.77-1.13), stillbirth (aOR 0.921, 95% CI: 0.41-2.02) or neonatal mortality (aOR 2.205, 95% CI: 0.86-5.62). Conclusion Maternal obesity is associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.

In addition, alterations in reelin expression levels have been reported in breast, pancreatic, liver, gastric, and other cancers. Reelin is normally expressed in mammary gland stromal cells, but whether stromal reelin contributes to breast cancer progression is unknown. Herein, we used a syngeneic mouse mammary tumor transplantation model to examine the impact of host-derived reelin on breast cancer progression. We found that transplanted syngeneic tumors grew more slowly in reelin-deficient (rl  ) mice and had delayed metastatic  of the lungs. Immunohistochemistry of primary tumors revealed that tumors grown in rl  animals had fewer blood vessels and increased macrophage infiltration. Gene expression studies from tumor tissues indicate that loss of host-derived reelin alters the balance of M1- and -associated macrophage markers, suggesting that reelin may influence the polarization of these cells. Consistent with this, rl  M1-polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages have heightened levels of the M1-associated cytokines iNOS and IL-6. Based on these observations, we propose a novel function for the reelin protein in breast cancer progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28471561>Effects of Helicobacter Pylori /Infection on the Metabolic Profile of Obese Persons Undergoing Sleeve Gastrectomy Surgery for Weight Reduction.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection of the gastric mucosa may be involved in the development of insulin resistance (IR).To investigate the association between HP status in stomach biopsies and weight reduction in patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).In this retrospective analysis of medical charts, all patients who underwent LSG for weight reduction and had at least 1 year of follow-up were included.

The widely accepted hypothesis is that the primary tumor microenvironment induces the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, facilitating their escape into the bloodstream, possibly accompanied by cancer stem cells. An alternative theory for metastasis involves fusion of macrophages with tumor cells (MTFs). Here we culture and characterize apparent MTFs from blood of melanoma patients.We isolated enriched CTC populations from peripheral blood samples from melanoma patients, and cultured them. We interrogated these cultured cells for characteristic BRAF mutations, and used confocal microscopy for immunophenotyping, motility, DNA content and chromatin texture analyses, and then conducted xenograft studies using nude mice.Morphologically, the cultured MTFs were generally large with many pseudopod extensions and lamellipodia. Ultrastructurally, the cultured MTFs appeared to be macrophages. They were rich in mitochondria and lysosomes, as well as apparent melanosomes. The cultured MTF populations were all heterogeneous with regard to DNA content, containing aneuploid and/or high-ploidy cells, and they typically showed large sheets (and/or clumps) of cytoplasmic chromatin. This cytoplasmic DNA was found within heterogeneously-sized autophagic vacuoles, which prominently contained chromatin and micronuclei. Cultured MTFs uniformly expressed pan-macrophage markers (CD14, CD68) and macrophage markers indicative of  polarization (CD163, CD204, CD206). They also expressed melanocyte-specific markers (ALCAM, MLANA), epithelial biomarkers (KRT, EpCAM), as well as the pro-carcinogenic cytokine MIF along with functionally related stem cell markers (CXCR4, CD44). MTF cultures from individual patients (5 of 8) contained melanoma-specific BRAF activating mutations. Chromatin texture analysis of deconvoluted images showed condensed DNA (DAPI-intense) regions similar to focal regions described in stem cell fusions. MTFs were readily apparent in vivo in all human melanomas examined, often exhibiting even higher DNA content than the cultured MTFs. When cultured MTFs were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice, they disseminated and produced metastatic lesions at distant sites.Apparent MTFs are present in peripheral blood of patients with cutaneous melanomas, and they possess the ability to form metastatic lesions when transplanted into mice. We hypothesize that these MTFs arise at the periphery of primary tumors in vivo, that they readily enter the bloodstream and invade distant tissues, secreting cytokines (such as MIF) to prepare "niches" for  by metastasis initiating cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218063>Macrophage-secreted interleukin-35 regulates cancer cell plasticity to facilitate metastatic .</a></h2><p>A favorable interplay between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates the outgrowth of metastatic tumors. Because of the distinct initiating processes between primary and metastatic tumors, we investigate the differences in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from primary and metastatic cancers. Here we show that dual expression of M1 and  markers is noted in TAMs from primary tumors, whereas predominant expression of  markers is shown in metastatic TAMs. At metastatic sites, TAMs secrete interleukin-35 (IL-35) to facilitate metastatic  through activation of JAK2-STAT6-GATA3 signaling to reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. In primary tumors, inflammation-induced EMT upregulates IL12Rβ2, a subunit of the IL-35 receptor, in cancer cells to help them respond to IL-35 during metastasis. Neutralization of IL-35 or knockout of IL-35 in macrophages reduces metastatic . These results indicate the distinct TMEs of primary and metastatic tumors and provide potential targets for intercepting metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27248835>Ecosystem Alterations and Species Range Shifts: An Atlantic-Mediterranean Cephalaspidean Gastropod in an Inland Egyptian Lake.</a></h2><p>The eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean marine Cephalaspidea gastropod Haminoea orbignyana was collected from Lake Qarun (Fayoum, Egypt), a landlocked lake that has undergone a shift from freshwater to estuarine conditions in the past 100 years. Species identity was confirmed by both morphological (anatomical dissection and scanning electron microscopy) and molecular methods (COI gene phylogeny). Observations suggested a robust population of H. orbignyana in the lake with a density of ca. 64 individuals/ and ca. 105 egg masses/ during surveys conducted in the summer of 2013. The vast majority of snails and egg masses were found under rocks. Observations of egg masses in the lab showed a gradual change from whitish to yellow-green as the eggs matured and the release of veliger larvae alone after about a week. Although adult cephalaspideans readily consumed filamentous red and green algae, and cyanobacteria, laboratory trials showed that they consumed significantly more of the red alga Ceramium sp., than of the green alga Cladophora glomerata, with consumption of Oscillatoria margaritifera being similar to those on the two algae. When grown on these resources for 16 days, H. orbignyana maintained their mass on the rhodophyte and cyanobacterium, but not in starvation controls. No cephalaspideans grew over the course of this experiment. Lake Qarun has been periodically restocked with Mediterranean fishes and prawns since the 1920s to maintain local fisheries, which represents a possible route of  for H. orbignyana. Yet, based on literature records, it seems more likely that invasion of the lake by this gastropod species has occurred only within the last 20 years. As human activities redistribute species through direct and indirect means, the structure of the community of this inland lake has become unpredictable and the long-term effects of these recent introductions are unknown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26879478>Clinical characteristics of patients with Aspergillus species isolation from respiratory samples: Comparison of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and .</a></h2><p>With advancements in anti-fungal drugs, it has become more important to correctly diagnose chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA); however, it is not easy to distinguish CPA from  when Aspergillus species are isolated from respiratory samples.

A total of 339 patients (197 females, 142 males) diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis by high-resolution computed tomography were classified into four groups: underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/), normal weight (18.5≤BMI<25.0 kg/), overweight (25.0≤BMI<30.0 kg/), and obese (BMI≥30.0 kg/). Clinical variables expressing disease severity were recorded, and acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and survival rates were estimated during the follow-up period. The mean BMI was 21.90 kg/. The underweight group comprised 28.61% of all patients. BMI was negatively correlated with acute exacerbations, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, radiographic extent of bronchiectasis, and chronic  by P. aeruginosa and positively correlated with pulmonary function indices. BMI was a significant predictor of hospitalization risk independent of relevant covariates. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year cumulative survival rates were 94%, 86%, 81%, and 73%, respectively. Survival rates decreased with decreasing BMI (χ2=35.16, P<0.001). The arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, inspiratory capacity, age, BMI, and predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s independently predicted survival in the Cox proportional hazard model. In conclusion, an underweight status was highly prevalent among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Patients with a lower BMI were prone to developing more acute exacerbations, worse pulmonary function, amplified systemic inflammation, and chronic  by P. aeruginosa.

Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).</a></h2><p>The ability of the isolate VG008 of S. frugiperda granulovirus (SpfrGV) to enhance the infectivity of the isolate SfCOL of S. frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpfrMNPV) was evaluated on  larvae. Bioassays were performed with mixtures by using different proportions 90%:10% (M1), 95%:5% () and 97.5%:2.5% (M3) of SfCOL:VG008, respectively. All mixtures showed higher insecticidal activity that SfCOL. The mixture M3 showed the highest enhancement of SfCOL reducing 11.40 times the Mean Lethal Concentration and 96 h in the Mean Time to Death. The enhancer activity of proteins derived from VG008 (GVPs) were also evaluated in mixture with SfCOL. The GVPs increased 27% larval mortality caused by SfCOL and damaged the peritrophic membrane of  larvae, suggesting that the key point in this enhancing activity is the initial step of the larva , the midgut infection. M3 was formulated and evaluated under greenhouse conditions in maize plants using different doses. The highest efficacy was obtained with the highest dose of M3 (8 × 10 OBs/ha), which was similar to that found when formulated SfCOL was applied using an approximately twofold higher dose. The viral mixture M3 was selected as the active ingredient for developing a new biopesticide for a more efficient management of the pest in the field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26762320>Pancreatic hamartoma: a case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic hamartoma is an extremely rare benign disease of the pancreas. Only 30 cases have been reported to date.A 68-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic solid and multi-cystic lesion in the uncus of the pancreas, incidentally detected on abdominal enhanced computed tomography. The tumor was found to be a well-demarcated solid and multi-cystic lesion without any enhancement, measuring 4 cm in diameter. After 28 months of follow-up, the tumor enlarged. At 31 months after initial diagnosis, the patient underwent surgical resection because it was difficult to clinically determine whether the tumor was malignant or not. Macroscopically, the solid tumor consisted of yellow adipose tissue with a smooth thin capsule confined to the pancreatic uncus. The inner structure of the tumor consisted of multiple cysts with a white nodule between the cysts. Histologically, the solid part and the multi-cystic portion consisted of mature adipose tissue and  of dilated pancreatic ducts with mild fibrosis, respectively. Immunohistochemical findings revealed cytokeratin 7 and 19 positive staining in the epithelial cells of the ducts. Adipose tissue showed positive staining for S-100 protein and there were only a few MIB-1 positive cells. The tumor was then diagnosed as a pancreatic hamartoma.Beside on the above findings, we suggest that the term "well-demarcated solid and cystic lesion with chronological morphological changes" could be a clinical keyword to describe pancreatic hamartomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28642762>Arbuscular Mycorrhiza Augments Arsenic Tolerance in Wheat ( L.) by Strengthening Antioxidant Defense System and Thiol Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) can help plants to tolerate arsenic (As) toxicity. However, plant responses are found to vary with the host plant and the AM fungal species. The present study compares the efficacy of two AM fungi  (M1) and  () in amelioration of As stress in wheat ( L. var. HD-2967). Mycorrhizal (M) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) wheat plants were subjected to four levels of As (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg As kg soil). Although As additions had variable effects on the percentage of root colonized by the two fungal inoculants, each mycobiont conferred benefits to the host plant. Mycorrhizal plants continued to display better growth than NM plants. Formation of AM helped the host plant to overcome As-induced P deficiency and maintained favorable P:As ratio. Inoculation of AMF had variable effects on the distribution of As in plant tissues. While As translocation factor decreased in low As (25 mg kg soil), it increased under high As (50 and 100 mg As kg soil). Further As translocation to grain was reduced (As grain:shoot ratio) in M plants compared with NM plants. Arsenic-induced oxidative stress (generation of HO and lipid peroxidation) in plants reduced significantly by AMF inoculation. The alleviation potential of AM was more evident with increase in severity of As stress.  of AMF resulted in higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and guaiacol peroxidase). It increased the concentrations of the antioxidant molecules (carotenoids, proline, and α-tocopherol) than their NM counterparts at high As addition level. Comparatively higher activities of enzymes of glutathione-ascorbate cycle in M plants led to higher ascorbate:dehydroascorbate (AsA:DHA) and glutathione:glutathione disulphide (GSH:GSSG) ratios. Inoculation by AMF also augmented the glyoxalase system by increasing the activities of both glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II enzymes. Mycorrhizal  increased concentrations of cysteine, glutathione, non-protein thiols, and activity of glutathione--transferase that facilitated sequestration of As into non-toxic complexes. The study reveals multifarious role of AMF in alleviation of As toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327655>The Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 Drives Double-Negative Prostate Cancer Metastasis by Coordinating Stemness and Immune Suppression.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms that enable immune evasion at metastatic sites are poorly understood. We show that the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) drives  of the bones and visceral organs in double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC). In vivo genetic screening identifies CCL2 as the top prometastatic gene induced by PRC1. CCL2 governs self-renewal and induces the recruitment of -like tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells, thus coordinating metastasis initiation with immune suppression and neoangiogenesis. A catalytic inhibitor of PRC1 cooperates with immune checkpoint therapy to reverse these processes and suppress metastasis in genetically engineered mouse transplantation models of DNPC. These results reveal that PRC1 coordinates stemness with immune evasion and neoangiogenesis and point to the potential clinical utility of targeting PRC1 in DNPC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here we describe the effects of flooding on carbon allocation on growth, domatia and leaf production, and the herbivory on the myrmecophyte domatia-bearing Tococa coronata Benth. (Melastomataceae) growing along river banks in the Amazon region.In an area of 80 000  of riparian forest along the Juruena River we actively searched for individuals of T. coronata. In each plant we evaluated the size of the plant when producing the first domatium and determined its best predictor: (1) plant total height; (2) size of plants above flood level; or (3) length of time each plant spent underwater. We also compared the herbivory, internode elongation, foliar asymmetry and specific leaf weight between T. coronata individuals growing above and below the maximum flooding level. The distance to the river and the height of the first domatium produced were compared between T. coronata and its sympatric congener, T. bulifera.We found that T. coronata invests in rapid growth in the early ontogenetic stages through an elongation of internodes rather than in constitutive anti-herbivore defences to leaves or domatia to exceed the maximum flooding level. Consequently, its leaf herbivory was higher when compared with those produced above the flooding level. Individuals with leaves above flood levels produce coriaceous leaves and ant-domatias. Thus, flooding seems to trigger changes in growth strategies of the species. Furthermore, T. coronata occurs within the flood level, whereas its congener T. bullifera invariably occurs at sites unreachable by floods.Even in conditions of high stress, T. coronata presents both physiological and adaptive strategies that allow for  and establishment within flooded regions. These mechanisms involve an extreme trade-off of postponing adult plant characteristics to rapid growth to escape flooding while minimizing carbon allocation to defence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28433460>Stimulatory effect of desipramine on lung metastases of adenocarcinoma MADB 106 in stress highly-sensitive and stress non-reactive rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of antidepressant drugs on tumor progress is very poorly recognized. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of individual reactivity to stress and 24-day desipramine (DES) administration on the metastatic  of adenocarcinoma MADB 106 cells in the lungs of Wistar rats. Wistar rats were subjected to stress procedure according to the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression for two weeks and stress highly-sensitive (SHS) and stress non-reactive (SNR) rats were selected. SHS rats were more prone to cancer metastasis than SNR ones and chronic DES treatment further increased the number of lung metastases by 59% and 50% in comparison to vehicle-treated appropriate control rats. The increase in lung metastases was connected with DES-induced skew macrophage activity towards  functional phenotype in SHS and SNR rats. Moreover, during 24h after DES injection in healthy rats, the decreased number of TCD8 and B cells in SHS and SNR rats as well as NK cell cytotoxic activity in SNR rats could be attributed to the lowered capacity to defend against cancer metastasis observed in chronic DES treated and tumor injected rats.Copyright © 2017.

Gene expressions of innate immunity receptors and cytokines were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The protein expression of selected molecules was tested by immunohistochemistry.H. pylori infection did not lead to a significant upregulation of MyD88, TLR2, TLR4, CD14, TREM1, and TREM2 mRNA expression but instead resulted in high mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and CD163. H. pylori cagA(+) infection was associated with higher IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA expression, as compared to cagA(-) strains. H. pylori infected children showed increased IFN-γ and TNF-α protein levels. IFN-γ mRNA expression correlated with both H. pylori density of  and lymphocytic infiltration in the gastric mucosa, whereas TNF-α protein expression correlated with bacterial density.H. pylori infection in children was characterized by (a) Th1 expression profile, (b) lack of mRNA overexpression of natural immunity receptors, and (c) strong anti-inflammatory activities in the gastric mucosa, possibly resulting from increased activity of anti-inflammatory  macrophages. This may explain the mildly inflammatory gastric inflammation often observed among H. pylori infected children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29548303>The RNA binding protein SORBS2 suppresses metastatic  of ovarian cancer by stabilizing tumor-suppressive immunomodulatory transcripts.</a></h2><p>Ovarian cancer constitutes one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies for females. Currently, early detection strategies and therapeutic options for ovarian cancer are far from satisfactory, leading to high diagnosis rates at late stages and disease relapses. New avenues of therapy are needed that target key processes in ovarian cancer progression. While a variety of non-coding RNAs have been proven to regulate ovarian cancer metastatic progression, the functional roles of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in this process are less well defined.In this study, we identify that the RBP sorbin and SH3 domain containing 2 (SORBS2) is a potent suppressor of ovarian cancer metastatic . Mechanistic studies show that SORBS2 binds the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of WFDC1 (WAP four-disulfide core domain 1) and IL-17D (Interleukin-17D), two secreted molecules that are shown to act as metastasis suppressors. Enhanced expression of either WFDC1 or IL-17D potently represses SORBS2 depletion-mediated cancer metastasis promotion. By enhancing the stability of these gene transcripts, SORBS2 suppresses ovarian cancer invasiveness and affects monocyte to myeloid-derived suppressor cell and -like macrophage polarization, eliciting a tumor-suppressive immune microenvironment.Our data illustrate a novel post-transcriptional network that links cancer progression and immunomodulation within the tumor microenvironment through SORBS2-mediated transcript stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26039002>The cytokine response in THP-1 (monocyte) and HL-60 (neutrophil-differentiated) cells infected with different genotypes of Helicobacter pylori strains.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a microaerophilic bacterium related with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Its virulence factors include cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (VacA) proteins. Cytokine release inducted by H. pylori  has an important role in pathogenesis of H. pylori. The severity of gastric pathologies depends on the H. pylori genotypes found in different geographical regions. We aimed to determine the relationship between different H. pylori genotypes and their effects on the cytokine release levels.ureC, cagA, vacAs1/s2, vacAm1/, and blood group antigen-binding adhesion protein A2 (babA2) virulence related genes were investigated in 21 H. pylori strains. Genotyping of 21 strains were made due to the presence of cagA, vacAs1/s2, vacAm1/, and babA2 genes. The H. pylori strains were cultured together with THP-1 and neutrophil-differentiated Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) cells. The levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-10 in these cells were measured after co-culturing with H. pylori strains.The following five different genotypes were detected: Genotype1: cagA and vacAs1m2; Genotype2: cagA and vacAs1m1; Genotype3: cagA, vacAs1m2, and babA2; Genotype4: vacAs2m2; and Genotype5: cagA and vacAs2m2. All these genotypes significantly induced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL 10, and TNF-α in THP-1 cells. Genotype 5 caused higher amounts of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10, whereas genotype 1 induced the highest levels of IL-8. In neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells, genotype 4 increased IL-6 levels and genotype 3 and 4 elevated IL-8 levels significantly.These results suggested that cytokine response of the host varies depending on the specific immune response of the host against different H. pylori strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746626>Association of Cutibacterium avidum  in the Groin With Obesity: A Potential Risk Factor for Hip Periprosthetic Joint Infection.</a></h2><p>An increase in the incidence of hip periprosthetic joint infections caused by Cutibacterium avidum has recently been detected after hip arthroplasty with an anterior surgical approach. We raised the question of whether skin  with C. avidum differs between the anterior and the lateral thigh as areas of surgical incision fields.Between February and June 2017, we analyzed skin scrapings from the groin and the anterior and lateral thigh in patients undergoing a primary hip arthroplasty. We anaerobically cultured plated swab samples for Cutibacterium spp. for ≥7 days. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore associations between body mass index (BMI) and  rate at different sites.Twenty-one of 65 patients (32.3%) were colonized with C. avidum at any site, mainly at the groin (n = 16; 24.6%), which was significantly higher at the anterior (n = 5; 7.7%; P = .009) or lateral (n = 6; 9.2%; P = .02) thigh. Patients colonized with C. avidum did not differ from noncolonized patients in age or sex, but their BMIs were significantly higher (30.1 vs 25.6 kg/, respectively; P = .02). Furthermore, increased BMI was associated with  at the groin (odds ratio per unit BMI increase, 1.15; 95% confidence interval; 1.03-1.29; P = .01).The groin, rather than the anterior thigh, showed  for C. avidum in obese patients.

The gerbils were euthanized at different time points (3, 6, 12, and 18 months). In group 1, genetic alterations were observed at 6 and 12 months. With the combination of both strains, group 3 also exhibited genetic alterations at 3 and 18 months; moreover, a chimera, , was detected. Additionally, four new sequence types (STs) were reported in the PubMLST database for . Synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were analyzed and associated with alterations in amino acids. Microevolutionary analysis of the STs (PHYLOViZ) identified in each group revealed many mutational changes in the toxigenic () and non-toxigenic () strains. Phylogenetic assessments (eBURST) did not reveal clonal complexes. Our findings indicate that the toxigenic strain, , and a combination of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains acquired genetic material by recombination.

Tobramycin-inhaled powder (TIP™) is increasingly replacing time-consuming nebulizer therapy. It is unclear whether laboratory parameters change during the month off period compared with the month on therapy.Our aim was to assess whether spirometry, lung clearance index and circulating inflammatory markers differ between on/off treatment periods.A prospective pilot study evaluating CF patients treated with TIP, on two consecutive months (on/off) therapy. The evaluations were performed at the end of a month off therapy (1-2 days before the initiation of TIP) and after 28 days of treatment with TIP (1-2 days after the end of the treatment cycle).Nineteen CF patients (10 males) with a mean age of 18.7±9.7 years and BMI (body mass index) of 19.62±3.53 kg/ were evaluated. After a month off treatment with TIP, spirometry parameters and lung clearance index remained unchanged. IL-6 increased significantly (p=0.022) off treatment. There was a non-significant change in the other inflammatory cytokines off therapy [hs-CRP, IL-8,TNF-α, α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) and neutrophilic elastase].The results of lung function parameters support the relative stability of CF patients during the month off therapy; however, the difference in serum IL-6 raises the possibility of ongoing higher degrees of inflammation during the month off therapy with TIP. The small sample size and the multiple parameters evaluated preclude firm conclusions; therefore, larger multicenter studies are needed to assess the on/off treatment strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25024028>The Otto Aufranc Award: Modifiable versus nonmodifiable risk factors for infection after hip arthroplasty.</a></h2><p>Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are associated with increased morbidity and cost. It would be important to identify any modifiable patient- and surgical-related factors that could be modified before surgery to decrease the risk of PJI.We sought to identify and quantify the magnitude of modifiable risk factors for deep PJIs after primary hip arthroplasty.A series of 3672 primary and 406 revision hip arthroplasties performed at a single specialty hospital over a 3-year period were reviewed. All deep PJIs were identified using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions (ie, occurs within 30-90 days postoperatively, involves deep soft tissues of the incision, purulent drainage, dehiscence and fever, localized pain or tenderness). Univariate and multivariate analyses determined the association between patient and surgical risk factors and PJIs. For the elective patients, the procedure was performed on the day of admission ("same-day procedure"), whereas for the fracture and nonelective patients, the procedure was performed 1 or more days postadmission ("nonsame-day procedure"). Staphylococcus aureus , tobacco use, and body mass index (BMI) were defined as patient-related modifiable risk factors.Forty-seven (1.3%) deep PJIs were identified. Infection developed in 20 of 363 hips of nonsame-day procedures and 27 of 3309 same-day procedures (p=0.006). There were eight (2%) infections in the revision group. After controlling for confounding variables, our multivariate analysis showed that BMI≧40 kg/ (odds ratio [OR], 4.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-12.88; p=0.01), operating time>115 minutes (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.23-9.28; p=0.018), nonsame-day surgery (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.44-12.02; p=0.008), and revision surgery (OR, 4.23; 95% CI, 1.67-10.72; p<0.001) are significant risk factors for PJIs. Tobacco use and S aureus  were additive risk factors when combined with other significant risk factors (OR, 12.76; 95% CI, 2.47-66.16; p=0.017).Nonsame-day hip and revision arthroplasties have higher infection rates than same-day primary surgeries. These characteristics are not modifiable and should be categorized as a separate cohort for complication-reporting purposes. Potentially modifiable risk factors in our patient population include operating time, elevated BMI, tobacco use, and S aureus . Modifying risk factors may decrease the incidence of PJIs. When reporting deep PJI rates, stratification into preventable versus nonpreventable infections may provide a better assessment of performance on an institutional and individual surgeon level.Level IV, prognostic study.

The objective of this study was to develop a risk prediction model for S. aureus SSI or bacteremia after cardiothoracic surgery based on pre-operative variables.Data from the Merck Phase IIb/III S. aureus vaccine (V710-P003) clinical trial were analyzed. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, the effect of preoperative vaccination against S. aureus was investigated in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The primary outcome was deep/superficial S. aureus SSI or S. aureus bacteremia through day 90 after surgery. Performance, calibration, and discrimination of the final model were assessed.Overall 164 out of 7,647 included patients (2.1%) developed S. aureus infection (149 SSI, 15 bacteremia, 28 both). Independent risk factors for developing the primary outcome were pre-operative  with S. aureus (OR 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23-4.22), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.34-2.60), BMI (OR 1.02 per kg/, 95% CI 0.99-1.05), and CABG (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.91-3.78). Although vaccination had a significant (albeit modest) protective effect, it was omitted from the model because its addition did not significantly change the coefficients of the final model and V710-vaccine development has been discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. The final prediction model had moderate discriminative accuracy (AUC-value, 0.72).Pre-operative S. aureus  status, diabetes mellitus, BMI, and type of surgical procedure moderately predicted the risk of S. aureus SSI and/or bacteremia among patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788098>Helicobacter pylori  Protects Against Chronic Experimental Colitis by Regulating Th17/Treg Balance.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an inverse association between Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The mechanisms by which H. pylori infection protects against IBD are unclear. Here, we explored the possible protective effects and mechanisms of gastric H. pylori  on a chronic colitis model, with focus on whether H. pylori exerted its effects through regulating Th17/Treg immune responses.Chronic colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine Th17 cells, Treg cells, and M1/ macrophages in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and colonic lamina propria. The levels of Th17- and Treg-associated cytokines were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The direct effect of H. pylori extract on the polarization status of macrophages was determined in vitro.Gastric H. pylori  significantly ameliorated the severity of chronic DSS-induced colitis. H. pylori  decreased Th17 cells and mRNA levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21 in the colon. Simultaneously, H. pylori  increased Treg cells and IL-10 expression. As to cytokines driving Th17 and Treg differentiation, H. pylori  increased TGFβ and decreased IL-6 and IL-23. Moreover, H. pylori  significantly increased  macrophages in the colon. In vitro, H. pylori extract promotion of  macrophage polarization was dependent on the presence of CagA.H. pylori  protects against chronic DSS-induced colitis via balancing Th17/Treg responses and shifting macrophages toward anti-inflammatory  phenotype. Our results strengthen the rationale for gastric H. pylori  affecting the immune homeostasis of the colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981499>Snail-overexpressing Cancer Cells Promote -Like Polarization of Tumor-Associated Macrophages by Delivering MiR-21-Abundant Exosomes.</a></h2><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major event during cancer progression and metastasis; however, the definitive role of EMT in remodeling tumor microenvironments (TMEs) is unclear. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major type of host immune cells in TMEs, and they perform a wide range of functions to regulate tumor  and progression by regulating tumor invasiveness, local tumor immunity, and angiogenesis. TAMs are considered to have an -like, i.e., alternatively activated, phenotype; however, how these EMT-undergoing cancer cells promote  polarization of TAMs as a crucial tumor-host interplay during cancer progression is unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of EMT-mediated TAM activation. Here, we demonstrate that the EMT transcriptional factor Snail directly activates the transcription of MIR21 to produce miR-21-abundant tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs). The miR-21-containing exosomes were engulfed by CD14 human monocytes, suppressing the expression of M1 markers and increasing that of  markers. Knockdown of miR-21 in Snail-expressing human head and neck cancer cells attenuated the Snail-induced  polarization, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. In head and neck cancer samples, a high expression of miR-21 was correlated with a higher level of SNAI1 and the  marker MRC1. This study elucidates the mechanism of EMT-mediated  polarization through delivery of the miR-21-abundant exosomes, which may serve as a candidate biomarker of tumor progression and provide a potential target for intercepting EMT-mediated TME remodeling.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

However, mismanagement of this plantation has led to its rapid degradation. The best option to maintain the protective service is to restore the plantation and direct its successional trajectory towards the neighbouring montane forest. Through experimental manipulation, we aimed to determine which factors block secondary succession and to investigate their effects. Within the experimental constraints imposed by the plantation small area, we analysed the effects of light and fertility limitation, litter accumulation and access to seed on plantation restoration. Light availability was manipulated by clearing and thinning three 800  main plots. Fertilization and litter removal was applied to sub-plots within the light plots. Soils were analysed, microclimate was monitored and, for four years, stem density, species richness and basal area were tallied. Our results showed that light accessibility was the main factor deterring the successional trajectory of the plots, with varying grades of interaction with the sub-treatments. By the end of the fourth year, the cleared plot showed the largest responses in all traits (triplicating stem density and basal area and >20 times higher species richness). The main colonizers were Croton megalodendron, Ocotea fendleri, and Clusia spp. all dominant trees in the nearby native forest. We concluded that the results of this pioneer study, showed that small clearings, repeated in 3-4 year cycles are appropriate for similar restoration schemes. This procedure would create a mosaic of vegetation patches at different successional stages while protecting the slopes from erosion and increasing local biodiversity.</p></html>
