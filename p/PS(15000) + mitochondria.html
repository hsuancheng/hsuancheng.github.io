The dependence of the key photodynamic properties of 1-5 on the introduced substituents was analyzed. The photoinduced cell-killing activity of 4 is 100- and 280-fold higher than that of chlorin p6 and Photogem, respectively, as estimated on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The activity is reduced eight times in the order 4 > 5 > 1 > 2 > 3. The intracellular accumulation of 1-5 occurs in cytoplasm in a monomeric form bound to the lipids of cellular membranes. This form of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is characterized by the high quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, which depends on the introduced substituents, .66, .59, .35, .51 and .73, respectively. The photostability is two-fold less for 1 and four-fold less for 2, 3 and 5 than for 4. The rates of cellular uptake and efflux of 1-5 vary widely, thus providing the way to optimize the pharmacological properties of the photosensitizer () using the respective substituents. Modifying the substituents, 1-5 were targeted to different cellular organelles. The enhanced accumulation in the Golgi apparatus and  complemented with diffuse staining of intracellular membranous structures is a property of 1-4. Compound 5 accumulates selectively in the lipid droplets and stains weakly perinuclear structures. Temperature-sensitive mechanisms of transport are responsible for the 1-4 uptake. Diffusion can play a role in the internalization of 5 but not of 1-4. Endocytosis via caveolae, clathrin-dependent and adenosine triphosphate-dependent pathways are not noticeably involved in the 1-5 internalization. Independently from their intracellular localization 1, 4 and 5 are highly efficient near-IR , which induce predominantly an apoptotic type of cell death under conditions providing ca 50% level of phototoxicity and necrosis at the 100% level of phototoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9472034>Rapid diffusion of green fluorescent protein in the mitochondrial matrix.</a></h2><p>It is thought that the high protein density in the mitochondrial matrix results in severely restricted solute diffusion and metabolite channeling from one enzyme to another without free aqueous-phase diffusion. To test this hypothesis, we measured the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in the mitochondrial matrix of fibroblast, liver, skeletal muscle, and epithelial cell lines. Spot photobleaching of GFP with a 100x objective (.8-micron spot diam) gave half-times for fluorescence recovery of -19 ms with >90% of the GFP mobile. As predicted for aqueous-phase diffusion in a confined compartment, fluorescence recovery was slowed or abolished by increased laser spot size or bleach time, and by paraformaldehyde fixation. Quantitative analysis of bleach data using a mathematical model of matrix diffusion gave GFP diffusion coefficients of 2-3 x 10(-7) cm2/s, only three to fourfold less than that for GFP diffusion in water. In contrast, little recovery was found for bleaching of GFP in fusion with subunits of the fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex that are normally present in the matrix. Measurement of the rotation of unconjugated GFP by time-resolved anisotropy gave a rotational correlation time of 23.3 +/- 1 ns, similar to that of 20 ns for GFP rotation in water. A rapid rotational correlation time of 325  was also found for a small fluorescent probe (BCECF, approximately .5 kD) in the matrix of isolated liver . The rapid and unrestricted diffusion of solutes in the mitochondrial matrix suggests that metabolite channeling may not be required to overcome diffusive barriers. We propose that the clustering of matrix enzymes in membrane-associated complexes might serve to establish a relatively uncrowded aqueous space in which solutes can freely diffuse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22701564>The reproducibility of 31-phosphorus MRS measures of muscle energetics at 3 Tesla in trained men.</a></h2><p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides an exceptional opportunity for the study of in vivo metabolism. MRS is widely used to measure phosphorus metabolites in trained muscle, although there are no published data regarding its reproducibility in this specialized cohort. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of (31)P-MRS in trained skeletal muscle.We recruited fifteen trained men (VO(2)peak = 4.7±.8 L min(-1)/58±8 mL kg(-1) min(-1)) and performed duplicate MR experiments during plantar flexion exercise, three weeks apart.Measures of resting phosphorus metabolites were reproducible, with 1.7 mM the smallest detectable difference in phosphocreatine (PCr). Measures of metabolites during exercise were less reliable: exercising PCr had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 27% during exercise, compared with 8% at rest. Estimates of mitochondrial function were variable, but experimentally useful. The CV of PCr(1/2t) was 40%, yet much of this variance was inter-subject such that differences of <20% were detectable with n = , given a significance threshold of p<.05.31-phosphorus MRS provides reproducible and experimentally useful measures of phosphorus metabolites and mitochondrial function in trained human skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15081634>Phosphatidylserine efflux and intercellular fusion in a BeWo model of human villous cytotrophoblast.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylserine () efflux characterizes cytotrophoblast apoptosis and differentiation. To evaluate whether  externalization and intercellular fusion were secondary to apoptosis, BeWo cells were induced to differentiate by forskolin or undergo apoptosis by staurosporine.  externalization was measured by FITC-annexin V binding, and intercellular fusion was quantified by counting nuclei in syncytial cells. During forskolin treatment, vanadate decreased  efflux by 78. per cent from 68. [5.3] (mean [SD]) to . [8.8] Lum (x10(3)) (P<.001), whereas Z-VAD-fmk had no effect (66.5 [7.3]). Vanadate decreased intercellular fusion from 78.1 per cent [4.1] fusion in uninhibited cultures to 23.4 per cent [2.5], compared with 10. per cent [1.7] in media alone. Z-VAD-fmk did not affect fusion (80.4 per cent [6.8]). Staurosporine induced  efflux was not affected by vanadate (69.6 [5.5] Lum x10(3)), but was inhibited 87.8 per cent by Z-VAD-fmk; from 71.5 [6.2] to 8.7 [3.6] Lum (x10(3)) (P<.001). Apoptosis was measured by the TUNEL and COMET assays, lamin B fragmentation, activation of procaspase 3, mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor. There was no indication of apoptosis associated with differentiation. Thus,  efflux and intercellular fusion occurred through a vanadate-sensitive mechanism that was independent of apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2798536>Mitochondrial protein synthesis may be involved in long-term memory formation.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis that two qualitatively different stages of cerebral protein synthesis () are required for the formation of long-term memory (LTM) for an active-avoidance task was investigated in rats. Cytoplasmic  was inhibited with anisomycin (ANI-5. mg subcutaneously). When ANI was injected at  min pre- and 30 min posttraining, so that cerebral  was inhibited by 90% for 2 hours starting just before training. LTM formation was prevented. When ANI was given after training, it was not effective. Mitochondrial  was inhibited with chloramphenicol (CAP-1.5 mg intracisternally). Inhibition occurred 40 min after the injection. CAP interfered with LTM formation only when injected between  and 55 min after training. From these data it was concluded that two stages of  are required for the formation of LTM. The first one takes place in the cytoplasm, starts with the commencement of training and is independent of newly synthesized mRNA. The second stage takes place in  starting approximately 25 min after training and is dependent upon newly formed mRNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17377779>Fluorescent determination of cardiolipin using 10-N-nonyl acridine orange.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL) plays an essential role as a marker for cell apoptosis. Quantitative detection of phospholipids (PLs) by UV absorbance is problematic due to the presence of few double bonds in the structure. Although 10-N-nonyl acridine orange (NAO) has been utilized for fluorescent visualization of liposomes and  through its interaction with CL, in this work, we have developed a specific fluorescent method for CL in solution using NAO. The interaction of sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS), used to treat cells prior to lipid extraction, and other PLs found in cell membranes such as phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidiylserine (), and sphingomyelin (SM) with NAO is investigated. The fluorescence intensity of the .5 microM NAO signal is strongly quenched by SDS below 25% methanol in water but with a methanol content above 50%, no quenching of NAO by SDS is observed. No fluorescence quenching of NAO with a 50% methanol/50% water solvent by the previously mentioned PLs or 4-20 microM cholesterol with the exception of PG at above 8 microM is noted. Using this 50% methanol/50% water solvent, the fluorescence signal due to the NAO-CL interaction is quite stable from 3 to at least  min. With excitation and emission wavelengths set at 518 and 530 nm, respectively, 20 microM NAO provides an inverse linear fluorescence response at .2-10 microM CL with a correlation coefficient of .9929. The detection limit is .2 microM and the limit of quantification is .6 microM. Structurally analogous acridine orange and phenosafranin dyes are less effective as fluorescent probes for CL. The CL in the whole cell and membrane samples is quantitatively determined by standard addition to range from .2 to 1.5 microM. The level of CL in cell membrane samples, previously subjected to staurosporine which initiates cell apoptosis, is increased but not significantly through use of the t-test.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552275>Alterations in the expression and activity of creatine kinase-M and mitochondrial creatine kinase subunits in skeletal muscle following prolonged intense exercise in rats.</a></h2><p>Creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes are important structural and energy metabolism components in skeletal muscle. In this study, CK isoenzyme alterations were examined in male rats, with an 8% body mass weight attached to their tail. The rats were either forced to swim for 5 h (5S, n = 51), or were pre-trained for 8 days and then forced to swim for 5 h (T5S, n = 48). Rats were sacrificed either immediately ( h ), 3 h (3 h ), or 48 h post-swimming (48 h ). Serum CK was increased significantly (P < .01) 6.2- and 2.-fold at  h  following the 5S and T5S protocols, respectively. However, training (T5S protocol) significantly (P < .01) decreased CK release. Soleus and white gastrocnemius (WG) CK activity was significantly decreased following the 5S protocol (P < .05), but not following the T5S protocol. The CK-M activity of the soleus muscle was significantly (P < .05) decreased at  h  following both the 5S and T5S protocols, and returned to control values at 3 h . The CK-M activity of the WG was significantly (P < .05) decreased at  h  following the 5S protocol. Sarcomeric mitochondrial CK (sCK-Mit) was decreased significantly (P < .01) at  h  (20%), 3 h  (14%), 24 h  (22%), and 48 h  (%) following the 5S protocol. However, sCK-Mit was decreased significantly (P < .01) only at  h  (7%) following the T5S. The results of this study demonstrate that prolonged intense exercise causes a loss of skeletal muscle CK-M and sCK-Mit activity and that training prior to the prolonged intense exercise attenuates the exercise-induced CK-M and sCK-Mit loss in both red and white skeletal muscles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15375728>The effect of ultraviolet radiation on ultrastructure and photosynthesis in the red macroalgae Palmaria palmata and Odonthalia dentata from Arctic waters.</a></h2><p>In radiation exposure experiments, the effects of mild artificial UV conditions (4.7 W m(-2) UV-A and .20 W m(-2) UV-B) plus PAR (25 - 30 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1)) on photosynthesis and ultrastructure of two red algal species from the Arctic have been investigated. While Palmaria palmata was collected from the upper sublittoral of the Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen, Norway), Odonthalia dentata represents a typical deepwater species at this high latitude. After 6 h and 24 h exposure to UV, chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II ( II efficiency, F(v)/F(m)) was determined as an indicator for photosynthetic performance, and the relative electron transport rates in response to increasing photon fluence rates were recorded. In parallel, tissue samples were prepared for the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The presented data clearly demonstrate a significant influence of experimental UV on photosynthetic performance. Photochemical efficiency of  II of both red algal species decreased to about one third of the initial value under UV. While the PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve parameter alpha (positive slope at limiting photon fluence rates) strongly decreased in both plants, the I(k) values (initial value of light-saturated photosynthetic rate) increased 3 - 5-fold. Palmaria palmata does not appear to become photoinhibited under these conditions, but O. dentata showed strong photoinhibition. The TEM results demonstrated that the photosynthetic apparatus was severely influenced by UV in both species, because thylakoid membranes appeared wrinkled, lumen dilatations occurred, and the outer membranes were altered. Moreover,  were damaged, and numerous plasma vesicles were observed. In conclusion, both red algal species are negatively affected by UV on the physiological and ultrastructural level. However, the differences in photoinhibitory responses correlate well with the vertical depth zonation of P. palmata and O. dentata in the Arctic Kongsfjord.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1722254>Identification of anion and cation pathways in the inner mitochondrial membrane by patch clamping of mouse liver mitoplasts.</a></h2><p>Alkalinization of the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane by pH shifts from 6.8 to 8.3 caused a reversible increase in current of 3.2 +/- .2 pA (mean +/- SE, n = 21) at +/- 40 mV measured using patch-clamp techniques. The current increase was reversed in a graded fashion by the addition of Mg2+ as well as a reduction in pH. Detection of single-channel events was done at .5, 1 and 2 M KCl. The single-channel amplitude in . M KCl corresponds to approximately  . Reversal potentials derived from whole patch currents indicated that the inner mitochondrial membrane was primarily cation selective at pH 6.8 with a PK/PCl = 32 (n = 6). Treatment with alkaline pH (8.3) increased the current and anion permeability (PK/PCl = 16, n = 6). The membrane becomes completely cation selective when low concentrations (12 microM) of the drug propranolol are added. The amphiphilic drugs amiodarone (4 microM), propranolol (70 microM) and quinine (.6 mM) blocked almost all of the current. The pH-dependent current was also inhibited by tributyltin. These results are consistent with the presence of two pathways in the inner mitochondrial membrane. One is cation selective and generally open and the other is anion selective and induced by alkaline pH. The alkaline pH-activated channel likely corresponds to the inner membrane anion channel postulated by others from suspension studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722112>Enzymatic characterization of an active NDH complex from Thermosynechococcus elongatus.</a></h2><p>Although type-1 NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex subunit constituents and physiological functions have been reported in plants and cyanobacteria, the biochemical properties of this enzyme are not clear. We used chromatographic isolation to purify and characterize a NADPH-active NDH from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Ferredoxin (Fd) and ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductase (FNR) were co-eluted with NDH, implying the electron donation from NADPH to NDH via the interaction with FNR. We investigated the enzymatic properties of the complex.

Second -derived activator of caspases (Smac), an antagonist of XIAP, has been shown in vitro to increase chemosensitivity. This study examined the prognostic value of survivin, XIAP and Smac in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure survivin, XIAP and Smac mRNA expression in transbronchial biopsy tumour specimens from 72 patients with advanced NSCLC before commencing chemotherapy. Outcome measures were response to chemotherapy, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Low expression of survivin was associated with good response to chemotherapy (P = .028). No association was found between XIAP and Smac expression levels and response to chemotherapy (P = .224 and P = .088, respectively). Patients with low survivin expression or high Smac expression had significantly longer PFS (P = .012 and P = .029, respectively) and OS (P = .007 and P = .031, respectively) compared with patients with high expression of survivin or low expression of Smac. XIAP expression was not correlated with PFS or OS. Additionally, PFS and OS in patients with performance status of  or 1 and stage IIIB were significantly longer than PFS and OS in patients with performance status () of 2 and stage IV disease. Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that survivin and clinical stage were independent predictors for PFS and OS. Smac was an independent prognostic factor for OS, but not for PFS.Our findings suggest that the expression levels of survivin and Smac, but not XIAP, predict the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857209>[Mechanism investigation of platelet apoptosis inhibition by N-Arachidonoylethanolamine].</a></h2><p>To investigate the mechanism of N- Arachidonoylethanolamine (ANA) on inhibiting platelets (PLT) apoptosis under standard blood bank storage conditions.Samples taken from collected apheresis PLT by the Amicus instrument were split into three parts. An aliquot of .5 μmol/L ANA were added to one part of storage PLT as the ANA group; an aliquot of .5 μmol/L ANA and 1 μmol/L SR141716 was added to the another part as the ANA + SR141716 group; and the third part without ANA and SR141716 as the control group. These samples were stored on a flat-bed shaker at (22 ± 2) ⁰C for 7 days. The expression of phosphatidyl serine () positive, phospho (p)-Akt, Akt, p-Bad, Bad, caspase-3, caspase-9, cytochrome C (Cyt-C) and BCL-XL interaction with Bak were detected.The rate of PLT  positive in ANA group decreased significantly than that in control group[ (8.29 ± 1.44) % vs (14.24 ± 2.47) %, P<.05]. The release of Cyt-C from  to cytosol in ANA group decreased significantly compared with control group[ (3.29 ± 1.44) % vs (.24 ± 3.40) %, P<.05]. Also the expressions of p-Akt and p-Bad in ANA group increased significantly than those in control group[ (71.33 ± 10.26) % vs (35.00 ± 6.00) %, P<.05; (39.00 ± 9.64) % vs (10.33 ± 1.53) %, P<.05, respectively]. Higher amounts of Bak protein were co-precipitated with BCL-XL in ANA group than that in control group (about 2.6 fold, P<.05).

There were no significantly changes between ANA+SR141716 and control groups (P>.05).ANA protected PLTs from apoptosis as a result of inhibiting the release of Cyt-C from  to cytosol by modifying the expressions of apoptosis-relative proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1805091>Fatty acid composition of subcellular particles from sheep platelets and topological distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acids in the plasma membrane.</a></h2><p>The fatty acid composition of individual phospholipids in subcellular fractions of sheep platelets and the asymmetrical distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) fatty acyl chains across the plasma membrane were examined. The main fatty acids of total lipid extracts were oleic (18:1; 32-41%), linoleic (18:2, 10-17%), stearic (18:; 13-%), palmitic (16:; 11-%) and arachidonic (20:4; 8-12%) acids, with a saturated/unsaturated ratio of about .4. Each phospholipid class had a distinct fatty acid pattern. Sphingomyelin (SM) showed the highest degree of saturation (50%), with large proportions of behenic (22:), 18: and 16: acids. The main fatty acid in PE, phosphatidylserine () and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was 18:1n-9. Our findings suggest that fatty acids are asymmetrically distributed between the choline versus the non-choline phospholipids, and also between plasma membranes and intracellular membranes. The transbilayer distribution of PE fatty acids in plasma membranes from non-stimulated sheep platelets was investigated using trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS). A significant degree of asymmetry was found, which is a new observation in a non-polar cell. The PE molecules from the inner monolayer contained higher amounts of 18:2 and significantly less 18:1 and 20:5 than those found in the outer monolayer, although no major differences were detected in the transbilayer distribution of total unsaturated versus saturated PE acyl chains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17456364>[The effect of two newly Chinese presenilin-1 mutations on the sensitivity to trophic factor withdrawal in human neuroblastoma cells].</a></h2><p>To study the effects of two novel presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations, V97L and A136G, discovered in 2 families of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China, on human neuroblastoma cells and the protective role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).Two mutation type (MT) -1 genes with the mutational sites V97L and A136G were established. These 2 MT genes, wild type (WT) -1 gene, and mock were stably transfected into the human neuroblastoma cells of the line SH-SY5Y. The 4 kinds of transfected cells were divided into 3 subgroups: (1) control subgroup, cultured in normal medium with serum, (2) serum deprivation subgroup, cultured in the medium without serum, and (3) serum deprivation + IGF-1 subgroup, cultured in serum deprivation medium plus IGF-1. Twenty-four hours later MTT colorimetry was used to calculate the cell survival rate. Hoechst33258 method and phosphatidylinositol/annexin V-FITC double staining flow cytometry were used to observe the cell apoptosis. The glucose uptake was measured. Western blotting was used to analyze the protein expression of glucose transporter protein (GLUT)-1 in the cell membrane.Different tests all showed that the cell survival rates of the V97L and A136G serum deprivation subgroups were both significantly lower than those of the corresponding WT and Mock subgroups (P < .01, P < .05), the cell survival rates of the all serum deprivation + IGF-1 subgroups were significantly higher than those of the corresponding serum deprivation subgroups (all P < .01); The glucose uptake rate was not significantly different among different subgroups, but IGF-1 addition made the glucose uptake increase by about 25% (all P > .05). The GLUT1 expression in the cell membrane of the serum deprivation + IGF-I subgroups increased by % - 20% respectively, however, without significant differences.Enhanced sensitivity to trophic withdrawal in the cells with the two Chinese PS1 mutations most likely contributes to the neuron loss in AD. The sensitivity to apoptosis is not caused by impaired glucose metabolism, but IGF-1 still can protect cells from serum deprivation that compensates the negative effect through enhancing glucose transport and  activities.</p></html>
