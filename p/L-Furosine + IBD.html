The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of DAP12 and Syk pathways in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).DAP12 deficient and DAP12 transgenic, overexpressing an increased amount of DAP12, mice and Syk deficient mice in the C57/BL6 background were used for these studies. Colitis was induced by administering mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), in drinking water, or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), by intrarectal enema.Abundant expression of DAP12 and Syk was detected in colon samples obtained from Crohn's disease patients with expression restricted to immune cells infiltrating the colonic wall. In rodents development of DSS colitis as measured by assessing severity of wasting diseases, global colitis score,and macroscopic and histology scores was robustly attenuated in DAP12-/- and Syk-/- mice. In contrast, DAP12 overexpression resulted in a striking exacerbation of colon damage caused by DSS. Induction of colon expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to DSS administration was attenuated in DAP12-/- and Syk-/- mice, whereas opposite results were observed in DAP12 transgenic mice. Treating wild-type mice with a DAP-12 inhibitor or a Syk inhibitor caused a robust attenuation of colitis induced by DSS and TNBS.DAP12 and Syk are essential mediators in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction in murine colitides. Because DAP12 and Syk expression is upregulated in patients with active disease, present findings suggest a beneficial role for DAP12 and Syk inhibitors in .© 2017 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America.

The anti-inflammatory role of PTPN2 is highlighted by the fact that PTPN2-deficient mice die a few weeks after birth because of systemic inflammation and severe colitis. However, the tissues, cells, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of PTPN2 in mice (PTPN2-LysMCre) promotes intestinal inflammation but protects from colitis-associated tumor formation in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Elevated levels of mature IL-1β production in PTPN2-LysMCre mice are a consequence of increased inflammasome assembly due to elevated phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Thus, we have identified a dual role for myeloid PTPN2 in directly regulating inflammasome activation and IL-1β production to suppress pro-inflammatory responses during colitis but promote intestinal tumor development.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Anti-cytokine therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in . Janus kinases (JAKs) are  kinases that bind different intracellular cytokine receptors, leading to phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of transcription molecules implicated on targeted gene transcription. Four isoforms of JAKs have been described: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Oral JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have been developed as synergic anti-cytokine therapy in , showing different selectivity towards JAK isoforms. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC. With the aim of improving the benefit: risk ratio of this drug class, several second-generation subtype-selective JAKi are under development. However, whether selective inhibition of JAK isoforms is associated with an increased clinical efficacy and/or a better safety profile remains debatable. The aim of this review is to critically review the preclinical and clinical data for the differential selectivity of JAK inhibitors and to summarise the potential clinical implications of the selective JAK inhibitors under development for UC and CD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the association of five polymorphisms of PTPN22 gene with susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) in Iran.A total of 67 patients diagnosed with UC (35 female and 32 male all under 18 years) and 93 healthy subjects were selected.

The carriage of G allele of rs1310182 was significantly associated with increased risk of UC (OR (95% CI) = 1.17 (0.70-1.98), p < 0.001). Moreover, the genotype GG of SNP rs1310182 was significantly associated with UC (OR (95% CI) = 2.32 (1.13-4.76), p < 0.01).

The inhibition of meprin-β by various inhibitors, both macromolecular and small molecules, is crucial in the control of several diseases. Human fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein involved in inflammatory disease, has recently been identified as an endogenous inhibitor for meprin-β. In this computational study, an integrated  approach was performed using existing structural information of meprin-β coupled with  modelling of human fetuin-A to predict a rational model of the complex through protein-protein docking. Further, the models were optimized and validated to generate an ensemble of conformations through extensive molecular dynamics simulation. Virtual alanine scanning mutagenesis was explored to identify hotspot residues on both proteins significant for protein-protein interaction (PPI). The results of the study provide structural insight into PPI between meprin-β and fetuin-A which can be useful in designing molecules to modulate meprin-β activity.

ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC) colon tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino acid composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, arachidonic, and linoleic acid. In the same way, differences in the amino acid composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, , methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino acid fragments. In this case, human colonic inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

Flavonoids have demonstrated radical-scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of BJe in mice subjected to experimental colitis.Colitis was induced in mice by intracolonic instillation of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS). BJe was administered daily orally (at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg).Four days after DNBS administration, colon nuclear factor NF-κB translocation and MAP kinase phospho-JNK activation were increased as well as cytokine production such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. Neutrophil infiltration, by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, in the mucosa was associated with up-regulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-selectin). Immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine and poly ADP-ribose (PAR) also showed an intense staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with BJe decreased the appearance of diarrhea and body weight loss. This was associated with a reduction in colonic MPO activity. BJe reduced nuclear NF-κB translocation, p-JNK activation, the pro-inflammatory cytokines release, the appearance of nitrotyrosine and PAR in the colon and reduced the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. In addition, colon inflammation was also associated with apoptotic damage. Treatment with BJe caused a decrease of pro-apoptotic Bax expression and an increase of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression.The results of this study suggested that administration of BJe induced, partly specified, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which potentially may be beneficial for the treatment of  in humans.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

SCFA (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and  involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30509444>Uveitis and spondyloarthropathies.</a></h2><p>Uveitis is a frequently occurring extra-articular manifestation of spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis (ReA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and inflammatory bowel disease (), occurring in both adults and children with SpA. Uveitis occurs with varying frequency according to the SpA subtype (33% in AS, 6-9% in PsA, 25% in ReA, 13% in undifferentiated SpA and 2-5% in ), the presence of HLA-B27 and with increasing duration of disease. The majority of cases of uveitis in SpA are attributed to acute anterior uveitis but a minority of uveitis cases occur in the posterior segment of the eye. The latter are more frequently complicated by cystoid macular oedema (CMO) and sight loss. The nature of the tissue specificity exhibited by the SpAs is poorly understood. Three current investigational approaches are discussed: high-throughput genomics to identify and confirm uveitis-specific susceptibility alleles; investigation of the role of the intestinal microbiome and its potential role in innate immune signalling in uveitis; and study of a novel IL23R-bearing cell population in several entheseal sites including the eye. The treatment for uveitis in SpAs is predominantly with topical corticosteroids for acute episodes. Among the systemic drugs used for the treatment of SpAs, infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab are effective in reducing the frequency of uveitis but etanercept is not. Other targets in spondyloarthropathy include cytokines within the IL23/IL17 axis, of which the IL17A inhibitor secukinumab has not been shown to be effective in uveitis. Future therapeutic approaches may include small molecules such as selective and non-selective janus kinase and  kinase inhibitors.Copyright © 2018.

Here, we genetically fine-map the RA risk locus at 19p13 to define causal variants, and explore the pleiotropic effects of these same variants in other complex traits. First, we combined Immunochip dense genotyping (n = 23,092 case/control samples), Exomechip genotyping (n = 18,409 case/control samples) and targeted exon-sequencing (n = 2,236 case/controls samples) to demonstrate that three protein-coding variants in TYK2 ( kinase 2) independently protect against RA: P1104A (rs34536443, OR = 0.66, P = 2.3 x 10(-21)), A928V (rs35018800, OR = 0.53, P = 1.2 x 10(-9)), and I684S (rs12720356, OR = 0.86, P = 4.6 x 10(-7)). Second, we show that the same three TYK2 variants protect against systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, Pomnibus = 6 x 10(-18)), and provide suggestive evidence that two of the TYK2 variants (P1104A and A928V) may also protect against inflammatory bowel disease (; P(omnibus) = 0.005). Finally, in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) assessing >500 phenotypes using electronic medical records (EMR) in >29,000 subjects, we found no convincing evidence for association of P1104A and A928V with complex phenotypes other than autoimmune diseases such as RA, SLE and . Together, our results demonstrate the role of TYK2 in the pathogenesis of RA, SLE and , and provide supporting evidence for TYK2 as a promising drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297055>Targeting the Eph/Ephrin System as Anti-Inflammatory Strategy in .</a></h2><p>Besides their long-known critical role in embryonic growth and in cancer development and progression, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma type B (EphB) receptor  kinases and their ephrin-B ligands are involved in the modulation of immune responses and in remodeling and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer. These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29029005>Biopsy-derived Intestinal Epithelial Cell Cultures for Pathway-based Stratification of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress was shown to be pivotal in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite progress in inflammatory bowel disease [] drug development, not more than one-third of patients achieve steroid-free remission and mucosal healing with current therapies. Furthermore, patient stratification tools for therapy selection are lacking. We aimed to identify and quantify epithelial ER stress in a patient-specific manner in an attempt towards personalised therapy.A biopsy-derived intestinal epithelial cell culture system was developed and characterised. ER stress was induced by thapsigargin and quantified with a BiP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] of cell lysates from 35 patients with known genotypes, who were grouped based on the number of -associated ER stress and autophagy risk alleles.The epithelial character of the cells was confirmed by E-cadherin, ZO-1, and MUC2 staining and CK-18, CK-20, and LGR5 gene expression. Patients with three risk alleles had higher median epithelial BiP-induction [vs untreated] levels compared with patients with one or two risk alleles [p = 0.026 and 0.043, respectively]. When autophagy risk alleles were included and patients were stratified in genetic risk quartiles, patients in Q2, Q3, and Q4 had significantly higher ER stress [BiP] when compared with Q1 [p = 0.034, 0.040, and 0.034, respectively].We developed and validated an ex vivo intestinal epithelial cell culture system and showed that patients with more ER stress and autophagy risk alleles have augmented epithelial ER stress responses. We thus presented a personalised approach whereby patient-specific defects can be identified, which in turn could help in selecting tailored therapies.Copyright © 2017 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Identification of novel, noninvasive, diagnostic biomarkers remains a priority. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of fecal amino acid composition as diagnostic biomarker for pediatric .In this case-control study, treatment-naïve, de novo pediatric patients with  from two tertiary centers were included. Endoscopic severity of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) was based on physician global assessment scores, substantiated by levels of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein at study inclusion. Patients were instructed to collect a fecal sample prior to bowel cleansing. Healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from primary schools in the same region. Dedicated amino acid analysis was performed on all samples.Significant differences between 30  patients (15 UC, 15 CD) and 15 age and sex-matched HCs were found in six amino acids (histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, , and valine; all area under the curve >0.75 and P < 0.005), displaying higher levels in . When distributing the patients according to type of , a similar spectrum of amino acids differed between UC and HC (histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and serine), whereas three amino acids were different between CD and HC (histidine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine).Significantly increased levels of six different fecal amino acids were found in patients with  compared to controls.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease () or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and  derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. , CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and microbiota-relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593888>The nitroxide 4-methoxy-tempo inhibits the pathogenesis of dextran sodium sulfate-stimulated experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic condition characterised by leukocyte recruitment to the gut mucosa. Leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO) produces the two-electron oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), damaging tissue and playing a role in cellular recruitment, thereby exacerbating gut injury. We tested whether the MPO-inhibitor, 4-Methoxy-TEMPO (MetT), ameliorates experimental . Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 3% w/v dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS) in drinking water ad libitum over 9-days with MetT (15 mg/kg; via i. p. injection) or vehicle control (10% v/v DMSO+90% v/v phosphate buffered saline) administered twice daily during DSS challenge. MetT attenuated body-weight loss (50%, p < 0.05, n = 6), improved clinical score (53%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and inhibited serum lipid peroxidation. Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro--; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular weight thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental , likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

Chronic or recurrent inflammation is generally regarded to be a necessary precondition for the initiation of intestinal fibrosis. In this view, fibrosis is a pathologically augmented healing response to inflammation-induced mucosal tissue destruction and injury. At present, there are no approved or effective medical therapies aimed specifically at fibrosis or stricture in . Indirect benefits may occur from anti-inflammatory therapies, although there is no consensus on this. Therapy for fibrosis is complicated by the fact that a wound-healing response is essential in CD and ulcerative colitis. Several pharmaceutical companies are now working on the therapy of fibrosis in other diseases. Strategies interfering with TGF-β expression and activation are promising. Pirfenidone has been studied in several clinical trials. Further therapeutic options are second-generation and wide-spectrum  kinase inhibitors. These inhibit growth factor receptor signaling, thus reducing fibrosis in animal models and some patients with tumor-associated fibrosis. At present, the development of antifibrotic therapies takes place in other diseases such as lung and liver fibrosis. This is partially due to a lack of experimental models for gut fibrosis and the fact that reliable readouts (MRI, serum markers) in patients are lacking. It will be important to test the above-mentioned newly available treatment strategies in  to profit from progress in other fibrotic diseases.© 2014 S.

Quinpirole decreased colonic vascular permeability (p < 0.001) via downregulation of c-Src and Akt phosphorylation. Cabergoline (5 µg/100 g) reduced vascular permeability but did not affect angiogenesis and improved signs of iodoacetamide-induced UC in rats (p < 0.05).Treatment with D2R agonists decreased the severity of UC in two animal models, in part, by attenuation of enhanced vascular permeability and prevention of excessive vascular leakage.

Sulfasalazine is converted by gut bacteria into sulfapyridine and the clinically active metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), and its efficacy is proportional to the 5-ASA concentration within the intestinal lumen. Renal complications are commonly reported for the chemically similar 5-ASA derivative mesalamine, but are not well-known side effects of sulfasalazine therapy. We report a 72-year-old patient with Crohn's disease managed with sulfasalazine for more than 10 years who presented with severe acute kidney injury (serum creatinine, 9.7mg/dL). Renal ultrasound revealed calculi and he subsequently spontaneously voided innumerable stones, which were composed of sulfasalazine metabolites. His renal calculi cleared and serum creatinine concentration improved to 3.1mg/dL after discontinuing sulfasalazine therapy and intravenous fluid hydration. His kidney function eventually returned to baseline. This case demonstrates that renal complications, in particular nephrolithiasis, may be an under-reported but potentially serious phenomenon in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with sulfasalazine and that their hydration status may play an important role in this process.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Anorectal malignant melanoma is often misdiagnosed as either hemorrhoids or benign anorectal conditions in inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the overall prognosis and survival of  are poor. To date, the best treatment strategy remains controversial. Only early diagnosis and complete excision yield survival benefit. Here, we report a 64-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis, who was found to have anal malignant melanoma on routine colonoscopy. The lesion was confined to the mucosa with no distant metastasis. She underwent complete trans-anal excision. There was no recurrence at the four-year follow-up. Physicians should be aware of increased risk of cancer development in  patients and remember the importance of meticulous inspection of the anal canal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29965986>The presence of genetic risk variants within PTPN2 and PTPN22 is associated with intestinal microbiota alterations in Swiss  cohort patients.</a></h2><p>Genetic risk factors, intestinal microbiota and a dysregulated immune system contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (). We have previously demonstrated that dysfunction of protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 contributes to alterations of intestinal microbiota and the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo. Here, we investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal microbiota composition in  patients.Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2 (rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq R package and MaAsLin pipeline.In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients. Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with severe disease course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild disease. In UC patients with severe disease, relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2 and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with PTPN2 variant genotype.We identified that -associated genetic risk variants, disease severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant alterations in intestinal microbiota composition of  patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510991>Disruption of FOXP3-EZH2 Interaction Represents a Pathobiological Mechanism in Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) regulatory T cell (Treg) dysfunction is associated with autoimmune diseases; however, the mechanisms responsible for inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a physical interaction between transcription factor FOXP3 and the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is essential for gene co-repressive function.Human FOXP3 mutations clinically relevant to intestinal inflammation were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. T lymphocytes were isolated from mice, human blood, and lamina propria of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and non-CD controls. We performed proximity ligation or a co-immunoprecipitation assay in FOXP3-mutant, interleukin 6 (IL6)-treated or CD-CD4 T cells to assess FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction. We studied  promoter activity and chromatin state of the interferon γ locus via luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, in cells expressing FOXP3 mutants.EZH2 binding was abrogated by inflammatory bowel disease-associated FOXP3 cysteine 232 (C232) mutation. The C232 mutant showed impaired repression of  and diminished EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 on interferon γ, indicative of compromised Treg physiologic function. Generalizing this mechanism, IL6 impaired FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. IL6-induced effects were reversed by Janus kinase 1/2 inhibition. In lamina propria-derived CD4T cells from CD patients, we observed decreased FOXP3-EZH2 interaction.FOXP3-C232 mutation disrupts EZH2 recruitment and gene co-repressive function. The proinflammatory cytokine IL6 abrogates FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. Studies in lesion-derived CD4 T cells have shown that reduced FOXP3-EZH2 interaction is a molecular feature of CD patients. Destabilized FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction via diverse mechanisms and consequent Treg abnormality may drive gastrointestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107248>Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 modulates colitis in a microbiota-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota is crucial for our health, and well-balanced interactions between the host's immune system and the microbiota are essential to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation, as observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (). A variant in protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is associated with reduced risk of developing , but promotes the onset of autoimmune disorders. While the role of PTPN22 in modulating molecular pathways involved in  pathogenesis is well studied, its impact on shaping the intestinal microbiota has not been addressed in depth. Here, we demonstrate that mice carrying the PTPN22 variant (619W mice) were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, but suffered from pronounced inflammation upon chronic DSS treatment. The basal microbiota composition was distinct between genotypes, and DSS-induced dysbiosis was milder in 619W mice than in WT littermates. Transfer of microbiota from 619W mice after the first DSS cycle into treatment-naive 619W mice promoted colitis, indicating that changes in microbial composition enhanced chronic colitis in those animals. This indicates that presence of the PTPN22 variant affects intestinal inflammation by modulating the host's response to the intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28124082>Novel compound heterozygous mutations in ZAP70 in a Chinese patient with leaky severe combined immunodeficiency disorder.</a></h2><p>In humans, the complete lack of  kinase ZAP70 function results in combined immunodeficiency (CID), with abnormal thymic development and defective T cell receptor (TCR) signaling of peripheral T cells, characterized by the selective absence of CD8 T cells. So far, 15 unique ZAP70 mutations have been identified in approximately 20 patients with CID, with variable clinical presentations. Herein, we report the first case from China of novel compound heterozygous mutations in ZAP70 (c.598-599delCT, p.L200fsX28; c.847 C>T, R283H). The patient suffered from early-onset and recurrent infections, but showed normal growth and development without signs of failure to thrive, thus presenting as leaky SCID. The patient also had clinical manifestations of autoimmunity, such as eczematous skin lesion, inflammatory bowel disease (), and intractable diarrhea, suggesting compromised T cell tolerogenic functions. Residual ZAP70 expression was identified. Immunological analysis revealed the selective absence of CD8 T cells in the periphery and the presence of CD4 T cells that failed to respond to phytohemagglutinin. Stimulation with lectin from pokeweed mitogen also failed to stimulate B cell proliferation in the patient. The frequency of Tfhs and Tregs in the patient was lower compared with the normal reference. Compared with the age-matched healthy control, the level of IL-17 was higher and the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-21 were lower. Infants with selected CD8 deficiency and severe autoimmune disorders or exaggerated inflammation should be screened for ZAP70 deficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621465>Selective Tyk2 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents: a patent review (2015-2018).</a></h2><p> kinase 2 (Tyk2) is a non-receptor -protein kinase, an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the TYK2 gene. Tyk2, together with three other family subtypes, namely, Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3, belong to the JAK family. Before 2014, far more publications and patents appeared in public domain attributing to the development of selective Jak2 and Jak3 inhibitors than those for selective Tyk2 and Jak1 inhibitors.This review sought to give an overview of patents related to small molecule selective Tyk2 inhibitors published from 2015 to 2018. The article also covers clinical activities of small molecule selective Tyk2 inhibitors in recent years.As a key component of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Tyk2 regulates INFα, IL12, and IL23. Selective inhibition of Tyk2 can provide pharmacological benefits in the treatment of many diseases such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cancer, and diabetes. The selectivity against other Jak family subtypes (such as Jak2) is crucial in order to minimize the potential side effects and to maximize the desired pharmacological effects. In this context, this review of recent selective Tyk2 inhibitor patents may prove valid, interesting, and promising within the therapeutic paradigm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560787>A role for interleukin 17A in -related neuroplasticity.</a></h2><p>Changes to the structure and function of the innervation of the gut contribute to symptom generation in inflammatory bowel diseases (). However, delineation of the mechanisms of these effects has proven difficult. Previous work on sympathetic neurons identified interleukin (IL)-17A as a novel neurotrophic cytokine. Since IL-17A is involved in  pathogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that IL-17A contributes to neuroanatomical remodeling during .Immunohistochemistry for  hydroxylase was used to identify sympathetic axons in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and controls. Axon outgrowth from sympathetic neurons in response to incubation in cytokines or endoscopic patient biopsy supernatants was quantified.DSS-induced colitis led to an increase in  hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the inflamed colon but not the spleen. Colonic supernatants from mice with colitis and biopsy supernatants from Crohn's disease patients increased axon outgrowth from mouse sympathetic neurons compared to supernatants from uninflamed controls. An antibody that neutralized IL-17A blocked the ability of DSS-induced colitis and Crohn's disease supernatants to induce axon extension.These findings identify IL-17A as a potential mediator of neuroanatomical remodeling of the gut innervation during .© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27926694>Involvement of Activated Cdc42 Kinase1 in Colitis and Colorectal Neoplasms.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Activated Cdc42 kinase1 (ACK1) is a non-receptor  kinase which is critical for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Genomic amplification of ACK1 has been reported in multiple human cancers. We aimed to investigate ACK1 protein expression in colorectal mucosa with inflammation and neoplasm, and to evaluate its correlation with disease activity and severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 250 individuals who underwent total colonoscopy were collected randomly from January 2007 to May 2013 in Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China. Colorectal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained by endoscopy from 78 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 22 with Crohn's disease (CD), 20 with infectious colitis, 26 with non- and noninfectious colitis, 16 with sporadic adenomas, 4 with dysplasia-associated lesions or masses, 10 with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), 4 with UC-related CRC, 10 with hyperplastic polyps, and 60 without colonic abnormalities. ACK1 protein levels were determined immunohistochemically. The correlations of ACK1 expression with disease activity and severity were also evaluated. RESULTS Significantly increased ACK1 expression was observed in epithelial cells of colorectal mucosa with inflammation and dysplasia compared to controls (P<0.05). ACK1 expression correlated with clinical activity in  (χ²=4.57, P=0.033 for UC; χ²=5.68, P=0.017 for CD), as well as grade of dysplasia in preneoplastic lesions (P<0.05). No significant differences in ACK1 expression were found between UC and CD, or between  and non- conditions (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS ACK1 protein is increased extensively in colitis and colorectal dysplasia. ACK1 overexpression may play a role in colorectal inflammation and neoplasms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321331>An Increased Abundance of Clostridiaceae Characterizes Arthritis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cross-sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of heterogeneous inflammatory conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Although there is considerable evidence linking the gut microbiota to intestinal inflammation, there is limited knowledge on its potential role in the development of extraintestinal manifestations of .Four groups of patients were included: -associated arthropathy (-A);  without arthropathy (-N); rheumatoid arthritis (RA); and non-, nonarthritis controls. DNA from stool samples was isolated and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Paired-end reads were quality-controlled using SHI7 and processed with SHOGUN. Abundance and diversity analyses were performed using QIIME, and compositional biomarker identification was performed using LEfSe.One hundred eighty patients were included in the analysis. -A was associated with an increased abundance of microbial  degradation pathways when compared with -N (P = 0.02), whereas -A and RA patients both shared an increased abundance of Clostridiaceae when compared with controls (P = 0.045). We found that history of bowel surgery was a significant source of variability (P = 0.001) among all  patients and was associated with decreased alpha diversity and increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.004).An increased abundance of gut microbial  degradation pathways was associated with -A. An increased abundance of Clostridiaceae was shared by both -A and RA patients and suggests a potentially common microbial link for inflammatory arthritis. The increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, previously reported in , may be due to the effects of previous bowel surgery and highlights the importance of controlling for this variable in future studies.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In this study, we investigated the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC since gankyrin is overexpressed in sporadic colorectal cancers. We analyzed gene expression of colon tissues obtained from 344 patients with  and CAC and found that expression of gankyrin was much higher in colonic mucosa of patients with refractory  than in those with  in remission. Expression of gankyrin was upregulated in inflammatory cells as well as tumor cells in colonic mucosa of patients with CAC. Over-expressing studies utilizing tagged ganlyrin-cDNA identified physical interaction between ganlyrin and Src homology 2-containing protein  phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). Importantly, the interaction between ganlyrin and SHP-1 leads to inhibition of STAT3 activation and to enhancement of TNF-α and IL-17 in inflammatory cells. To further address the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC, we created mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Vil-Cre;Gankyrinf/f) and deletion of gankyrin in myeloid and epithelial cells (Mx1-Cre;Gankyrinf/f). Gankyrin deficiency in myeloid cells, but not in epithelial cells, reduced the activity of mitogen activated protein kinase and the expression of stem cell markers, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. These findings provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CAC and suggest that gankyrin is a promising target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against CAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174704></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27133786>Psychological stress promotes neutrophil infiltration in colon tissue through adrenergic signaling in DSS-induced colitis model.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic intestinal inflammatory condition. Psychological stress has been postulated to affect the clinical symptoms and recurrence of . The exact molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that psychological stress promotes neutrophil infiltration into colon tissues in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. The psychological stress resulted in abnormal expression of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL2) and overactivation of the STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathway. Under chronic unpredictable stress, the adrenergic nervous system was markedly activated, as the expression of  hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in bone marrow and colonic epithelium was enhanced, especially in the myenteric ganglia. The β-AR agonist isoproterenol mimicked the effects of psychological stress on neutrophilia, neutrophil infiltration, and colonic damage in DSS-induced colitis. The β1-AR/β2-AR inhibitor propranolol reduced the numbers of the neutrophils in the circulation, suppressed neutrophil infiltration into colonic tissues, and attenuated the colonic tissue damage promoted by chronic stress. Propranolol also abolished stress-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil chemokines. Our data reveal a close linkage between the β1-AR/β2-AR activation and neutrophil trafficking and also suggest the critical roles of adrenergic nervous system in exacerbation of inflammation and damage of colonic tissues in experimental colitis.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced  phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating -associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The aim of this study was to determine the expression profile of TAM family receptors in an inflamed colon. For this, we used a rat model of experimental colitis and also collected samples from colons of  patients. Samples were taken from both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the same colon; the total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA and microRNA expressions were monitored. We have determined that AXL is highly induced in active-inflamed colon, which is accompanied with reduced expression of AXL-regulating microRNAs. In addition, the expression of genes responsible for inducing or maintaining mesenchymal phenotype, such as SNAI1, ZEB2, VIM, MMP9, and HIF1 were all significantly induced in the active-inflamed colon of  patients while the epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1) was downregulated.

Excessive inflammasome activation results in severe inflammatory conditions, but physiological IL-1β secretion is necessary for intestinal homeostasis. Here, we have described a mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation by  phosphorylation of NLRP3 at Tyr861. We demonstrated that protein  phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22), variants in which are associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, dephosphorylates NLRP3 upon inflammasome induction, allowing efficient NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β release. In murine models, PTPN22 deficiency resulted in pronounced colitis, increased NLRP3 phosphorylation, but reduced levels of mature IL-1β. Conversely, patients with inflammatory bowel disease () that carried an autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 variant had increased IL-1β levels.

Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are critical in regulating these interactions. Multiple genetic loci are associated with , but altered functions for most, including in the rs713875 MTMR3/HORMAD2/LIF/OSM region, are unknown. We identified a previously undefined role for myotubularin-related protein 3 (MTMR3) in amplifying PRR-induced cytokine secretion in human macrophages and defined MTMR3-initiated mechanisms contributing to this amplification. MTMR3 decreased PRR-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and autophagy levels, thereby increasing PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, autocrine IL-1β secretion, NFκB signaling, and, ultimately, overall cytokine secretion. This MTMR3-mediated regulation required the N-terminal pleckstrin homology-GRAM domain and Cys413 within the phosphatase domain of MTMR3. In MTMR3-deficient macrophages, reducing the enhanced autophagy or restoring NFκB signaling rescued PRR-induced cytokines. Macrophages from rs713875 CC  risk carriers demonstrated increased MTMR3 expression and, in turn, decreased PRR-induced PtdIns3P and autophagy and increased PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, signaling, and cytokine secretion. Thus, the rs713875  risk polymorphism increases MTMR3 expression, which modulates PRR-induced outcomes, ultimately leading to enhanced PRR-induced cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26811645>Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 and inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Genome wide association studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene locus encoding protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) with the onset of inflammatory bowel disease () and other inflammatory disorders.

Although protein  kinase 6 (PTK6, also known as breast tumor kinase BRK) has been primarily studied in an oncogenic context, it was noted that PTK6 null mice exhibited significantly enhanced colonic epithelial barrier function. Considering that the inflammatory functions of PTK6 have not yet been explored, we hypothesized that cytokines responsible for mediating , such as TNFα/IFNγ, may solicit the action of PTK6 to alter barrier function. After first assessing critical mediators of TNFα/IFNγ driven epithelial barrier dysfunction, we further explored the possibility of PTK6 in this inflammatory context. In this report, we showed that PTK6 siRNA and PTK6 null young adult mouse colonic epithelial cells (YAMC) exhibited significant attenuation of TNFα/IFNγ induced barrier dysfunction as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assay and permeability assays. In addition, PTK6 null cells transfected with PTK6 cDNA displayed restored barrier dysfunction in response to TNFα/IFNγ, while the cells transfected with vector alone showed similar attenuation of barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, using subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry experiments, we found that PTK6 plays a role in FoxO1 nuclear accumulation leading to down-regulation of claudin-3, a tight junction protein. Moreover, we searched for relevant miRNA candidates putative for targeting PTK6 in order to identify and assess the impact of microRNA that target PTK6 with respect to TNFα/IFNγ induced barrier dysfunction. Subsequently, we assayed likely targets and determined their effectiveness in attenuating PTK6 expression as well as cytokine induced barrier dysfunction. Results showed that miR-93 reduced PTK6 expression and attenuated TNFα/IFNγ imposed decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), as well as excluded FoxO1 from the nucleus. Our results indicate that PTK6 may act as a novel mediator of intestinal epithelial permeability during inflammatory injury, and miR-93 may protect intestinal epithelial barrier function, at least in part, by targeting PTK6.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429852>Protein  Phosphatases: Regulators of CD4 T Cells in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatases (PTPs) play a critical role in co-ordinating the signaling networks that maintain lymphocyte homeostasis and direct lymphocyte activation. By dephosphorylating  residues, PTPs have been shown to modulate enzyme activity and both mediate and disrupt protein-protein interactions. Through these molecular mechanisms, PTPs ultimately impact lymphocyte responses to environmental cues such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as antigenic stimulation. Mouse models of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation have been shown to be exacerbated in the absence of PTPs such as PTPN2 and PTPN22. This increase in disease severity is due in part to hyper-activation of lymphocytes in the absence of PTP activity. In accordance, human PTPs have been linked to intestinal inflammation. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified several PTPs within risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease (). Therapeutically targeting PTP substrates and their associated signaling pathways, such as those implicated in CD4 T cell responses, has demonstrated clinical efficacy.

The presence of the C-allele (i.e. either CC or CT genotype) was associated with the onset of uveitis, but protected from aphthous oral ulcers in CD patients. UC patients carrying a C-allele were diagnosed at an older age but required intestinal surgery more often. The presence of the C-allele was associated with a successful treatment with anti-TNF antibodies in both CD and UC patients. patients carrying the C-allele of PTPN2 SNP rs1893217 are at greater risk for developing a severe disease course but are more likely to respond to treatment with anti-TNF antibodies. These findings demonstrate a clinical relevance of this PTPN2 risk variant in  patients.© 2016 S.

IL-10RA deficiency is one of the major causal mutations in VEO-. Here, we aimed to identify the causal mutation associated with severe  in a 1-year-old patient, validate the pathogenicity of the mutation, and characterize the mutant protein.To identify the causal mutation, targeted exome sequencing (ES) was performed using the genomic DNA from the patient. To validate the pathogenicity, IL-10RA functional tests were performed using the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, flow cytometry analysis, confocal microscopy on overexpressed green fluorescent protein-fused mutants, and computational analysis on the structures of IL-10RA proteins were performed.We identified a novel compound heterozygote mutation p.[Tyr91Cys];[Pro146Alafs*40] in the IL10RA gene of the patient. The missense variant p.Tyr91Cys was previously identified but not functionally tested, and a frameshift variant, p.Pro146Alafs*40, is novel and nonfunctional. PBMCs from the patient showed defective signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. The p.Tyr91Cys mutant protein failed to properly localize on the plasma membrane. The p.Tyr91Cys mutation seems to disrupt the hydrophobic core structure surrounding the  91 residue, causing structural instability.Targeted ES and linkage analysis identified novel compound heterozygous mutations p.[Tyr91Cys];[Pro146Alafs*40] in the IL10RA gene of a child with severe VEO-. p.Tyr91Cys proteins were functionally defective in IL-10RA signaling and failed to properly localize on the plasma membrane, probably due to its structural instability.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Diverse expression between CSF-1 and IL-34, suggest that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. Receptor-type protein- phosphatase ζ (PTPRZ1, RPTP-ζ), an additional IL-34 receptor, was recently identified. Here, we aimed to assess PTPRZ1 expression in  and non- intestinal biopsies. Further, we aimed to investigate cellular PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R expression, and cytokine- and chemokine responses by IL-34 and CSF-1. The expression of PTPRZ1 was higher in non- colon compared to ileum. PTPRZ1 expression was not altered with inflammation in , however, correlated to IL34, CSF1, and CSF1R. The expression patterns of PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R differed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cell line. PBMCs and monocytes of the same donors responded differently to IL-34 and CSF-1 with altered expression of tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, interferon γ (IFN-γ), IL-13, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. This study shows that PTPRZ1 was expressed in bowel tissue. Furthermore, CSF-1R protein was detected in an intestinal epithelial cell line and donor dependently in primary PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages, and first hints also suggest an expression in these cells for PTPRZ1, which may mediate IL-34 and CSF-1 actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384859>The PTPN22 C1858T (R620W) functional polymorphism in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>In view of the discrepant data regarding the association between the protein  phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) rs2476601 (R620W, 1858C→T) polymorphism and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (), we investigated whether this functional single-nucleotide polymorphism influences  risk in a group of Moroccan patients.This is the first report on the prevalence of PTPN22 (R620W) variant in a Moroccan cohort. No evidence of statistically significant differences was observed when the PTPN22 (R620W) allele and genotype distribution among , Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and healthy controls were compared. The frequency of the variant allele in healthy subjects was 1.77% compared to 2.56% in the  patients and 1.85% in CD patients. Furthermore, the frequency of this allele was increased in UC patients compared to controls (4.17% vs. 1.77%, OR = 2.42, 95% CI 0.82-7.08; P = 0.09), but the difference was not statistically significant.

A recent study demonstrated that PTPN2 regulates ER stress signalling in pancreatic β-cells. Therefore, we investigated whether PTPN2 regulates ER stress pathways, apoptosis and cytokine secretion in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and monocytes.THP-1 and HT-29 IECs were stimulated with 2 µg/ml tunicamycin (TNM) for the indicated periods of time. For knockdown experiments, cells were transfected using a mixture of three different PTPN2-specific siRNA oligonucleotides. Cell lysates were analysed by Western blot and real-time PCR. Cytokine secretion was studied by ELISA measurements of cell culture supernatant.TNM treatment reduced PTPN2 protein levels in HT-29 IECs and THP-1 monocytes. Knockdown of PTPN2 in THP-1 monocytes led to an exaggerated induction of phospho-eIF2α, enhanced PARP cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, and attenuated IL-8 and TNF secretion upon TNM stimulation. In HT-29 cells PTPN2 deficiency caused reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α and PARP cleavage under ER stress conditions.Whereas the knockdown of PTPN2 made THP-1 cells more susceptible to ER stress, PTPN2 deficiency reduced ER stress responses in HT-29 IECs. This suggests that PTPN2 regulates adaptation to ER stress in a cell type-specific manner.© 2015 S.

Free AAs were identified applying Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry in plasma. Medical-dietary history, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Harvey-Bradshaw Index, Partial Mayo Score, biochemical, faecal and blood inflammatory markers were assessed. Primary endpoint was the clinical relapse rate at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included variations in free AAs, inflammatory biomarkers and quality of life.

Inflammatory markers had not a significantly different change between the two groups, even serum IL-6, faecal calprotectin and faecal lactoferrin increased only in the placebo group. Although Mastiha was not proven superior to placebo in remission rate (17.6% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.549), attenuation in increase of free AAs levels in verum group is reported.Mastiha inhibited an increase in plasma free AAs seen in patients with quiescent .

The present study identifies high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a key mediator of intestinal inflammation in NAFLD and outlines a detailed redox signaling mechanism for such a pathway. NAFLD mice showed liver damage and release of elevated HMGB1 in systemic circulation and increased intestinal  nitration that was dependent on NADPH oxidase. Intestines from NAFLD mice showed higher Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, an outcome strongly dependent on the existence of NAFLD pathology and NADPH oxidase. Mechanistically intestinal epithelial cells showed the HMGB1 activation of TLR-4 was both NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite dependent with the latter being formed by the activation of NADPH oxidase. Proinflammatory cytokine production was significantly blocked by the specific peroxynitrite scavenger phenyl boronic acid (FBA), AKT inhibition and NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin suggesting NADPH oxidase-dependent peroxynitrite is a key mediator in TLR-4 activation and cytokine release via an AKT dependent pathway. Studies to ascertain the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated NADPH oxidase activation showed a distinct role of Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) as the use of inhibitors targeted against RAGE or use of deformed HMGB1 protein prevented NADPH oxidase activation, peroxynitrite formation, TLR4 activation and finally cytokine release. Thus, in conclusion the present study identifies a novel role of HMGB1 mediated inflammatory pathway that is RAGE and redox signaling dependent and helps promote ectopic intestinal inflammation in NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Many components in the IL-22-pSTAT3 pathway have been identified as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease () and some of them are considered as promising therapeutic targets. However, new perspectives are still needed to understand IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling for effective clinical interventions in  patients. Here, we revealed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), recently identified to be upregulated in patients with active , as a crucial player in the epithelial IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling cascade. We found ATF3 is central to intestinal homeostasis and provides protection during colitis. Loss of ATF3 led to decreased crypt numbers, more shortened colon length, impaired ileal fucosylation at the steady state, and lethal disease activity during DSS-induced colitis which can be effectively ameliorated by rectal transplantation of wild-type colonic organoids. Epithelial stem cells and Paneth cells form a niche to orchestrate epithelial regeneration and host-microbe interactions, and IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling is a key guardian for this niche. We found ATF3 is critical for niche maintenance as ATF3 deficiency caused compromised stem cell growth and regeneration, as well as Paneth cell degeneration and loss of anti-microbial peptide (AMP)-producing granules, indicative of malfunction of Paneth/stem cell network. Mechanistically, we found IL-22 upregulates ATF3, which is required to relay IL-22 signaling leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent AMP induction. Intriguingly, ATF3 itself does not act on STAT3 directly, instead ATF3 regulates pSTAT3 by negatively targeting protein  phosphatases (PTPs) including SHP2 and PTP-Meg2. Furthermore, we identified ATF3 is also involved in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in T cells and loss of ATF3 leads to reduced capacity of Th17 cells to produce their signature cytokine IL-22 and IL-17A. Collectively, our results suggest that via IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling in the epithelium and IL-6-pSTAT3 signaling in Th17 cells, ATF3 mediates a cross-regulation in the barrier to maintain mucosal homeostasis and immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28545409>Genetic variation and expression levels of tight junction genes identifies association between MAGI3 and inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is associated with increased intestinal permeability, which involves paracellular passage regulated through tight junctions (TJ).

IL-10-deficient mice and patients with mutations in IL-10 or its receptor, IL-10R, show increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (). Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) controls immune cell activation and the equilibrium between regulatory and effector T cells, playing an important role in controlling immune homoeostasis of the gut. Here, we examined the role of PTPN22 in intestinal inflammation of IL-10-deficient (IL-10 ) mice. We crossed IL-10 mice with PTPN22 mice to generate PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice and induced colitis with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In line with previous reports, DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis was exacerbated in IL-10 mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. However, PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice developed milder disease compared to IL-10 mice. IL-17-promoting innate cytokines and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells were markedly increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but did not provide a protctive function. CXCL1/KC was also increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but therapeutic injection of CXCL1/KC in IL-10 mice did not ameliorate colitis.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in  patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells.

Galectin mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and qPCR using specific primers for individual galectins. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to analyze galectin expression in individual intestinal samples. Expression of common mucosal-associated galectins (Gal-1, -3, -4, -9) is dysregulated in inflamed tissues of  patients compared with non-inflamed  or control samples. LDA discriminated between different inflammation grades in active  and showed that remission  samples were clusterized with control samples. Galectin profiling could not distinguish CD and UC. Furthermore, inflamed  was discriminated from inflamed tissue of rejected gut in transplanted patients and duodenum of celiac patients, which could not be distinguished from control duodenum samples.
