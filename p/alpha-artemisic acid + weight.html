However, existing thermoviscosifying polymers have complicated synthesis processes and high costs, and both of them restrict the wide practical applications of thermoviscosifying polymers. Although polyethers have the characteristics of thermal gelatinization, they just display thermoviscosifying behaviors only under extremely high concentrations (>15 wt %). Therefore, the graft copolymerization of the commercialized Pluronic F127 (PEO-PPO-PEO) with acrylamide and 2-acrylamide-methylpropionic  sodium salt was studied here. A series of graft modified polyether polymers were prepared and it was expected to get thermoviscosifying polymers with high molecular  and low association temperatures. Several factors on thermoviscosifying behaviors were investigated, such as polymerization condition, polymer concentration, hydrophilic monomer, molecular structure and molecular . It was also proven that the apparent viscosity of polymer solution is influenced by polymer concentration, molecular  of polymer, and content of anion groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal microbiota.</a></h2><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty  in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in  gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty . The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635360>Effect of Age and Weaning on Growth Performance, Rumen Fermentation, and Serum Parameters in Lambs Fed Starter with Limited Ewe-Lamb Interaction.</a></h2><p>Sixty neonatal Hu lambs were weaned at either 21 (n = 30) (early weaning, EW) or 49 days (n = 30) of age (control, CON). The starter intake and  (BW) of lambs was recorded weekly from birth to 63 days of age. Diarrhea rate of lambs was measured from birth to 35 days. Six randomly selected lambs from each treatment were slaughtered at 26, 35, and 63 days of age, respectively. Ruminal pH, NH-N, and volatile fatty  (VFA) concentration, as well as serum parameters including immunity, antioxidant status, and inflammatory parameters from randomly selected lambs from each treatment were measured. There was no difference in BW at birth and day 21 between the two groups of lambs ( > 0.05). However, BW of the lambs in the EW group was significantly lower than those in the CON group ( < 0.01) from 28 to 49 days of age. Average daily gain (ADG) of the lambs in the EW group was significantly lower than those in the CON group ( < 0.01) at three weeks after early weaning. Starter intake of the lambs in the EW group was obviously higher than that in the CON group ( < 0.01) from day 28 to 49. In addition, the diarrhea rate was significantly higher than that in the CON group from day 5 to 14 after weaning ( < 0.01). The EW group had heavier carcasses ( < 0.01) and rumen relative to whole stomach  ( < 0.01). Rumen pH was increased by age ( < 0.01) and was not affected by early weaning ( > 0.05). Early weaning decreased abomasum relative to whole stomach  ( < 0.01) and increased total VFA concentrations ( < 0.01) at day 26. There was no difference in lambs' immunity and stress indicators ( > 0.05). The results indicated that lambs weaned at 21 days of age had decreased ADG and higher diarrhea rate, although the overall immunity was not compromised. Long-term study is needed to further validate the feasibility of early weaning strategy in lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667778>Elevated salivary uric  levels among adolescents with eating disorders.</a></h2><p>Uric  (UA) is increasingly recognized as having important physiological roles and associated with several peripheral and central pathophysiological outcomes, and might play a role in eating disorders (ED) pathogenesis. We investigated whether UA levels are altered among adolescents with ED.Morning salivary UA concentrations were compared between adolescents referred to treatment at the Herman Dana Center receiving a DSM-V diagnosis of an ED and matched healthy controls.Salivary UA was significantly elevated among ED compared with control values (ED mean 3.9 ± 1.2 mg/dl, control mean 2.9 ± 1.9 mg/dl, t = - 3.13 df = 81, p = 0.003).Salivary UA is elevated among adolescents with ED.

Adult-male SD rats (n=40) were equally divided into group 1 (sham-operated control), group 2 (ICH), group 3 (ICH + hyaluronic  (HA)/intracranial injection at 3 h after ICH), group 4 [ICH + HA + iPSC-MSC (1.2 × 10 cells/intracranial injection at 3 h after ICH)] and euthanized by day 28 after ICH procedure. In vitro study showed that hemorrhagic-brain tissue augmented protein expressions of inflammation (HMGB1/MyD88/TLR-4/TLR-2/NF-κB/TNF-α/iNOS/IL-1β) in cultured neurons that were significantly inhibited by iPSC-MSC treatment (all P<0.001). By days 7 and 14 after ICH procedure, circulating inflammatory levels of TNF-α/IL-6/MPO expressed were lowest in group 1, highest in group 2 and significantly lower in group 4 than in group 3 (all P<0.0001). By day 14 after ICH procedure, neurological function and BIV expressed an opposite pattern, whereas protein expressions of inflammation (HMGB1/MyD88/TLR-4/TLR-2/NF-κB/I-kB/TNF-α/iNOS/IL-1β/MMP-9), oxidative stress (NOX-1/NOX-2/oxidized protein) and apoptosis (mitochondrial-Bax/cleaved-caspase-2/PARP) in brain exhibited an identical pattern to circulating inflammation among the four groups (all P<0.001). Microscopy demonstrated that the number of vascular remodeling and GFAP+/53BP1+/γ-H2AX+ cells displayed an identical pattern of inflammation, whereas the NeuN+ cells displayed an opposite pattern of inflammation among the four groups (all P<0.001). In conclusion, iPSC-MSC therapy markedly reduced BIV and preserved neurological function mainly by inhibiting inflammatory/oxidative-stress generation.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629370>Phytochemical identification from Lithocarpus polystachyus by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS and its protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and α-glucosidase activities.</a></h2><p>Lithocarpus polystachyus leaves have become popular healthful tea due to its antidiabetic activity. In the present study, the phytochemical profiles were achieved by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS in both positive and negative ion modes. A total of 17 compounds were tentatively characterized and identified by means of accurate mass and characteristic fragment ions. Total phenolic contents ranged from 9.0 to 13.4 g gallic  equivalents (GAE)/100g of dry . In addition, α-glucosidase and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitory activities were evaluated. The L. polystachyus extracts significantly showed the α-glucosidase inhibition rate more than 88.1% at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL. The acarbose was 93.6% at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The PTP1B inhibition rate showed more than 84.3%. The antioxidant capacities were determined using DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP ranged from 50.5 to 72.5 g trolox, from 43.2 to 77.7 g trolox, and from 5.0 to 10.6 g BHT (equaling trolox or BHT per 100 g of dry ), respectively. L. polystachyus could be considered as functional food for antidiabetic and antioxidative activities, due to its rich phenolic and dihydrochalcone contents.This article is protected by copyright.

Among multiple risk factors, host intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention in T2D etiology and progression. In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut microbiota population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in ,  composition, or food intake between groups. These findings suggest that FFP induced gut microbiota modifications in ZDF rats that improved glucose metabolism and protected from T2D development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659708>Glycyrrhizic  modulates the atrazine-induced apoptosis in rabbit spleen.</a></h2><p>Atrazine (ATR) is a common herbicide used worldwide. It is a potent endocrine disruptor that causes hormonal imbalance. We investigated the modulatory role predisposed by glycyrrhizic  (GA) against the hazardous effects caused by the ATR in the rabbit spleen. Sixty rabbits were assigned into 4 groups. The first group is the negative control; the ATR group received 1/10 of the oral LD  ATR; the GA group received 50 mg/kg  daily intraproteinally; and group 4 received both ATR and GA concurrently. ATR and GA administrations were done for 60 days. ATR-induced humoral immunotoxicity was illustrated by decreased serum total protein, albumin, and globulin levels and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus antibody titer, 4 weeks after vaccination. Moreover, upregulation of spleen Fas and caspase-III genes was recorded in ATR-exposed rabbits. Clear splenocyte apoptosis was observed in the immunohistochemical examination by the caspase-III technique. GA diminished the ATR-induced splenocyte apoptosis through downregulation of Fas and caspase-III expressions. In conclusion, our findings bounced a new perspective into the mechanism by which ATR induces immunotoxicity and assumed the potential modulatory role of GA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618998>Multi-Step Enzymatic Synthesis of 1,9-Nonanedioic  from a Renewable Fatty  and Its Application for the Enzymatic Production of Biopolyesters.</a></h2><p>1,9-Nonanedioic  is one of the valuable building blocks for producing polyesters and polyamides. Thereby, whole-cell biosynthesis of 1,9-nonanedioic  from oleic  has been investigated. A recombinant , expressing the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases (ChnDE) of  sp.

Sixteen target PFCs, including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic  (PFCAs, C-C, C, and C) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic  (PFSAs, C, C, C, and C), were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-negative electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS). Concentrations of total PFCs (∑PFCs) ranged from 2.19 to 98.5 μg kg (dry , dw), with an average of 5.97 μg kg dw. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFC, accounting for 23.9% of ∑PFCs. The highest ∑PFCs was found in the soil sample collected from Dongguan with a large number of manufacturing industries. There were no significant differences of ∑PFCs among unban, industrial, and agricultural soils, indicating similar pollution sources in soil of the PRD. More than 70% of ∑PFCs in soil of the PRD could be attributed to the four principal components, represented by PFOS and perfluorooctanoic  (PFOA), perfluoropentanoic  (PFPeA) and perfluorohexanoic  (PFHxA), perfluorodecanoic  (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic  (PFUdA). Ecological risk assessment indicated that PFOA had low risk to soil plants and animals.

The rats were orally treated with different doses (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of C. mas 80% methanol extract for 14 days. Increase in , consumed amount of feed, form of the stool, presence of rectal prolapse were followed every day. At the end of the experiment, colon tissues were removed and wet  for each animal were measured and colon damages were scored. Total antioxidant and total oxidant status, cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) and protein levels of colon tissues were evaluated and histopathological analyses were carried out. After the detection of the effective dose as 400 mg/kg, the aqueous methanol extract was fractionated by using liquid-liquid fractionation technique and the sub-extracts were also tested for in vivo biological activities. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses were conducted to determine the phytochemical profile of the active crude extract and n-butanol sub-extract.Amount of feed consumed per day and increase in  were the lowest in the control group, while those values were determined to be the highest in 80% methanol extract (at 400 mg/kg dose), n-butanol sub-extract and reference groups. Following colitis induction, it was determined that the fecal form was yellow-slippery in all groups and returned to normal after the treatment with C. mas extracts. Rectal prolapse score was less in the extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract treated groups. Total antioxidant, total oxidant status, cytokine and protein levels were found to be in parallel with macroscopic findings. 80% methanol extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract provided the best healing according to the wet  measurements and colon damage scoring performed on the removed colon tissues. These findings supported the results of histopathological analysis. According to the chromatographic analysis, ellagic  was determined in both extracts and its amount was quantified.The present study has verified the ethnomedical use of C. mas for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic  bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in , colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in  mass index, , waist circumference, or visceral fat were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic  (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645121>Anti-Inflammatory Effects of  in Macrophage Cells and DSS-Induced Colitis Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>, known as sword bean, has been used as a Chinese traditional medicine for anti-inflammatory effects. However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic  as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RSBE and GSBE inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits, which correlated with the inhibitory effects on inhibitor kappa B (IB) degradation. In dextran sulfated sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice model, RSBE restored , colon length, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon- (IFN-).

Alternative treatment options include the use of large neutral amino  (LNAA). The aim of this study was to determine the Phe, tyrosine (Tyr), and Phe/Tyr ratio in a cohort of sub-optimally controlled adult patients with classical PKU treated with a new LNAA formulation. Twelve patients received a Phe-restricted diet plus a slow-release LNAA product taken three times per day, at a dose of 1 g/kg  (mean 0.8 ± 0.24 g/kg/day), over a 12-month period. The product is in a microgranulated formulation, which incorporates all amino  and uses sodium alginate as a hydrophilic carrier to prolong its release. This LNAA formulation provides up to 80% of the total protein requirement, with the rest of the protein supplied by natural food. Patients had fortnightly measurements of Phe and Tyr levels over a 12-month period after the introduction of LNAA. All patients completed the 12-month treatment period. Overall, adherence to the new LNAA tablets was very good compared with a previous amino  mixture, for which taste was a major complaint by patients. Phe levels remained unchanged ( = 0.0522), and Tyr levels increased ( = 0.0195). Consequently, the Phe/Tyr ratio decreased significantly ( < 0.05) in the majority of patients treated. In conclusion, LNAA treatment increases Tyr levels in sub-optimally controlled adult PKU patients, while offering the potential to improve their adherence to treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671870>Microbiological Insights into the Stress-Alleviating Property of an Endophytic  WR10 in Wheat under Low-Phosphorus and High-Salinity Stresses.</a></h2><p>An indole-3-acetic  producing  WR10 was previously isolated from the root of wheat (  L.). In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry  in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and energy sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Understanding the metabolic response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years,  mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole- stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue metabolism and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate metabolism). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino , tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean  mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, -bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean  mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643431>Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists.</a></h2><p>The thrombopoietin receptor agonists mimic the action of thrombopoietin on its receptor and stimulate the activation, proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes, resulting in an increase in circulating platelet counts. Thrombopoietin itself acts in this manner, but when recombinant thrombopoietins were used clinically, they were found to cause rebound thrombocytopenia, probably due to induction of anti-thrombopoietin antibodies. For this reason, direct administration of thrombopoietin was abandoned as an approach to treating thrombocytopenia and other approaches to activating the thrombopoietin receptor were sought. Several thrombopoietin receptor agonists were subsequently developed and are now in clinical use for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and for raising platelet counts in persons with thrombocytopenia undergoing surgical procedures or other thrombocytopenic conditions. Eltrombopag, lusutrombopag and avatrombopag are peptide-like, small molecular  agonists of the thrombopoietin receptor. These agents are given by mouth and result in significant increases in platelet counts in normal persons as well as patients with thrombocytopenia due to hematologic and liver diseases. Romiplostim, in contrast, is a recombinant polypeptide that binds to and activates the thrombopoietin receptor despite having no amino  homology to native thrombopoietin. It also increases platelet counts in normal subjects as well as patients with chronic ITP but has not been associated with induction of anti-thrombopoietin antibodies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636904>Dietary fibre enrichment of supplemental feed modulates the development of the intestinal tract in suckling piglets.</a></h2><p>Commercial pre-weaning diets are formulated to be highly digestible and nutrient-dense and contain low levels of dietary fibre. In contrast, pigs in a natural setting are manipulating fibre-rich plant material from a young age. Moreover, dietary fibre affects gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development and health in older pigs. We hypothesised that supplemental diets that contain vegetal fibres are accelerating GIT development in suckling piglets in terms of size and functionality. From d 2 of life, sow-suckled piglets had access to a low fibre diet (CON), a diet with a fermentable long-chain arabinoxylan (lc-AXOS), a diet with a largely non-fermentable purified cellulose (CELL), or a diet containing both fibres. During the initial 2 weeks, the control diet was a high-density milk replacer, followed by a dry and highly digestible creep meal. Upon weaning at 25 d, 15 piglets from each treatment group, identified as eaters and originating from six or seven litters, were sacrificed for post-mortem examination of GIT morphology, small intestinal permeability and metabolic profile of the digesta. The microbiota composition of the mid-colon was evaluated in a sub-set of ten piglets.No major statistical interactions between the fibre sources were observed. Piglets consumed the fibre-containing milk supplements and creep diets well. Stomach size and small intestinal permeability was not affected.

Also, CELL decreased ileal pH and tended to increase ileal DM content compared to CON ( < 0.050). Moreover, the concentration of volatile fatty  was increased in the caecum ( < 0.100) and mid-colon ( < 0.050) by addition of CELL. lc-AXOS only stimulated caecal propionate ( < 0.050). The microbiota composition showed a high individual variation and limited dietary impact. Nonetheless, CELL induced minor shifts in specific genera, with notable reductions of -.Adding dietary fibres to the supplemental diet of suckling piglets altered large intestinal morphology but not small intestinal permeability. Moreover, dietary fibre showed effects on fermentation and modest changes of microbial populations in the hindgut, with more prominent effects from the low-fermentable cellulose.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665421>Lack of association between modifiable exposures and glioma risk: A Mendelian randomisation analysis.</a></h2><p>The etiological basis of glioma is poorly understood. We have used genetic markers in a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) framework to examine if lifestyle, cardiometabolic and inflammatory factors influence the risk of glioma. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation.We identified genetic instruments for 37 potentially modifiable risk factors and evaluated their association with glioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. We used the estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined traits to infer evidence for a causal relationship with the following exposures: lifestyle and dietary factors (height, plasma IGF-1, blood carnitine, blood methionine, blood selenium, blood zinc, circulating adiponectin, circulating carotenoids, iron status, serum calcium, vitamin [A1, B12, B6, E and 25-hydroxyvitamin D], fatty  levels [mono-unsaturated, omega-3 and omega-6] and circulating fetuin-A); cardiometabolic factors (birth , HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, basal metabolic rate,  fat percentage,  mass index, fasting glucose, fasting proinsulin, HbA1C levels, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) were included; inflammatory factors (C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma IL-6 sRa and serum IgE).After correction for the testing of multiple potential risk factors and excluding associations driven by one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) no significant association with glioma risk was observed (i.e. PCorrected > 0.05).This study did not provide evidence supporting any of the 37 factors examined as having a significant influence on glioma risk.© The Author(s) 2019.

Phenotype A: androgen excess + ovulatory dysfunction + polycystic ovarian morphology. Phenotype B: androgen excess + ovulatory dysfunction. Phenotype C: androgen excess + polycystic ovarian morphology. Phenotype D: ovulatory dysfunction + polycystic ovarian morphology. All patients were given daily for six months a compound with 2 g myo-inositol, 0.5 mg L-Tyrosine, 0.2 mg folic , 55 mcg selenium, 40 mcg chromium. Hormonal assessment, BMI, Ferriman-Gallway Gallway score, HOMA index, and follicular monitoring were reported before starting the therapy, three months and six months after.Phenotype A showed an improvement, consistent with restored ovulation: more regular length of the menstrual cycle, detection of periovulatory follicle at ultrasound, and rising of progesterone in the luteal phase. A total of 45 patients (65.2%) ovulated after six months. In the same period glucose and HOMA index decreased. In the phenotype B, 80% of patients ovulated after six months. An improvement of the clinical and biochemical sign of hyperandrogenism was also reported. In the phenotype C, after BMI had followed the treatment for six months, it decreased in a statistically significant manner.

In this study, we showed that PAB significantly inhibited the viability and caspase-dependent apoptosis in HN22 cell line. PAB-induced apoptosis is through inducing death receptor 5 (DR5) together with the increase in the expression of cleaved caspase-8. It also inhibited the proliferations and induced apoptosis through DR5 in other three HNC cell lines (HSC3, Ca9.22, and HSC4).

The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased  gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue , serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPKα, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXRα), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Thus, chronic CGA and caffeine intakes may be potent for preventing obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639558>Morphological and metabolic responses to salt stress of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars which differ in salinity tolerance.</a></h2><p>Salinization is one of the most important abiotic stressors for crop growth and productivity. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), as the major food source around the world, is very sensitive to salt, especially at seedling stage. In order to examine how salt stress influences the metabolism of rice, we compared the levels of a range of sugars and organic  in three rice cultivars with different tolerance under salt stress over time. According to the morphological result, the shoot length and root fresh  were only affected by salinity in the salt sensitive cultivar (Nipponbare). The responses of metabolites to salinity were time-, tissue- and cultivar-dependent. Shikimate and quinate, involved in the shikimate pathway, were dramatically decreased in the leaves of all three cultivars, which was regarded as a response to salinity. Many sugars in the leaves of the salt tolerant cultivar (Dendang and Fatmawati) showed earlier increases to salt stress compared to Nipponbare leaves. Moreover, only in the leaves of tolerant cultivars (Dendang and Fatimawati), malate was significantly decreased while sucrose was significantly increased. In Dendang roots, mannitol levels were significantly higher than in Nipponbare roots after 14 days of salt treatment, which may be attributed to its higher salt tolerance. It is proposed that these responses in the more tolerant cultivars are involved in their resistance to high salt stress which may lay the foundation for breeding tolerant rice cultivars.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the effects on nutrient absorption and rumen function induced by excessive iron have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of over-load iron on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep. Twenty-four German Mutton Merino cross-bred sheep with  (42.66 ± 2.34 kg BW) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates and 1 sheep per replicate. The basal diet consisted of 60% Leymus chinensis hay and 40% concentrate. The sheep in 4 groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with 50 (Control), 500 (T1), 1,000 (T2) and 1,500 (T3) mg Fe/kg as ferrous sulphate monohydrate (FeSO ·H O) respectively. And the actual contents of iron in the diet were determined to be 457.68 (control), 816.42 (T1), 1,256.78 (T2) and 1,725.63 (T3) mg/kg respectively. The experiment lasted 62 days including a 7-day metabolism trial. During the whole experiment, the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and  detergent fibre showed a quadratic increase with increasing over-load iron levels (p < .05), and maximum responses were found with 500 mg/kg supplementation. However, the response of total VFA concentration showed a quadratic decrease, as did the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerate (p < .05). Serum total iron-binding capacity on day 30 showed a quadratic decrease with the increase in high-dose iron, while the serum iron content increased linearly at day 60 (p < .05). Excessive iron resulted in the change in bacterial communities. An increase in over-load iron linearly decreased the abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes (p < .05), but linearly increased the Firmicutes (p = .037) and Proteobacteria (p = .018). In addition, there was a quadratic effect (p = .003) on the Fibrobacteres, which was higher in the 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Fe-supplemented groups. At the genus level, there were quadratic effects on the abundances of Selenomonas_1 (p = .023) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p = .016). Furthermore, feeding of iron linearly increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 (p < .05). These results indicate that increasing ferrous sulphate monohydrate in diets had no negative impact on the growth performance, but it changed nutrient digestibility, blood iron parameters, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651186>Comparison of Carcass Traits, Meat Quality, and Chemical Composition of Tissues from Progeny Derived from Cloned and Noncloned Pigs.</a></h2><p>Systematic studies of progeny derived from somatic cell nuclear transferred animals in their biophysical and biochemical characters are critical in assessing the safety of this kind of food.

Schischk. (Umbelliferae) is a popular medicinal plant in East Asia, there has been no systemic toxicological evaluation of a water extract of Saposhnikoviae Radix (SRE). In this experiment, an oral acute and 13-week subchronic toxicological evaluations of SRE (500-5,000 mg/ kg ) were performed in both sexes of Crl:CD(SD) rats. Based on the results from mortality, clinical signs, effects on  and organ , clinical biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and histopathology, significant acute, 4-week repeated dose range finding (DRF) and 13-week subchronic toxicity of SRE was not observed in either sex of rats; thus, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 5,000 mg (kg/day). To identify anti-hyperuricemia potential of SRE, the suppressive effect of SRE was determined in mice challenged with potassium oxonate (PO; 250 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection for 8 days (each group; n = 7). SRE supplementation suppressed the uric  level in urine through significant xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity. Kidney dysfunctions were observed in PO-challenged mice as evidenced by an increase in serum creatinine level. Whereas, SRE supplementation suppressed it in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, SRE was safe up to 5,000 mg (kg/day) based on NOAEL found from acute and 13-week subchronic toxicological evaluations. SRE had anti-hyperuricemia effect and lowered the excessive level of uric , a potential factor for gout and kidney failure.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662982>Chlorogenic  Attenuates Kidney Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury via Reducing Inflammation, Tubular Injury, and Myofibroblast Formation.</a></h2><p>Kidney ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) involving renal function deterioration, renal architecture damage, and inflammation. This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic  (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = 5, 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3.5 (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of . Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic -Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups. CGA treatment attenuates kidney I/R injury through reducing inflammation, decreasing myofibroblast expansion, and inducing epithelial cells proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Nur Arfian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620596>The effect of thalidomide on visceral fat pad mass and triglyceride concentration of the skeletal muscles in rats.</a></h2><p> fats, especially both of abdominal fat pad mass and skeletal muscle fat content, are inversely related to insulin action.

Here, a comprehensive set of metabolic markers, predominantly lipids, was compared between depressed and nondepressed persons.Nine Dutch cohorts were included, comprising 10,145 control subjects and 5283 persons with depression, established with diagnostic interviews or questionnaires. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform provided 230 metabolite : 51 lipids, fatty , and low-molecular- metabolites; 98 lipid composition and particle concentration  of lipoprotein subclasses; and 81 lipid and fatty  ratios. For each metabolite measure, logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, fasting status, and lipid-modifying medication were performed within cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analyses.Of the 51 lipids, fatty , and low-molecular- metabolites, 21 were significantly related to depression (false discovery rate q < .05). Higher levels of apolipoprotein B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty , fatty  chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, tyrosine, and isoleucine and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, acetate, and apolipoprotein A1 were associated with increased odds of depression. Analyses of lipid composition indicators confirmed a shift toward less high-density lipoprotein and more very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride particles in depression. Associations appeared generally consistent across gender, age, and  mass index strata and across cohorts with depressive diagnoses versus symptoms.This large-scale meta-analysis indicates a clear distinctive profile of circulating lipid metabolites associated with depression, potentially opening new prevention or treatment avenues for depression and its associated cardiometabolic comorbidity.Copyright © 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

In this conversion, most of the plant materials are digested by rumen fermentation and are changed to short-chain fatty , microbial cells, and methane, which is released into the atmosphere. The relationships among feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production are poorly understood. Here we report a novel indicator of characteristics of rumen fermentation, theoretical turnover rate (TTOR) of the rumen liquid fraction. The TTOR was calculated from the presumed rumen volume (PRV) which is estimated by dividing the methane yield by the methane concentration of rumen fluid. The formula for the TTOR is: TTOR = PRV/ . Our present analyses confirm that the TTOR as an indicator is capable of connecting feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production, because dry matter intake/TTOR showed a strong correlation with milk yield/TTOR. In addition, the TTOR may be related to ruminal pH, as we observed that the ruminal pH decreased as the TTOR increased. We propose that the TTOR is a factor characterizing rumen fermentation and a good indicator of the productivity of ruminants and dysbiosis of the rumen microbiome.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated  gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667583>Effect of continuous long-term treatment for 10 years with bisphosphonate on Japanese osteoporosis patients.</a></h2><p>In terms of the balance between benefits and risks of long-term treatment with bisphosphonate, uncertainties remain regarding the optimal treatment duration.

Serum Ca value was significantly decreased after the start of treatment, and became stable within the reference range from the second year. Bone resorption markers such as uNTX and TRAP5b significantly decreased from the second year after the start of treatment and no significant changes were observed thereafter.

Poultry products contaminated with this pathogen is one of the major sources of infections in humans. Outer membrane protein C (OmpC) of Salmonella Typhimurium is a promising DNA vaccine candidate to mitigate Salmonella infection in poultry. However, the large-scale production of bioactive recombinant OmpC (rOmpC) protein is hindered due to the formation of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.

The ompC gene was optimized and fused with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) gene for high level expression as soluble protein. The fusion protein with ~58 kDa molecular  was observed on SDS-PAGE gel. The expression levels of rOmpC fusion protein reached maximum of 38% of total soluble protein (TSP) after 8 h of 0.2% rhamnose induction. Protein purification was carried out using nickel nitrilotriacetic  (Ni-NTA) purification column. Western blot were performed to analyse expression and immunoreactivity of rOmpC fusion protein.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in  gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and  response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

It involves serious clinical consequences such as diarrhea, erythematous lesions of mucosa, and eventually development of ulcers accompanied by severe pain. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the mucoprotective effects of Saikosaponin-A in 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis in mice. Mucositis was induced in BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU (50 mg/kg/day) for three consecutive days and IM was assessed by both behavioral and histochemical analysis. While, Saikosaponin-A (1, 5, 10 mg/kg/day) was administered 1 h before 5-FU injection for consecutive seven days. Pre-treatment of Saikosaponin-A significantly ameliorated the severity of mucositis reflected as food intake,  loss, severity of diarrhea and mortality rate in a dose depended manner as compared to mice treated with 5-FU. Moreover, histopathological analysis furthered reinforced the mucoprotective potential of Saikosaponin-A against 5-FU-induced intestinal abnormalities referred as villus atrophy, mitotic crypt stem cells damage, inflammatory cells infiltration, vacuolization and edema. Furthermore, Saikosaponin-A administration strongly inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, COX-2, IL-1β and IL-6) and apoptotic markers (p-JNK, Casp-3). Saikosaponin-A pre-treatment significantly reduced the production of nitric oxide in intestinal tissue, inhibited acetic -induced Evans blue vascular permeability. The Siaikosaponin-A treatment markedly enhanced the anti-oxidants enzymes (Nrf2, HO-1, SOD, GSH, GST and Catalase), while decreased the oxidative stress markers i.e. Malonaldehde. Hence, these data suggest that Saikosaponin-A maybe a potential candidate for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.Copyright © 2019.

In turn, dietary fatty  can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial : 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in liver caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the fatty  content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty  with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated  and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty  metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the  and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on.

The structural features of the isolated lignins were analyzed accordingly. All the studied pretreatments reduced the molecular  of the lignins. Aliphatic OH was reduced while phenolic OH was increased in all pretreated lignins. HSQC analysis revealed that pretreatment influenced the lignin composition and relative distribution of inter-unit linkages. The lignin S/G ratio was found to increase during DA pretreatment, while it was decreased after LHW and OS pretreatment. LHW pretreatment also resulted in much less cleavage of β-O-4 linkage than the other two pretreatments.

Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive -loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty  (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive -loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657655>Iron toxicity-induced physiological and metabolite profile variations among tolerant and sensitive rice varieties.</a></h2><p>Iron toxicity stress causes physiological and metabolic changes in rice and other plants. To date, there is little information about the metabolite profile of rice under Fe toxicity conditions. In fact, metabolite has a contribution to the physiological condition of plants. Plant metabolomics is a study of low-molecular  metabolites in plants under certain conditions. The objective of the research was to investigate physiological and metabolic changes in rice under Fe toxicity stress. Two-week-old seedlings of four rice varieties with various Fe toxicity tolerance levels were stressed hydroponically with 400 ppm FeSO7HO for 10 d. Numerous physiological characters were observed and untargeted metabolomic analysis was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). The results showed Fe toxicity induced physiological and metabolite variation in rice. By comparing the metabolites synthesized in Fe toxicity-stressed plants with control plants, it showed that elaidic , linoleic , and linolenic  could be as metabolite marker candidates for rice response to Fe toxicity stress. When plants exposed to Fe toxicity stress, elaidic  increased, whereas linoleic- and linolenic  decreased. The alteration of fatty  composition in the root and shoot suggests the alteration of metabolites is one of the tolerance strategies of rice to Fe toxicity stress. This finding offers an insight about the tolerance strategies of rice under Fe toxicity stress related to the maintenance process of the cell membranes during this stress. The genes underlying biosynthesis of the fatty  could be a target of future research on responsible genes for Fe toxicity tolerance in rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651967>Association of Metabolically Healthy Overweight Phenotype With Abnormalities of Glucose Levels and Blood Pressure Among Chinese Adults.</a></h2><p>Whether the metabolically healthy overweight (MHO) phenotype is resistant to metabolic abnormalities remains unknown.To evaluate the association of MHO with glucose level abnormalities and high blood pressure (BP) in Chinese adults.This prospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2013, to October 31, 2018, in the Health Management Center at Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai, China, using data from 55 155 recruited Chinese adults. , fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, and BP were measured annually.Metabolically healthy overweight was defined as a  mass index (calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 24.0 in 2013 (baseline) and 2014, no history of metabolic diseases, and normal FBG level, HbA1c level, BP, lipid profile, serum uric  level, and liver ultrasonographic findings at baseline; the remaining participants were defined as being metabolically healthy normal.Glucose level abnormality was confirmed if the FBG level was 101 mg/dL or greater or the HbA1c level was 5.7%, and high BP was confirmed if the systolic BP was 130 mm Hg or higher or the diastolic BP was 80 mm Hg or higher at least twice during the subsequent 4 years of follow-up.A total of 3204 metabolically healthy Chinese adults (mean [SD] age, 39.8 [10.9] years; 1940 women [60.5%]) were included in the study. The prevalence of MHO was 7.0%. A total of 146 incident cases of glucose level abnormality and 220 cases of high BP during 4 years of follow-up were identified.

The complexation of metals with DOC influences their toxicity and bioavailability in the environment. The endogenous release of metal species with heterogeneous DOC from BC is very complex; this process has been neglected and remains unaddressed in the literature to date. In this study, the yield and chemical properties of labile DOC from BC were characterized, and the release of endogenous metal/metalloid elements (K, Mg, Mn, Fe, Al, Cu, and Si) and their species from BC with various pyrolysis temperatures and particle sizes were systematically investigated under various solution chemistries. The results showed that pyrolysis temperature of BC significantly influenced the yield and composition of DOC and DOC-metal/metalloid complexes, while particle size had lower impact. The yield of BC-derived DOC significantly decreased and the components gradually changed from low-molecular  and low-aromaticity hydrophilic humic -like substances to complex high-molecular  and high-aromaticity hydrophobic substances as pyrolysis temperature increased from 200 to 700 °C. The release of total dissolved metals decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature, while the highest total dissolved Si was released from BC with the moderate pyrolysis temperature (500 °C). The metal elements were mainly released in the DOC-combined form, while the released Si was mainly in the free form in the neutral water environment. The release of DOC increased while that of dissolved metals decreased with increasing solution pH. The release of total dissolved metals/metalloids increased but the ratio of the DOC-combined metals/metalloids decreased with increasing solution ionic strength. These results provide new insight into the understanding of endogenous metal/metalloid release from BC in the natural environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650772>Effect of silicate and phosphate solubilizing rhizobacterium  GAK2 on  L. under cadmium stress.</a></h2><p>Silicon and phosphorus are elements that are beneficial for plant growth.

In our study, we aimed to assess silicate and phosphate solubilization by the bacteria  GAK2, in the presence and absence of phosphate [Ca(PO)] or silicate (MgOSi), to counteract cadmium stress in rice ( L). Our results showed that the GAK2 treated rice plants, grown in soil amended with phosphate [Ca(PO)] or silicate (MgOSi), had significantly reduced cadmium content, and enhanced plant growth promoting characteristics including fresh shoot and root , plant height, and chlorophyll content. These plants showed significant downregulation of the cadmium transporter gene, , and upregulation of the silicon carrier gene, . Moreover, jasmonic  levels were significantly reduced in the  inoculated plants, and this was further supported by the downregulation of the jasmonic  related gene, .

Herein, amorphous spray-dried dispersions (SDDs) of poly(acrylic )-polystyrene (PS--PAA) diblock copolymers with differing degrees of polymerization were prepared in aggregated and nonaggregated states with the Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class II drug, probucol (PBC). Specifically, PS--PAA, PS--PAA, PS--PAA, and PS--PAA amphiphilic block polymers that covered a compositional range in the area of oral drug delivery were prepared to examine the role of molecular  and controlled aggregation in promoting drug supersaturation and maintenance. In addition, hydrophilic homopolymers PAA, PAA, PAA, and PAA were prepared as controls to evaluate the role of the block copolymer-based SDDs in PBC solubilization. Characterization such as powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and dissolution tests under nonsink conditions were then performed to evaluate the SDDs. When comparing the block copolymer systems, polymers that were preaggregated into micellular structures prior to spray drying with the drug promoted higher drug solubility and maintenance than when the drug was formulated with molecularly dissolved PS-PAA block polymer. Interestingly, the aggregated PS--PAA SDD with 25 wt % PBC achieved 100% burst release and maintained full supersaturation of PBC at pH 6.5 (physiological pH in the small intestine). Dissolution studies conducted at the pH of the stomach (pH = 1.2) show that a minimal amount of drug (∼10 μg/mL) was released, which could be used for protecting drugs from acidic environments (stomach) before reaching the small intestine. To evaluate drug bioavailability, in vitro Caco-2 cell assays were performed, which reveal that PAA-based excipients do not hinder drug permeation across the epithelial membrane and that PS--PAA SDD with 25 wt % PBC achieved the highest membrane permeability coefficient. This work demonstrates that block copolymer-based SDDs capable of preaggregating into nanostructures may be a tunable drug-delivery platform that can improve solubility and supersaturation maintenance of Class II pharmaceutics while also not prohibiting bioavailability through model intestinal membranes.

Perampanel is a recently introduced pharmaceutical molecule with no prior reports of hair changes as a side effect. There is no clear explanation for this side effect, but it should be discussed with patients taking valproate whenever perampanel is added to the treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629306>An open-label, single-center pilot study to test the effects of an amino  mixture in older patients admitted to internal medicine wards.</a></h2><p>Older patients are frequently subjected to prolonged hospitalization and extended bed rest, with a negative effect on physical activity and caloric intake. This results in a consistent loss of muscle mass and function, which is associated with functional decline and high mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 1 wk of oral amino  (AA) supplementation in older patients subjected to low mobility during hospitalization.Hospitalized older patients (69-87) were included in the control group (n = 50) or were administered 25 g of AA mixture (n = 44) twice daily throughout 7 d of low mobility. We collected data related to length of stay as primary outcome measure. In-hospital mortality, 90-d postdischarge mortality, 90-d postdischarge rehospitalization, and falls also were considered. Moreover, variations of anthropometric ,  composition and muscle architecture/strength, circulating interleukins, and oxidative stress markers between the beginning and the end of the supplementation period were analyzed as secondary outcomes.Similar values were reported between the two groups regarding age (76.6 ± 6.8 versus 79 ± 7.2 y old),  (61.5 ± 14.3 versus 62.1 ± 16.1 kg), and  mass index (28.7 ± 4.15 versus 28.1 ± 3.62 kg/m). Although no difference in terms of in-hospital, 90-d postdischarge, or overall mortality rate was observed between the two groups, a reduction in length of stay, 90-d postdischarge hospitalization, and falls was observed in the AA supplementation group rather than in controls. Furthermore, the AA mixture limited muscle architecture/strength impairment and circulating oxidative stress, which occurred during hospitalization-related bed rest. The latter data was associated with increased circulating levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and -10.These results suggest that the AA mixture limits several alterations associated with low mobility in older hospitalized patients, such as length of stay, 90-d postdischarge hospitalization, and falls, preventing the loss of muscle function, as well as the increase of circulating interleukins and oxidative stress markers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of  in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644673>IS THERE ANY CHANGE IN PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS COMPARING 5 TO 10 YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP IN OBESE PATIENTS UNDERGOING ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS?</a></h2><p>: Bariatric surgery promotes significant  loss and improvement of associated comorbidities; however, nutrients deficiencies and  regain may occur in the middle-late postoperative period.To investigate nutritional status in 10 years follow-up.: Longitudinal retrospective study in which anthropometric, biochemical indicators and nutritional intake were assessed before and after one, two, three, four, five and ten years of Roux-en Y gastric bypass through analysis of medical records.: After ten years there was a reduction of 29.2% of initial ; however, 87.1% of patients had significant  regain.

Bearing this in mind, the current study was designed using sorafenib (SFB) encapsulated microparticles (MP) prepared with biodegradable poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) copolymer. The surfaces of these microparticles were modified with RNA aptamer having a binding affinity towards ErbB3 receptors. SFB-loaded MP (MPS) were prepared by o/w solvent evaporation method and the surface was coupled with the amino group of aptamer by EDC/NHS chemistry. Physiochemical investigations were done by dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy and FTIR. In vitro apoptosis assay, cell viability assay and metastatic progression showed a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in vitro cell viability for MPS and MPS-Apt as compared to MP. The synergistic combination of SFB and aptamer also decreased the metastatic progression of cells for an extended period. Microparticles were also evaluated for in vivo toxicity in female BALB/c mice. It was evident that the presence of aptamer decreased the generalized toxicity of MPS-Apt, as measured by mean  loss and blood profiles, keeping all the blood formed elements level within acceptable limits. The histopathological investigations showed some necrotic and pyknotic bodies. In a similar fashion, liver function test and renal function tests showed pronounced effects of formulations on vital organs.Copyright © 2019.

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg ) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole- and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of increasing dietary inclusion levels of laminarin in the first 14 days post-weaning on pig growth performance and weaning associated intestinal dysfunction. At weaning, 96 pigs (8.4 (SD 1.09) kg) (meatline boars x (large white x landrace sows) were blocked by live , litter and sex and randomly assigned to: 1) basal diet; 2) basal + 100ppm laminarin; 3) basal + 200ppm laminarin; 4) basal + 300ppm laminarin (3 pigs/pen). The appropriate quantity of a laminarin rich extract (65% laminarin) was added to the basal diet to achieve the above dietary inclusion levels of laminarin. After 14 days of supplementation, 8 pigs from the basal group and the best performing laminarin group were euthanised for sample collection. The 300ppm laminarin group was selected as this group had higher ADFI compared to all other groups and higher ADG than the basal group (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased the expression of SLC2A8/GLUT8 in the duodenum, SLC2A2/GLUT2, SLC2A7/GLUT7, SLC15A1/PEPT1 and FABP2 in the jejunum, and SLC16A1/MCT1 in the colon. Laminarin supplementation reduced Enterobacteriaceae numbers in the caecum (P<0.05), and increased lactobacilli numbers (P<0.05), total volatile fatty  concentrations and the molar proportions of butyrate (P<0.01) in the colon. In conclusion, 300ppm laminarin from a laminarin rich extract has potential, as a dietary supplement, to improve performance and prevent post-weaning intestinal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635262>Separation and Identification of Highly Efficient Antioxidant Peptides from Eggshell Membrane.</a></h2><p>The enzymatic hydrolysates (EHs) of the eggshell membrane (ESM) were obtained after incubating eggshell membrane in solutions prepared with NaSO and alkaline protease combinations. The effects of enzyme species, enzyme dosage, NaSO concentration, and hydrolysis time on the antioxidant activity of the ESM-EH were determined. Also, the correlation between the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and the antioxidant activity of ESM-EH was analyzed. The DH of ESM-EH showed a highly positive correlation with the reducing power (R = 0.857) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) (R = 0.876) and performed negative correlation with the Fe-chelating ability (R = -0.529). The molecular  distribution of the ESM-EH was determined by MALDI-TOF/MS. Cation exchange chromatography (Sephadex C-25) was used to isolate the ESM-EH and then the enzymatic hydrolysis fragment (EHF) was obtained. Among the five isolated fragments (F1~F5), fragment 3 (F3), which was composed of 28 polypeptides, showed the highest ability to quench ABTS• (2,2-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic ) (90.44%) and also displayed stronger TBARS (thiobarbituric - reactive substances) (58.17%) and TAA (303.82 µg /mL) than the ESM-EH. Further analysis of the 28 peptides in F3 identified using LC-MS/MS indicated that five peptides (ESYHLPR, NVIDPPIYAR, MFAEWQPR, LLFAMTKPK, MLKMLPFK) showed high water-solubility, biological activities, and antioxidant characteristics. Finally, the TAA of the synthetic peptide was verified, the synthetic peptides ESYHLPR and MFAEWQPR performed the best activity and have high potentials to be used as antioxidant agents in functional foods, pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665680>Increasing perfluoroalkyl substances and ecological process from the Yongding Watershed to the Guanting Reservoir in the Olympic host cities, China.</a></h2><p>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have raised great attention, particularly in regions of rapid urbanization. Zhangjiakou and Beijing will jointly host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022, which will likely increase local PFASs pollution and their associated risks over the coming period. In this study, we identified ecological process of PFASs, including sources, environmental fate, and risks, from the Yongding Watershed to the Guanting Reservoir. The concentrations of total 12 PFASs in water of the Guanting Reservoir were higher than that from the Yongding Watershed, with mean of 48.9 and 33.7 ng/L, respectively. The concentrations of PFASs in sediment of the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir were similar, with mean of 1.01 and 0.827 ng/g dry , respectively. Detected levels of PFASs in the Guanting Reservoir significantly increased during the past eight years, possibly due to an improving economy and a rapidly developed service industry. Moderate PFASs levels in fish of the Guanting Reservoir were detected relative to other lakes and reservoirs. The daily intake of PFASs via fish and water ranged from 4.96 to 15.0 ng/kg bw/day, with higher levels found in children relative to adults. In total, approximately 9.06 kg of PFASs from riverine flow and atmospheric deposition annually entered the Guanting Reservoir. PFASs from the Yongding River significantly contributed to the pollution of Guanting Reservoir, with predominance of perfluorobutanoic  (PFBA) in water, and long-chain perfluorinated carboxylic  (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in sediment in both the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir. Most of the PFASs (23.5 kg) were stored in water of the Guanting Reservoir, while the annual storage of PFASs in sediment and fish was only 4.68 × 10 kg and 4.36 × 10 kg via deposition and accumulation, respectively. The results suggest that water quality management of the Yongding Watershed is necessary for effective control on PFASs pollution in the Guanting Reservoir.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino- defined (CDAA) diets with increasing fat content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (2-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive  loss, irrespective of fat content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose  and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary fat in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the lipid metabolism genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60% fat (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High fat supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher oxygen radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg ) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino  sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high oxygen radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654701>Adipokines underlie the early origins of obesity and associated metabolic comorbidities in the offspring of women with pregestational obesity.</a></h2><p>Maternal pregestational obesity is a well-known risk factor for offspring obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal  and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular  (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino  transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we assessed the morphological, physiological and metabolic responses to sustained water deficit in Brachypodium distachyon, a model organism for research on temperate grasses. Relative to control plants, fresh biomass, leaf water potential, and chlorophyll levels decreased rapidly in plants grown under drought conditions, demonstrating an early onset of senescence. The leaf C/N ratio and protein content showed an increase in plants subjected to drought stress. The concentrations of several small molecule carbohydrates and amino -derived metabolites previously implicated in osmotic protection increased rapidly in plants experiencing water deficit. Malic , a low molecular  organic  with demonstrated roles in stomatal closure, also increased rapidly as a response to drought treatment. The concentrations of prenyl lipids, such as phytol and α-tocopherol, increased early during the drought treatment but then dropped dramatically. Surprisingly, continued changes in the quantities of metabolites were observed, even in samples harvested from visibly senesced plants. The data presented here provide insights into the processes underlying persistent metabolic activity during sustained water deficit and can aid in identifying mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants.Copyright © 2019.

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced obesity mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine lipid accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of adipogenesis by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced  gain and total fat mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

The left ventricular functions were evaluated on 15th day by echocardiography. The heart tissues were then excised for histological evaluation. In DOXO group, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS), and mitral lateral annulus (s') velocity were significantly lower, and the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (LVEDD, LVESD) were significantly higher than control group (p < 0.05), indicating a significant deterioration in left ventricular functions. However, in comparison to DOXO group, LVESD, LVEDD, LVEF, FS, and s' were significantly improved in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.05). On histological evaluation, contrary to the normal cellular structure of cardiomyocytes in control and TAU groups, DOXO group showed increased nuclear or cytoplasmic changes and infiltrative cell proliferation (p < 0.001), which were remarkably reduced in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.001). TAU treatment has a protective effect against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity on echocardiographical and histological evaluation.

We also aimed to estimate associations between PFAS and thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations, thereby elucidating whether THs potentially mediate the associations between PFAS concentrations and birth size.We studied a population-based prospective cohort of 172 mother-singleton pairs from the Faroe Islands. Twelve PFAS were measured in maternal serum obtained at 34 weeks of gestation. THs were measured in maternal and cord serum. Associations between PFAS concentrations and birth size and TH concentrations were estimated using multivariable linear regressions. Sex-stratified analyses along with a mediation analysis were performed to estimate potential mediating effects of THs in the association between PFAS and birth outcomes.Several PFASs were negatively associated with birth , length, and head circumference, and a general positive association between maternal serum-PFASs and cord serum-thyroid stimulating hormone was found. For instance, a doubling in perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic  (PFOA) was associated with a 53% (95% CI: 18%, 99%) and 40% (95% CI: 8%, 81%) increases in thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, respectively. There was little evidence of sexually dimorphic associations. Overall, THs were not found to mediate associations between PFASs and birth size.In this study, several PFASs were negatively associated with birth size and increased THs, which however did not explain lower birth  among children exposed to PFAS.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Pro-inflammatory leukotrienes are formed via the ALOX5 pathway but 12/15-lipoxygenating ALOX-isoforms have been implicated in the biosynthesis of pro-resolving mediators. In vitro mutagenesis of the triad determinants abolished the leukotriene synthesizing activity of ALOX5 but the biological consequences of these alterations have not been studied. To fill this gap we created Alox5 knock-in mice, which express the 12/15-lipoxygenating Phe359Trp+Ala424Ile+Asn425Met Alox5 triple mutant and characterized its phenotypic alterations.The mouse Alox5 triple mutant functions as arachidonic  15-lipoxygenating enzyme, which also forms 12S-hydroxy and 8S-hydroxy arachidonic . In contrast to the wildtype enzyme the triple mutant effectively oxygenates linoleic  to the activating PPARγ ligand 13S-hydroxy linoleic . Knock-in mice expressing the mutant enzyme are viable, fertile and develop normally. The mice cannot synthesize pro-inflammatory leukotrienes but show significantly attenuated plasma levels of lipolytic endocannabinoids. When aging the animals gained significantly more , which may be related to the 5-fold higher levels of 13-hydroxy linoleic  in the adipose tissue.These data indicate for the first time that in vivo mutagenesis of the triad determinants of mouse Alox5 abolished the biosynthetic capacity of the enzyme for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and altered the catalytic properties of the protein favoring the formation of 13-hydroxy linoleic .In vivo triple mutation of the mouse Alox5 gene impacts the  homeostasis of aging mice via augmented formation of the activating PPARγ ligand 13-hydroxy linoleic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651888>Ulcerative intestinal tuberculosis case as a complication of treatment by infliximab for intestinal Behçet's disease: A case report.</a></h2><p>Intestinal Behçet's disease (BD) is characterized by intestinal ulcerations and gastrointestinal symptoms. Ulcerative intestinal tuberculosis (TB) is usually with dyspepsia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and  loss. The 2 diseases exhibit similar clinical manifestations, but the most critical aspects of their clinical courses and required treatments are not at all similar.We present a case in which a patient with intestinal Behçet's disease developed a de novo ulcerative intestinal TB infection after the start of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α treatment.

However, 2,129 proteins remain listed as missing proteins (MPs) in the newest neXtProt release (2019-02). The main reasons for MPs are a low-abundance, low-molecular- (LMW), unexpected modifications, membrane characteristics, etc. Moreover, more than 50% of the MS/MS data have not been successfully identified in shotgun proteomics. Open-pFind, an efficient open search engine, recently released by the pFind group in China, might provide the opportunity to identify these buried MPs in complex samples. In this study, proteins and potential MPs were identified using Open-pFind and three other search engines to compare their performance and efficiency with three large-scale datasets digested by three enzymes (Glu-C, Lys-C, and Trypsin) with specificity on different amino  (AA) residues. Our results demonstrated that Open-pFind identified 44.7-93.1% more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), and 21.3-61.6% more peptide sequences than those identified by the second-best search engine. As a result, Open-pFind detected 53.1% more candidate MPs than MaxQuant and 8.8% more candidate MPs than Proteome Discoverer. In total, 5 (PE2) of the 124 candidate MPs identified by Open-pFind were verified from two unique peptides containing more than 9 AA by using spectrum theoretical prediction with pDeep, and synthesized peptide matching with pBuild, after spectrum quality analysis, isobaric post-translational modification, and single amino  variant (SAAV) filtering. These five verified MPs can be saved as PE1 proteins. In addition, three other candidate MPs were verified with two unique peptides (one peptide containing more than 9 AA and the other containing only 8 AA), which were slightly lower than the criteria listed by C-HPP, and required additional verification information. More importantly, unexpected modifications were detected in these MPs. All MS datasets have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD015759.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640215>Meat Proteins as Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV Inhibitors and Glucose Uptake Stimulating Peptides for the Management of a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In Silico Study.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a non-communicable disease entity currently constituting one of the most significant health problems. The development of effective therapeutic strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes mellitus based on the selection of methods to restore and maintain blood glucose homeostasis is still in progress. Among the different courses of action, inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) can improve blood glucose control in diabetic patients. Pharmacological therapy offering synthetic drugs is commonly used. In addition to medication, dietary intervention may be effective in combating metabolic disturbances caused by diabetes mellitus. Food proteins as a source of biologically active sequences are a potential source of anti-diabetic peptides (DPP-IV inhibitors and glucose uptake stimulating peptides). This study showed that in silico pork meat proteins digested with gastrointestinal enzymes are a potential source of bioactive peptides with a high potential to control blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Analysis revealed that the sequences released during in silico digestion were small dipeptides (with an average  of 270.07 g mol), and most were poorly soluble in water. The selected electron properties of the peptides with the highest bioactivity index (i.e., GF, MW, MF, PF, PW) were described using the DFT method. The contribution of hydrophobic amino , in particular Phe and Trp, in forming the anti-diabetic properties of peptides released from pork meat was emphasized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621006>Characterization of HemY-type protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase genes from cyanobacteria and their functioning in transgenic Arabidopsis.</a></h2><p>We investigated the functions of two cyanobacterial HemY protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) genes with in vitro and in vivo assays and evaluated their applicability as resistance traits to PPO-inhibiting herbicides. We isolated HemY-type protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) genes from cyanobacteria, OnPPO gene from Oscillatoria nigro-viridis PCC7112 and HaPPO gene from Halothece sp. PCC7418. The alignment of amino  sequences as well as phylogenetic analyses conducted showed that OnPPO and HaPPO are classified as HemY-type PPO and are more closely related to plastidic PPOs than to mitochondrial PPOs. The PPO-deficient Escherichia coli BT3 strain, which requires heme supplementation, could obtain normal growth in the absence of heme supplementation when complemented with OnPPO and HaPPO. The enzyme assays of OnPPO, HaPPO, and Arabidopsis thaliana PPO1 (AtPPO1) proteins each revealed different kinetic properties in terms of catalytic efficiency, substrate affinity, and the degree of inhibition by PPO inhibitors. In particular, the catalytic efficiencies (k/Km) of OnPPO and HaPPO were approximately twofold higher than that of AtPPO1. The elution profiles of all three PPOs, acquired by size-exclusion chromatography, showed only a single peak with a molecular  of approximately 52-54 kDa, which corresponds to a monomeric form. Moreover, functional complementation with OnPPO and HaPPO in AtPPO1-silenced Arabidopsis resulted in restored growth, whereas AtPPO1-silenced wild type Arabidopsis suffered necrotic death. In addition, we observed that overexpression of OnPPO and HaPPO in Arabidopsis conferred resistance to the PPO-inhibiting herbicides tiafenacil and saflufenacil. These results suggest that two HemY-type PPOs of cyanobacteria can functionally substitute for plastidic PPO activity in Arabidopsis and can enhance resistance to tiafenacil and saflufenacil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655590>Heated egg white has no effect, but lactic fermented and unheated egg white reduces abdominal fat in rats.</a></h2><p>We previously reported the abdominal fat-reducing effect of unheated egg white proteins (EWP); however, unheated egg white is actually rarely consumed. We thus investigated the effect of heated egg white on abdominal fat in rats.Male SD rats were divided into two groups that were allowed to consume different dietary preparations containing casein or heated egg white for 4 weeks (Trial 1). We studied whether a heated form and a lactic fermented form of egg white (FLE) are as effective as unheated egg white for reducing abdominal fat. For this, we divided male SD rats into four groups that were allowed to consume different dietary preparations containing casein, unheated egg white, heated egg white, or lactic fermented egg white for 4 weeks (Trial 2).Animals in the heated egg white group showed no significant difference in abdominal fat  compared with those in the casein group (Trial 1). Animals in the unheated egg white group and the FLE group had significantly lower levels of abdominal fat  than those in the casein group (Trial 2). Ovalbumin in heated egg white was degraded by pepsin, whereas ovalbumin in unheated egg white and lactic  fermented egg white was not degraded appreciably by pepsin. It was reported that EWP inhibit triglyceride absorption in rat. In the present study, EWP pepsin hydrolysate inhibited the micellar solubility of fatty  in vitro. In particular, ovalbumin inhibited the micellar solubility of fatty .These results indicate that lactic fermented egg white reduces visceral fat in rats and suggest that different levels of susceptibility of ovalbumin to pepsin digestion underlie the varying effectiveness among the egg white preparations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644648>Effect of replacing fish meal by full fat soybean meal on growth performance, feed utilization and gastrointestinal enzymes in diets for African catfish Clarias gariepinus.</a></h2><p>Study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing fish meal with different levels of full fat soybean meal (FFSBM) on growth and digestive enzyme activities in the stomach, Liver and intestine for Clarias gariepinus. Four diets (D1, D2, D3 and D4) were formulated with 0, 15, 20 and 20 g 100-1 protein + DL-methionine by alternating FFSBM with fish meal.

Attachment of ligand to the PPAR-γ receptor activates a series of genes that are involved in glucose and fatty  metabolism, the overall effect being an increase in insulin effect. The thiazolidinediones reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and act additively with other antidiabetic medications. Troglitazone was the first thiazolidinedione that received approval for use in the United States (January 1997). However, within a year of its approval, reports of severe liver injury and deaths from acute liver failure began to appear. Cautionary statements and recommendations for monitoring of ALT levels were made, but after more than two dozen reports of hepatic failure and the introduction of two new thiazolidinediones in 1999, troglitazone was withdrawn from use in 2000. The newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been associated with only rare instances of acute liver injury. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are linked to increased  gain, heart failure and fracture risk and they are considered second-line agents for type 2 diabetes and recommended only after failure of metformin and lifestyle modifications. All references on hepatotoxicity of the thiazolidinediones are given together at the end of this Overview section (updated June 2018).

We have previously described the hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and anticoagulant activity of orally administered camel milk in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In the present study in the same animal model, we extended these observations by comparing camel milk and the more available and widely consumed bovine milk with respect to their antidiabetic and antithrombotic actions. Rats were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (65 mg/kg), and then camel milk or bovine milk was administered orally for 8 wk. We evaluated the changes in , fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, blood coagulation profile, and platelet function. Diabetic rats developed  loss, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, inhibition of platelet aggregation responses to arachidonic  and adenosine diphosphate, a marked decrease (>50%) in plasma fibrinogen levels, and short activated partial thromboplastin time. Treatment with camel milk or bovine milk reversed these abnormalities, resulting in  gain, decreased blood glucose levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Despite the more remarkable antidiabetic action of camel milk, treatment with bovine milk was more effective in correcting plasma fibrinogen levels and restoring inhibited platelet aggregation responses. Long-term administration of camel milk or bovine milk counteracted streptozotocin-induced metabolic manifestations in rats, maintained platelet function, and abolished coagulopathy-associated fibrinogen consumption. Notably, the antidiabetic effect of camel milk was more pronounced than that of bovine milk, but bovine milk exhibited more potent anticoagulant activity than camel milk. These findings should encourage further clinical trials to assess the efficiency of camel milk and bovine milk or their derived peptides as food supplements or potential nonpharmacological therapies for dysglycemia and the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The present study was undertaken for purification, characterization, and structural elucidation of serratiopeptidase produced from Streptomyces hydrogenans var. MGS13.The crude enzyme was purified by precipitating with ammonium sulfate, dialysis, and Sephadex gel filtration, resulting in 34% recovery with a 12% purification fold. The purified enzyme S.AMP13 was spotted as a single clear hydrolytic band on casein zymogram and whose molecular  was found to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The inhibitor and stability studies revealed that this enzyme is metalloprotease, thermostable, and alkaline in nature. The maximum serratiopeptidase activity was observed at 37 °C and pH 9.0. The partial amino  sequence of the purified enzyme S.AMP13 by LC-MS/MS analysis shows the closest sequence similarities with previously reported alkaline metalloendopeptidases. The amino  sequence alignment of S.AMP13 shared a conserved C-terminus region with peptidase-M10 serralysin superfamily at amino  positions 128-147, i.e., ANLSTRATDTVYGFNSTAGR revealed that this enzyme is a serralysin-like protease. The kinetic studies of the purified enzyme revealed a K of 1 mg/mL for its substrate casein and V of 319 U/mL/min. The 3D structure of the purified enzyme was modeled by using SWISS-MODEL, and the quality of the structure was authenticated by assessing the Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK server, which suggested that the enzyme was stable with good quality.Inhibitor, stability, electrophoretic, and bioinformatic studies suggested that the purified enzyme obtained from S. hydrogenans var.

Unpredictable graft survival is a major drawback, and a variety of improvements on technique such as using antioxidants have been reported to increase retention. The authors examined whether a natural rosemary plant extract known with antioxidant properties, rosmarinic , could improve the survival of the adipose tissue.Inguinal fat pads were harvested from 24 Sprague Dawley rats and implanted to the parascapular area. Rats were divided into three groups: rosmarinic  and ethanol as solvent (RA), ethanol (E), and serum physiologic (C). These substances were administered intraperitoneally daily for 1 week and once a week for 7 weeks. Volume and  measurements, blood specimens,  and volume records, and histopathologic examinations were performed and analyzed.The RA group demonstrated lower TOS, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and MDA values compared to E and C groups. TGF-beta increase was statistically insignificant, but TOS, TNF-alpha, MDA decrease was found statistically significant.  and volume losses were lower in the RA and E groups compared to the C group. The difference between the RA and E groups in terms of  and volume loss was statistically insignificant. Histopathologically fat necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were less in the RA group compared to the E and C groups (p < 0.05).Rosmarinic  increased the fat graft volume retained and decreased cyst formation and abscess formation in the rat model. Further studies can be undertaken to investigate rosmarinic 's local application as a tumescent and safety in humans.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which Evidence-Based Medicine rankings are applicable.

In this context, the production of protein concentrates and isolates from new plant sources have increased enormously because of their nutritional and techno-functional properties. Therefore, this work describes a pilot process for obtaining protein-rich ingredients from a yellow lupin variety (Lupinus luteus) developed by the Agriaquaculture Nutritional Genomic Center (CGNA). A protein alkaline solubilisation followed by isoelectric precipitation was used as a method for obtaining a protein concentrate (LPC) and isolate (LPI) with 75 and 95% protein, respectively. The changes in the protein quality and chemical composition during the protein concentration process from lupin flour were evaluated. Thus, nutritional parameters such as the amino  (AAs) profile, essential amino  index (EAAI), chemical score (CS), the protein efficiency ratio (PER), and digestible indispensable amino  score (DIAAS) were determined to evaluate the nutritional quality of LPC and LPI. The facile and scalable protein isolation method without a defatting process proposed in this study showed a great protein separation efficiency (PSE), while the amino  profile was not affected during both the concentration as well as the isolation of proteins. In addition, SDS-PAGE showed that both LPC and LPI mainly contained the high-molecular- proteins α and β-conglutins. Both LPC and LPI had a balanced amino  profile, and arginine was the most predominant amino . These results are useful for increasing the use of lupin based-protein ingredients as a potential functional ingredient in the food industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618914>Effects of Nutritional Deprivation and Re-Alimentation on the Feed Efficiency, Blood Biochemistry, and Rumen Microflora in Yaks ().</a></h2><p>Yak suffers severe starvation and  reduction in the cold season and recovers relatively rapid growth in the warm season every year. Herein, we investigated the effects of starvation and refeeding on the growth, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry and rumen microbial community as well as functions of yaks. The results showed that starvation significantly reduced the  of yaks. Serum glucose and triglyceride concentrations significantly decreased, and β-hydroxybutyric  and non-esterified fatty  levels were significantly increased during the starvation period. Starvation also dramatically inhibited rumen microbial fermentations. Whereas, refeeding with the same diet significantly increased the feed efficiency, nutrient digestibility together with rumen acetate, propionate and microbial protein productions compared with those before starvation. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that starvation mainly decreased the ruminal protein-degrading bacteria  and propionate-producing bacteria  populations and dramatically increased the denitrifying bacteria  populations. Refeeding reduced the  population and increased propionate-producing bacteria  and starch-degrading bacteria  populations when compared with those before starvation. The predicted microbial metabolic pathways, related to amino  and starch metabolisms, were also significantly altered during the starvation and refeeding. The results indicated that the rumen microorganisms and their metabolism pathways changed with feed supply, and these alterations in part contributed to yak adaption to starvation and re-alimentation.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), or saturated fatty  (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently,  gains, liver , and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty - and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

Tannins are naturally found in both tropical and temperate plants, and have been shown to consistently decrease urinary nitrogen (N) excretion when consumed by ruminants. However, the limited number of in vivo studies conducted indicates that the effects of tannins on intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, CH production and animal performance vary depending on source, type, dose, and molecular  (MW). There are two main types of tannin in terrestrial plants: condensed tannin (CT; high MW) and hydrolysable tannin (HT; low MW). Consumption of CT and HT by ruminants can reduce N excretion without negatively affecting animal performance. High MW tannins bind to dietary protein, while low MW tannins affect rumen microbes, and thus, irrespective of type of tannin, N excretion is affected. The structure of high MW tannin is more diverse compared with that of low MW tannin, which may partly explain the inconsistent effects of CT on CH production reported in in vivo studies. In contrast, the limited number of in vivo studies with low MW HT potentially shows a consistent decrease in CH production, possibly attributed to the gallic  subunit. Further in vivo studies are needed to determine the effects of tannins, characterized by MW and structural composition, on reducing CH emissions and improving animal performance in ruminants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634391>All-trans Retinoic  Counteracts Diarrhea and Inhibition of Downregulated in Adenoma Expression in Gut Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial apical membrane Cl-/HCO3- exchanger DRA (downregulated in adenoma, SLC26A3) has emerged as an important therapeutic target for diarrhea, emphasizing the potential therapeutic role of agents that upregulate DRA. All-trans retinoic  (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic  (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic  altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic  cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated  loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Combinations of lithium plus valproic  (Li/VPA) and lithium plus carbamazepine (Li/CBZ) are used in clinical practice but were not previously compared in a head-to-head trial.The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of Li/VPA versus Li/CBZ in treating type 1 BD in any phase of illness in young individuals.LICAVAL was a randomized, unicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial that was conducted from January 2009 to December 2012 in a tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Participants were between 18 and 35 years old and were followed up for 2 years. Our primary outcome was the number of participants achieving/maintaining response and remission during the acute and maintenance phases of BD treatment, respectively. Other outcomes assessed were symptom severity and adverse events throughout the study. In the analysis of the primary outcome, we compared groups by using a two-way repeated  analysis of variance and estimated effect sizes by using Cohen's d.Of our 64 participants, 36 were allocated to Li/VPA and 28 to Li/CBZ. Our sample was composed predominantly of females (66.6%) and the average age was 27.8 years. A total of 27 (45.0%) participants had depression, 17 (28.3%) had mania/hypomania, and 16 (26.7%) had a mixed state. We found no between-group differences in CGI-BP (Clinical Global Impression Scale modified for use in bipolar disorder) scores (P = 0.326) or in any other outcome. Side effects differed significantly between groups only in the first week of treatment (P = 0.021), and there were more side effects in the Li/VPA group. Also, the Li/VPA group gained  (+2.1 kg) whereas the Li/CBZ group presented slight  loss (-0.2 kg).Our study suggests that Li/VPA and Li/CBZ have similar efficacy and tolerability in BD but that Li/CBZ might have metabolic advantages in the long term.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  .

Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry  and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino  were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino  in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670129>Purification, characterization, and functional properties of a novel glycoprotein from tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tartaricum) seed.</a></h2><p>A pure glycoprotein (BGP4-I) was obtained from tartary buckwheat seeds by aqueous extraction followed by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography. The average molecular  of BGP4-I, as determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography, was 123.43 kDa. The structure of BGP4-I was characterized based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. Based on the nano-liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the amino  sequence of BGP4-I, belongs unequivocally to the glycosyl hydrolase family 1 in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database by alignment studies. The specific activity of BGP4-I was 18.44 μmol/min/mg on the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Furthermore, BGP4-I is unique in its specificity for some substrates. These results suggest that the BGP4-I from tartary buckwheat seeds is a novel specific β-glucosidase setting the foundation for potential applications in the food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to establish metabolic factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with obesity-related factors such as , BMI, and serum lipid levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk metabolism and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (palmitic , PA) to gauge its effects on cell metabolism and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652636>MicroRNA-29a Suppresses CD36 to Ameliorate High Fat Diet-Induced Steatohepatitis and Liver Fibrosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) has been shown to play a critical role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis following liver injury. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced  gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty  translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced obesity, hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642431>[Level of circulating Alarin in obese children and its association with insulin resistance].</a></h2><p>To study the level of circulating Alarin in obese children and its association with various metabolic parameters.A total of 86 obese children with a  mass index (BMI) above the 95th percentile were enrolled as the obesity group, and 82 healthy children, matched for age and sex, with a BMI below the 85th percentile were enrolled as the healthy control group. According to the presence or absence of insulin resistance (IR), the obesity group was further divided into an IR group with 27 children and a non-IR group with 59 children. Related anthropometric parameters, including  height, , systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), were measured, and BMI was calculated. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), uric  (UA), fasting insulin (FINS), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were measured. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and whole- insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) were calculated. ELISA was used to measure the level of circulating Alarin.The obesity group had a significantly higher level of circulating Alarin than the healthy control group (P<0.01). The IR group had a significantly higher level of circulating Alarin than the non-IR group (P<0.01). Circulating Alarin was positively correlated with BMI, TG, FBG, AUC-glucose, AUC-FINS, and HOMA-IR (P<0.05) and was negatively correlated with WBISI (P<0.05). The circulating Alarin level had a linear regression relationship with BMI, FBG, and HOMA-IR, among which HOMA-IR had the greatest influence on the circulating Alarin level (P<0.05).There is a significant increase in the circulating Alarin level in obese children, which may be associated with the development of obesity and IR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675464>Molybdate Toxicity in Chinese Cabbage is not the direct Consequence of Changes in Sulfur Metabolism.</a></h2><p>In polluted areas, plants may be exposed to supra-optimal levels of the micronutrient molybdenum. The physiological basis of molybdenum phytotoxicity is poorly understood. Plants take up molybdenum as molybdate, which is a structural analogue of sulfate. Therefore, it is presumed that elevated molybdate concentrations may hamper the uptake and subsequent metabolism of sulfate, which may induce sulfur deficiency. In the current research, Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) seedlings were exposed to 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM Na MoO for nine days. Leaf chlorosis and a decreased plant growth occurred at concentrations ≥ 100 μM. Root growth was more affected than shoot growth. At ≥ 100 μM Na MoO , the sulfate uptake rate and capacity were increased, though only when expressed on a root fresh  basis. When expressed on a whole plant fresh  basis, which corrects for the impact of molybdate on the shoot-to-root ratio, the sulfate uptake rate and capacity remained unaffected. Molybdate concentrations ≥ 100 μM altered the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, although the levels of sulfur metabolites (sulfate, water-soluble non-protein thiols and total sulfur) were not altered. Moreover, the levels of nitrogen metabolites (nitrate, amino , proteins and total nitrogen), which are generally strongly affected by sulfate deprivation, were not affected. The root water-soluble non-protein thiol content was increased and the tissue nitrate levels decreased, only at 200 μM Na MoO . Evidently, molybdenum toxicity in Chinese cabbage was not due to the direct interference of molybdate with the uptake and subsequent metabolism of sulfate.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635295>Electro-Acupuncture Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Anorexia in Rats by Modulating Ghrelin and Monoamine Neurotransmitters.</a></h2><p>Anorexia is common in patients with cancer, mostly as a side effect of chemotherapy. The effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) on ameliorating cancer-related symptoms have been studied in animal models and in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to determine optimal conditions for the application of EA to alleviate anorexia, followed by the study of molecular mechanisms affecting its therapeutics. Anorexia was induced in male Wistar rats by injecting cisplatin, which was then followed by EA treatment at CV12, the acupuncture point located in the center of the abdominal midline.  and food intake were measured daily throughout the duration of the study. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the plasma were quantitatively analyzed by HPLC-ECD. Gastrointestinal hormone concentrations were elucidated with ELISA kits. RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA expression of ghrelin (GHRL), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and pro-opiomelanocortin. The expression of c-Fos in the nucleus tractus solitarii was detected using western blotting analysis. The optimal conditions of EA to alleviate anorexia in rats was determined to be 1 unit for intensity and 10 Hz for frequency. EA treatment at CV12 reduced the levels of plasma monoamine neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic , dopamine, and norepinephrine; as well as stimulated the expression of GHRL and NPY to alleviate cisplatin-induced anorexia in rats.

The molecular  of FIM is 16304Da. In theory, the concentration of FIM in biological samples should be determined by the LBA method or indirectly quantified using LC-MS/MS instrumentation. However, the above methods were complex and time-consuming. In this study, we successfully developed a simpler LC-MS/MS method for directly quantifying the intact FIM protein in monkey plasma for the first time. The chromatographic separation of FIM was achieved by using an InertSustain Bio C18 column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic  (A)-water containing 0.1% formic  (B) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Good linearity was observed in the concentration range of 5~500 ng/mL (r >0.99). The intra- and inter-day precision (expressed as relative standard deviation, RSD) of FIM was 2.30%~12.8% and 7.30%~13.2%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracy (expressed as a relative error, RE) was -12.7%~6.55% and -10.1%~0.892%, respectively. This method was successfully applied for a pharmacokinetic study of the FIM protein in 4 monkeys after subcutaneous administration.This article is protected by copyright.

This was a secondary analysis of a clinical trial where Malawian infants aged 6-12 mo were given a legume supplement providing 8.2 g/d of protein; anthropometry was conducted at multiple intervals, and fasted serum AA concentrations were measured at 12 mo of age. Lysine, proline, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine concentrations were higher in infants with a linear growth velocity -score >0 than those <0. Corrected Spearman correlation coefficients between individual AA concentrations and -for-height and length velocity from 6 to 12 mo of age were positively correlated for glycine, isoleucine, proline, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and valine. Additionally, -for-height was correlated with arginine, asparagine, glutamine, leucine, lysine, methionine, and phenylalanine.

Wistar rats were used in the in vivo experiments. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test (FST) and the antinociceptive activity was evaluated using hot plate test. In both, non-specific effects were evaluated by the open field test. Anti-thyroid activity was examined using Lang's method. Albumin binding behavior was evaluated by 3D fluorescence spectroscopy.For the Mg(DL-pGlu) complex (30 mg/kg), the FST test on Wistar rats revealed a decrease of 22% in the immobility time and an increment of 106% in the swimming time. The compound alters neither the locomotor activity nor the  after chronic administration. At the same dose, it showed antinociceptive activity, increasing the response latency. It blocks iodination reactions generating a charge transfer complex with iodine hence indicating anti-thyroid activity (K = 45366.5 ± 29 M). Albumin 3D fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed intensity increase of peak A and decrease of peak B.The results showed that the new compound produced a lowering of the immobility time and an increment of the swimming ability of the rats. The compound is able to increase the response latency in 70.0%, to capture iodine (anti-thyroid activity) and to interact with albumin through covalent type of interaction of the free NH groups.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

However, it is still unknown how exercise alters immunometabolism in a context of dietary changes. Agonists of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated-Receptor beta/delta (PPARβ/δ) have been studied this last decade as "exercise-mimetics", which are potential therapies for metabolic diseases. In this study, we address the question of whether PPARβ/δ agonist treatment would improve the immunometabolic changes induced by exercise in diet-induced obese female mice, having switched from a high fat diet to a normal diet. 24 mice were assigned to groups according to an 8-week exercise training program and/or an 8-week treatment with 3 mg/kg/day of GW0742, a PPARβ/δ agonist. Our results show metabolic changes of peripheral lymphoid tissues with PPARβ/δ agonist (increase in fatty  oxidation gene expression) or exercise (increase in AMPK activity) and a potentiating effect of the combination of both on the percentage of anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ T cells. Those effects are associated with a decreased visceral adipose tissue mass and skeletal muscle inflammation (TNF-α, Il-6, Il-1β mRNA level), an increase in skeletal muscle oxidative capacities (citrate synthase activity, endurance capacity), and insulin sensitivity. We conclude that a therapeutic approach targeting the PPARβ/δ pathway would improve obesity treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656323>High-Throughput Tertiary Amine Deoxygenated Photopolymerizations for Synthesizing Polymer Libraries.</a></h2><p>The huge chemical space potential of synthetic polymers means that in many studies only a small parameter range can be realistically synthesized in a short time and hence the "best" formulations may not be optimum. Throughput is traditionally limited by the need for deoxygenation in radical polymerizations, but advances in photopolymerization now provide opportunities for "in-air" polymerizations. Here, we have developed a protocol using liquid handling robots (or multichannel pipettes) with blue light photolysis of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer agents and tertiary amine deoxygenation to enable the synthesis of polymer libraries in industry-standard 96-well plates with no specialized infrastructure and no degassing step. The roles of solvents and amine deoxygenators are explored to optimize the polymerization, particularly to look at alternatives to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for hydrophobic monomer (co)polymerization. DMSO is shown to aid the degassing process but is not easy to remove and hence prevents isolation of pure polymers. In contrast, using dioxane in-plate evaporation or precipitation of the tertiary amine allowed isolation of polymers in-plate. This removed all reaction components yielding pure polymers, which is not easily achieved with systems using metal catalysts and secondary reductants, such as ascorbic . As an example of the throughput, in just under 40 h, 392 polymers were synthesized and subsequently analyzed direct from plates by a 96-well plate sampling size exclusion chromatography system to demonstrate reproducibility. Due to less efficient degassing in dioxane (compared to DMSO), the molecular  and dispersity control were limited in some cases (with acrylates giving the lowest dispersities), but the key aim of this system is to access hundreds of polymers quickly and in a format needed to enable testing. This method enables easy exploration of chemical space and development of screening libraries to identify hits for further study using precision polymerization methods.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650550>An erosion-type hydrolysis behavior of insoluble protein fraction from Chlorella protothecoides.</a></h2><p>-induced hydrolysis of proteins has been used to improve solubility as well as functional properties of various proteins, and could be a promising tool to facilitate the use of currently underutilized insoluble microalgae protein-rich fractions in food applications. However, results of a prior study showed an unusual resistance of an insoluble microalgae protein-rich fraction to  hydrolysis at room temperature.In this study, the insoluble protein-rich fraction extracted from microalgae Chlorella prothothecoides were thus treated with 0.5 M hydrochloric  at 25, 45, 65 or 85 °C for 0 - 4 h. Results showed that hydrolysis of the fraction at 85 °C for 4 h led to decreases in the amount of insoluble protein-rich aggregates and the formation of fragments with lower molecular , as well as an increase in protein solubility by around 40%. Nevertheless, some aggregated insoluble protein-rich particles remained even after hydrolysis at 85 °C for 4h.The higher temperature improved the efficiency of the  hydrolysis of the insoluble protein fraction from microalgae Chlorella prothothecoides which is highly -resistant.

Its advantages include brightness and a relatively high affinity for Zn(II),  = 0.7 nM. 2-(4,5-Dimethoxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethylbenzoxazole (Zinbo-5) is a member of a growing family of ratiometric synthetic Zn(II) probes, offering a possibility to determine Zn(II) concentration independently of the sensor concentration. Cells, however, contain high, millimolar or nearly millimolar concentrations of low molecular  ligands (LMWLs) capable of binding Zn(II) ions. Previously, we demonstrated that such LMWLs can perturb the performance of some fluorescent zinc sensors by competition and formation of ternary Zn(sensor) (LMWL) complexes. Here we tested Zinpyr-1 and Zinbo-5 in this respect. Despite structural differences, both sensors formed such ternary complexes. We determined their stability constants  and performed numerical simulations of Zn(II) distributions at physiological concentrations of selected LMWLs. Glutamic  was found to provide the strongest ternary complexes with either of the studied sensors. Zn(Zinpyr-1)(Glu) was an absolutely dominant Zn(II)/Zinpyr-1 species (more than 96% of the exchangeable Zn(II)), and Zn(Zinbo-5)(Glu) was the most abundant one (more than 40%) in these simulations. Our results indicate that under cellular conditions these sensors are able to report Zn(II) complexed to LMWLs rather than free Zn ions. On the other hand, the specific affinity of Zn(Zinpyr-1) and Zn(Zinbo-5) for Glu creates interesting opportunities for determining glutamic  in biological samples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623621>The effectiveness of marine based fatty  compound (PCSO-524) and firocoxib in the treatment of canine osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>NSAIDs are accepted as the most predictably efficacious medical treatment of the clinical signs of osteoarthritis (OA).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of PCSO-524 combined with the NSAID firocoxib using force plate gait analysis, orthopedic assessment score (OAS) and canine brief pain inventory score (CBPI) in dogs with OA. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted. Seventy-nine dogs that had hip and/or stifle OA were assigned randomly into three treatment groups: firocoxib, PCSO-524 and combination of firocoxib and PCSO-524, orally for 4 weeks. Peak vertical force (PVF, expressed as a percentage of bodyweight), OAS, CBPI, serum prostaglandin E concentration, hematology and blood chemistry values were evaluated before treatment (Day0), as well as at the second (Day14) and fourth week (Day28) during treatment.Within group analysis revealed significant increases in PVF over the 4-week treatment period for firocoxib, PCSO-524 and the combination (p < 0.05). Mean increases in PVF were 3.25 ± 4.13, 2.01 ± 3.86, 4.11 ± 4.69%BW (mean ± SD) respectively. The OAS showed non-significant change in all treatment groups. There were significant decreases in CBPI pain severity score (PSS) and CBPI pain interference scores (PIS) within some groups over time, however no significant differences were found between the groups. Significantly decreased serum PGE concentration (p < 0.05) was found in the combination group. Significant increases in BUN and creatinine (p < 0.05) compared to pre-treatment values were found in the firocoxib and combination groups but not in the PCSO-524 group at day28, but all values in all dogs remained within the normal ranges.The results of this study suggested combination of both PCSO-524 and firocoxib is more effective in alleviation of inflammation and improvement of  bearing ability when compared to the uses of either PCSO-524 or firocoxib alone. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm this, and to determine if there is any benefit of PCSO-524 over placebo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646708>Insulin resistance: Relationship between indices during late gestation in dairy cows and effects on newborn metabolism.</a></h2><p>To investigate the relationship between insulin resistance indices ["Revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index" (RQUICKI; RQ), "Revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index - β-hydroxybutyrate" (RQUICKI ; RQ ), and "Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance" (HOMA-IR; HR)], and metabolic parameters in dams during late gestation, and their newborn calves.

In this study, 13 strains close to strains belonging to the genera Oblongichytrium, Thraustochytrium, and Aurantiochytrium were isolated from seawater samples collected near the Antarctic Base Professor Julio Escudero (S 62°12'57' E 58°57'35″). Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was found in the total lipids of all the isolates; DHA content of the biomass (dry ) varied between 3.3 and 33 mg/g under the growth conditions for isolation. Five of the Antarctic thraustochytrids were able to accumulate lipids at levels higher than 20% w/w. Two strains, RT2316-7 and RT2316-13, were selected to test the effect of the incubation temperature (at 5°C for 14 days and at 15°C for 5 days). Incubation temperature had little effect on the lipid content and biomass yield; however, its effect on the fatty  composition was significant (p < .05). The low incubation temperature favored the accumulation of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), palmitic  and stearic  in the total lipids of RT2316-7. Percentage of EPA, DHA and the omega-6 fatty  dihomo-γ-linolenic  of total fatty  of RT2316-13 was higher at the low incubation temperature. RT2316-13 accumulated the highest lipid content (30.0 ± 0.5%) with a carbon to nitrogen mass ratio equal to 16.9. On the contrary, lipid accumulation in RT2316-7 occurred at high concentration of the nitrogen sources (monosodium glutamate or yeast extract). The capability to accumulate lipids with a fatty  profile that can be tuned through cultivation temperature make the Antarctic thraustochytrid RT2316-13 a candidate for the production of lipids with different uses.© 2019 The Authors.

In order to develop a simplified process with a stronger purity of protease, we investigated the  earthworm and  lugworm. We purified water extracts cut off at 10 kDa of molecular  using ultrafiltration because proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino  residues. We purified EW1 (raw earthworm extract), EW2 (molecular  (m.w) > 10 kDa of earthworm extract), and EW3 (m.w < 10 kDa) from the  earthworm. Likewise, we purified LW1 (wild lugworm extract), LW2 (m.w > 10 kDa), and LW3 (m.w < 10 kDa) from the  lugworm.

After surface sterilization, the seeds were sown on seedling trays. Forty-day-old plants were then transferred to hydroponic cultures with Cd (40 μM) or without Cd (control). Some biochemical and physiological parameters were assayed on the sixth day after Cd treatment. Based on the results, the plants showed an increase in leaf soluble carbohydrates, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity at the end of the exposure period. However, length, fresh , chlorophyll (Chl) b, total Chl, stomatal conductance and starch content decreased under Cd treatment. There was no significant difference between the plants exposed to Cd and the control group for Chl a, SPAD index, carotenoids, and anthocyanins as well as the HO content six days after treatment. The Cd content in the roots was considerably higher than that in the shoots. In assessing the antioxidant capacity of plant extracts, different results were observed using 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) test and beta-carotene/linoleic  bleaching assay. According to the results of this study, it seems that increased activity of PAL enzyme leads to an increase in biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in M. parviflora. This mechanism probably increases the antioxidant capacity of the plant to suppress Cd-induced toxicity and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we examined the effect of sodium valproate in random-pattern skin flap of rats and investigated its mechanisms of action. Different types of experiments were carried out. In acute treatment, different doses of sodium valproate (50, 100, 150, 300 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 1 h before surgery. In chronic treatment, the substance was injected each day for 2 wk. The size of skin necrosis was measured 1 wk after the surgery. The rate of secondary healing, amount of  gain, hair growth, and wound regeneration were measured 2 wk after operation. In acute treatment, sodium valproate (100 mg/kg) reduced significantly the length of skin necrosis (P < 0.05). Administration of bicuculline (competitive antagonist of GABAA, 20 mg/kg) increased the length of skin necrosis (P < 0.05). In addition, administration of 100 mg/kg of sodium valproate and subeffective dose of bicuculline (10 mg/kg) prevented the protective effect of sodium valproate on skin flap necrosis (P < 0.05). In the chronically treated skin flap group, 100 mg/kg of sodium valproate reduced the length of necrosis (P < 0.01).  gain in the valproate group was more than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Skin also healed faster in the sodium valproate group than in the control group (P < 0.001). Combination therapy of sodium valproate and trichostatin A (330 nmol/kg) reversed the effect of valproate (P < 0.05). This study demonstrate that sodium valproate accelerates skin secondary healing in a rat model of skin flap probably through a GABA and histone deacetylase-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since there are numerous surgical techniques, the effects of these on the esophageal function are still poorly understood. We aimed at assessing the effect of different techniques on esophagogastric junction (EGJ), esophageal peristalsis and reflux exposure using high-resolution manometry (HRM), and impedance-pH monitoring (MII-pH).All obese patients underwent symptomatic questionnaires, endoscopy, HRM, and MII-pH before and 1 year after surgery. Esophageal function and EGJ were classified according to Chicago Classification V. 3.0. Intragastric pressure (IGP) and gastroesophageal pressure gradient (GEPG) were assessed. Total  exposure time (AET %), total number of refluxes, and symptom association probability (SAP) were assessed. A group of healthy volunteers (HVs) served as control.One hundred and twelve obese subjects and 15 HVs (normal ) were studied. Thirteen underwent endoscopic balloon placement (BIB), 12 gastric banding (GB), 26 sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 18 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 15 mini-gastric bypass (MGB), 16 biliointestinal bypass (BIBP), and 12 biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). IGP and GEPG significantly decreased after RYGP, BPD, and BPBP, whereas they significantly increased after GB and SG. Post-operative greater AET (p < 0.05) and increased total number of reflux (p < 0.001) were present after GB and SG. RYGB and MGB showed a significant decrease in AET (p < 0.05) and total number of reflux (p < 0.001).HRM verified that different bariatric techniques produced different modification of IGP and GEPG, leading to different reflux exposure. Only GB and SG can negatively impact on esophageal function and reflux exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638214>Effects of β‑hydroxybutyric  and ghrelin on the motility and inflammation of gastric antral smooth muscle cells involving the regulation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that is produced by gastric cells. Ghrelin stimulates food intake and increases gastric movement. In rat model, injected β‑hydroxybutyric  (β‑HB) leads to a decrease in . It has been reported that patients with gastric erosions are slower to evacuate the stomach. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ghrelin and β‑HB on motility and inflammation in rat gastric antral smooth muscle cells (GASMCs). GASMCs were extracted from rat gastric antrum. Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay kit was used to analyze the levels of ROS using flow cytometry. Protein levels were determined using western blotting, and the expression levels of mRNAs were evaluated using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. β‑HB inhibited the expression of myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 (MYL9), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), transforming protein RhoA (RhoA), Rho‑associated protein kinase‑1 (ROCK‑1) and growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS‑R). By contrast, ghrelin increased the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA, ROCK‑1 and GHS‑R in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. β‑HB increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6 and ROS, and decreased the levels of manganese (Mn) superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper/zinc (Cu/Zn)SOD and catalase. Ghrelin decreased the expression of TNF‑α, IL‑6, ROS and catalase, whereas ghrelin promoted the expression of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. Short interfering RNA targeting GHS‑R inhibited the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA and ROCK‑1, and increased the levels of TNF‑α, IL‑6 and ROS in β‑HB‑treated or ghrelin‑treated GASMCs. The present study provided preliminary evidence that β‑HB inhibits the motility of GASMCs and promotes inflammation in GASMCs, whereas ghrelin decreases these effects. GHS‑R acted as a primary regulator of motility and inflammation in GASMCs treated with β‑HB and ghrelin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648122>Unique root exudate tartaric  enhanced cadmium mobilization and uptake in Cd-hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii.</a></h2><p>Low molecular  organic  (LMWOA) involved in heavy metal tolerance, translocation, and accumulation in plants. However, underlying mechanism of LMWOA secretion in metal mobilization and uptake in hyperaccumulator still need to be identified. In this study, a C labeling rhizobox was designed to investigate the composition and distribution of LMWOA in the rhizosphere of S. alfredii. The result showed that about 2.30%, 2.25% and 2.35% of the assimilated C was incorporated into oxalic , malic , and tartaric  in rhizosphere of S. alfredii after CO assimilation, respectively. Oxalic , malic , and tartaric  were the predominant LMWOA in rhizosphere soil solution of hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) S. alfredii, however, almost no tartaric  was detected for non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE). Tartaric  was identified as the unique root exudate from HE S. alfredii which was mainly distributed within the range of rhizosphere 0-6 mm. Tartaric  significantly increased the solubility of four Cd minerals. HE S. alfredii treated with tartrate + CdCO had higher Cd contents and larger biomass than CdCO treatment. Cadmium accumulation in HE S. alfredii was promoted by the exudation of tartaric , which was highly efficient in Cd solubilization due to the formation of soluble Cd-tartrate complexes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, thiolated chitosan-hyaluronic  composite polymeric complex next-generation of the periodontal membrane was manufactured by solvent casting method. FTIR spectroscopic analysis displayed successful immobilization of thiol groups on the manufactured thiolated periodontal membrane. Moreover, XRD, DSC, AFM and TGA of the membrane confirmed the compatibility of ingredients and modifications in surface chemistry. The thiolated periodontal film was also investigated in terms of thickness,  uniformity, water-uptake capacity, drug content, pH, entrapment efficiency, lysozymal degradation and release patterns. Also, mucoadhesion profile was explored on gingival mucosa. The immobilized thiol groups on thiolated chitosan and thiolated hyaluronate were found to be 168 ± 11 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) and 189 ± 8 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) respectively. Swelling capacity of the thiolated periodontal membrane was significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. The obtained thiolated membrane depicted 3 -old higher mucoadhesive features as compared to the un-modified membrane. In vitro release kinetics indicated approximately more than 80% prolonged release within 7 days. Mechanical strength of the Thiolated bandage was also significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. Ex-vivo retention study revealed enhanced retention of thiolated membrane as compared to unmodified membrane. In-vitro antimicrobial studies demonstrated that thiolated membrane could efficiently kill Porphyromonas gingivalis cells as compared to the native membrane. Moreover, ex-vivo biodegradation results indicated that 90% of the thiolated membrane was biodegradable in 28 days. Based on these findings, thiolated next-generation of the periodontal membrane seems to be promising for periodontitis therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619635>In Vivo Colonic Fermentation of Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.): Important Correlations Observed among the Physiological Parameters of Cecum, Liver, Adipose Tissue and Fasting Serum Lipid Profile.</a></h2><p>High amylose corn starch (HAS), whole grain sorghum (S-Wh), refined sorghum (S-Rf) and α-corn starch (CON) diets were fed to animals for 1 mo aiming to examine the physiological effects of resistant starch inclusion in the diet from grains.

These compounds contaminate the soil and harm plant productivity during unchecked disposal of textile effluent to the farm soil. Environmental and safety concerns associated with crops, soil, and human health encourage the exploration of biological tools to control the issue. We hereby propose the application of biosurfactant (lipopeptide) to reduce the toxic effects of azulene and chromium in plants. Results of the study indicated that the augmentation of biosurfactant with azulene and chromium promoted seed germination, plant biomass, specific leaf  (SLW), chlorophyll content, protein content, soluble sugar and ascorbic  concentration in cultivars of wheat and chilli. Decreasing the level of proline under biosurfactant augmentation further confirms the reduction of oxidative stress caused by azulene and chromium amendment. The results indicated that lipopeptide biosurfactant could be an effective biological tool to reduce the toxic effect of persistent substances in soil, thus maintaining soil health and sustainable agriculture.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In a quest to better understand the non-enzymatic browning of shelf-stable orange juice during storage, the juice was fractionated into different fractions depending on the solubility in water/ethanol and the obtained fractions were characterized. The results showed that brown compounds formed during storage of orange juice distributed over water insoluble (pulp), ethanol insoluble (cloud), and ethanol soluble (serum) fractions. In the ethanol insoluble fraction, the brown compounds are hypothesized to be associated to proteins, arabinogalactan proteins and/or protein-pectin complexes of this fraction without significantly changing their molecular  distribution, monosaccharide composition, and protein content. The changes in the ethanol soluble fraction including ascorbic  degradation, -catalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose, and formation of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were highly correlated to the browning development of the juice during storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636375>Saturated fatty  is a principal cause of anxiety-like behavior in diet-induced obese rats in relation to serum lysophosphatidyl choline level.</a></h2><p>Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for neurodegenerative- and psychiatric- diseases including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. A high-lard diet is widely used to induce obesity in model animal experiments, which also leads to anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. However, the contribution of dietary fat source to these abnormal behaviors in obesity is largely unknown.Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different types of high-fat (lard and olive oil) diet with high sucrose for more than 8 weeks. Anxiety-like behavior (open-field and social interaction tests) and cognitive function (Y-maze test) after the treatment were analyzed. The expression of mRNA related to neurotransmitter and nutrient transporters in the prefrontal cortex were determined using real-time PCR. Serum lipid species were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.Both high-fat/high-sucrose diets increased  (BW), adipose tissue, and serum leptin level. However, the high-lard/high-sucrose (HL/HS), but not high-olive oil/HS, diet induced anxiety-like behavior in open field and social interaction tests. BW and endocrine hormones such as leptin and insulin were not correlated to anxiety-like behavior. HL/HS diet induced an increase in glutamate transporter and a decrease of glutamate receptor mRNA expressions in the prefrontal cortex. Further, serum lysophosphatidyl choline conjugated with several fatty  was decreased by HL/HS diet. LPC conjugated with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) was strongly correlated with anxiety-like behavior.These results suggest that lipid composition, rather than obesity per se, is a major cause of anxiety-like behavior in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Decreased levels of peripheral LPC conjugated with EPA and altered glutamate system in the prefrontal cortex might be involve in the pathophysiology of the behavioral change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric  was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric  has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the -reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose  is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric .Copyright © 2019 Per G.

The yield of gelatin (G3, G4, G5, G8, and G9, respectively) was 49-55% of the dry raw material. The influence of extraction pH on the physicochemical and functional properties of gelatin was studied. Sample G5 was characterized by higher protein content (92.8%) while lower protein content was obtained for sample G3 (86.5%) extracted under more aggressive conditions. Analysis of the molecular  distribution showed the presence of α- and β-chains as major components; the molecular  of the samples ranged between 130 and 150 kDa, with sample G5 having the highest molecular . IR spectra of all samples had absorption bands characteristic of fish gelatin. The study of the secondary structure demonstrated higher amounts of ordered triple collagen-like helices for G5 extracted under mild conditions. Accordingly, sample G5 formed gels with high values for the storage modulus and gelling and melting temperatures, which decrease as pH changes into acidic or alkaline regions. In addition, the differential scanning calorimetry data showed that G5 had a higher glass transition temperature and melting enthalpy. Thus, cod skin is an excellent source of gelatin with the necessary physicochemical and functional properties, depending on the appropriate choice of aqueous phase pH for the extraction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668383>Metformin prevents the pathological browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Browning, the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to a beige phenotype, has gained interest as a strategy to induce  loss and improve insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Two dietary treatments (pelleted complete feed supplemented without (control diet; CON) or with 0.05% LPL on dry matter basis) were tested in these experiments. Feed and water were provided  to lambs. The results showed that average daily gain (ADG) tended to increase or was not affected by LPL supplementation. Compared with CON, the supplementation of LPL resulted in an increase in dry matter, crude protein and organic matter digestibilities, and a decrease in neutral detergent fiber and  detergent fiber digestibilities. Ruminal pH values did not change with LPL supplementation, but the concentrations of ammonia and total short chain fatty  (SCFAs) were increased. The molar proportion of major individual SCFAs and the ratio of acetate to propionate were not affected by LPL supplementation. While the activity of lipase was decreased with LPL supplementation, all other serum biochemical parameters did not change. Rumen bacterial community was altered by LPL supplementation with the relative abundance of fibrolytic bacteria in the total bacterial population, such as , decreased. In conclusion, LPL supplementation can alter feed digestion, but may not result in consistent positive responses in animal growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662651>Seasonal Variation in Helminth Parasites of Snakeheads  and  (Perciformes: Channidae) in Uttar Pradesh, India.</a></h2><p>Snakehead fishes are widely consumed throughout South East Asia, China and India because of their good taste of meat and high nutrient values such as presence of prostaglandins, thromboxane and Omega-6 fatty .

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed  gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However,  fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the bio-HS that contained humic  (HA) and fulvic  (FA) from effluent and activated sludge were isolated and purified with XAD-8 resin and ion exchange resin, and then the molecular , functional groups, contents and forms of phosphorus (P) using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), element analysis and P nuclear magnetic resonance (P-NMR) were investigated. The results showed that HS was formed in biological wastewater treatment systems, and had a lower degree of humification than soil, peat, or marine HS, and mainly comprised diester and monoester P fragments. Specific signal peaks of intracellular materials and cell membranes (nucleic , phospholipids, and sugar phosphate) showed that microbial cell debris was the precursor of bio-HS. HA comprised diester P fragments and monoester P fragments that formed when diester P fragments degraded, while FA contained only diester P fragments. The monoester P fragments in HA may result from microbial degradation of diester P fragments, and FA may simultaneously condense into HA.

Here, inspired by natural sponges, a novel of multi-functional polymer sponges was developed which were fabricated by ice-templating with multi-functional amine (PEI) and diepoxide cross-linker (PEG-DE) for highly efficient harvesting of dyes and simultaneous pure water recovery both in mechanic pressing and filtration processes. The as-prepared sponge (SP-1) was further modified by poly(caffeic ) through a simple dipping-crosslinking process to obtain the hybrid polymer sponge (SP-2), which showed higher compress strength than SP-1. These sponges possessed a crosslinked three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure with quick water absorbing property over ten times of their own  within 20 seconds directed by capillary. The adsorption behavior of the obtained polymer sponges to eleven hydrophilic dyes was studied in detail by mechanic induced separation. All these polymer sponges exhibited the high selective adsorption to hydrophilic dyes in water. For example, SP-1 has high adsorption capacity over 150 μmol/g to Erythrosin B (ETB), which is 20 times higher than that of Calcein. With the modified poly(caffeic ) layer, SP-2 exhibited a different adsorption properties for Methylene Blue (MB, 180 μmol/g) to SP-1(~0 μmol/g), indicating that the tailorable structures of sponge can regulate their selectivity to guest molecules. Based on the unique recognition to guest molecules, the methodology of dynamic separation of dye's mixture in water was demonstrated by using these sponges through mechanical pressing or fast filtration, which provides a facile alternative with easy-operation for water purification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634777>Ferulic , a natural polyphenol, protects against osteoporosis by activating SIRT1 and NF-κB in neonatal rats with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis is a chronic disease whose symptoms include a reduction in bone strength, osteopenia, and damage to the bone microstructure. Ferulic  are natural polyphenols present in various fruits that suppress the fusion and apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. Rats were divided into sham, control (osteoporosis), 10 mg/kg  ferulic , 20 mg/kg  ferulic , and 30 mg/kg  ferulic  treatment groups. Osteoporosis was induced in neonatal by administration of dexamethasone (glucocorticoids). Bone mineral density (BMD), osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, bone mechanical parameters, and mRNA and protein levels of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) in the osteoporotic neonatal rats were assessed. Histopathological analysis was also conducted. Treatment with 20 and 30 mg/kg  ferulic  increased BMD by 25% and 141.7%, respectively, but reduced ALP and osteocalcin levels. Furthermore, treatment with 20 or 30 mg/kg  ferulic  significantly reduced the pixel intensity and significantly increased the peak load and ultimate stiffness. Ferulic  significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 and reduced those of NF-κB. Finally, the histopathological analysis showed that ferulic  increased BMD. In summary, ferulic  exhibited protective effects against osteoporosis in neonatal rats.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Responses to an initial herbivore may change a number of plant traits that subsequently alter ecological processes with additional herbivores. Although common, indirect interactions between taxonomically distant herbivores, such as mammals and insects, are less studied than between taxonomically related species (i.e., insect-insect). In terms of mammal-insect interactions, effects on insect numbers (e.g., density) are relatively well studied, whereas effects on performance (e.g., fecundity) are rarely explored. Moreover, few studies have explored mammal-insect interactions on coniferous plants.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mammalian induced responses on insect performance. We specifically investigated the effect of moose () browsing on Scots pine () and subsequent effects on sawfly () performance.Sawfly larvae were reared on browsed, clipped, and unbrowsed control pine trees in a controlled field experiment. Afterward, cocoon  was measured. Needle C:N ratio and di-terpene content were measured in response to browsing.Sawfly performance was enhanced on trees browsed by moose. Cocoon  (proxy for fecundity) was 9 and 13% higher on browsed and clipped trees compared to unbrowsed trees. Cocoon  was weakly related to needle C:N ratio, and browsed trees had lower a C:N ratio compared to unbrowsed trees. Needle di-terpene content, known to affect sawfly performance, was neither affected by the browsing treatments nor did it correlate with sawfly .We conclude that mammalian herbivory can affect insect herbivore performance, with potential consequences for ecological communities and with particular importance for insect population dynamics. The measured plant variables could not fully explain the effect on sawfly performance providing a starting point for the consideration of additional plant responses induced by mammalian browsing affecting insect performance.© 2019 The Authors.

ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry  ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry  ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the mitochondria of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641317>Morphological and molecular identification of  (Trematode: Paramphistomoidea) from Sumatran elephant ().</a></h2><p>Paramphistomiasis is common in tropical countries such as Indonesia and affects livestock and various endemic wild animals such as Sumatran elephants.

Heparin is synthesized in mast cells as a polymer from glucuronic  and glucosamine residues, 10 to 15 of which are attached to a core protein resulting in a large proteoglycan of 750,000 to 1,000,000 daltons. This complex is then modified extensively and then degraded into glycosaminoglycan chains of 5000 to 30,000 daltons. Heparin for therapeutic use in humans is generally made from extracts of bovine lung or porcine intestinal mucosa and consists of a heterogeneous mixture of glycosaminoglycans of slightly different structures and molecular . Commercial preparations of heparin are standardized as USP units/mg. Low molecular  heparins (1000 to 10,000 daltons) are isolated from standard heparin preparations, which are then partially depolymerized and purified by gel chromatography and alcohol precipitation. Commercial preparations of low molecular  heparins are standardized in a bioassay based upon inhibition of coagulation factor Xa. Heparin is a large glycosaminoglycan and is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal mucosa and must be given intravenously or by subcutaneous injection. Heparin is used as the initial treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism because of its rapid onset of action, while awaiting the slower onset of activity of oral anticoagulants (such as warfarin). Heparin is also used in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina and in prophylaxis of venous thrombosis during and/or after surgery. In addition, heparin is used to maintain patency of intravenous indwelling catheters (“heparin lock”), usually in low doses (10 to 100 units), and is not meant for therapeutic purposes. Recently, low molecular  heparins have replaced standard heparin in many situations, their advantage being a more predictable pharmacokinetics which allows for subcutaneous administration and outpatient management. The major side effects of heparin therapy are related to excessive bleeding and anticoagulation. However, heparin (both standard and low molecular  forms) also has somewhat idiosyncratic side effects which includes hypersensitivity reactions, thrombocytopenia and serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, a large proportion of patients given standard or low molecular  heparin intravenously develop serum ALT and AST elevations arising after 4 to 8 days of therapy that are usually asymptomatic and self-limited, lasting only 4 to 20 days and resolving sometimes even with continuation of treatment. The cause of these elevations is not known, but they are rarely associated with any symptoms. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated in a small proportion of cases but bilirubin levels are rarely above normal. For obvious reasons, the liver histological changes accompanying the aminotransferase elevations during heparin therapy has not been described.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669276>The antioxidant activities of balsam pear polysaccharide.</a></h2><p>The antioxidant activities of polysaccharide from balsam pear were studied.

Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) are necessary for the 's metabolism, growth and development. Although PUFAs play an important role in the regulation of female reproduction, their role in ovarian development in PCOS is still unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different ratios of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (omega-3/omega-6) on ovary development in PCOS rats. Serum levels of reproductive hormones and enzymes related to steroidogenesis were assessed. The results indicated that PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) significantly increased ovarian  and improved the ovarian structure although they had no significant effect on  in PCOS rats. Meanwhile, apoptosis was attenuated accompanied by increased cell proliferation by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15). Moreover, serum levels of hormones (FSH and E2) were also significantly increased by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) accompanied by decreased T levels. To investigate whether PUFAs regulate the expression of enzymes related to hormone synthesis, western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of CYP51, CYP19, StAR and 3β-HSD. The results showed that PUFAs significantly increased the protein levels of all of these enzymes. These results indicate that PUFAs enhance the reproductive performance of PCOS by increasing the expression of steroidogenesis enzymes, which are related to hormone secretion and ovarian functions. These findings provide evidence that a balanced n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is beneficial for PCOS reproduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656520>Humic  as a feed additive in poultry diets: a review.</a></h2><p>Many studies tested different feed additives, among these additives, humic substances (HS) have been used in livestock and poultry diets.

Moreover, methods for enhancing the hardness of potatoes after boiling are underexplored. In this study, the hardness of potato slices after boiling were increased from 288 g to 2342 g by the combined treatment of lactic  (LA) and calcium chloride (CC). Through the analysis of the microstructure of the potato cells, the molecular  distribution and natural sugar ratio of different soluble pectin fractions, and the enzymatic activities (polygalacturonase, PG and pectin methylesterase, PME), the possible mechanism behind the hardness enhancement by LA and CC pretreatment, namely the direct link between pectin and potato structure was revealed. The obtained results confirmed the target spot for enhancing the hardness of potatoes after boiling lay in PG activity and gelation of the pectin, which also could be used to help other plants resist the heat process if pectin existed in their cell wall.Copyright © 2019.

Its chemical composition is strongly correlated with, and dependent on, genetic characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variation in seed yield, oil content, fatty  composition and secondary metabolite profiles between a low-linolenic linseed variety, belonging to the Solin-type group (Solal), and a high-linolenic traditional one (Bethune), cultivated, both as spring crops, in open field conditions of Central Italy. The achieved results pointed out the different behavior of the two varieties in terms of growth cycle, oil content, and some important yield components, such as capsule number per plant and thousand seed . There were also significant differences in seed composition regarding total phenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant activities as well as in carotenoid, tocopherol, and tocotrienol profiles between the two varieties. In particular, Solal was characterized by the greatest contents of oil, phenols, flavonoids, α- and δ- tocotrienol, together with the highest antioxidant activity. Bethune, on the contrary, showed the highest amounts of carotenoids (lutein and β-carotene). These results indicate a clear effect of the genetic characteristics on the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites and, consequently, on the related antioxidant activity. Our findings suggest that the mutation process, responsible for the selection of the low-linolenic cultivar, is able to modify the biosynthetic pathways of carotenoids and phenolics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648859>Vocal Characteristics of Patients With Morbid Obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity modifies vocal characteristics, causing abnormal fat deposition in the abdominal region and upper airways.

The vocal self-evaluation did not record any relevant complaints in both groups. In obese, the perceptual-auditory voice evaluations indicated significant changes in R (roughness), B (breathiness), I (instability), and S (tension) parameters. Acoustic vocal analysis recorded changes in the noise-harmonic ratio (NHR) and soft phonation index (SPI) parameters. The videolaryngoscopy examinations showed, in control and obese groups, respectively: normal: 92.5% and 55.5%; posterior pachydermia: 11.1% and 33.3%; mid-posterior bowing: 0% and 7.4%; edema/congestion: 0% and 7.40%.The voice of the obese becomes discreetly hoarse, breathless, and unstable. The most frequent videolaryngoscopic findings in obese patients are hyperemia and edema of vocal folds and posterior pachydermia, related to  laryngitis, secondary to gastroesophageal reflux.Copyright © 2019 The Voice Foundation.

To use MLR, firstly the most important input data were selected, and then, the best model to predict the taste of orange was applied. In this research, methodology of ANFIS consisted of selection of dependent orange taste, fuzzification, fuzzy inference rule, membership function, and defuzzification process. The predictive capability of these models was evaluated by various descriptive statistical indicators such as mean square error () and determination coefficient ( ). The results showed that the prediction performance of the MLR model has a strong significant relationship between orange taste and vitamin C (0.897), red color (0.901), and blue color (0.713). Also, the results of ANFIS model showed that with low error for train and check data increased the most accuracy for prediction of orange taste.

The present study investigated the anaerobic digestion (AD) performances of HTL-AP under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions, and molecular and metabolic analysis were conducted to provide insights into the different performances. The results showed that thermophilic AD had lower COD removal efficiency compared to mesophilic AD (45.0% vs. 61.6%). Liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection and organic nitrogen (LC-OCD-OND) analysis showed that both high molecular  (HMW) and low molecular  (LMW) compounds were degraded to some extent and more LMW  (LMWA) and recalcitrant aromatic compounds were degraded in the mesophilic reactor, which was the main reason of higher COD removal efficiency. Phenyl compounds (e.g. phenol and 2 methoxyphenol), furans and pyrazines were the recalcitrant chemicals detected through GC-MS analysis. Fourier transform ion cyclone resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis demonstrated the complexity of HTL-AP and the proportions of phenolic or condensed aromatic compounds increased especially in the thermophilic effluents. Metabolites analysis showed that the reasons contributing to the differences of mesophilic and thermophilic AD were not only related to the degradation of organic compounds (e.g. benzoate degradation via CoA ligation) in HTL-AP but also related to the microbial autogenesis (e.g. fatty  biosynthesis) as well as the environmental information processing. In addition, the enrichment of Mesotoga, responsible for the high degradation efficiency of LMWA, and Pelolinea, involved in the degradation of phenyl compounds, were found in mesophilic reactor, which was consistent with higher removal of corresponding organics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This new class of soft materials combines the anisotropy of LLCs with the mechanical stability of a physical gel. The studied LLC system consists of sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant, -decanol as a cosurfactant, and water as a solvent. At room temperature, four liquid crystalline phases (lamellar L, nematic N and N, and hexagonal H) are formed depending on the composition. We were successful in gelling the lyotropic lamellar phase with the low-molecular- organogelator 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic  (12-HOA). The obtained gelled lamellar phase shows optical birefringence, elastic response, and no macroscopic flow. However, we were not able to obtain gels with hexagonal or nematic structure. These findings can be explained twofold. When gelling the hexagonal phase, the long-range hexagonal order was destroyed and an isotropic gel was formed. The reason might be the incompatibility between the gel fiber network and the two-dimensional long-range translational order of the cylindrical micelles in the hexagonal phase. Otherwise, the lyotropic nematic phase was transformed into an anisotropic gel with the lamellar structure during gelation. Evidently, the addition of the gelator 12-HOA to the lyotropic system considerably widens the lamellar regime because the integration of the surface-active 12-HOA gelator molecules into the nematic micelles flattens out the micelle curvature. We further investigated the successfully gelated L phase to examine the impacts of the gel network and the remaining monomeric gelator on both the structure and properties of the gelled lamellar phase. Small-angle X-ray scattering results showed an arrested lamellar layer spacing in the gelled state, which indicates a higher translational order for the gelled lamellar phases in comparison with their gelator-free counterparts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649705>Ripening Indices, Olive Yield and Oil Quality in Response to Irrigation With Saline Reclaimed Water and Deficit Strategies.</a></h2><p>The 70% worldwide surface of olive orchards is irrigated. The evaluation of non-conventional water resources and water-saving techniques has gained importance during the last decades in arid and semiarid environments. This study evaluated the effects of irrigation with two water sources: low-cost water DEsalination and SEnsoR Technology (DESERT) desalinated water (DW) EC ∼1 dS m) and reclaimed water (RW) (EC ∼ 3 dS m) combined with two irrigation strategies: full irrigation (FI) (100% of ET) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI, 50% of ET) on fruit yield, ripening indices, and oil yield and quality of olive trees cv Arbosana planted in Mediterranean conditions. Our results showed that RW without water restrictions increased the fruit yield by 35% due to a slight increase in the fruit  and, mainly, to a greater fruit set than the control trees; although this did not result in a higher oil yield (g tree) since the oil content per fruit dry  was reduced. The RDI strategy did not decrease the fruit yield despite the fact that olive  tended to decrease, and it increased the oil yield by ∼14.5%. The combination of both stresses (RW and RDI) neither decreased the fruit yield; however, it significantly reduced oil yield (25% less in 2018) since oil content per fruit dry  was strongly reduced (40%) compared to control trees. Both RDI treatments, regardless water source, determined acidity levels in olive paste lower than in FI treatments; however, it reduced oil extractability and fatty yield. The finding about oil quality indicated that olive exposure to RW, regardless of the water amount, decreased oil quality mainly due to the reduction of oleic  and the increase of C18:2/C18:3 ratio and peroxides; on the contrary, both RW and RDI improved the total polyphenols. In all cases, the parameters met the legislation. In short, with appropriate management, RW and RDI have great potential to manage oil olive production; nevertheless, studies subjected to long-term use of these techniques should be experienced to ensure the sustainability of oil yields and quality.Copyright © 2019 Romero-Trigueros, Vivaldi, Nicolás, Paduano, Salcedo and Camposeo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623084>Synthesis of Lignin-based Phenol Terminated Hyperbranched Polymer.</a></h2><p>In this work, we proved the efficient synthesis of a bio-based hyper-branched polyphenol from a modified lignin degradation fragment.

The composition, chain conformation and rheological properties were investigated. PPS mainly consisted of arabinose, galacturonic , xylose, and rhamnose. The intrinsic viscosity [η] was 0.71 dL/g in 0.1 M NaNO solution. The -average molar mass Mw and polydispersity index were 3.77 × 10 g/mol and 1.25, suggesting high homogeneity. The average radius of gyration (R), hydrodynamic radius (R), R/R ratio and conformation parameter v were 25.5, 18.2, 1.40 and 0.21, respectively, indicating compact coil chain conformation with branched structure. Molecular morphology revealed that PPS displayed chain shape comprised of spheres with a diameter range of 15-50 nm and apparent length of chains mainly ranged from 100 to 300 nm. The aggregation caused by molecular self-association enhanced with concentration increasing. Additionally, Newtonian behavior was observed at various concentrations. Increase in temperature effectively broke this behavior. 10.0 wt.% PPS possessed activation energy of 21.7 KJ/mol, was structured liquid and almost fitted Cox-Merz rule.

(2015), we have shown that lignosulfonic , a commercially available lignin derivative, possesses broad antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) by preventing viral entry into susceptible target cells. Because of the interesting safety profile as potential microbicide, we now determined the antiviral activity of a series of lignosulfonates in order to understand better which molecular features can contribute to their antiviral activity. Here, 24 structurally different lignosulfonates were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit HIV and HSV transmission and replication in various cellular assays. These derivatives differ in origin (hardwood or softwood), counter-ion used during sulphite processing (Na, Ca, or NH), sulphur content, carboxylic  percentage, and molecular  fraction, which allowed to determine structure-activity relationships. We demonstrate that the broad antiviral activity of lignosulfonates is mainly dependent on their molecular  and that their mechanism of action is based on interactions with the viral envelope glycoproteins. This makes the lignosulfonates a potential low-cost microbicide that protects women from sexual HIV and HSV transmission and thus prevents life-long infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we incorporated a simple hard-template approach to synthesise single crystal nanoplates of HA. We used the 2D graphitic nitride (g-C3N4) material to prepare an HA sol-gel under hydrothermal conditions. A new HA nanostructure was then formed during the calcination and removal of g-C3N4 at a higher temperature, which finally led to the production of nanoplates (thickness of ∼100 nm) while in lateral dimension the average size was in the micrometre scale. We characterised the synthesised HA nanoplates with XRD, TEM, and HRTEM. The theoretically predicted nanostructure construction based on Wulff's method is in full agreement with the experimental observations. We then prepared different  ratios of HA and polylactic  (PLA) composites for artificial 3D bone fabrication. The strong interaction between PLA and HA's (110) facet, which was the second most prevalent, resulted in the composite's mechanical robustness.

In the present study, 36 castrated Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire pigs with an average  of 71.25 ± 2.40 kg were randomly divided into three treatments and fed with a basal diet supplemented with 0, 400, or 800 mg kg-1 APPs for 7 weeks. The results showed that dietary 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation not only decreased backfat thickness and abdominal adipose tissue index but also decreased L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. The LD muscle crude protein content, the proportions of essential amino , flavor amino , and total amino , as well as the amino  transporter (SLC7A1, SLC7A2, SLC7A7, SLC1A2) mRNA levels were increased by 800 mg kg-1 APPs. The proportions of docosahexaenoic  and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) and the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty  in LD muscle were increased by 400 mg kg-1 APPs. Meanwhile, dietary 400 mg kg-1 and 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation decreased the contents of blood urea nitrogen and total cholesterol, as well as increased the content of inosinic  in LD muscle. In conclusion, these results suggested that dietary 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation improved the carcass traits, meat color, and meat flavor in finishing pigs. These results also suggested that dietary 400 mg kg-1 and 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation improved the meat nutritional value in finishing pigs. The present study provides effective evidence for the application of APP supplementation for healthy high-quality and nutritional value pork production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669589>VDR regulates energy metabolism by modulating remodeling in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole  was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in , fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

Evidence on the influence of gastrostomy placement on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of gastrostomy on gastro-oesophageal reflux.A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was performed including 50 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrostomy between May 2012 and April 2014. Before and 3 months after surgery 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring was performed and caregivers filled out reflux symptom questionnaires.Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms were present in a comparable number of patients before (44%) and after gastrostomy placement (40%; P = 0.73). Twenty-five of the patients (50%) underwent both the preoperative and postoperative tests and were included in impedance-pH analysis.  exposure time (percentage of time with pH below 4) did not change significantly after gastrostomy placement: from 6.2% (3.0-18.1) to 6.1% (2.6-14.9). The number of reflux episodes did not significantly change, for either liquid [mean difference 4.3 (-4.5 to 13.2)] or mixed liquid-gas reflux [mean difference 2.0 (-9.3 to 13.3)]. Before gastrostomy placement, 18 out of 25 patients had pathological reflux (72%) on pH-impedance measurement. In 4 patients, pathological reflux dissolved, whereas 4 patients newly developed pathological reflux. A low preoperative -for-height percentile was associated with increased  exposure after gastrostomy placement.Overall, gastrostomy placement was not associated with an increase in  exposure on 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring. Similarly, the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux-related symptoms did not change after gastrostomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670436>Widely adaptable oil-in-water gel emulsions stabilized by an amphiphilic hydrogelator derived from dehydroabietic .</a></h2><p>A novel surfactant, 6-((1 R ,4a S )-7-isopropyl-1,4a-dimethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,10a-octahydro-phenanthrene-1-carboxamido)- N , N - dimethylhexan-1-amine oxide (abbreviated as R-6-AO) derived from dehydroabietic  has been synthesized which behaves as a highly efficient low molecular  hydrogelator with an extremely low critical gelation concentration (CGC) of 0.18 wt.% (4 mM). As a typical surfactant, R-6-AO not only stabilizes oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions at concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.6 mM, but also forms gel emulsions at concentrations beyond the CGC with the oil volume fraction freely adjustable between 2% and 95%. Cryo-TEM images reveal that R-6-AO molecules self-assemble into left-handed helical fibers with cross-sectional diameters of about 10 nm in pure water which can be turned to very stable hydrogels at concentrations above the CGC. Compared with traditional high internal phase emulsions, the gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO can be prepared with different oils such as n-dodecane, n-decane, n-octane, soybean oil, olive oil and tricaprylin, due to the tricyclic diterpene hydrophobic structure in their molecules which enable them to adopt a unique arrangement in the fibers. The intriguing properties of gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO are believed to be significant and helpful for the preparation of new soft materials and other applications.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Biomolecules exhibit a wide range of functions and structures, including chemical recognition (of enzyme substrates or adhesive ligands, for instance), exquisite nanostructures (composed of peptides, proteins or nucleic ), and unusual mechanical properties (such as silk-like strength, stiffness, viscoelasticity and resiliency). Here we combine the computational design of physical (noncovalent) interactions with pathway-dependent, hierarchical 'click' covalent assembly to produce hybrid synthetic peptide-based polymers. The nanometre-scale monomeric units of these polymers are homotetrameric, α-helical bundles of low-molecular- peptides. These bundled monomers, or 'bundlemers', can be designed to provide complete control of the stability, size and spatial display of chemical functionalities. The protein-like structure of the bundle allows precise positioning of covalent linkages between the ends of distinct bundlemers, resulting in polymers with interesting and controllable physical characteristics, such as rigid rods, semiflexible or kinked chains, and thermally responsive hydrogel networks. Chain stiffness can be controlled by varying only the linkage. Furthermore, by controlling the amino  sequence along the bundlemer periphery, we use specific amino  side chains, including non-natural 'click' chemistry functionalities, to conjugate moieties into a desired pattern, enabling the creation of a wide variety of hybrid nanomaterials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634706>Transport of Cd through saturated porous media: Insight into the effects of low-molecular- organic .</a></h2><p>Low-molecular- organic  (LMWOAs) are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and consequently may affect the heavy metal transport in aquifer systems. In this study, the influences of LMWOAs on the transport of Cd under different pH conditions in saturated porous media were evaluated. For this, three LMWOAs such as acetic , tartaric , and citric  were employed. A two-site nonequilibrium transport model was applied to simulate the transport data. Under acidic conditions (pH 5.0), the results indicated that LMWOAs inhibited the transport of Cd even at the low concentrations of organic  (i.e., 0.05 and 0.1 mM). The inhibition effects might be attributed to the complexation role of the sand surface-bound organic  and also electrostatic interaction. Meanwhile, the inhibition effects of LMWOAs on Cd transport in the following order of citric  > tartaric  > acetic , which was also in agreement with the decreasing complex stability constants between Cd and LMWOAs. This order may be dependent on their molecular structures (i.e., amount and type of functional groups) and complexing strength. Interestingly, when the LMWOA concentrations 0.5 mM, tartaric  and citric  still inhibited Cd transport, while acetic  slightly enhanced the Cd mobility due to its weaker complexing strength. However, under neutral conditions (pH 7.0), LMWOAs generally enhanced the transport of Cd. The transport-enhancement of LMWOAs was ascribed to the formation of stable aqueous non-adsorbing Cd-organic  complexes. In addition, citric  could obviously inhibit the transport of Cd under competitive transport conditions (i.e., with competing cations), which is mainly due to different complex affinities of citric  to Pb and Cd. These findings demonstrate that LMWOAs may inhibit or facilitate Cd transport under different environmental conditions. Thus, environmental assessment concerning the transport of heavy metals should consider the roles of organic .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and , and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty -binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition.

Recently, a technology platform to produce VLP based on the small surface protein (dS) of the duck hepatitis B virus was established. In this study, chimeric VLP were investigated displaying the 195 N-terminal amino  derived from the glycoprotein E2 of the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) on their surface. Isolation of the VLP from methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha was allowed upon co-expression of wild-type dS and a fusion protein composed of the BVDV-derived antigen N-terminally fused to the dS. It was shown the VLP could be purified by a process adapted from the production of a recombinant hepatitis B VLP vaccine. However, the process essentially depended on costly ultracentrifugation which is critical for low cost production. In novel process variants, this step was avoided after modification of the initial batch capture step, the introduction of a precipitation step and adjusting the ion exchange chromatography. The product yield could be improved by almost factor 8 to 93 ± 12 mg VLP protein per 100 g dry cell  while keeping similar product purity and antigenicity. This allows scalable and cost efficient VLP production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The process of gelation is generally considered to arise from immobilization of the solvents in the three-dimensional networks formed by the assembly of gelator molecules through weak intermolecular noncovalent interactions. From these points of view a huge number of organogelators have been developed so far. In the course of our research on LMOGs we have noticed a mixture of two gelators could show a different trend in gelation compared to the single gelator. It is well known that the catecholic moiety easily forms cyclic boronate esters with the boronic . Thus, we have investigated the two-component system based on cyclic boronate esters formed by the catechols and a boronic  in terms of the control of gelation capability. Basic gelation properties of the constituent catecholic gelators have also been clarified. The catecholic gelators with the amide unit form no gel by addition of the boronic . In contrast, the catecholic gelators with the glutamic  moiety improve their gelation abilities by mixing with the boronic . Furthermore, the gelation ability of the catecholic gelators having the urea unit is maintained after addition of the boronic . It has been found that gelation abilities of the catecholic gelators are highly affected by addition of the boronic .

Serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and glucose tolerance were measured. Fecal BA composition was determined through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The gene expression of BA synthase in the liver and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated BA negative feedback regulation pathway in the liver and ileum were analyzed via RNA analysis.HFCCD resulted in abnormal cholesterol levels in the serum and liver. LF intervention significantly increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 24.9% and decreased the hepatic total cholesterol content by 26%. LF treatment significantly increased the BA content per gram by 109.8%, the total amount of BA excretion by 153.5% and conjugated BAs by 87.6% in the feces.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of liver mitochondria in hepatoprotection of betulin using a rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis induced by ethanol administration (4 g/kg, intragastric) for 8 weeks. The treatment with betulin (50 and 100 mg/kg b.w., intragastric) during this period attenuated the histological signs of steatohepatitis and lowered the serum and liver triglyceride contents, as well as the serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Betulin (100 mg/kg) decreased the liver/ ratio and inhibited the increase in the serum levels of TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and hyaluronic , demonstrating hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic potential. Betulin also inhibited the formation of superoxide anions in mitochondria and the end-products of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue, the amount of which was significantly increased in ethanol-treated rats. The disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and decreasing of mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities in rats with steatohepatitis, were reverted by betulin administration. The increased susceptibility of mitochondria to Ca-induced permeability transition pore formation in the hepatitis group was improved in rats treated with betulin. In conclusion, betulin, having antioxidant properties, exerts a beneficial effect in the rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis via prevention of liver mitochondria dysfunction, which may be attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673504>Safety evaluation of calcium L-methylfolate.</a></h2><p>Calcium L-methylfolate (L-5-MTHF-Ca; CAS Number 151533-22-1) is a source of folate and an alternative to folic  for use in human food and food supplements.

Using a model of prenatal maternal 70% food restriction diet (FR30) in rat, we previously showed that maternal undernutrition predisposes offspring to altered lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, especially under high-fat (HF) diet. Here, using microarray-based expression profiling combined with metabolic, endocrine, biochemical, histological and lipidomic approaches, we assessed whether FR30 procedure sensitizes adult male offspring to impaired lipid metabolism in the liver. No obvious differences were noted in the concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and bile  in the liver of 4-month-old FR30 rats whatever the post-weaning diet used. However, several clues suggest that offspring's lipid metabolism and steatosis are modified by maternal undernutrition. First, lipid composition was changed (i.e., higher total saturated fatty  and lower elaidic ) in the liver whereas larger triglyceride droplets were observed in hepatocytes of undernourished rats. Second, FR30 offspring exhibited - impact on hepatic gene expression and lipid metabolism pathways under chow diet. Although the transcriptome profile was globally modified by maternal undernutrition, cholesterol and bile  biosynthesis pathways appear as key targets indicating that FR30 animals were predisposed to impaired hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Third, FR30 procedure markedly modifies hepatic gene transcription profiles in undernourished offspring in response to post-weaning HF. Overall, FR30 offspring may exhibit impaired metabolic flexibility which does not enable them to properly cope with post-weaning nutritional challenges influencing the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620014>Cold Induced Depot-Specific Browning in Ferret Aortic Perivascular Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue is responsible for facultative thermogenesis to produce heat and increase energy expenditure in response to proper stimuli, e.g., cold. Acquisition of brown-like features (browning) in perivascular white adipose tissue (PVAT) may protect against obesity/cardiovascular disease. Most browning studies are performed in rodents, but translation to humans would benefit from a closer animal model. Therefore, we studied the browning response of ferret thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT) to cold. We performed global transcriptome analysis of tPVAT of 3-month-old ferrets acclimatized 1 week to 22 or 4°C, and compared the results with those of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize browning. Transcriptome data revealed a stronger cold exposure response of tPVAT, including increased expression of key brown/brite markers, compared to subcutaneous fat. This translated into a clear white-to-brown remodeling of tPVAT, with the appearance of multilocular highly UCP1-stained adipocytes. The pathway most affected by cold exposure in tPVAT was immune response, characterized by down-regulation of immune-related genes, with cardio protective implications. On the other hand, subcutaneous fat responded to cold by increasing energy metabolism based on increased expression of fatty  oxidation and tricarboxylic  cycle genes, concordant with lower inguinal adipose tissue  in cold-exposed animals. Thus, ferret tPVAT responds to cold acclimation with a strong induction of browning and immunosuppression compared to subcutaneous fat. Our results present ferrets as an accessible translational animal model displaying functional responses relevant for obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright © 2019 Reynés, van Schothorst, Keijer, Ceresi, Oliver and Palou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635353>Melanoidins from Chinese Distilled Spent Grain: Content, Preliminary Structure, Antioxidant, and ACE-Inhibitory Activities In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Distilled spent grain (DSG), as the major by-product of baijiu making, contains melanoidins generated via the Maillard reaction.

In many cases, the relationship between the chemical structure of the gelator and the emergent hydrogel properties is poorly understood. As a result, empirical screening strategies instead of rational design approaches are often relied upon to tune the emergent properties of the gels. Herein, we describe a novel strategy to identify improved phenylalanine (Phe) derived gelators using a focused empirical approach. Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protected Phe derivatives are a privileged class of gelators that spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils that entangle to form a hydrogel network upon dissolution into water. However, the Fmoc group has been shown to have toxicity drawbacks for potential biological applications, requiring the identification of new N-terminal modifications that promote efficient self-assembly but lack the shortcomings of the Fmoc group. We previously discovered that fibrils in Fmoc-p-nitrophenylalanine (Fmoc-4-NO-Phe) hydrogels transition to crystalline microtubes after several hours by a mechanism that involves the hierarchical assembly and fusion of the hydrogel fibrils. We hypothesized that this hierarchical crystallization behavior could form the basis of a screening approach to identify alternative N-terminal functional groups to replace Fmoc in Phe-derived LMW gelators. Specifically, screening N-terminal modifying groups for 4-NO-Phe that stabilize the hydrogel state by preventing subsequent hierarchical crystallization would facilitate empirical identification of functional Fmoc replacements. To test this approach, we screened a small series of 4-NO-Phe derivatives with various N-terminal modifying groups to determine if any provided stable LMW supramolecular hydrogels. All but one of the 4-NO-Phe derivatives assembled into crystalline forms. Only the 1-naphthaleneacetic  (1-Nap) 4-NO-Phe derivative self-assembled into a stable hydrogel network. Additional Phe derivatives were modified by N-terminal 1-Nap-Phe groups to confirm the general potential of 1-Nap as a suitable replacement for Fmoc, and all derivatives formed stable hydrogels under similar conditions to their Fmoc-Phe counterparts. These results illustrate the potential of this approach to identify next-generation Phe-derived LMW gelators with improved emergent properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660636>Evaluation of the inflammatory response to two intra-articular hyaluronic  formulations in normal equine joints.</a></h2><p>Intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic  (HA) is commonly used to treat equine arthritis. Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of inflammation following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular  (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of inflammation in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used. Further investigation of different HA formulations and the use of HA in normal and arthritic equine joints is warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659712>Using Chou's General Pseudo Amino  Composition to Classify Laccases from Bacterial and Fungal Sources via Chou's Five-Step Rule.</a></h2><p>Laccases are a group of enzymes with a critical activity in the degradation process of both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. These enzymes present in a diverse array of species, including fungi and bacteria. Since this enzyme is in the market for different usages from industry to medicine, having a better knowledge of its structures and properties from diverse sources will be useful to select the most appropriate candidate for different purposes. In the current study, sequence- and structure-based characteristics of these enzymes from fungi and bacteria, including pseudo amino  composition (PseAAC), physicochemical characteristics, and their secondary structures, are being compared and classified. Autodock 4 software was used for docking analysis between these laccases and some phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The results indicated that features including molecular , aliphatic, extinction coefficient, and random coil percentage of these protein groups present high degrees of diversity in most cases. Categorization of these enzymes by the notion of PseAAC, showed over 96% accuracy. The binding free energy between fungal laccases and their substrates showed to be considerably higher than those of bacterial ones. According to the outcomes of the current study, data mining methods by using different machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks, could provide valuable information for a fair comparison between fungal and bacterial laccases. These results also suggested an association between efficacy and physicochemical features of laccase enzymes from different sources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639637>Assessment of carcass and meat quality of longissimus thoracis and semimembranosus muscles of Hanwoo with Korean beef grading standards.</a></h2><p>The carcass traits, meat quality traits, and fatty  profile of two muscles, longissimus thoracis (LT) and semimembranosus (SM), in Hanwoo steers were investigated against the Korean beef quality grade (QG) and yield grade (YG) standards. Back fat thickness and carcass  most affect the YGs, while the marbling score is the primary determinant of the QGs. The muscle type greatly influenced the meat qualities, sensory properties, and fatty  profiles of Hanwoo meat. In terms of sensory aspects, the muscle type affected the QG for tenderness and juiciness, with the LT being more desirable than the SM for all the sensory attributes. SM meat is potentially beneficial for human health because it has a lower amount of unhealthy saturated fatty  and a greater amount of healthier polyunsaturated fatty , especially essential fatty , than the LT. The present study indicates that carcass based common grading system does not reflect the real value of SM meat.Copyright © 2019.

Ghrelin (GHRL), a 28-amino  peptide secreted mainly by the stomach and pancreas, has been reported to alleviate male reproductive injury through inhibiting apoptosis. However, whether GHRL has a beneficial effect on psychological stress-induced testicular injury and the possible mechanisms remain poorly understood.Male mice were immobilized in Decapicone bags for 3 h daily for 14 days treated with or without GHRL (i.p. 100 mg/kg ).  and testicular  were measured. Histological alterations and apoptosis were examined by H.E. staining and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the testes was investigated.Exposure to stress caused testicular histological alterations, an elevation of the Johnsen score, and germ cell apoptosis, while GHRL partially alleviated the adverse effects. The expression of ER stress marker proteins, including GRP78, CHOP, ATF6, p-JNK, and XBP-1, was upregulated in the stress group; however, GHRL treatment significantly suppressed the activation of ER stress in the testes. GHRL also inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TLR4, and NF-κB.GHRL alleviated testicular injury induced by ER stress and inflammation which is associated with the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, and these findings may provide a novel strategy for preventing and treating reproductive dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649851>MCC1019, a selective inhibitor of the Polo-box domain of Polo-like kinase 1 as novel, potent anticancer candidate.</a></h2><p>Polo-like kinase (PLK1) has been identified as a potential target for cancer treatment. Although a number of small molecules have been investigated as PLK1 inhibitors, many of which showed limited selectivity. PLK1 harbors a regulatory domain, the Polo box domain (PBD), which has a key regulatory function for kinase activity and substrate recognition. We report on 3-bromomethyl-benzofuran-2-carboxylic  ethyl ester (designated: MCC1019) as selective PLK1 inhibitor targeting PLK1 PBD. Cytotoxicity and fluorescence polarization-based screening were applied to a library of 1162 drug-like compounds to identify potential inhibitors of PLK1 PBD. The activity of compound MC1019 against the PLK1 PBD was confirmed using fluorescence polarization and microscale thermophoresis. This compound exerted specificity towards PLK1 over PLK2 and PLK3. MCC1019 showed cytotoxic activity in a panel of different cancer cell lines. Mechanistic investigations in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed that MCC1019 induced cell growth inhibition through inactivation of AKT signaling pathway, it also induced prolonged mitotic arrest-a phenomenon known as mitotic catastrophe, which is followed by immediate cell death  apoptosis and necroptosis. MCC1019 significantly inhibited tumor growth  in a murine lung cancer model without affecting  or vital organ size, and reduced the growth of metastatic lesions in the lung.

The Ionomer n Analysis (INCA method), based on n/T plots where n is a counter elastic force index, was applied to SSC-PFSA in order to evaluate ionomer thermo-mechanical properties and to probe the increase of crystallinity during the annealing procedure. The enhanced thermal and mechanical stability of extruded Aquivion 870 (equivalent , EW = 870 g·mol) was related to an increase of long-range order. Complementary differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements confirmed the increase of polymer stiffness by the annealing treatment with an enhancement of the storage modulus over the whole range of temperature. The main thermomechanical relaxation temperature is also enhanced. DSC measurements showed slight base line changes after annealing, attributable to the glass transition and melting of a small amount of crystalline phase. The difference between the glass transition and melting temperatures derived from INCA plots and the ionic-cluster transition temperature derived from DMA measurements is consistent with the different experimental conditions, especially the dry atmosphere in DMA. Finally, the annealing procedure was also successfully applied for the first time to an un-crystallized cast membrane (EW = 830 g·mol) resulting in a remarkable mechanical and thermal stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650131>Anionic Polymerization of Methylene Malonate for High-Performance Coatings.</a></h2><p>Here, we demonstrate the anionic polymerization and the high reactivity of the novel monomer diethyl methylene malonate (DEMM). At room temperature and under atmospheric conditions, water and anionic functional groups (i.e., carboxyl, boronic, and phenol) quickly initiate DEMM. The polymerization of DEMM in water and the final molecular  of the polymer were both demonstrated to be pH-dependent. Systematically, investigations were conducted to study the conversion rate of DEMM with various functional groups, and the polymerization was verified to occur with anionic groups using a carboxylate-initiated DEMM system. For coating applications, we also investigated a multifunctional derivative monomer called (DEMM) that is an oligomeric polyester of DEMM esterified with butanediol that contains on average six repeat units of reactive DEMM (commercially known as Forza B3000 XP). The incorporation of 15 wt % (DEMM) into latex containing methacrylate  as a functional monomer yielded cross-linked coatings with a gel content of 76.25 wt % that had a 289% improvement in rub-resistance performance compared to controls (without (DEMM)).

Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), , feces  and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic -Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress.

We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty  oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in  or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of diets enriched with high doses of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA)  and glutamine on inflammatory mediators in dogs before and after ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Twelve female dogs were divided into two groups: group A was fed a commercial diet without the addition of EPA and DHA, and group B was fed an experimental diet enriched with EPA and DHA (0.2 g/100 kcal). Experimental diet intake initiated 21 days before surgery and continued until 30 days after OVH. Parameters measured were serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10), C-reactive protein (CRP), IGF-1, lymphoproliferation and  composition before and after surgery. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software considering the effects of age and diet and their interactions, and means were compared by the Tukey test. There was no difference between groups in  (p = .682), lean mass (p = .101) and  fat (p = .103). There were no group differences in serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IGF-1, CRP and the percentage of lymphocyte proliferation. However, a time effect for TNF-α was observed (p < .001), in which T (10 days after the surgical procedure) presented lower values of this cytokine when compared to the other evaluation time points; and interaction effects between group and time were observed for serum concentrations of IL-6 (p < .001) and IL-10 (p = .002). OVH procedure was not considered invasive enough to increase inflammatory cytokines after 30 days of surgery, as well as the dosage of the EPA and DHA used before and after the surgery did not modulate the inflammatory markers.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652646>Mutation of  Enhances Grain Yield by Increasing Panicle Number and Delaying Leaf Senescence during Grain Filling in Rice.</a></h2><p>Exploring genetic methods to improve yield in grain crops such as rice () is essential to help meet the needs of the increasing population.

In this study, we investigated their bioavailability, metabolism, and excretion in vivo. A complex Alternaria culture extract (50 mg/kg ) containing 11 known toxins and the isolated lead toxin altertoxin II (0.7 mg/kg ) were administered per gavage to groups of 14 Sprague Dawley rats each. After 3 h and 24 h, plasma, urine and feces were collected to determine toxin recoveries. For reliable quantitation, an LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous detection of 20 Alternaria toxins and metabolites was developed and optimized for either biological matrix. The obtained results demonstrated efficient excretion of alternariol (AOH) and its monomethyl ether (AME) via feces (> 89%) and urine (> 2.6%) after 24 h, while the majority of tenuazonic  was recovered in urine (20 and 87% after 3 and 24 h, respectively). Moreover, modified forms of AOH and AME were identified in urine and fecal samples confirming both, mammalian phase-I (4-hydroxy-AOH) and phase-II (sulfates) biotransformation in vivo. Despite the comparably high doses, perylene quinones were recovered only at very low levels (altertoxin I, alterperylenol, < 0.06% in urine and plasma, < 5% in feces) or not at all (highly genotoxic, epoxide-holding altertoxin II, stemphyltoxin III). Interestingly, altertoxin I was detected in all matrices of rats receiving altertoxin II and suggests enzymatic de-epoxidation in vivo. In conclusion, the present study contributes valuable information to advance our understanding of the emerging Alternaria mycotoxins and their relevance on food safety.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675560>Association of prenatal pesticide exposures with adverse pregnancy outcomes and stunting in rural Bangladesh.</a></h2><p>Pesticide exposure during pregnancy is thought to adversely affect fetal growth, which in turn may impact child growth, but results have been inconsistent across studies and few have explored these effects in developing countries.To quantify urinary concentrations of pesticide biomarkers in early pregnancy (<16 weeks' gestation), and to estimate the association of these concentrations with preterm birth, low birth , small for gestational age, and stunting at ~1 and 2 years of age.Eight pesticide biomarkers were quantified in urine collected from 289 pregnant women (aged 18-40 years) participating in a birth cohort study in Bangladesh. Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic  (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total energy and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth  compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08).

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g ) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the liver. Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced  gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into liver suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the liver after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of fatty  synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic treatment options, particularly for disseminated disease. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a proteoglycan cell surface receptor overexpressed in most HCCs and provides a unique target for molecular therapies. We have previously demonstrated that PET imaging using a Zr-conjugated monoclonal anti-GPC3 antibody (GPC3) can bind to minute tumors and allow imaging with high sensitivity and specificity in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of HCC and that serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are highly correlated with tumor size in this model. In the present study, we conjugated Y, a high-energy beta-particle-emitting radionuclide, to our GPC3 antibody to develop a novel antibody-directed radiotherapeutic approach for HCC. Luciferase-expressing HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells were orthotopically implanted in the livers of athymic nude mice, and tumor establishment was verified at 6 weeks after implantation by bioluminescent imaging and serum AFP concentration. Tumor burden by bioluminescence and serum AFP concentration was highly correlated in our model. Yttrium-90 was conjugated to GPC3 using the chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic  (DOTA) and injected via the tail vein into the experimental mice at a dose of 200 Ci/mouse or 300 Ci/mouse. Control mice received DOTA-GPC3 without radionuclide. At 30 days after a single dose of the radioimmunotherapy agent, mean serum AFP levels in control animals increased dramatically, while animals treated with 200 Ci only experienced a minor increase, indicating cessation of tumor growth, and animals treated with 300 Ci experienced a reduction in serum AFP concentration, indicating tumor shrinkage. Mean tumor-bearing liver  in control animals was also significantly greater than that in animals that received either dose of Y-GPC3. These results were achieved without significant toxicity as measured by  condition scoring and . The results of this preclinical pilot demonstrate that GPC3 can be used as a target for radioimmunotherapy in an orthotopic mouse model of HCC and may be a target of clinical significance, particularly for disseminated HCC.Copyright © 2019 Andrew D.

However, little is known about how the diet fed to BSFL affects their nutritional value, especially their fatty  composition. In this study, BSFL were fed 11 diets based on four different organic waste sources (mussels, bread, fish and food waste). Fatty  and proximate composition (dry matter, crude fat, crude protein and ash) were analysed in the diets, in two-week-old larvae and substrate residues. Larval , survival and feed conversion were also recorded. The diet was found to affect all parameters investigated. Irrespective of diet, the larval fat consisted mainly of lauric  and other saturated fatty  and these were found to be synthesised by the larvae. However, both the fatty  composition of the substrate, and the larval  were found to affect the fatty  profile of the larvae. In general, larvae with a higher  contained a higher percentage of saturated fatty  and a lower percentage of unsaturated fatty , such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). It was concluded that the possibilities to tailor the fatty  composition of the BSFL through the diet are limited; thus, the BSFL fat may not be suitable to replace fish oil, but has potential of inclusion in other food, feed and fuel products.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A recent report has linked Rac GTPase-activating protein 1 (RACGAP1) to the early recurrence of HCC. The current study aimed to ascertain whether MAGI2 antisense RNA 3 (MAGI2-AS3) influences the development of HCC by regulating RACGAP1. MAGI2-AS3 expression was initially quantified in both the HCC tissues and cell lines. In order to elucidate the role of MAGI2-AS3 in the development of HCC, MAGI2-AS3 was overexpressed or silenced in HCC cells after which cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration were evaluated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assays were conducted to determine the interactions among MAGI2-AS3, KDM1A, and RACGAP1. Finally, the effects of MAGI2-AS3 and RACGAP1 on the tumorigenesis of transplanted HCC cells in nude mice were evaluated. MAGI2-AS3 was found to be under-expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. The restoration of MAGI2-AS3 was identified to markedly inhibit HCC cell growth, migrating ability, and invasiveness, and promote cell apoptosis. Interaction between MAGI2-AS3 and KDM1A was identified. KDM1A recruited by MAGI2-AS3 was found to promote H3K4me2 demethylation at the RACGAP1 promoter, which ultimately decreased the expression of RACGAP1. We also identified that RACGAP1 knockdown eliminated the stimulatory effects of MAGI2-AS3 silencing on the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells. Additionally, the expression of MAGI2-AS3 reduced tumor  and size in HCC transplanted nude mice. Taken together, the key observations of the current study demonstrate the potential of MAGI2-AS3 as a tumor suppressor and a promising target for HCC treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Rice, a good dietary source of carbohydrates, also contains RS. However, it remains unclear if RS at the amount consumed in cooked rice has health benefit. To address the question, we examined the effects of cooked rice containing different levels of RS in a diet-induced obesity rodent model. Rice containing RS as low as 1.07% attenuated adipose  and adipocyte size gain, induced by a moderately high-fat (HF) diet which correlated with lower leptin levels in plasma and adipose tissue. Rice with 8.61% RS increased fecal short chain fatty  (SCFA) levels, modulated HF diet-induced adipose triacylglycerol metabolism and inflammation related genes' expression, and increased fecal triglyceride excretion. Hence, including rice with RS level at ≥ 1.07% may attenuate risks associated with consumption of a moderately high-fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659077>Indirect Evidence of Circulating Parasite Hapten Immune Complexes in Visceral Leishmaniasis.</a></h2><p>Hypergammaglobulinemia is present in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), inducing the formation of immune complexes (ICs), which interferes in conventional serology. Parasitic haptens block antibodies, making it difficult to identify and detect them. ICs could be determined indirectly by  dissociative ELISA (DE) seroconversion in natural and experimental VL.We determined the frequency of samples that seroconverted in DE or presented a 10% increase in DE (ΔDE) in 3 types of VLs-hamster, canine, and human samples-with larger antigen determination by direct antigen capture in experimental samples.The ΔDE frequency is increased in all VL models: human (34%), canine (27%), and hamster (25%) samples. Seroconversion was present in hamster (14%), dog (1%), and human (6%) samples. During experimental infection, higher frequencies (28%) of circulating antigens were observed at the 30th day, associated with higher ΔDE (47%) and seroconversion (22%), with lower frequencies in other periods.The frequency of ΔED and seroconversion samples found in natural and experimental infection suggests that specific antibodies can be blocked by low molecular  antigens that interfere qualitatively (seroconversion) or quantitatively (ΔDE) in serology. Several antigen types may be involved, as high molecular  proteins and low molecular  glycoconjugates. The higher frequency of those indirect demonstrations of antibody-blocking antigen or haptens that could be -removed in VL has implications for the development of assays for detection of circulating or antibody-bound 1- to 3-kDa antigens, which could interfere in diagnosis and also in the immune response of the host.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625209>Larval development and proteolytic activity of Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) exposed to different soybean protease inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Anticarsia gemmatalis represents a relevant factor for lowering soybean and other legume crop productivities. Protease inhibitors affect protein degradation and reduce the availability of amino , impairing the development and survival of insect pests. To evaluate the possible use of proteinaceous protease inhibitors in the management of this pest, the activities of midgut proteases and the growth and development of A. gemmatalis larvae exposed to soybean Bowman-Birk trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (SBBI) and soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (SKTI) were determined. The survival curves obtained using Kaplan-Meier estimators indicated that SKTI and SBBI stimulated larval survival. However, the development of A. gemmatalis was delayed, and prepupal  decreased in the presence of both inhibitors. The results showed that SKTI and SBBI inhibited the trypsin-like and total proteolytic activities of larvae on the 12th day after eclosion. On the 15th day after eclosion, larvae exposed to SKTI increased the activities of trypsin and total proteases. Although SKTI and SBBI did not affect the survival of the insect, they had effects on midgut proteases in a stage wherein A. gemmatalis fed voraciously, increased the larval cycle, and decreased prepupal . These findings provide baseline information about the potential of proteinaceous protease inhibitors to manage the velvetbean caterpillar, avoiding chemical pesticides.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635032>Plasma Metabolomics Identifies Lipid and Amino  Markers of  Loss in Patients with Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Cachexia is a multifactorial wasting syndrome associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Diagnosis can be difficult and, in the clinical situation, usually relies upon reported  loss. The 'omics' technologies allow us the opportunity to study the end points of many biological processes. Among these, blood-based metabolomics is a promising method to investigate the pathophysiology of human cancer cachexia and identify candidate biomarkers. In this study, we performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics to investigate the metabolic profile of cancer-associated  loss. Non-selected patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for upper gastrointestinal cancer were recruited. Fasting plasma samples were taken at induction of anaesthesia. LC/MS analysis showed that 6 metabolites were highly discriminative of  loss. Specifically, a combination profile of LysoPC 18.2, L-Proline, Hexadecanoic , Octadecanoic , Phenylalanine and LysoPC 16:1 showed close correlation for eight -losing samples (≥5%  loss) and nine -stable samples (<5% loss) between predicted and actual  change (r = 0.976,  = 0.0014). Overall, 40 metabolites were associated with ≥5%  loss. This study provides biological validation of the consensus definition of cancer cachexia (Fearon et al.) and provides feasible candidate markers for further investigation in early diagnosis and the assessment of therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664902>Analysis of the fecal microbiota of fast- and slow-growing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Diverse microbial communities colonizing the intestine of fish contribute to their growth, digestion, nutrition, and immune function. We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino  fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655260>Cross-Species Suppression of Hepatoma Cell Growth and Migration by a Schistosomajaponicum MicroRNA.</a></h2><p>Schistosoma japonicum eggs trapped in host liver secretes microRNA (miRNA)-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be transferred to host cells. Recent studies demonstrated that miRNAs derived from plants can modulate gene expression and phenotype of mammalian cells in a cross-kingdom manner. In this study, we identified a Schistosoma japonicum miRNA (e.g., Sja-miR-3096) that is present in the hepatocytes of mice infected with the parasite and has notable antitumor effects in both in vitro and in vivo models. The Sja-miR-3096 mimics suppressed cell proliferation and migration of both murine and human hepatoma cell lines by targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase class II alpha (PIK3C2A). We generated a murine hepatoma cell line that stably expressed the pri-Sja-miR-3096 gene and demonstrated cross-species processing of the schistosome pri-miRNA to the mature Sja-miR-3096 in the mammalian cell. Importantly, inoculation of this cell line into the scapula and livers of mice led to a complete suppression of tumorigenesis of the hepatoma cells. Moreover, tumor  was significantly reduced on intravenous administration of Sja-miR-3096 mimics. Thus, the schistosome miRNA-mediated antitumor activity occurs in host liver cells during schistosome infection, which may strengthen resistance of host to liver cancer, and discovery and development of such miRNAs may present promising interventions for cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty , lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for  loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially -loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic  levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt obesity model was developed by exposure to different energy diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low-energy group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium-energy group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high-energy group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal  and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher  and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth  compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty  contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high-energy diet-induced obesity increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674084>Effects of low-protein diet supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate on growth performance, nitrogen metabolism and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets.</a></h2><p>Excessive protein levels in diets result in incomplete digestion of nitrogenous nutrients that are excreted from the , causing environment pollution. Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen metabolism, relative expression of amino  transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial  of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.5%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino  transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624923>Toothpaste factors related to dentine tubule occlusion and dentine protection against erosion and abrasion.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of toothpastes on dentine surface loss and tubule occlusion, and the association of toothpaste-related factors to each of the outcomes.One hundred and sixty human dentine specimens were randomly distributed into 10 groups, according to different toothpastes. The specimens were submitted to artificial saliva (60 min), citric  (3 min), and brushing abrasion (25 s; totalizing 2 min in toothpaste slurries). This was repeated five times and two outcome variables were analyzed: dentine surface loss (dSL; μm) and tubule occlusion by measurement of the total area of open tubules (Area-OT; μm). Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α = 0.05); bivariate and multivariate regressions were used to model the association of the chemical (pH, concentration of F, Ca, and PO and presence of Sn) and physical (%  of solid particles, particle size, and wettability) factors of the toothpastes to both outcome variables.Toothpastes caused different degrees of dSL and did not differ in Area-OT. All chemical and physical factors, except the presence of Sn, were associated with dSL (p < 0.001). Area-OT was associated only with the presence of Sn (p = 0.033).Greater dSL was associated with lower pH, lower concentration of F, higher concentration of Ca and PO, greater %  of solid particles, smaller particle size, and lesser wettability, whereas tubule occlusion was associated with the presence of Sn.Depending on their chemical and physical composition, toothpastes will cause different degrees of dentine tubule occlusion and dentine surface loss.

Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effect and underlying mechanism of  extract (GPE) enriched in gypenoside L, gypenoside LI, and ginsenoside Rg3 and obtained using a novel extraction method. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 100 mg/kg  (BW)/day GPE (GPE 100), HFD + 300 mg/kg BW/day GPE (GPE 300), or HFD + 30 mg/kg BW/day Orlistat (Orlistat 30) for 8 weeks. The HFD-fed mice showed significant increases in , fat mass, white adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared to the CD group; but GPE inhibited those increases. GPE reduced serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. GPE significantly increased AMPK activation and suppressed adipogenesis by decreasing the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), PPARγ coactivator-1α, fatty  synthase (FAS), adipocyte protein 2 (AP2), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and by increasing that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL).
