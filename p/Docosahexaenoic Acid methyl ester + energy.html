In this context, the objective of the present study was to analyze in an aquatic invertebrate with direct development the effect of temperature on female biochemical composition and reserve allocation to maturing ovaries, which determine egg quality. A decapod crustacean, the freshwater shrimp Neocaridina davidi, was used as experimental model. Newly hatched juveniles were exposed to 28 °C or 33 °C. Females showed mature ovaries and spawned at 28 °C (control ovigerous females), but no ovigerous female was found at 33 °C. After a 200-day period, half of the females at 33 °C were transferred to 28 °C, where they rapidly showed mature ovaries and spawned (transferred ovigerous females). Ovigerous females and females that did not spawn at 28 °C (control non-ovigerous females) and at 33 °C (high-temperature non-ovigerous females) were sacrificed to determine their biochemical composition. The number, volume, weight, and biochemical composition of the eggs from transferred and control ovigerous females were also analyzed as indicators of their quality. Female biochemical composition was not influenced by temperature, because control and high-temperature non-ovigerous females had similar lipid, protein, and glycogen contents. However, ovarian maturation and spawning were inhibited at 33 °C, which indicates a negative effect of this temperature on nutrient transfer to the oocytes. This effect was rapidly reversed after females were moved to 28 °C; the eggs from control and transferred ovigerous females were of similar quality, except for a lower protein content in the latter. The present results provide valuable information on reserve allocation to reproduction under thermal stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326602>Efficient Extraction of a   (DHA)-Rich Lipid Fraction from  sp. Using Ionic Liquids.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a significant role in the modulation and prevention of various diseases, and hence are attracting increasing attention from the biotech industry. Thraustochytrids are marine heterokonts that exhibit robust growth rates, high PUFA content, and more specifically, a large percentage of omega-3 fatty acids like   (DHA). Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to improve the efficiency of organic solvent extraction of oils from wet oleaginous yeast and microalgae under mild conditions. Two ILs, the imidazolium 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate [C₂mim][EtSO₄] IL and the phosphonium (tetrabutylphosphonium propanoate [P][Prop]) IL were assessed for their ability to facilitate extraction of PUFA-containing lipids from a  sp. (T18) through efficient cell wall disruption. The oil extracted after IL pretreatment was further characterized with respect to fatty    (FAME) composition, while the effects of process parameters, such as the ratio of ionic liquid to co-solvent, the mass ratio of microalgae to the mixture of ionic liquid, and type of co-solvent were also investigated for both ILs. The results indicate that these ILs can disrupt the cells of  sp. when mixed with a co-solvent (methanol), and facilitated the recovery of oils over a large degree of dewatered  biomass (0⁻77.2 wt% water) in a short period of time (60 min) at ambient temperature, hence demonstrating a water compatible, low-, lipid recovery method. The lipid recovery was not affected by repeated usage of recycled ILs (tested up to five times).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24128590>Structural elucidation of olive pomace fed sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) polar lipids with cardioprotective activities.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to structurally characterise the polar lipids of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), fed with an experimental diet containing olive pomace (OP), that exhibit cardioprotective activities. OP has been added to conventional fish oil (FO) feed at 4% and this was the OP diet, having been supplemented as finishing diet to fish. Sea bass was aquacultured using either FO or OP diet. At the end of the dietary experiment, lipids in both samples of fish muscle were quantified and HPLC fractionated. The in vitro cardioprotective properties of the polar lipid fractions, using washed rabbit's platelets, have been assessed and the two most biologically active fractions were further analysed by mass spectrometry. The gas-chromatrograpy-mass spectrometric data shows that these two fractions contain low levels of myristic (14:0), oleic (18:1 cis ω-9) and linoleic acids (18:2 ω-6), but high levels of palmitic (16:0) and stearic acids (18:0) as well as eicosadienoic  (20:2 ω-6). The first fraction (MS1) also contained significant levels of arachidonic  (20:4 ω-6) and the omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic  (22:5) and   (22:6). Electrospray-mass spectrometry elucidated that the lipid composition of the two fractions contained various diacyl-glycerophospholipids species, where the majority of them have either 18:0 or 18:1 fatty acids in the sn-1 position and either 22:6 or 20:2 fatty acids in the sn-2 position for MS1 and MS2, respectively. Our research focuses on the structure/function relationship of fish muscle polar lipids and cardiovascular diseases and structural data are given for polar lipid HPLC fractions with strong cardioprotective properties.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to determine the efficacy of alpha-substituted DHA derivatives as lipid-lowering, antiobesity, and antidiabetic agents. C57BL/6 mice were given a corn oil-based high-fat (35% weight/weight) diet (cHF), or cHF with 1.5% of lipids replaced with alpha- DHA ethyl  (Substance 1), alpha-ethyl DHA ethyl  (Substance 2), alpha,alpha-di- DHA ethyl  (Substance 3), or alpha-thioethyl DHA ethyl  (Substance 4) for 4 months. Plasma markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, glucose tolerance, morphology, tissue lipid content, and gene regulation were characterized. The cHF induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, impairment of glucose homeostasis, and adipose tissue inflammation. Except for Substance 3, all other substances prevented weight gain and Substance 2 exerted the strongest effect (63% of cHF-controls). Glucose intolerance was significantly prevented (~67% of cHF) by both Substance 1 and Substance 2. Moreover, Substance 2 lowered fasting glycemia, plasma insulin, triacylglycerols, and nonesterified fatty acids (73, 9, 47, and 81% of cHF-controls, respectively). Substance 2 reduced accumulation of lipids in liver and skeletal muscle, as well as adipose tissue inflammation associated with obesity. Substance 2 also induced weight loss in dietary obese mice. In contrast to DHA administered either alone or as a component of the EPA/DHA concentrate (replacing 15% of dietary lipids), Substance 2 also reversed established glucose intolerance in obese mice. Thus, Substance 2 represents a novel compound with a promising potential in the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463839>Comparison of Thraustochytrids Aurantiochytrium sp., Schizochytrium sp., Thraustochytrium sp., and Ulkenia sp. for production of biodiesel, long-chain omega-3 oils, and exopolysaccharide.</a></h2><p>Heterotrophic growth of thraustochytrids has potential in coproducing biodiesel for transportation, as well as producing a feedstock for omega-3 long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), especially   (DHA) for use in nutraceuticals. In this study, we compared eight new endemic Australian thraustochytrid strains from the genera Aurantiochytrium, Schizochytrium, Thraustochytrium, and Ulkenia for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide (EPS), in addition to biodiesel and LC-PUFA. Aurantiochytrium sp. strains readily utilized glucose for biomass production, and increasing glucose from 2 to 4 % w/v of the culture medium resulted in increased biomass yield by an average factor of 1.7. Ulkenia sp. strain TC 010 and Thraustochytrium sp. strain TC 033 did not utilize glucose, while Schizochytrium sp. strain TC 002 utilized less than half the glucose available by day 14, and Thraustochytrium sp. strain TC 004 utilized glucose at 4 % w/v but not 2 % w/v of the culture suggesting a threshold requirement between these values. Across all strains, increasing glucose from 2 to 4 % w/v of the culture medium resulted in increased total fatty    content by an average factor of 1.9. Despite an increasing literature demonstrating the capacity of thraustochytrids for DHA synthesis, the production of EPS from these organisms is not well documented. A broad range of EPS yields was observed. The maximum yield of EPS was observed for Schizochytrium sp. strain TC 002 (299 mg/L). High biomass-producing strains that also have high lipid and high EPS yield may be better candidates for commercial production of biofuels and other coproducts.</p></html>
