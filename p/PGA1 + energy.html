<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623164>Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy and Its Emerging Role in Hematological Malignancies.</a></h2><p>Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) ensures the selective degradation of cellular proteins endowed with a KFERQ-like motif by lysosomes. It is estimated that 30% of all cellular proteins can be directed to the lysosome for CMA degradation, but only a few substrates have been formally identified so far. Mechanistically, the KFERQ-like motifs present in substrate proteins are recognized by the molecular chaperone Hsc70c (Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein cytosolic), also known as HSPA8, and directed to LAMP2A, which acts as the CMA receptor at the lysosomal surface. Following linearization, the protein substrate is next transported to the lumen of the lysosomes, where it is degraded by resident proteases, mainly cathepsins and eventually recycled to sustain cellular homeostasis. CMA is induced by different stress conditions, including  deprivation that also activates macro-autophagy (MA), that may make it difficult to decipher the relative impact of both pathways on cellular homeostasis. Besides common inducing triggers, CMA and MA might be induced as compensatory mechanisms when either mechanism is altered, as it is the often the case in different pathological settings. Therefore, CMA activation can compensate for alterations of MA and vice versa. In this context, these compensatory mechanisms, when occurring, may be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Both processes have received particular attention from scientists and clinicians, since modulation of MA and CMA may have a profound impact on cellular proteostasis, metabolism, death, differentiation, and survival and, as such, could be targeted for therapeutic intervention in degenerative and immune diseases, as well as in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. The role of MA in cancer initiation and progression is now well established, but whether and how CMA is involved in tumorigenesis has been only sparsely explored. In the present review, we encompass the description of the mechanisms involved in CMA, its function in the physiology and pathogenesis of hematopoietic cells, its emerging role in cancer initiation and development, and, finally, the potential therapeutic opportunity to target CMA or CMA-mediated compensatory mechanisms in hematological malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433435>Growth and metabolic characteristics of oleaginous microalgal isolates from Nilgiri biosphere Reserve of India.</a></h2><p>Renewable  for sustainable development is a subject of a worldwide debate since continuous utilization of non-renewable  sources has a drastic impact on the environment and economy; a search for alternative  resources is indispensable. Microalgae are promising and potential alternate  resources for biodiesel production. Thus, our efforts were focused on surveying the natural diversity of microalgae for the production of biodiesel. The present study aimed at identification, isolation, and characterization of oleaginous microalgae from shola forests of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), the biodiversity hot spot of India, where the microalgal diversity has not yet been systematically investigated.Overall the higher biomass yield, higher lipid accumulation and thermotolerance observed in the isolated microalgal strains have been found to be the desirable traits for the efficient biodiesel production. Species composition and diversity analysis yielded ten potential microalgal isolates belonging to Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. The chlorophytes exhibited higher growth rate, maximum biomass yield, and higher lipid accumulation than Cyanophyceae. Among the chlorophytes, the best performing strains were identified and represented by Acutodesmus dissociatus (TGA1), Chlorella sp. (TGA2), Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) and Hindakia tetrachotoma (). The Chlamydomonadales sp. recorded with the highest growth rate, lipid accumulation and biomass yield of 0.28 ± 0.03 day (μ), 29.7 ± 0.69% and 134.17 ± 16.87 mg L day, respectively. It was also found to grow well at various temperatures, viz., 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, indicating its suitability for open pond cultivation. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of stationary phase cultures of selected four algal strains by tandem mass spectrograph showed C16:0, C18:1 and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production. All the three strains except for Hindakia tetrachotoma () recorded higher carbohydrate content and were considered as potential feed stocks for biodiesel production through hydrothermal liquefaction technology (HTL).In conclusion, the present investigation is a first systematic study on the microalgal diversity of soil and water samples from selected sites of NBR. The study resulted in isolation and characterization of ten potent oleaginous microalgae and found four cultures as promising feed stocks for biodiesel production. Of the four microalgae, Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) was found to be significantly thermo-tolerant and can be considered as promising feedstock for biodiesel production.</p></html>
