The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of all forms of  including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and  unspecified (IBDU).Pediatric (age -17) and adult (age ≥18)  patients were identified from  large claims databases. For each year between 2007 and 2016, prevalence was calculated per 100,000 population and standardized based on the 2016 national Census. A fixed-effects meta-analytical model was used for overall prevalence.The pediatric prevalence of  overall increased by 133%, from 33.0/100,000 in 2007 to 77.0/100,000 in 2016. Among children, CD was twice as prevalent as UC (45.9 vs 21.6). Prevalence was higher in boys than girls for all forms of , in contrast to the adult population where the prevalence was higher in women than men. We also found that the 10-17 age subgroup was the major contributor to the rising pediatric  prevalence. For adults, the prevalence of  overall increased by 123%, from 214.9 in 2007 to 478.4 in 2016. The prevalence rates of UC and CD were similar (181.1 vs 197.7) in 2016.Inflammatory bowel disease continues to affect a substantial proportion of the US population. In 2016, 1 in 209 adults and 1 in 1299 children aged -17 were affected by . Prevalence of  has been increasing compared with previously published 2009 data.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The results revealed that AA-βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease () in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing colitis disease activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing tight junction proteins. Additionally, AA-βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty acids and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to  were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and . The results indicated that AA-βG might treat  through the regulation of gut microbiota, suggesting that AA-βG has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566409>Status of transition care in inflammatory bowel disease in Spain. Different medical perspectives.</a></h2><p>transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (). The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives.a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition.one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.5% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns). The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about disease and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine.in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498502>Nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms for inflammatory bowel disease in Korean National Health Insurance Service database.</a></h2><p>We conducted a nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms to identify cases of inflammatory bowel disease () within the Korea National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database.Using the NHIS dataset, we developed 44 algorithms combining the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, codes for Rare and Intractable Diseases (RID) registration and claims data for health care encounters, and pharmaceutical prescriptions for -specific drugs. For each algorithm, we compared the case identification results from electronic medical records data with the gold standard (chart-based diagnosis). A multiple sampling test verified the validation results from the entire study population.A random nationwide sample of 1697 patients (848 potential cases and 849 negative control cases) from 17 hospitals were included for validation. A combination of the ICD-10 code, ≥ 1 claims for health care encounters, and ≥ 1 prescription claims (reference algorithm) achieved excellent performance (sensitivity, 93.1% [95% confidence interval 91-94.7]; specificity, 98.1% [96.9-98.8]; positive predictive value, 97.5% [96.1-98.5]; negative predictive value, 94.5% [92.8-95.8]) with the lowest error rate (4.% [3.3-5.3]). The multiple sampling test confirmed that the reference algorithm achieves the best performance regarding  diagnosis. Algorithms including the RID registration codes exhibited poorer performance compared with that of the reference algorithm, particularly for the diagnosis of patients affiliated with secondary hospitals. The performance of the reference algorithm showed no statistical difference depending on the hospital volume or  type, with P-value < 0.05.We strongly recommend the reference algorithm as a uniform standard operational definition for future studies using the NHIS database.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental Colitis.</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73. ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513295>Interventions for maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease: a network meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane  Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5-ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5-ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and 5-ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in .8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in .5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494649>MEFV Gene-Related Enterocolitis Account for Some Cases Diagnosed as Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unclassified.</a></h2><p>Familial mediterranean fever (FMF), an autoinflammatory disease, is characterized by periodic fever and serositis. An MEFV gene mutation has been identified as the cause of FMF. Recently, patients with MEFV gene mutations and chronic gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation mimicking inflammatory bowel disease () have been reported. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with  unclassified (IBDU) with MEFV gene mutations.MEFV gene analysis was performed on 8 patients with IBDU among 710 patients with  who had been treated at Kyorin University Hospital from April 2016 to December 2018. Clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings, and serological markers were also analyzed.The average of the 8 patients with IBDU (3 men, 5 women) was 32.7 ± 6.4 years (range 26-76 years). Their symptoms comprised diarrhea (n = 8, 100%), hematochezia (n = 3, 37.5%), abdominal pain (n = 3, 37.5%), high fever (n = , 16.5%), and other periodic symptoms (n = , 16.5%). MEFV gene mutation was confirmed in 4/8 of these patients. Colonoscopy showed various mucosal lesions, rectal sparing, right side dominant colitis, pseudopolyposis, and granular protrusions. Colchicine was administered to 5 of the 8 patients (4 with and 1 without MEFV mutation) who were resistant to conventional treatment for ulcerative colitis. Clinical and endoscopic improvement was observed in all of 5 patients treated with colchicine.Some patients diagnosed as having IBDU have enterocolitis related to MEFV gene mutation and respond to colchicine therapy.© 2019 S.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate . We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase- (COX-) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

Current guidelines recommend an intensified surveillance strategy in these patients, although the evidence for this recommendation is conflicting. The aim of our study was to assess whether  patients with PIPs are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.We established a retrospective cohort in a tertiary  center with  patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in the current era. We compared cumulative incidences of colorectal neoplasia since  diagnosis between patients with and without PIPs and corrected for confounders. Second, we compared the risk of receiving a colectomy.In our cohort with >22 years of median follow-up, 154 of 519 patients had PIPs. PIPs were associated with extensive disease (odds ratio [OR], .76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-4.42; P < 0.001) and with more severe inflammation at colonoscopy (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, .28-5.50; P < 0.001). After correction for confounders, the presence of PIPs was not associated with development of colorectal neoplasia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.85-1.93; P = 0.24) or with development of advanced neoplasia (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.52-3.68; P = 0.52). There was a higher risk of colectomy in patients with PIPs (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.55-7.54; P = 0.002).In this cohort, PIPs were associated with disease extent, inflammation, and higher rates of colectomy. However, the presence of PIPs was not associated with the development of neoplasia. These findings suggest that patients with PIPs may not need an intensified surveillance strategy.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

A previous version of this review was not able to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS and recommended that further high quality RCTs were conducted to explore the clinical and cost effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review: 1. Clinical homeopathy where a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition; . Individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation.To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for IBS.For this update we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane  Group Specialised Register and trials registers from inception to 31 August 2018.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion.Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS as measured by an IBS symptom severity score. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, and adverse events. The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes.Four RCTs (307 participants) were included. Two studies compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy, asafoetida or asafoetida plus nux vomica) to placebo for IBS with constipation (IBS-C). One study compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care for the treatment of IBS in female patients. One study was a three armed RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening or usual care. The risk of bias in three studies (the two studies assessing clinical homeopathy and the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care) was unclear on most criteria and high for selective reporting in one of the clinical homeopathy studies. The three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care and supportive listening was at low risk of bias in four of the domains and high risk of bias in two (performance bias and detection bias).A meta-analysis of the studies assessing clinical homeopathy, (171 participants with IBS-C) was conducted. At short-term follow-up of two weeks, global improvement in symptoms was experienced by 73% (46/63) of asafoetida participants compared to 45% (30/66) of placebo participants (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to .18;  studies, very low certainty evidence). In the other clinical homeopathy study at two weeks, 68% (13/19) of those in the asafoetida plus nux vomica arm and 52% (12/23) of those in the placebo arm experienced a global improvement in symptoms (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to .15; very low certainty evidence). In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care (N = 20), the mean global improvement score (feeling unwell) at 12 weeks was 1.44 + 4.55 (n = 9) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 1.41 + 1.97 (n=11) in the usual care arm (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22; very low certainty evidence).In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44 + 112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 237.3 + 110.22 (n = 60) in the usual care arm (MD -26.86, 95% CI -88.59 to 34.87; low certainty evidence). The mean quality of life score (EQ-5D) at 6 months in homeopathy participants was 69.07 (SD 17.35) compared to 63.41 (SD 23.31) in usual care participants (MD 5.66, 95% CI -4.69 to 16.01; low certainty evidence).For In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44 + 112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 262 + 120.72 (n = 18) in the supportive listening arm (MD -51.56, 95% CI -129.94 to 26.82; very low certainty evidence). The mean quality of life score at 6 months in homeopathy participants was 69.07 (SD 17.35) compared to 63.09 (SD 24.38) in supportive listening participants (MD 5.98, 95% CI -8.13 to 20.09; very low certainty evidence).None of the included studies reported on abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, or adverse events.The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of homeopathy for the treatment of IBS can be drawn. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy for IBS compared to placebo or usual care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492986>An updated systematic review and meta-analysis about the safety and efficacy of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.We searched PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials discussing CT-P31 administration for  patients either naïve to biological therapy or switched from IFX therapy. Data of the rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and adverse events were extracted and pooled in a random effect model meta-analysis using CMA version .Thirty-two studies with a total of 3464  patients treated with CT-P13 were identified. The pooled rates of clinical response among Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) at 8-14 weeks were 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.87) and 0.68 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.72), respectively, and at 48-63 weeks were 0.69 (95% CI = 0.48 to 0.85) and 0.54 (95% CI = 0.45 to 0.63) respectively.

STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active  patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for  and colitis-associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670762>Early Discontinuation of Infliximab in Pregnant Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Early discontinuation of infliximab (IFX) in pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease () decreases the intrauterine fetal exposure to the drug but may increase the risk of disease flaring leading to poor pregnancy outcomes. In this study, we assessed the impact of early IFX discontinuation on mother's disease activity and on their at-risk babies.In a retrospective study of the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from 2011 to 2015, we compared  patients who discontinued IFX more than 90 days ("early IFX") with those who discontinue IFX 90 days or less ("late IFX) before delivery. We evaluated the risk of flaring, defined by new steroid prescriptions, visits to emergency room and/or hospital admissions, the pregnancy outcomes, and the at-risk babies.After IFX discontinuation, the early IFX group (68 deliveries) required significantly more steroid prescriptions than the late IFX group (318 deliveries) to control disease activity (P < 001). There were more preterm babies in the early IFX group (P < 049), but no difference within the  groups was noticed in the rate of intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestation, and stillborn babies. Similarly, there was no increase in acute respiratory infections, development delays, and congenital malformations in babies of the mothers from the late IFX vs early IFX groups.Steroid-free remission  mothers are at risk for disease flares and preterm babies when IFX is discontinued early in pregnancy. Continuation of IFX seems to be safe at least for the first year of life.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The hypothetical influence of IFX TDM was based on an optimal therapeutic range of 6-10 mg/L for mucosal healing.Secondary loss of response (reactive TDM) was the most common indication for TDM. These patients have consistently lower median IFX levels: 3.02 mg/L (IQR 1.14 - 6.67 mg/L) vs. 5.22 mg/L (IQR .70 - 8.12 mg/L), p = 0.0001 compared with patients in remission (proactive TDM). TDM helped to identify unnecessary use of IFX in 30.6% of the TDM tests performed in luminal Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, with an associated drug cost saving of $531.38 per IFX TDM test episode. Unnecessary IFX use was identified in 38.9% (96/247) of reactive IFX TDM tests performed and in 19.3% (35/181) of proactive testing.Use of both reactive and proactive IFX TDM is cost-effective for  management as it informs the clinician where unnecessary use of IFX can be stopped.

It may be associated with chronicity, premalignant nature, and high morbidity and mortality during childhood. Because of overlapping phenotypes, the definitive diagnosis based on conventional strategies is frequently a challenge. However, many patients with different molecular pathologies are treated with the same therapeutic strategy. In this context, it is essential to define a more reliable method to provide an opportunity for a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Here we report a novel homozygous exonic variant in a patient with an -like lesion in the colon during the infancy period. A 7 months old boy who was born of a consanguineous marriage developed gastrointestinal disorders early in life. After complete diagnostic workups, this case underwent conventional therapy of  for five months; but clinical remission was not achieved. We identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.684C>T p(=)) in exon 7 of  gene that  studies indicated its significance in the splicing process. At the 14 month of age, this case died. Our finding reveals the importance of genetic screening as an early diagnostic tool in the identification of the underlying causes of  with very early onset manifestations, particularly infantile (<  years of age) . This strategy makes an opportunity in prompt diagnosis and targeted therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566580>IFN-γ drives inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis through VE-cadherin-directed vascular barrier disruption.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic inflammatory disorder with rising incidence. Diseased tissues are heavily vascularized. Surprisingly, the pathogenic impact of the vasculature in  and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. IFN-γ is a major cytokine in  pathogenesis, but in the context of the disease, it is almost exclusively its immune-modulatory and epithelial cell-directed functions that have been considered. Recent studies by our group demonstrated that IFN-γ also exerts potent effects on blood vessels. Based on these considerations, we analyzed the vessel-directed pathogenic functions of IFN-γ and found that it drives  pathogenesis through vascular barrier disruption. Specifically, we show that inhibition of the IFN-γ response in vessels by endothelial-specific knockout of IFN-γ receptor  ameliorates experimentally induced colitis in mice. IFN-γ acts pathogenic by causing a breakdown of the vascular barrier through disruption of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. Notably, intestinal vascular barrier dysfunction was also confirmed in human  patients, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings. Treatment with imatinib restored VE-cadherin/adherens junctions, inhibited vascular permeability, and significantly reduced colonic inflammation in experimental colitis. Our findings inaugurate the pathogenic impact of IFN-γ-mediated intestinal vessel activation in  and open new avenues for vascular-directed treatment of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600487>HLA-DQA1*05 Carriage Associated With Development of Anti-Drug Antibodies to Infliximab and Adalimumab in Patients With Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies are the most widely used biologic drugs for treating immune-mediated diseases, but repeated administration can induce the formation of anti-drug antibodies. The ability to identify patients at increased risk for development of anti-drug antibodies would facilitate selection of therapy and use of preventative strategies.We performed a genome-wide association study to identify variants associated with time to development of anti-drug antibodies in a discovery cohort of 1240 biologic-naïve patients with Crohn's disease starting infliximab or adalimumab therapy. Immunogenicity was defined as an anti-drug antibody titer ≥10 AU/ml in a drug-tolerant ELISA assay. Significant association signals were confirmed in a replication cohort of 178 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.The HLA-DQA1*05 allele, carried by approximately 40% of Europeans, significantly increased the rate of immunogenicity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.60-.25; P=5.88×10). The highest rates of immunogenicity, 92% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with infliximab monotherapy who carried HLA-DQA1*05; conversely the lowest rates of immunogenicity, 10% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with adalimumab combination therapy who did not carry HLA-DQA1*05. We confirmed this finding in the replication cohort (HR, .00; 95% CI, 1.35-.98; P=6.60×10). This association was consistent for patients treated with adalimumab (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-.70) or infliximab (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.57-.33), and for patients treated with anti-TNF therapy alone (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-.22) or in combination with an immunomodulator (HR, .01; 95% CI, 1.57-.58).In an observational study, we found a genome-wide significant association between HLA-DQA1*05 and the development of antibodies against anti-TNF agents. A randomized controlled biomarker trial is required to determine whether pretreatment testing for HLA-DQA1*05 improves patient outcomes by helping physicians select anti-TNF and combination therapies.

TREMs are emerging as key players in pivotal mechanisms often concurring in  and neurodegeneration, namely microbiota dysbiosis, leaky gut, and inflammation. In conditions of dysbiosis, compounds released by intestinal bacteria activate TREMs on macrophages, leading to an exuberant pro-inflammatory reaction up to damage in the gut barrier. In turn, TREM-positive activated macrophages along with inflammatory mediators may reach the brain through the blood, glymphatic system, circumventricular organs, or the vagus nerve via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This leads to a systemic inflammatory response which, in turn, impairs the blood-brain barrier, while promoting further TREM-dependent neuroinflammation and, ultimately, neural injury. Nonetheless, controversial results still exist on the role of TREM- compared with TREM-1, depending on disease specificity, stage, and degree of inflammation. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide an update on the role of TREMs in the pathophysiology of  and neurodegeneration. The evidence here discussed the highlights of the potential role of TREMs, especially TREM-1, in bridging inflammatory processes in intestinal and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593096>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a young patient with ulcerative colitis: A case report.</a></h2><p>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) represents one of the most alarming forms of hemostatic abnormalities that may occur in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).Here we report a case of a 25-year-old male with ulcerative colitis, who developed such thromboembolic complication during flare of the disease. CVST in our patient was clinically manifested by headache and nausea.Angio-magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head revealed segments of contrast filling defects/absence indicating right dural venous sinus thrombosis of the transverse sinus.Immediate treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin has been introduced and led to full remission of symptoms and total recanalization of the thrombotic cerebral regions.Currently (over  years after diagnosis) the patient is in remission of the disease, and no further thromboembolic complications have been observed.Our case study highlights the clinical difficulties and challenges associated with diagnosis and treatment of CVST, as well as presents the current state of knowledge about this complication among patients with IBDs.

We investigated the role of DNAM-1 (co-activating)/TIGIT (co-inhibitory)/ligand axis in the regulation of T-cell functions and its involvement in  pathogenesis. We show that DNAM-1 and TIGIT display a peculiar expression pattern on gut mucosa T-cell populations, in a microenvironment where their shared ligands (PVR and Nectin-) are physiologically present. Moreover, DNAM-1 family receptor/ligand system is perturbed in  lesions, in a disease activity-dependent manner. The expression profile of CCR6 and CD103 mucosa addressins suggests that microenvironment-associated factors, rather than skewed recruitment of circulating T-cell populations, play a more relevant role in supporting the establishment of DNAM-1 and TIGIT expression pattern in mucosal T-cell populations, and may explain its alteration in . Although both co-receptors mark functionally competent T cells, DNAM-1 and TIGIT segregate on T cells endowed with different proliferative potential. Moreover, their opposing role in regulating T-cell proliferation exquisitely depends on ligand availability. All together, our data propose a role for DNAM-1 and TIGIT in regulating mucosal T-cell activation and immune homeostasis, and highlight the involvement of an imbalance of this system in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559172>Assessing colitis  using optical coherence elastography in a murine model.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease () that causes regions of ulceration within the interior of the colon. UC is estimated to afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. In addition to traditional colonoscopy, ultrasonic techniques can detect colitis, but have limited spatial resolution, which frequently results in underdiagnoses. Nevertheless, clinical diagnosis of colitis is still generally performed via colonoscopy. Optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed to detect UC with higher resolution. However, UC can potentially alter tissue biomechanical properties, providing additional contrast for earlier and potentially more accurate detection. Although clinically available elastography techniques have been immensely useful, they do not have the resolution for imaging small tissues, such as in small mammalian disease models. However, OCT-based elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is well-suited for imaging the biomechanical properties of small mammal colon tissue.In this work, we induced elastic waves in  mouse colon tissue using a focused air-pulse. The elastic waves were detected using a phase-stabilized swept source OCE system, and the wave velocity was translated into stiffness. Measurements were taken at six positions for each sample to assess regional sample elasticity. Additional contrast between the control and diseased tissue was detected by analyzing the dispersion of the elastic wave and tissue optical properties obtained from the OCT structural image.The results show distinct differences (P<0.05) in the stiffness between control and colitis disease samples, with a Young's modulus of 11.8±8.0 and 5.1±1.5 kPa, respectively. The OCT signal standard deviations for control and diseased samples were 5.8±0.3 and 5.5±0. dB, respectively. The slope of the OCT signal spatial frequency decay in the control samples was 92.7±10.0 and 87.3±4.7 dB∙µm in the colitis samples. The slope of the linearly fitted dispersion curve in the control samples was 1.5 mm, and 0.8 mm in the colitis samples.Our results show that OCE can be utilized to distinguish tissue based on stiffness and optical properties. Our estimates of tissue stiffness suggest that the healthy colon tissue was stiffer than diseased tissue. Furthermore, structural analysis of the tissue indicates a distinct difference in tissue optical properties between the healthy and UC-like diseased tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474792>High prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (). This study evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD and the associated risk factors among  patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Adult  patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab) were enrolled. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasound. Patients with a history of excessive alcohol or recent steroid use were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.Eighty patients, 55% male, mean age 42±15 years, were enrolled. The sonographic prevalence of NAFLD was 54% (43/80), significantly higher than the general prevalence in the US adult population (30%) (P<0.0001). NAFLD patients had a significantly higher proportion of males, as well as greater body weight and body mass index, compared to non-NAFLD. The Crohns disease activity index (CDAI) was significantly higher among patients with NAFLD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a higher CDAI was independently associated with NAFLD, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.05-.44; P=0.03).The presence of  is strongly associated with NAFLD. We identified a high prevalence of NAFLD among  patients receiving anti-TNF. CDAI was independently associated with hepatic steatosis.

We evaluatedthe predictive value of serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations for treatment failure.Prospectively, all patients treated for the first time with either infliximab or adalimumab for  between 2007 and 2018 were included. All patients were tested for serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations and were followed up until June 2018.128 patients (95 Crohn's disease, 67 females, age 40.1 ± 13.7 years) were included in the study. 81patients (63.3%) received infliximab and 47 (36.7%) adalimumab first line. Eight patients (6.3%) were primary non-responders, 50 patients (39.0%) showed a sustained clinical remission and 70 patients (54.7%) developed a secondary loss of response. Meantime to develop secondary loss of response was 24.5 ± 20.5 months. Albumin serum concentrations in the clinical response group were significantly higher than in the secondary loss of response group (39.8 ± 5.7 g/L vs. 35.0 ± 5.4 g/L). γ-globulin serum concentrations in the sustained response group were significantly lower than in the secondary loss of response group (11.8 ± .8 g/L vs. 14.7 ± 4.5 g/L). Hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia were associated with the loss of response. Immunosuppressant co-medication in patients with high γ-globulin serum concentrations reduced the risk of secondary loss of response.Low albumin and increased γ-globulin serum concentrations are strongly associated with a higher risk for loss of response to an anti-TNFα treatment. Increased serum γ-globulin concentrations may have a higher risk to produce anti-drug antibodies or a different phenotype of disease less responsive to anti-TNFα treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614035>The influence of self-criticism on depression symptoms among ambulatory patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Considering that self-criticism is an important process in the development and maintenance of depression, and taking into account the stigma associated with inflammatory bowel disease (), the present study aimed to analyse whether self-criticism exacerbates the relationships of depression symptoms with  symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame. The sample included 53 ambulatory  patients (66% females) with ages from 18 to 65. Moderation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. Self-criticism exacerbated the associations of depression with  symptoms (b = 0.01; standard error [SE] = 0.00; Z = 3.73; P < .001) and illness shame (b = 0.02; SE = 0.01; Z = .40; P = .016). For the same level of  symptomatology or chronic illness-related shame, those individuals who present more feelings of inadequacy towards the self, experience more symptoms of depression. This exacerbation effect is stronger when  symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame are more intense. A high self-critical  patient may view the illness and/or symptomatology as a flaw or error that should be self-corrected. Physicians and other health professionals should be attentive to these pathological mechanisms and should attempt to alleviate them. It may be beneficial to refer high self-critical patients to psychological care.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560042>Utilization of Diagnostic Imaging and Ionization Radiation Exposure Among an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inception Cohort.</a></h2><p>Abdominal imaging is important in managing inflammatory bowel disease ().

During the first 5 years of diagnosis,  patients were exposed to nearly 6-fold higher exposure to cumulative ionizing radiation attributable to abdominal imaging compared with non- controls (18.6 mSv vs .9 mSv). Cumulative ionizing radiation exposure was higher in CD than UC (26.0 mSv vs 12.0 mSv; P < 0.001). Crohn's disease patients were more than twice as likely as UC patients to exceed 50 mSv (15.6% vs 6.%; P < 0.001) and 100 mSV (5.0% vs .1%; P < 0.001). There was geographic variation in ionizing radiation exposure, and individuals of lower income were more likely to have high exposure. Utilization of abdominal MRI has increased substantially, peaking between 2007 and 2012 and increasing annually at 34%, which coincided with an annual % decline in the use of abdominal CT.Crohn's disease patients are at highest risk for high exposure to ionizing radiation, with a subgroup receiving potentially harmful levels.

Additionally, the adjuvant or immune enhancing potential of these two immunomodulatory agents with the commercially available IBDV vaccine was determined in chicks. The augmentation of vaccine response in terms of an enhanced antibody titer after vaccination, along with either or a combination of the two agents was noticed. The findings provide a way forward to counter the menace of IBDV in the poultry sector through use of these herbal or synthetic immunomodulatory supplements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524013>IgE-sensitization to food and inhalant allergens in  patients compared with normal blood donors at Oslo University Hospital, Norway.</a></h2><p> Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been regarded as autoimmune Th-1/Th-17- and Th--associated conditions, respectively. The aim of the study was to examine possible differences in allergen sensitization between these diseases and relative to normal blood donors (BD).  Plasma from 29 UC and 37 CD patients with moderate disease activity and 100 healthy age- and gender-matched BD, were analyzed for specific IgE to 22 food- and 28 inhalation allergens using EUROLINE atopy screen.  There was significantly higher proportion of allergen sensitized patients in UC compared to BD. Corresponding mean percentages for UC, CD and BD were 8.5, 8.9 ( = .) and 5.9 ( = .04). There was no intergroup difference in sensitization to food allergens. Most prominent result was the double level of sensitization to inhalants in CD (15%) compared to BD (8%) ( = .03). Overall highest levels of sensitization to inhalants were for grass pollens. Interestingly, the number of allergens ( = 50) the subjects were sensitized to, was significantly lower among UC ( = 20; 40%) ( = .0005) than CD ( = 31; 62%) and BD ( = 38; 76%).  The percentage of individuals sensitized to inhalants in CD and to inhalants and foods in UC, were higher than corresponding results in BD. However, whereas allergen positive reactions in CD were comparable to those in BD, they were reduced in UC because of the few UC reactions to food allergens. This contrasts previous data and the study also points to sensitization to inhalants as a potential factor in the complex pathogenesis of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589971>Levels of Vitamin D are Low After Crohn's Disease is Established But Not Before.</a></h2><p>Low serum levels of vitamin D have been associated with Crohn's disease (CD). However, it is unclear whether low vitamin D levels cause CD or CD reduces serum vitamin D.United States military personnel with CD (n=240) and randomly selected individuals without CD (controls, n=240) were matched by age, sex, race, military branch, and geography. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D in sera 8-3 years (pre-) and 3 years to 3 months before diagnosis (pre-1), and 3 months before through 21 months after diagnosis (pre-0). We genotyped VDR and GC vitamin D related polymorphisms. We used conditional logistic regression, including adjustments for smoking, season, enlistment status, and deployment, to estimate relative odds of CD according to vitamin D levels and interactions between genetic factors and levels of vitamin D.Levels of vitamin D before diagnosis were not associated with CD in pre- (P trend=.65) or pre-1 samples (P trend=.84). However, we found an inverse correlation between CD and highest tertile of vitamin D level in post-diagnosis samples (P trend=.01; odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.86). Interactions were not detected between vitamin D levels and VDR or GC polymorphisms. We observed an association between VDR Taq1 polymorphism and CD (independent of vitamin D) (P=.02).In serum samples from military personnel with CD and matched controls, we found no evidence for an association between CD and vitamin D levels up to 8 years before diagnosis. However, we observed an inverse-association between post-diagnosis vitamin D levels and CD. These findings suggest that low vitamin D does not contribute to development of CD-instead, CD leads to low vitamin D.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing  management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among  patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45./44., the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to patients with mild or no disease activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed  treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and 5-ASA compounds (77.5%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe  activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of  surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study was to report the rates and risk factors of inflammatory pouch conditions.This was a retrospective review of UC or  unspecified (IBDU) patients who underwent TPC with IPAA for refractory disease or dysplasia between 2008 and 2017. Pouchoscopy data were used to calculate rates of inflammatory pouch conditions. Factors associated with outcomes in univariable analysis were investigated in multivariable analysis.Of the 621 patients more than 18 years of age who underwent TPC with IPAA between January 2008 and December 2017, pouchoscopy data were available for 386 patients during a median follow-up period of 4 years. Acute pouchitis occurred in 205 patients (53%), 60 of whom (30%) progressed to chronic pouchitis. Cuffitis and Crohn's disease-like condition (CDLC) of the pouch occurred in 119 (30%) patients and 46 (12%) patients, respectively. In multivariable analysis, female sex was associated with a decreased risk of acute pouchitis, and pre-operative steroid use and medically refractory disease were associated with an increased risk; IBDU was associated with chronic pouchitis; rectal cuff length ≥ cm and medically refractory disease were associated with cuffitis; age 45-54 at colectomy was associated with CDLC. Rates of pouch failure were similar in chronic pouchitis and CDLC patients treated with biologics and those who were not.Inflammatory pouch conditions are common.

Leukocyte migration inhibitors are considered as promising and potentially effective therapeutic agents to treat inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. In this study, based on previous trioxotetrahydropyrimidin based integrin inhibitors that suboptimally blocked leukocyte adhesion, twelve molecules with a modified scaffold were designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro for their capacity to block the transendothelial migration of immune cells. One of the molecules, namely, methyl 4-((-(tert-butyl)-6-((,4,6-trioxotetrahydropyrimidin-5(2H)-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) benzoate, (compound 12), completely blocked leukocyte transendothelial migration, without any toxic effects on immune or endothelial cells (IC = .4 µM). In vivo, compound 12 exhibited significant therapeutic effects in inflammatory bowel disease ()/Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, fatty liver disease, and rheumatoid arthritis models. A detailed acute and chronic toxicity profile of the lead compound in vivo did not reveal any toxic effects. Such a type of molecule might therefore provide a unique starting point for designing a novel class of leukocyte transmigration blocking agents with broad therapeutic applications in inflammatory and auto-immune pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although it is rare (0.9%) in standard endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), the incidence increases to % to 3% in EVAR with hypogastric artery embolization (HAE). This study investigated whether preservation of pelvic perfusion with iliac branch devices (IBDs) decreases the incidence of ischemic colitis.We used the targeted EVAR module in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients undergoing EVAR of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm from 2012 to 2017. The cohort was further stratified into average-risk and high-risk groups. Average-risk patients were those who underwent elective repair for sizes of the aneurysms, whereas high-risk patients were repaired emergently for indications other than asymptomatic aneurysms. Within these groups, we examined the 30-day outcomes of standard EVARs, EVAR with HAE, and EVAR with IBDs. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic colitis. Secondary outcomes included mortality, major organ dysfunction, thromboembolism, length of stay, and return to the operating room. The χ test, Fisher exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and multivariate regression models were used for data analysis.There were 11,137 patients who had infrarenal EVAR identified. We designated this the all-risk cohort, which included 9263 EVAR, 531 EVAR-HAE, and 1343 EVAR- procedures. These were further stratified into 9016 cases with average-risk patients and 2121 cases with high-risk patients. In the average-risk group, 7482 had EVAR, 411 had EVAR-HAE, and 1123 had EVAR-. In the high-risk group, 1781 had EVAR, 120 had EVAR-HAE, and 220 had EVAR-. There was no significant difference in 30-day outcomes (including ischemic colitis) between EVAR, EVAR-HAE, and EVAR- in the all-risk and high-risk groups. In the average-risk cohort, EVAR-HAE was associated with a higher mortality rate than EVAR (.% vs 1.0%; adjusted odds ratio, .58; P = .01). Although EVAR- was not superior to EVAR-HAE in 30-day mortality, major organ dysfunction, or ischemic colitis in this average-risk cohort, EVAR- exhibited a trend toward lower mortality compared with EVAR-HAE in this cohort, but it was not statistically significant (1.0% vs .%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.42; P = .07).Ischemic colitis is a rare complication of EVAR. HAE does not appear to increase the risk of ischemic colitis, and preservation of pelvic perfusion with IBDs does not decrease its incidence. Although HAE is associated with significantly higher mortality than standard EVAR in average-risk patients, the preservation of pelvic perfusion with IBDs does not appear to improve mortality over HAE.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery.

PG can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (), arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes, and hematological malignancies. Multiple reports in the literature have found an association between PG and solid organ tumors. This article provides a summary and review of PG in patients with solid organ malignancies. We performed a PubMed search using the terms pyoderma gangrenosum, paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum, cancer, malignancy, tumor, and solid organ malignancy. Out of 529 papers screened, 19 relevant cases were included that reported patients above the age of 12 years old with antecedent, coincident, or subsequent occurrence of PG in association with a solid organ malignancy. The most common malignancies associated with PG were found in the breast (n = 6, 31.6%). In a majority of the cases, the site of PG was found to be the lower extremities (n = 12, 63.%). Almost all cases were presented with ulcerative PG subtype (n = 18, 94.7%). Moreover, 78.9% of cases (n = 15) were reported to have PG prior to tumor diagnosis. PG lesions resolved in 100% of patients after either tumor or PG-specific treatment. We identified a strong temporal relationship between ulcerative PG and its associated solid organ malignancy.

In the case of sibling RILs where sisters and brothers are crossed at each generation, there has been no progress in treating 4 or more loci, a limitation we overcome here without much increase in complexity.

We show that these 4  probabilities satisfy a system of linear equations that follow from self-consistency. In the absence of genetic interference-crossovers arising independently-the associated matrix can be written explicitly in terms of the recombination rates between the different loci. We provide the matrices for  up to 4 and also include a computer program to automatically generate the matrices for higher values of . Furthermore, our framework can be generalized to recombination rates that are different in female and male meiosis which allows us to show that the Haldane and Waddington -locus formula is valid in that more subtle case if the meiotic recombination rate is taken as the average rate across female and male.

Our objective was to explore the frequency and severity of neutropenia and it's complications in relation to genotype of GSD-Ib patients.We estimated cumulative incidence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia, relation of genotype to absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and dynamics of ANC during serious bacterial infections (SBI) in a cohort of Serbian GSD Ib patients. Impact of genotype on GSD Ib-related inflammatory bowel disease () was also assessed.Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500/mm was present in all 33 patients, with severe neutropenia (ANC<500/mm) occurring in 60.6% of patients. The median age at neutropenia onset was 24 months, while severe neutropenia developed at median of 4.5 years. The ANC was elevated during 90.5% episodes of SBI.

A lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet (1400 kcal/day), a kind of plant-based diet (PBD), was provided. He lost 4 kg, which was 4.6% of his base body weight. Triglyceride and total cholesterol decreased to the normal ranges. Transaminases and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase also decreased. His body weight decreased further after discharge. Follow-up ultrasonography indicated an improvement in hepatic enlargement. The shear wave velocity decreased from 1.11 to 0.88 m/s. His soft stool became normal stool by  months after discharge. Records of his health checkups revealed the presence of metabolic syndrome and abnormal liver function tests already in 2015. Thus, it was concluded that UC developed in a patient with NAFLD in this case. Plant-based diet has already been shown to be effective in inflammatory bowel disease (). In the present case, NAFLD parameters were dramatically improved by PBD. Whether the improvement was due to weight loss per se or due to weight loss with PBD is to be clarified.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We aimed to understand whether these strategies had a different impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL).This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study: patients who had a moderate to severe UC episode that prompted the utilization of immunomodulatory drugs or surgery were invited to complete a generic (short form [36] health survey [SF-36]) and a disease-specific (inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire [IBDQ]) survey.We included 157 patients, 65 (41.4%) surgically treated. The therapeutic procedure had a minimal impact on HRQoL: only the social dimension of the IBDQ and the physical function component of the SF-36 were significantly different between the study arms - lower for the surgically treated patients. The type of surgery had no impact, but the occurrence of pouchitis, namely, in a chronic form, was associated with a lower HRQoL. Regression analysis confirmed surgery as an independent predictor of lower scores in the social dimension of the IBDQ (-4.646, 95% CI -6.953 to -.339) and in the physical functioning (-9.622, 95% CI -17.061 to -.183) and physical role functioning (-3.669, 95% CI -7.339 to 0.001) dimensions of the SF36.Although usually feared by patients, surgery has a limited impact on UC patients HRQoL when compared to medical management with immunomodulatory drugs.© 2019 S.

Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) inhibitor which regulates impaired immune response.The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CZP for the induction of remission in CD.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane  group specialized register, trials registers and other sources from inception to 28 January 2019. Moreover, we contacted the pharmaceutical company that manufactures CZP.We included randomized controlled trials comparing CZP with placebo or no treatment in active CD patients.We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The main outcomes selected for GRADE analysis were clinical remission at week 8 (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] ≤150), clinical response at week 8 (CDAI reduction ≥ 100 or clinical remission), and serious adverse events. The Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method was applied for the statistical analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI).Four studies involving 1485 participants with moderate to severe CD met the inclusion criteria and were used in the meta-analyses. All studies included active CD patients with CDAI ranging from 220 to 450. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age. One study was identified as high risk of bias due to a non-identical placebo while the other studies were judged to be at low risk of bias.CZP (100 mg to 400 mg every  to 4 weeks) was shown to be superior to placebo for achieving clinical remission at week 8 (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.66; moderate certainty evidence). The raw numbers of participants achieving clinical remission at week 8 were 26.9% (225/835) and 19.8% (129/650) in the CZP and the placebo groups, respectively.CZP was shown to be superior to placebo for achieving clinical response at week 8 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.53; moderate certainty evidence). In raw numbers, clinical response at week 8 was achieved in 40.% (336/835) and 30.9% (201/650) of participants in the CZP and the placebo groups, respectively.In raw numbers, serious adverse events were observed in 8.7% (73/835) and 6.% (40/650) of participants in the CZP and the placebo groups, respectively (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.97; moderate certainty evidence). Serious adverse events included worsening Crohn's disease, infections, and malignancy.Moderate certainty evidence suggests that CZP is effective for induction of clinical remission and clinical response in participants with active CD patients. It is uncertain whether the risk of serious adverse events differs between CZP and placebo as the 95% CI includes the possibility of a small decrease or doubling of events. Future studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of CZP in CD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627210>Characterizing Clinical Features and Creating a Gene Expression Profile Associated With Pain Burden in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>There is often dissociation between inflammatory activity and abdominal pain in children with inflammatory bowel disease (), suggesting other factors may play a role in the pain experience.Patients (8 to 17 years) newly diagnosed with  were enrolled in the ALLAY Study: Assessing Risk Factors for Abdominal Pain in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease ().

The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a disease-specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I disease occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for , 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD.

Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor is a highly regulated, dynamic event in  pathogenesis. Using a lentivirus approach, NF-κB-regulated luciferase was expressed in patient macrophages, isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. Following activation, samples could be segregated into three clusters based on the NF-κB-regulated luciferase response. The ulcerative colitis (UC) samples appeared only in the hypo-responsive Cluster 1, and in Cluster . Conversely, Crohn's disease (CD) patients appeared in all Clusters with their percentage being higher in the hyper-responsive Cluster 3. A positive correlation was seen between NF-κB-induced luciferase activity and the concentrations of cytokines released into medium from stimulated macrophages, but not with serum or biopsy cytokine levels. Confocal imaging of lentivirally-expressed p65 activation revealed that a higher proportion of macrophages from CD patients responded to endotoxin lipid A compared to controls. In contrast, cells from UC patients exhibited a shorter duration of NF-κB p65 subunit nuclear localization compared to healthy controls, and CD donors. Analysis of macrophage cytokine responses and patient metadata revealed a strong correlation between CD patients who smoked and hyper-activation of p65. These  dynamic assays of NF-κB activation in blood-derived macrophages have the potential to segregate  patients into groups with different phenotypes and may therefore help determine response to therapy.Copyright © 2019 Papoutsopoulou, Burkitt, Bergey, England, Hough, Schmidt, Spiller, White, Paszek, Jackson, Martins Dos Santos, Sellge, Pritchard, Campbell, Müller and Probert.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622737>Risk Factors Associated With Early-onset Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in individuals younger than 50 years, who do not usually undergo screening if they are of average risk. We sought to identify risk factors for CRC in this population.We compared sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 18-49 years (early-onset) with patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 50 years or older (late-onset) and with age-matched, cancer-free individuals (controls) at a tertiary academic hospital. We collected data from all adult patients with a diagnosis of CRC from January 1, 2011 through April 3, 2017 from electronic health records. Associations with risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We identified 269 patients with early-onset CRC, 2802 with late-onset CRC, and 1122 controls. Compared with controls, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39-.51), have inflammatory bowel disease () (3% vs 0.4% for controls; univariable P<.01), and have a family history of CRC (OR, 8.61; CI, 4.83-15.75). Prevalence values of well-established modifiable CRC risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and diabetes, were similar. Compared to patients with late-onset CRC, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), black (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08-.65) or Asian (OR, .60; 95% CI, 1.57-4.15), and have  (OR, .97; 95% CI, 1.16-6.63) or a family history of CRC (OR, .87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.25). Sensitivity analyses excluding  and family history of CRC showed comparable results. Early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset disease to be detected in the left colon or rectum (75% vs 59%, P=.02) and at a late stage of tumor development (77% vs 62%, P=.01).In a retrospective study of patients with early-onset CRC vs late-onset CRC or no cancer, we identified non-modifiable risk factors, including sex, race, , and family history of CRC, to be associated with early-onset CRC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The aim of this study is to better characterize this possible association by conducting a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of relevant literature until April 30, 2019, was performed. Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with  and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-.42) and .29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively. Begg's test and Egger's test suggested no publication bias.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness.In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.5-.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent disease, previous use of anti-TNF-α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8.The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF-α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p = 0.009).

Differences in this parameter can result from alterations in task-related cognitive states or from resting state processes. Nowadays, advanced imaging techniques such as fMRI are more frequently used and are acknowledged among both clinicians and radiologists in the diagnostic algorithm of digestive tract diseases. Functional dyspepsia is a condition in which neuroimaging allows for analysis of dysfunctions within the brain-gut axis (BGA) engaged in processing of visceral discomfort and pain. The results of studies in patient groups with irritable bowel syndrome prove that psychosocial factors significantly affect the mechanisms regulating visceral sensitivity within the brain. The BGA includes neuronal pathways (autonomic nervous system), neuroendocrine (hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis), and neuroimmunological ones. Psychological processes affect the functioning of the digestive system and can cause dyspeptic symptoms. A patient's mental condition associated with stress can affect processes taking place in the central nervous system and trigger somatic reactions in the digestive tract through the autonomic visceral system.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616526>The importance of cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress for the quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease patients during biological therapy.

The Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire (FCSQ-14), the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), the Quality of Life SF36v2 Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the socio-demographic questionnaire were used to gather the data.A total of 14 females and 19 males were included in this analysis. The results did not prove that the disease diagnosis (UC or CD) differed the level of psychological resources. However, older respondents achieved lower results in cognitive flexibility. A positive correlation was observed between both cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and different dimensions of quality of life and satisfaction with life.There is a relationship between both cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and health-related quality of life.

Fecal calprotectin is commonly used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease () and has an average sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 96%. For diagnosing pediatric , calprotectin fecal tests have similar sensitivity (92%) but substantially less specificity (76%). Low specificity, especially in pediatric patients, means a high likelihood of false negative diagnoses, suggesting that a substantial number of active  cases remain undiagnosed and untreated. To improve on calprotectin as an effective  monitoring tool in pediatric populations, specificity must be increased. To develop an assay with higher specificity in pediatric patients, we identified a panel of multiple proteins that are present in both  flare and remission but have distinct abundance ranges between each condition. From a pilot cohort of 10 pediatric patients in states of either active disease or remission, we discovered and relatively quantified hundreds of stool proteins. Of these, our mass spectrometry-based study prioritized at least 5 that have potential to augment negative predictive power of mucosal-level inflammation alongside fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Expression of these proteins is coordinately regulated during postnatal development. While expression of claudin- and claudin-15 has been studied in inflammatory bowel disease () and celiac disease (CD), it has not been assessed in other malabsorptive diseases, and no reports have compared expression in children and adults. We used quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy to assess claudin- and claudin-15 expression in duodenal biopsies from children and adults with malabsorptive disease and healthy controls. Consistent with previous work in rodents, claudin- expression in healthy children was markedly greater, and claudin-15 expression was less, than that in adults. Claudin- expression was increased in adults with CD and downregulated in children with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, claudin-15 expression was reduced in adults with GVHD and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). These data show that one of the two Na/water pore-forming claudins is upregulated in CD and downregulated in GVHD and CVID. The specific claudin whose expression changes, however, reflects the age of the patient (child or adult). We conclude that contributions of claudin- and claudin-15 to pathophysiology of and responses to diarrhea in children and adults with GVHD and CVID differ from those in CD and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617572>Substrate-based kinase activity inference identifies MK2 as driver of colitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic and debilitating disorder that has few treatment options due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of its molecular pathogenesis. We used multiplexed mass spectrometry to collect high-content information on protein phosphorylation in two different mouse models of . Because the biological function of the vast majority of phosphorylation sites remains unknown, we developed Substrate-based Kinase Activity Inference (SKAI), a methodology to infer kinase activity from phosphoproteomic data. This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase  (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active colitis with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced inflammatory signaling in the colon and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in  and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the disease.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco- cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial barrier was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and inflammatory factors in Caco- cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco- cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable.

Growing evidences support the existence of exposure-response relationship with Vedolizumab, but the utility and the appropriate use of TDM in clinical practice is still under debate. In this review, we summarize all evidences supporting a TDM-guided approach for patients treated with Vedolizumab, suggesting three potential scenarios: 1) early prediction of long-term outcomes; ) verifying the best strategy in case of loss of response, 3) maximizing therapeutic efficacy during maintenance treatment. Vedolizumab through concentrations < 20 μg/ml at week 6 and > 12 μg/ml seem to be associated with more favourable outcomes. No comparative studies have been conducted so far to demonstrate the advantage of adopting a TDM-guided versus an empirical approach for managing primary or secondary non responses.The frequency of antibodies to Vedolizumab detection is quite low (up to 4% in pivotal trials), suggesting, unlike of anti TNF-α agents, a low probability of experiencing an immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure in clinical practice.

This retrospective study aimed at analysing which early parameters recorded during the induction period are able to predict response to IFX during the maintenance period in pediatric CD.Medical records of all CD patients ages from  to 18 years who received IFX at a tertiary  center were retrospectively analyzed. Children were classified in 3 groups according to their response at week 14 (W14) (1) remission, () clinical response or (3), no response. The factors recorded at W0, W2, and W6, which were associated with remission at W14 were analyzed using a logistic regression.Among the 111 patients included, 74.8% patients were responders to IFX at W14, including 38.7% in clinical remission and 36% with partial clinical response. Clinical remission at W14 was associated with normal growth (P < 0.01), and normal albuminemia (P = 0.01) at baseline, It was also associated with trough levels to IFX >8.3 μg/ml at week 6 (P < 0.01).Trough levels to IFX >8.3 μg/ml at week 6 are predictive of remission at W14 for luminal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650238>Pouch wall thickness and floppy pouch complex.</a></h2><p>Floppy pouch complex (FPC) consists of disease phenotypes in patients with ileal pouches, including pouch prolapse, afferent limb syndrome, enterocele, redundant loop, and pouch folding. Our recent study demonstrated that lower body weight, lower peripouch fat, family history of inflammatory bowel disease (), female gender, and dyschezia are risk factors for FPC patients with . The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between pouch wall thickness and FPC, and to investigate the association between inflamed and non-inflamed pouch wall thickness.This case-control study included all eligible patients with FPC from our prospectively maintained, IRB-approved Pouchitis Registry from 2011 to 2017. We measured pouch wall thickness of fully distended pouches on cross-sectional abdominal and pelvic imaging. Patients with stoma and non-distended pouches were completely excluded. Risk factors for FPC were analyzed.A total of 140 out of 451 patients from our were found to have fully distended pouches on imaging. Of the 140 patients, 36 (25.7%) were diagnosed as having FPC. We analyzed pouch wall thickness for each subcategory of FPC as well as non-FPC conditions. The thickness of pouch wall was follows: pouch prolapse (N = 19): 1.5 mm (1.5-.0), afferent limb syndrome (N = 12): 1.5 mm (1.1-.0), folded pouch (N = 4): 1.5 mm (1.1-1.9), and redundant pouch (N = ): 1.3 mm (1.0-1.3). The control group (N = 104) consisting of normal pouch, pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch, and pouch sinus with median pouch wall thickness of 1.5 mm, .3 mm, .0 mm, .0 mm, and 1.5 mm, respectively. There were significant differences in pouch wall thickness between normal or non-inflamed pouch versus pouchitis versus cuffitis versus Crohn's disease of the pouch with p values of 0.01, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.049, respectively.Patients with FPC were shown to have thin pouch wall, which those with inflammatory conditions of the pouch tended to have thick pouch wall.

Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- (COX-), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/ (JAK1/) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration, restoring tight junction (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced inflammatory responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595533>Assessment of steroid use as a key performance indicator in inflammatory bowel disease-analysis of data from 2385 UK patients.</a></h2><p>Patients with  are at risk of excess corticosteroids.To assess steroid excess in a large  cohort and test associations with quality improvement and prescribing.Steroid exposure was recorded for outpatients attending 19 centres and associated factors analysed. Measures taken to avoid excess were assessed.Of 2385 patients, 28% received steroids in the preceding 12 months. 14.8% had steroid excess or dependency. Steroid use was significantly lower at 'intervention centres' which participated in a quality improvement programme (exposure: 23.8% vs 31.0%, P < .001; excess 11.5% vs 17.1%, P < .001). At intervention centres, steroid use fell from 2015 to 2017 (steroid exposure 30.0%-23.8%, P = .003; steroid excess 13.8%-11.5%, P = .17). Steroid excess was judged avoidable in 50.7%. Factors independently associated with reduced steroid excess in Crohn's disease included maintenance with anti-TNF agents (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.24-0.95]), treatment in a centre with a multi-disciplinary team (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.20-0.86]) and treatment at an intervention centre (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.46-0.97]). Treatment with 5-ASA in CD was associated with higher rates of steroid excess (OR 1.72 [95% CI 1.24-.09]). In ulcerative colitis (UC), thiopurine monotherapy was associated with steroid excess (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.19-3.01]) and treatment at an intervention centre with less steroid excess (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.45-0.95]).This study validates steroid assessment as a meaningful quality measure and provides a benchmark for this performance indicator in a large cohort.

For each patient, the average and maximum of each day's pain scores were used to measure changes in pain from admission to discharge using mixed model regression, with opiate use as a time-dependent covariate.The daily average pain score over the entire hospitalization was 4.23 ± .09, and the maximum pain score was 8.28 ± 1.75. Among opioid users (n = 51), the daily average pain score was 4.65 ± .16 and the maximum pain score was 7.53 ± .56. Across all cases from admission to discharge, there was less than a 1-point change in daily average pain (- 0.96 ± .03, p = 0.0009), and no change in maximum pain (- 0.89 ± 3.59, p = 0.0671). Opioid users, a subset of the overall cohort, had a similar less than one-point drop in daily average pain (- 0.94 ± - 0.29, p = 0.0024) and no change in daily maximum pain scores (- 0.81 ± - 0.47, p = 0.0914).

CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco- cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease () and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from  patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses.

Patients were randomly assigned to groups given intravenous placebo (n=63), mirikizumab 50 mg (n=63) or 200 mg (n=62) with exposure-based dosing, or mirikizumab 60 mg with fixed dosing (n=61), at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Of assigned patients, 63% had prior exposure to a biologic agent. Clinical responders (decrease in 9-point Mayo score, including ≥ points and ≥35% from baseline with either a decrease of rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1) at week 12 who had received mirikizumab were randomly assigned to groups that received maintenance treatment with mirikizumab 200 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks (n=47) or every 12 weeks (n=46). The primary endpoint was clinical remission (Mayo subscores of 0 for rectal bleeding, with 1-point decrease from baseline for stool frequency, and 0 or 1 for endoscopy) at week 12. A multiple testing procedure was used that began with the 600-mg dose group, and any non-significant comparison result ended the formal statistical testing procedure.At week 12, 15.9% (P=.066), 22.6% (P=.004), and 11.5% (P=.142) of patients in the 50-mg, 200-mg, and 600-mg groups achieved clinical remission, respectively, compared with 4.8% of patients given placebo. The primary endpoint was not significant (comparison to 600 mg, P>.05). Clinical responses occurred in 41.3% (P=.014), 59.7% (P<.001), and 49.% (P=.001) of patients in the 50-mg, 200-mg, and 600-mg groups, respectively, compared to 20.6% of patients given placebo.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± .88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81).

Chemically induced colitis models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of inflammatory bowel disease () since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's disease. This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced colitis. We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed platform for studies published through December 2018, using MeSH terms (Crohn Disease.kw) OR (Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.kw) OR (Colitis, Ulcerative.kw) AND (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.kw) AND (disease models, animal.kw) AND (mice.all).

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco- cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco- cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating -associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤ on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.5%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (5.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo. Through 52 weeks of exposure, there were two deaths (one each from acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemorrhage from esophageal varices) and seven cases of cancer (one each of prostate, colon, renal papillary, and rectal cancer and three nonmelanoma skin cancers) among 825 patients who received ustekinumab and no deaths and one case of cancer (testicular cancer) among 319 patients who received placebo.Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

Developing novel efficient therapeutics is still a common interest for clinicians. Increasing evidence have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to the pathological pain state in some pain models. Resveratrol (RSV) has showed promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain. However, whether RSV has analgesic effect on visceral pain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established the colitis model through intrarectal administration of ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and found that TNBS induced colonic inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Meanwhile, astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TRAF6, phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were increased in L6-S1 spinal cord after TNBS enema. Then, intrathecal injection of TRAF6 siRNA attenuated visceral pain, blocked the upregulation of pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the spinal cord in TNBS mice. Furthermore, spinal administration of NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 reversed the pain behavior and suppressed spinal TNF-α and IL-1β expression in TNBS mice. Finally, repeated intrathecal injection of RSV reversed TNBS-induced visceral pain hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TNBS-induced enhancement of spinal GFAP, TRAF6, pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were reduced by the same treatment of RSV. In conclusion, our results suggest that RSV exerts the effects of antinociception on colitis-induced visceral hyperalgesia through inhibition of spinal TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway and the production of inflammatory mediators in the spinal cord, suggesting a new application of RSV for the treatment of visceral pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There are  main subsets of Treg cells: FOXP3 (forkhead box protein 3)-positive Treg cells, which do not produce high levels of effector cytokines, and type 1 Treg (Tr1) cells, which are FOXP3-negative and secrete interleukin (IL) 10. IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, so Tr1 cells might be used the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. We aimed to develop methods to isolate and expand human Tr1 cells and define their functions.We obtained blood samples and colon biopsy samples from patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or healthy individuals (controls). CD4 T cells were isolated from blood samples and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and Tr1 cells were purified by using an IL10 cytokine-capture assay and cell sorting. FOXP3-positive Treg cells were sorted as CD4CD25CD127 cells from unstimulated cells. Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were expanded, and phenotypes and gene expression profiles were compared. T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and the suppressive abilities of Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were measured. Human colon organoid cultures were established, cultured with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. T84 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells) were incubated with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and transepithelial electrical resistance was measured to determine epithelial cell barrier function.Phenotypes of Tr1 cells isolated from control individuals vs patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not differ significantly after expansion. Tr1 cells and FOXP3-positive Treg cells suppressed proliferation of effector T cells, but only Tr1 cells suppressed secretion of IL1B and tumor necrosis factor from myeloid cells. Tr1 cells, but not FOXP3-positive Treg cells, isolated from healthy individuals and patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis secreted IL22, which regulated repair of the epithelium and promoted barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. Tr1 cell culture supernatants promoted differentiation of mucin-producing goblet cells in intestinal organoid cultures.Human Tr1 cells suppress proliferation of effector T cells (adaptive immune response) and production of IL1B and TNF by myeloid cells (inmate immune response). They also secrete IL22 to regulate repair of the epithelium and promote barrier function. They might be developed as a cell-based therapy for intestinal inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These changes are directly related to the content of OMSW in the growing substrate. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-in-flammatory bowel disease () mice model, we measured the colonic inflammatory response to the different glucan preparations. We found that the histology damaging score (HDS) resulting from DSS treatment reach a value of 11.8 ± .3 were efficiently downregulated by treatment with the fungal extracted glucans. Glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 20% OMSW downregulated to a HDS value of 6.4 ± 0.5 whereas those cultivated at 80% OMSW showed the strongest effects (5.5 ± 0.6). Similar downregulatory effects were obtained for expression of various intestinal cytokines. All tested glucans were equally effective in regulating the number of CD14/CD16 monocytes from 18. ± .7% for DSS to 6.4 ± .0 for DSS + glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 50% OMSW. We tested the effect of glucans on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-α, which demonstrated that stalk-derived glucans were more effective than caps-derived glucans. Isolated glucans competed with anti-Dectin-1 and anti-CR3 antibodies, indicating that they contain β-glucans recognized by these receptors. In conclusion, the most effective glucans in ameliorating -associated symptoms induced by DSS treatment in mice were glucan extracts prepared from the stalk of P. eryngii grown at higher concentrations of OMSW. We conclude that these stress-induced growing conditions may be helpful in selecting more effective glucans derived from edible mushrooms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476872>The use of serum calprotectin as a biomarker for inflammatory activity in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>simple, reliable and non-invasive biomarkers are needed to enable the early detection of inflammatory activity for the correct management of inflammatory bowel disease ().

The study parameters included SC, fecal calprotectin (FC) and conventional blood test parameters. Clinical indices (Harvey and Walmsley) and relevant endoscopic scores were completed for each scenario (Simple Endoscopic Score Crohn Disease [SES-CD] and Mayo).fifty-three patients were included in the study, 51% (27 patients) with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 49% (26 patients) with Crohn's disease (CD). The CS values in UC were significantly higher with an endoscopic Mayo score /3 (median score 10.39 mg/ml [IQR: 7.4-12.]) compared to those with a Mayo score of 0/1 (median 4.07 mg/ml [IQR: .9-7.]) (p = 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was 0.85 and the sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 81.25%, respectively, for a SC cut-off point of 4.4 mg/dl. Furthermore, a higher AUCROC was obtained in comparison with other serological markers for activity (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], hemoglobin [Hb] and platelets). There were no statistically significant differences in the comparison between SC and endoscopic findings in CD (SES CD > 3: 20.1 [IQR: 16.8-23.4] vs SESC ≤ 3:6.25 [IQR: 5.4-7.1]) (p = 0.8).SC is a good indirect marker of inflammatory activity and there was a correlation with endoscopic findings in UC.

The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between maintenance anti-TNF levels and perianal fistula outcomes.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients receiving maintenance adalimumab or infliximab therapy (minimum 24 weeks) for the treatment of Crohn's disease with associated perianal fistulas, who had anti-TNF drug/antibody levels (trough for infliximab) measured within 4 weeks of clinical assessment. The primary outcome was the association of anti-TNF levels with perianal fistula healing defined as the absence of drainage. The secondary outcome was the association of anti-TNF levels with complete perianal fistula closure.A total of 64 patients (adalimumab, n = 35; infliximab, n = 29) were included.

The secondary end point was to provide characterization of incident cancer types.All incident cases of cancer occurring in  patients from December 2011-2017 were prospectively recorded in 16 Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease units. Each of the  patients with a new diagnosis of cancer was matched with   patients without cancer, according to  phenotype (ulcerative colitis [UC] vs Crohn's disease [CD]), age (±5 years), sex. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Cancer occurred in 403  patients: 204 CD (CD cases), 199 UC (UC cases). The study population included 1209 patients (403  cases, 806  controls). Cancer (n = 403) more frequently involved the digestive system (DS; 32%), followed by skin (14.9%), urinary tract (9.7%), lung (6.9%), genital tract (6.5%), breast (5.5%), thyroid (1.9%), lymphoma (.7%, only in CD), adenocarcinoma of the small bowel (SBA; 3.9%, 15 CD, 1 pouch in UC), other cancers (15.9%). Among cancers of the DS, colorectal cancer (CRC) more frequently occurred in UC (29% vs 17%; P < 0.005), whereas SBA more frequently occurred in CD (13% vs 6.3% P = 0.039). In CD, perforating (B3) vs non-stricturing non-perforating (B1) behavior represented the only risk factor for any cancer (odds ratio [OR], .33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-4.11).

With different protocol, derivatives such as advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF), injected PRF (I-PRF) and concentrated growth factors (CGF) have been demonstrated effectively in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The aim of this study was to compare the level of growth factors releasing from A-PRF and CGF, and their clinical efficacy in the regenerative management of intrabony defects (IBDs).Thirty-two blood samples were collected from 8 healthy donors and assessed for PDGF-AB, VEGF, BMP- and TGF-β1 release at indicated times. In addition, the clinical records of forty-five patients (15 per group) who had undergone guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with or without A-PRF/CGF were retrieved. The probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Intrabony component (IC) depth, radiographic bone level (RBL) and bone defect filling were assessed radiographically.A-PRF had a looser fibrin network than the CGF but presented larger amounts of growth factors with a more sustained release period. Although there was no difference in PPD reduction, CAL gain, RBL height change and defect filling (%) between A-PRF and CGF group, both achieved a more favorable clinical result in IC height reduction and defect filling (%) than the control.A-PRF and CGF have the ability to stimulate a continual and steady release of total growth factors over a 14-day period.

Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, defined as HBI <5, and endoscopic improvement, as measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD).One hundred CD patients (45 male, 55 female), median age 47 (19, 78) years, were included; clinical response rate was 60%, and clinical remission was 36%. The response rate in patients with ileal pyroptosis <14 positive cells per 1000 IECs was significantly higher than those above the threshold: 89% (25 of 28) vs 49% (35 of 72), odds ratio (OR) 8.8 (95% CI, .3-48.6; P < 0.001). Corresponding remission rates were 54% (15 of 28) vs 29% (21 of 72; OR .8 [1.03-7.59; P = 0.036]). For endoscopic improvement, ileal pyroptosis of 22 positive cells per 1000 IECs was the optimal threshold that determines the magnitude SES-CD change.Ileal biopsy IEC pyroptosis was predictive of clinical response and endoscopic improvement to vedolizmab in CD patients.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The clinical data of 161 children with  was collected from the electronic medical records in the Department of Pediatrics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2017. These patients were divided into Crohn's disease (CD) group and ulcerative colitis (UC) group, accounting for 82.0% (132 cases) and 18.0%(29 cases), respectively. The incidence of EIMs in each group was analyzed. The potential risk factors of EIMs including the  phenotype, gender, age, location of the CD lesion, disease activity of CD, and the presence of perianal lesion were analyzed with logistic regression model.  Eighty-eight patients (54.7%) had EIMs. The main EIMs were immune-mediated EIMs and growth retardation, accounting for 41.0% (66/161) and 24.% (39/161), respectively. Aphthous ulcer (39/161, 23.0%) was the most common symptom among immune-mediated EIMs, followed by arthropathy (20/161, 12.4%) and skin lesions (19/161, 11.8%). Forty-three patients (26.7%) had EIMs before being diagnosed as . Fifty-eight (65.9%) patients had only one EIM during the whole course of . By logistic regression analysis, CD (5.536, 95:1.825-16.788) and perianal disease (1.969, 95:1.035-3.746) were the risk factors of immune-mediated EIMs. Meanwhile, CD (11.319, 95: 1.487-86.179), younger than six-year-old at diagnosis (8.556, 95: 3.109-23.545), moderate to severe activity of CD (3.447, 95: 1.196-9.934) and perianal disease (3.361, 95: 1.720-7.793) increased the risk of growth retardation.

Although higher drug trough levels (TLs) are associated with sustained clinical outcomes, there are concerns that they may be associated with a higher risk of adverse events (AEs). The aim was to evaluate the presence of a possible association between drug TLs and the occurrence of AEs in  patients treated with anti-TNF drugs.  We retrospectively studied a cohort of 113  patients treated with adalimumab or infliximab, of whom 27 were in combination therapy with immunosuppressants. TLs were measured using a homogeneous mobility shift assay.  During a median follow-up of 16 months (range 1-144), we observed 103 AEs occurring in 58 patients. We found no statistically significant difference ( = .21) in median TLs between patients who did 6.7 mcg/mL; range 0.0-36.) or did not (7.7 mcg/mL; range 0.0-20.7) experience an AE. No difference was observed in the rate of AEs between patients in mono- or combination therapy ( = .38), as well as between elderly (i.e., >65 years) and younger patients ( = .32). Considering a TL cutoff of 7 mcg/mL for infliximab and 12 mcg/mL for adalimumab, or even double these TL values, we observed no statistically significant difference in the rate of AEs occurrence.  Our study suggests that, when clinically required, anti-TNF drug dosage may be increased without particular concerns regarding the risk of AEs occurrence in  patients, even in patients on combination therapy and elderly ones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455255>Association between serum IgG level and clinical course in primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease. The pathomechanism is still not fully understood, but there is evidence that immune-mediated processes may contribute to disease progression.We studied the prognostic relevance of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) elevated above the upper limit of normal as a marker for immune activation at initial diagnosis and its influence on transplantation-free survival in a well-defined cohort of PSC patients.The final study cohort comprises of 148 PSC patients. Elevated IgG levels were found in 66 patients (44.6%). Apart from their younger age at first diagnosis, there was no significant difference between patients with or without elevated IgG levels. The presence of a concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, an autoimmune hepatitis or immunosuppressive medication was equally distributed between both groups. Patients with elevated IgG levels reached the combined endpoint (34 (59.6%) vs. 23 (40.4%); p = 0.004) significantly more often and had reduced transplantation-free survival (Log-rank: 24.0 (10.-37.9) vs. 14.0 (8.5-19.5); p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis including age, gender, presence of , presence of dominant stricture (DS), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), immunosuppression, biochemical response to UDCA and elevated IgG-levels confirmed MRS (p = 0.03), DS (p = 0.04), biochemical response (p = 0.04) and elevated IgG level (p = 0.04) as independent risk factors for reduced transplantation-free survival.We identified elevated serum IgG levels at first diagnosis as an independent risk factor for reduced transplant free-survival in patients with PSC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669514>Comparison of the Quantum Blue® Reader Point-of-Care system versus ELISA technique for therapeutic drug monitoring of Infliximab levels.</a></h2><p>Infliximab (IFX) is a monoclonal antibody used to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease (). For IFX therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the most commonly used analysis is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) which do not allow results to be provided in real-time. The aim of this study was to compare the in-house ELISA (Promonitor IFX) with the much faster assay Quantum Blue® IFX (QB) for quantification of serum IFX concentration among  patients in maintenance IFX therapy.We studied 30 serum samples from outpatients in IFX maintenance therapy at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark. Samples were used to compare IFX measurements from Promonitor IFX with QB. Therapeutic intervals of <3 μg/mL, 3-7 μg/mL and >7 μg/mL were equally covered. Differences were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and Student t-test. Correlation was evaluated using x,y-plot and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The intermediate imprecision (CV%) of QB was measured at two levels (3 μg/mL and 7 μg/mL). For qualitative comparison, weighted kappa statistics (κ) were determined after stratification of results by therapeutic interval.Promonitor IFX and QB were strongly correlated (r = 0.92, p<0.001). The mean difference between Promonitor IFX and QB was -0.57 μg/mL (p = 0.). The CV% of QB was 16.3% at 3 μg/mL and 16.7% at 7 μg/mL. Classification of results according to therapeutic interval showed almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.81).QB is a suitable alternative to Promonitor IFX for TDM in patients treated with IFX for . The results revealed a strong correlation between methods, in particular at lower IFX concentrations, representing the most interesting clinical range. When the samples were stratified according to the therapeutic interval, an almost perfect agreement between the methods was observed.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Among 1125 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 774, 294, and 57 initiated infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, respectively. Rates of non-persistence and switching were higher in UC than in CD. One- and 3-year non-persistence rates were 14.% and 26.5% in CD and 35.4% and 53.4% in UC, respectively. One- and 3-year switching rates were 3.7% and 10.1% in CD and 15.6% and 22.0% in UC, respectively.

This Mediterranean aromatic plant, used as a gastronomic spice and as food preservative by the food industry has been studied mainly due to its essential oil antibacterial properties, composed primarily by monoterpenes. With this work, we aimed to evaluate the effects of a phenolic extract of pennyroyal in the impairment of inflammatory processes in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases () and in the potential inhibition of progression to colorectal cancer (CRC).To that purpose, we evaluated the effect of pennyroyal extract administration in a model of TNBS-induced colitis in mice and further determined its effect on human colon carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion.The phenolic extract of pennyroyal exhibited antioxidant properties in in vitro assays and administration of the extract in a rat model of carrageenan-induced paw oedema led to significant anti-inflammatory effects. Further results evidenced a beneficial effect of the phenolic extract in the attenuation of experimental colitis and a potential antiproliferative effect on cultured colon cancer cells, effects not previously described, to our knowledge. A reduction in several markers of colon inflammation was observed following administration of the extract to colitis-induced mice, including functional and histological indicators. A successful inhibition of cancer cell invasion and proliferation was also observed in in vitro studies with HT-29 cells. Furthermore, the extract also led to a reduced expression of iNOS/COX- in the colon of colitis-induced mice, both being crucial mediators of intestinal inflammation.Taking into consideration the central role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of CRC and the recognised connection between inflammatory events and cancer, these results enlighten the relevance of the phenolic constituents of pennyroyal as important pharmacological sources in the investigation of new treatment options for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In view of recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, we sought to understand their current knowledge and working practices.A Web-based survey was advertised to chiropractors and osteopaths via the Royal College of Chiropractors and the Institute of Osteopathy.Of 382 completed responses [237 chiropractors (62%) and 145 osteopaths (38%)], all were familiar with AS, but only 63 and 25% were familiar with the terms axSpA and non-radiographic axSpA, respectively. Seventy-seven per cent were confident with inflammatory back pain. Respondents routinely asked about  (91%), psoriasis (81%), acute anterior uveitis (49%), peripheral arthritis (71%), genitourinary/gut infection (56%), enthesitis (30%) and dactylitis (20%). Eighty-seven per cent were aware of the association between axSpA and HLA-B27. Only 29% recognized that axSpA was common in women. Forty per cent recommend an X-ray (pelvic in 80%) and, if normal, 27% would recommend MRI of the sacroiliac joints and whole spine. Forty-four per cent were aware of biologic therapies. Forty-three per cent were confident with the process of onward referral to rheumatology via the general practitioner (GP). The principal perceived barrier to onward referral was reluctance by the GP to accept their professional opinion.Overall knowledge of ankylosing spondylitis is good, but the term axSpA is poorly understood. Specific learning needs include gender preponderance, awareness of acute anterior uveitis and the availability of biological therapies.

A total of 137  patients, including 40 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 97 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 50 healthy controls (HCs), were recruited. Serum food-specific IgG antibodies were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum food-specific IgE antibodies were measured by Western blot. The value of food-specific IgG antibodies was compared among different groups, and potent factors related to these antibodies were explored by binary logistic regression.Food-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 57.5% of UC patients, in 90.72% of CD patients and in 42% of HCs. A significantly high prevalence and titer of food-specific IgG antibodies were observed in CD patients compared to UC patients and HCs. The number of IgG-positive foods was greater in CD and UC patients than in HCs (CD  HCs,  = 0.000; UC  HCs,  = 0.029). The top five food antigens that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in CD patients were tomato (80.68%), corn (69.32%), egg (63.64%), rice (61.36%), and soybean (46.59%). The foods that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in UC patients were egg (60.87%), corn (47.83%), tomato (47.83%), rice (26.09%), and soybean (21.74%).

We utilized the latest available country-specific incidence rates, and aggregate data for 20 determinants, from over 50 countries accounting for more than half of the global population. We presented the associations with exponentiated beta coefficients [exp(β)] indicating the relative increase of disease incidence per unit increase in the predictor variables.Country-specific incidence estimates demonstrate wide variability across the world, with a median of 4.8 new UC cases (IQR .4-9.3), and 3.5 new CD cases (IQR 0.8-5.7) per 100,000 population per year. Latitude [exp(β) 1.05, 95% CI 1.04‒1.06, per degree increase], prevalence of obesity (1.05, 1.02‒1.07, per 1% increase) and of tobacco smoking (0.97, 0.95‒0.99, per 1% increase) explained 71.5% of UC incidence variation across countries in the adjusted analysis. The model for CD included latitude (1.04, 1.02‒1.06), expenditure for health (1.03, 1.01‒1.05, per 100 PPP/year per capita increase) and physical inactivity prevalence (1.03, 1.00‒1.06, per 1% increase) explaining 58.3% of incidence variation across countries.

The infiltration of immune cells into the mucosa and uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators trigger the chronic inflammatory reaction in the intestine [1]. The inflammatory setting consists of subsequent events that comprise an induction phase, the peak of inflammation which is subsequently followed by the resolution phase. The induction phase, which represents the first phase of inflammation, is important for the rapid and efficient activation of the immune system for sufficient host defense. The permanent sensing of exogenous or endogenous danger signals enables the fast initiation of the inflammatory reaction. The immune cell infiltrate initiates an inflammatory cascade where released lipid and protein mediators play an indispensable role [, 3]. The last decades of research strongly suggest that resolution of inflammation is similarly a tightly coordinated and active process. The basic concept that resolution of inflammation has to be regarded as an active process has been thoroughly described by others [4-6]. The following review focuses on mechanisms, pathways, and specific mediators that are actively involved in the resolution of inflammation in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665264>Inflammation, but Not the Underlying Disease or Its Location, Predicts Oral Iron Absorption Capacity in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Anaemia is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [], its two main aetiologies being iron deficiency anaemia [IDA] and anaemia of chronic inflammation [ACI]. Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying diseases, disease locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult  patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with  [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying disease type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at  h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying disease type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

Furthermore, intestinal inflammation increases the risk of enteric cancer, which is a common malignancy globally. Native anti-inflammatory peptides are a class of anti-inflammatory agents that could be used in the treatment of several intestinal inflammation conditions. However, potential cytotoxicity, and poor anti-inflammatory activity have prevented their development as anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, in this study, we designed and developed a novel hybrid peptide for the treatment of intestinal inflammation. Eight hybrid peptides were designed by combining the active centers of antimicrobial peptides, including LL-37 (13-36), YW12D, innate defense regulator 1, and cathelicidin  (1-13) with thymopentin or the active center of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) (17-24). The hybrid peptide, LL-37-Tα1 (LTA), had improved anti-inflammatory activity with minimal cytotoxicity. LTA was screened by molecule docking and  experiments. Likewise, its anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms were also evaluated using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal inflammation murine model. The results showed that LTA prevented LPS-induced impairment in the jejunum epithelium tissues and infiltration of leukocytes, which are both histological markers of inflammation. Additionally, LTA decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. LTA increased the expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin, and reduced permeability and apoptosis in the jejunum of LPS-treated mice. Additionally, its anti-inflammatory effect is associated with neutralizing LPS, binding to the Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor  (TLR4/MD-) complex, and modulating the nuclear factor-kappa B signal transduction pathway. The findings of this study suggest that LTA may be an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460574>IMMUNIZATION STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.</a></h2><p>Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease () includes a variety of immunosuppressants and biological agents, which increase the risk of infections due to altered cellular and humoral immunity.

Seventy-five patients with  were identified. Cases were matched to controls by age, sex, injury severity, and mechanism using 4:1 propensity score-matching analysis. Injury characteristics, clinical course, and infectious and noninfectious complications were compared using bivariate and multivariate analysis.Participants had a mean age of 56 years and mean injury severity score of 15. Of the 75 cases, 44% had ulcerative colitis, 44% had Crohn's disease, and 12% had undetermined type. More cases were on an immunosuppressant (19% vs %, P < 0.01) or steroids (8% vs %, P = 0.02) on admission compared with controls. More cases had prior abdominal surgery (P = 0.01). Cases had fewer brain injuries (P = 0.02) and higher admission Glasgow Coma Scale (P < 0.01) but required more neurosurgical intervention (P = 0.03). Cases required more orthopedic surgeries (P < 0.01) and more pain management consultations (P = 0.04).

However, DCE has not been widely adopted into clinical practice yet. We aimed to evaluate quality indicators in  surveillance following introduction of structured changes in service delivery.In August 2016 we introduced a number of changes to  surveillance practice in our endoscopy unit. These included training using interactive videos/images in a structured module; DCE as standard by using a foot-pedal operated pump jet; allocation of 45-minute procedure slot; targeted biopsies (except high risk patients); scoring of endoscopic disease activity; lesion detection/morphology characterization. All  surveillance colonoscopies were allocated to a small team of four DCE trained endoscopists. We compared quality measures for surveillance procedures performed pre- and post-August 2016. The two groups were compared using Chi-square statistics.A total of 598  surveillance procedures (277 pre-August 2016 and 321 post-August 2016) were performed and included in the study. Use of DCE increased (54.% vs. 76.0% p<0.0005) whilst random biopsy surveillance reduced (12.3% vs. 3.1% p<0.0005). The use of Paris classification (26.1% vs. 57.0% p<0.0005) and Kudo pit pattern increased (21.7% vs. 59.0% p<0.0005). There was also an increased lesion detection rate (24.9% vs. 33.1% p<0.05).Implementation of extensive changes in practice of surveillance colonoscopy resulted in significant improvement in quality indicators within a short period.

These effector-host protein interactions are often dynamic and transient in nature, making them difficult to identify using traditional interaction-based methods. Here, we performed a systematic comparison between proximity-dependent biotin labelling (BioID) and immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate a series of Salmonella type 3 secreted effectors that manipulate host intracellular trafficking (SifA, PipB2, SseF, SseG and SopD2). Using BioID, we identified 632 candidate interactions with 381 unique human proteins, collectively enriched for roles in vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton components and transport activities. From the subset of proteins exclusively identified by BioID, we report that SifA interacts with BLOC-, a protein complex that regulates dynein motor activity. We demonstrate that the BLOC- complex is necessary for SifA-mediated positioning of Salmonella-containing vacuoles, and affects stability of the vacuoles during infection. Our study provides insight into the coordinated activities of Salmonella type 3 secreted effectors and demonstrates the utility of BioID as a powerful, complementary tool to characterize effector-host protein interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504569>Effectiveness and Safety of the Sequential Use of a Second and Third Anti-TNF Agent in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results From the Eneida Registry.</a></h2><p>The effectiveness of the switch to another anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent is not known.

In the short term, remission was achieved in 55% of the patients with the second anti-TNF. The incidence of loss of response was 19% per patient-year with the second anti-TNF. Combination therapy (hazard ratio [HR], .4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-3; P < 0.0001) and ulcerative colitis vs Crohn's disease (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-.1; P = 0.005) were associated with a higher probability of loss of response. Fifteen percent of the patients had adverse events, and 10% had to discontinue the second anti-TNF. Of the 71 patients who received a third anti-TNF, 55% achieved remission. The incidence of loss of response was 22% per patient-year with a third anti-TNF. Adverse events occurred in 7 patients (11%), but only 1 stopped the drug.Approximately half of the patients who received a second anti-TNF achieved remission; nevertheless, a significant proportion of them subsequently lost response.

In IL-10mice, various experimental regimens including piroxicam, ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), respectively were used for promoting colitis; colitis was induced with DSS in FVB mice. Using clinical and small animal ultrasound scanners, evolution of inflammation in proximal, middle and distal colon, was monitored with USMI by using MB at multiple time points. Imaged colon segments were analyzed  for inflammatory changes on H&E staining and for P-selectin expression on immunofluorescence staining. : Sustained colitis was not detected with USMI in IL-10 or FVB mice with various experimental regimens. USMI signals either gradually decreased after the colitis enhancing/inducing drug/agents were discontinued, or the mortality rate of mice was high. Inflammation was observed on H&E staining in IL-10 mice with piroxicam promotion, while stable overexpression of P-selectin was not found on immunofluorescence staining in the same mice. : Sustained colitis in IL-10 mice induced with piroxicam, TNBS or DSS, and in FVB mice induced with DSS, was not detected with USMI using MB, and this was verified by immunofluorescence staining for inflammation marker P-selectin.

The incidence of type  diabetes, traditionally viewed as an adult disease, is increasing at alarming rates in children, paralleling the rise in childhood obesity. As the rates of diabetes increase in children, accurate population-based assessment of disease burden is important for those implementing strategies for health services delivery. Health administrative data are a powerful tool that can be used to track disease burden, health services use, and health outcomes. Case validation is essential in ensuring accurate disease identification using administrative databases.The aim of our study was to define and validate a pediatric diabetes case ascertainment algorithm (including any form of childhood-onset diabetes) using health administrative data.We conducted a two-stage method using linked health administrative data and data extracted from charts. In stage 1, we linked chart data from a large urban region to health administrative data and compared the diagnostic accuracy of various algorithms. We selected those that performed the best to be validated in stage . In stage , the most accurate algorithms were validated with chart data within two other geographic areas in the province of Quebec.Accurate identification of diabetes in children (ages ≤15 years) required four physician claims or one hospitalization (with International Classification of Disease codes within 1 year (sensitivity 91.%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 89.-92.9]; positive predictive value [PPV] 93.5%, 95% CI 91.7-95.0) or using only four physician claims in  years (sensitivity 90.4%, 95% CI 88.3-92.; PPV 93.%, 95% CI 91.7-95.0).

Gut dysbiosis is thought to be the critical factor in diabetic intestinal pathogenesis. As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in gut homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (). Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal epithelium.16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the gut microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the tight junction pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal barrier function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal barrier structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the tight junction pathway and ZO-1 expression.© 2019 The Authors.

Endoscopic outcome data are limited, especially in anti-TNF naïve patients. The present study compared endoscopic outcome in anti-TNF naïve and exposed patients, and explored if this was affected by drug exposure.We retrospectively analysed all patients initiating vedolizumab at our tertiary referral centre since 2015. For UC, endoscopic improvement was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 at week 14. For CD, endoscopic remission was defined as absence of ulcerations at week 22. Vedolizumab trough concentrations were measured at week 6, week 14 and during maintenance.A total of 336 patients were identified (53.3% CD), 20% of them were anti-TNF naïve. Endoscopic improvement was achieved by 56.1% of UC patients and endoscopic remission by 39.1% of CD patients. Endoscopic outcomes were significantly better in anti-TNF naïve vs exposed patients (all 67.% vs 42.0%, p=0.0002; UC 74.4% vs 50.0%, p=0.02; CD: 57.1% vs 35.8%, p=0.03). Achievement of endoscopic endpoints significantly impacted long-term treatment continuation (p=9.7x10-13). A better endoscopic outcome was associated with significant higher drug exposure in both CD and UC.The results of this observational, single-centre real-life study suggest that vedolizumab may induce endoscopic remission in both CD and UC. Although anti-TNF naïve patients had a significantly better outcome, 42% of anti-TNF exposed patients still benefited endoscopically. A clear exposure-endoscopic response relationship exists, however not all patients will benefit from treatment intensification. Hence, predictive biomarkers will remain necessary.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The prevalence of 30-day -specific readmission was determined. The association between 30-day readmission and visit outcomes, specifically length of stay and a composite of comorbid conditions (venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, sepsis, Clostridium difficile infection, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and blood transfusion), was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Patients with  accounted for 35,514 and 39,506 inpatient stays in New York and Florida, respectively. Of these stays, 13.7% to 16.% resulted in a 30-day readmission. On multivariable analysis, 30-day readmissions were associated with a longer length of stay than index hospitalizations by 1.00 day (adjusted regression coefficient, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.73-1.26) and a higher likelihood of having a comorbid condition (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.68-1.99) in New York. Similar associations were confirmed in Florida.Nearly 1 in 7 hospitalizations of patients with  lead to a 30-day readmission.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with  treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, .8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with , 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy. In patients with CD, the probability of nonadherence increased as the number of risk factors increased.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473900>Paeoniflorin Prevents Intestinal Barrier Disruption and Inhibits Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Inflammation in Caco- Cell Monolayers.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () in humans is closely related to bacterial infection and the disruption of the intestinal barrier. Paeoniflorin (PF), a bioactive compound from Paeonia lactiflora Pallas plants, exerts a potential effect of anti-inflammatory reported in various researches. However, the effect of PF on intestinal barrier function and its related mechanisms has not been identified. Here, we investigate the PF potential anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human Caco- cell monolayers and explore its underlying key molecular mechanism. In this context, PF significantly increased TEER value, decreased intestinal epithelium FITC-dextran flux permeability, and restored the expressions of occludin, ZO-1, and claudin5 in LPS-induced Caco- cell. In vitro, treatment of PF significantly inhibited LPS-induced expression of cyclooxygenase- (COX-), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). In addition, we found that PF suppressed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in ILPS-stimulated Caco- cells. Our findings indicate that PF has an inhibitory effect on endothelial injury. Our findings suggested that PF has an anti-inflammatory effect in ILPS-stimulated Caco- cells, which might be a potential therapeutic agent against  and intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586631>Interactions between rat submucosal neurons and mast cells are modified by cytokines and neurotransmitters.</a></h2><p>The role of mast cells during inflammatory bowel diseases () is discussed controversially. Whereas several studies report an increase in mast cell density during , others found a decrease. Recently, we observed a reduced response to mast cell degranulation induced by antigen contact in a colitis model. As the effects of mast cell mediators on epithelial ion transport are mediated indirectly via stimulation of secretomotor neurons, we investigated in vitro whether proinflammatory cytokines change the response to mast cell degranulation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and a mix of proinflammatory cytokines caused an increase of short-circuit current (I) and tissue conductance in rat colon. Anion secretion induced by histamine was downregulated in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the cytokine mix, whereas the response to the mast cell stimulator compound 48/80 was not changed significantly. In a coculture of rat submucosal ganglionic cells with a mast cell line (RBL-2H3), TNFα preincubation for 1 d increased the percentage of neurons responding to mast cell degranulation with an increase of the cytosolic Ca concentration and enhanced the amplitude of this response. Consequently, the downregulation of epithelial secretion is compensated by an increased sensitivity of secretomotor neurons leading to a constant response of the epithelium to compound 48/80. Furthermore, enteric neurons can modify mast cell functions as nicotine inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca concentration of RBL-2H3 cells and the I evoked by compound 48/80. Consequently, these in vitro models deliver new insights into cellular interactions in the gut wall under inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In many cases, the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is straightforward, especially when patients have a typical presentation and characteristic histopathological features. Knowledge of the full clinical history is very important, particularly past and recent medical history, drug history, foreign travel, or known contact with individuals with specific infection. Discussion of all cases of suspected  within a multidisciplinary team meeting is required to ensure that clinical, radiological, and pathological features can be correlated. Mimics of  can be divided into 4 categories: 1) those due to specific infection, ) those due to a specific localized inflammatory process, 3) those due to iatrogenic causes, and 4) other rarer causes. Accurate diagnosis of  and exclusion of these mimics are crucial for patient management. Once a diagnosis of  has been proffered by a pathologist, it is very difficult to "undiagnose" the condition when an alternative diagnosis or "mimic" has been subsequently identified. The histological diagnosis of each of these  mimics is discussed in detail, with guidance on how to avoid the pitfall of missing these sometimes very subtle and "difficult to diagnose" conditions.© 2019 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

Although conventional therapeutic strategies have demonstrated to be effective in the  treatment, it is necessary to incorporate novel therapeutic agents that target other mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as oxidative stress. For this reason, the efficacy in vivo of two antioxidant compounds, melatonin and resveratrol, has been investigated in an animal model of TNBS (, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) induced colitis. PET/CT (Positron emission tomography/Computer Tomography) scans were performed to assess disease activity and evaluate treatment response. SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) values, body weight changes and histological evaluation were used as inflammatory indices to measure the efficacy of both treatments. SUV values increased rapidly after induction of colitis, but after the beginning of the treatment (day 3) a statistically significant decrease was observed on days 7 and 10 in treated animals compared to the non-treated group. This remission of the disease was also confirmed by histological analysis of the colon tissue using the Nancy histological index (p value < 0.05 for differences between non-treated and both groups of treated animals). Moreover, statistical analysis showed a correlation (R = 65.52%) between SUV values and weight changes throughout the treatment. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of resveratrol, and melatonin in lower extent, as therapeutic agents in the  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to ascertain safety and efficacy of excisional hemorrhoidectomy in CD.A retrospective review of all adult CD patients undergoing excisional hemorrhoidectomy between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2019, at   referral centers was performed. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics of CD (anorectal symptoms; prior nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy; presence of other perianal disease; and activity, duration, and anatomic location of CD), and postoperative complications including bleeding, wound healing, and need for further therapy or surgical intervention after surgery.A total of 36 adult patients with Crohn's disease with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease were included. The study cohort included 16 males (44%), and median age was 49 (range, 21 to 77) years. Predominant symptoms included pain (n = 16; 44%), prolapse (n = 8; 22%), and bleeding (n = 12; 33%). Sixteen patients (44%) had nonoperative therapy before surgery. Twenty-four patients (67%) had other perianal disease. At the time of hemorrhoidectomy, 9 patients (25%) were exposed to corticosteroids, 8 patients (25%) to immunomodulators, and 9 patients (25%) to biologics. During a median follow-up time of 31.5 (range, 1 to 255) months after hemorrhoidectomy, 4 patients (11%) had complications (1 developed a stricture, 1 developed a perianal abscess/fistula, 1 had a nonhealing wound, and 1 had hemorrhoidal recurrence).Our data suggest that excisional hemorrhoidectomy may be performed safely in CD patients who have failed nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy without concern for de novo perianal disease or need for proctectomy.Hemorrhoidal disease is common in patients with Crohn's disease.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the percentage of sarcopenia in  patients, characterizing methods for assessment and clinical symptoms associated to it. () Methods: Consecutive  patients accessing the Fondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) were enrolled. Healthy patients, elderly or elderly sarcopenic patients, were enrolled as controls. Skeletal muscle mass was evaluated by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Bio-Impedensometric Analysis (BIA). Asthenia degree was assessed by subjective visual analogue scales (VAS). Quality of life was measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire. (3) Results: Patients with  showed a significant reduction in skeletal muscle mass than healthy controls with lower DEXA and BIA parameters. Moreover,  patients presented a lower perception of muscle strength with a higher incidence of asthenia and reduction in quality of life when compared with healthy controls.

Asymptomatic patients with a Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) symptom sub-score of zero who underwent an index surveillance pouchoscopy were included. Endoscopic pouch body activity was graded as 0: normal, 1: mucosal inflammation, or : mucosal breaks (ulcers and/or erosions). The primary outcome was primary acute idiopathic pouchitis defined as PDAI score ≥ 7 with symptoms lasting less than four weeks and responsive to standard antibiotics, not otherwise meeting criteria for secondary pouchitis. The secondary outcome was chronic idiopathic pouchitis defined as PDAI score ≥ 7 with symptoms lasting greater than four weeks despite standard antibiotics. Predictors of pouchitis were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported.143 asymptomatic pouch patients were included. Index endoscopic pouch body activity was 0 in 86 (60.1%) patients, 1 in 26 (18.%) and  in 31 (21.7%). The median length of follow-up after index surveillance pouchoscopy was 3.03 [IQR 1.24-4.60] years.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in  patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

FC, CRP and clinical indices were evaluated in 123 (76 CD, 47 UC) patients before infliximab induction and after 12 weeks. Responders were monitored 48 weeks for an 'incident' (dosage increase, shortened dosage interval, surgery). Cutoff values for FC and CRP were obtained using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC). Disease progression was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survivals, log-rank test and logistic regression for combined biomarkers. Cytokines were analyzed with Luminex multiplexing system.  Following infliximab, FC and CRP declined ( < .0001) along with HBi for CD and pMCS for UC. Simultaneously, IL-6 and TNF-α decreased, while IL-10 increased. Optimal FC ROC cutoff was 221 µg/g (sensitivity 66%, specificity 67%, AUC 0.71) and CRP ROC cutoff .1 mg/L (sensitivity 54%, specificity 60%, AUC 0.58). In CD, FC > 221 µg/g ( < .0001), but not CRP > .1 mg/L predicted an 'incident'. However, combined FC and CRP also predicted an 'incident' ( < .042).

The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire was adopted to evaluate patients' quality of life.  From January to November 2016, 37 consecutive  patients (30 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative colitis) and 20 controls were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients had a history of perianal fistula, 9 reported fecal incontinence, and  had anal fissure. Fecal incontinent patients were older, had a longer disease duration, and higher bowel movement number than continent patients. Endoanal ultrasound findings were normal in all volunteers, while pathological features were found in 31/37 patients. Rectal sensory testing and anal pressure did not differ between the  patients and controls. However, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was normally elicited in all controls vs. 32/37 (86%)  patients; 25/37 (68%)  patients showed manometric features of dyssynergic defecation.

The combination of high-resolution and multiple solved structures of FtsY in different states revealed a new sensor-relay system of this unique GTPase receptor. A nucleotide sensing function of the P-loop assists FtsY in nucleotide-binding and contributes to modulate nucleotide binding properties in SRP GTPases. A reorganization of the other G-loops and the insertion binding domain () is observed only upon transition from a diphosphate to a triphosphate nucleotide. The role of a magnesium ion during the GDP and GTP-bound states has also been observed. The binding of magnesium in the nucleotide site causes the reorientation of the β- and γ- phosphate groups toward the jaws of the P-loop and stabilizes the binding of the nucleotide, creating a network of hydrogen and water-bridge interactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Presently there is no cure, and many  treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved inflammatory changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild  rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe  induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given % DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro-inflammatory factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti-inflammatory treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614204>Polysaccharides derived from Morinda citrifolia Linn reduce inflammatory markers during experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>There are many reports of pharmacological activities of extracts and fractions of different vegetable-derived products in the scientific literature and in folk medicine. Ethnopharmacological use of these products by various communities continues to be extensively explored, and they account for more than half of all medications used worldwide. Polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from plants such as Morinda Citrifolia Linn present therapeutic potential in treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases () such as ulcerative colitis (UC).To evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of Noni PLS against the intestinal damage in UC induced by acetic acid in mice.In acetic acid-induced colitis, the mice were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with PLS (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (sc) with dexamethasone (.0 mg/kg) 30 min before euthanasia to determine the best dose of PLS with an anti-inflammatory effect in the course of UC. The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and COX- expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti-inflammatory action against intestinal damage by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory action of cytokines, and COX- expression in the inflamed colon. PLS shows therapeutic potential against inflammatory disorders like UC.Copyright © 2019.

Interestingly, XLP- patients display high levels of IL-18 in the serum even while in stable condition, presumably through spontaneous inflammasome activation. Recent data suggests that LPS stimulation can trigger inflammasome activation through a TNFR2/TNF/TNFR1 mediated loop in xiap macrophages. Yet, the direct role TNFR2-specific activation plays in the absence of XIAP is unknown. We found TNFR2-specific activation leads to cell death in xiap myeloid cells, particularly in the absence of the RING domain. RIPK1 kinase activity downstream of TNFR2 resulted in a TNF/TNFR1 cell death, independent of necroptosis. TNFR2-specific activation leads to a similar inflammatory NF-kB driven transcriptional profile as TNFR1 activation with the exception of upregulation of NLRP3 and caspase-11. Activation and upregulation of the canonical inflammasome upon loss of XIAP was mediated by RIPK1 kinase activity and ROS production. While both the inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity and ROS production reduced cell death, as well as release of IL-1β, the release of IL-18 was not reduced to basal levels. This study supports targeting TNFR2 specifically to reduce IL-18 release in XLP- patients and to reduce priming of the inflammasome components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489956>Analysis of Oxidative Stress-Related Markers in Crohn's Disease Patients at Surgery and Correlations with Clinical Findings.</a></h2><p>Crohn' disease (CD) patients are at high risk of postoperative recurrence and new tools for the assessment of disease activity are needed to prevent long-term complications. In these patients, the over-production of ROS generated by inflamed bowel tissue and inflammatory cells activates a pathogenic cascade that further exacerbates inflammation and leads to increased oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. We measured the products of protein/lipid oxidation and the total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma, FRAP) in the serum of CD patients with severe disease activity requiring surgery with the aim to characterize their redox status and identify associations between oxidative stress-related markers and their clinical characteristics. At the systemic level, CD was associated with increased levels of protein and lipid oxidation products when compared to healthy volunteers, even though the FRAP values were similar. Advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels showed the highest difference between patients and the controls (11.25, 5.02-15.15, vs. 1.36, 0.75-.70, median, interquartile range;  < 0.0001) and the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicated for AOPP, the best area under the curve (AUC) value for CD prediction. Advanced glycated end-products (AGEs) were also significantly higher in CD patients ( < 0.01), which is of interest since AOPP and AGEs are both able to activate the membrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) involved in inflammatory diseases. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly higher in CD patients with ileal localization and aggressive disease behavior, in smokers, and in patients suffering from allergies. In conclusion, our data indicate that circulating oxidative stress biomarkers may be attractive candidates as disease predictors as well as for clinical or therapeutic monitoring of CD. Our results also suggest that AOPP/AGEs and RAGE signaling may represent a pathogenic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594293>Drug allergy is associated with the development of extraintestinal manifestations in patients with ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Drug allergies are developed by antibody or cell-mediated reactions as immunologic mechanisms.

Higher ADL trough concentrations are associated with improved clinical and endoscopic outcomes. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of ADL might be facilitated by using dried blood samples (DBS) from capillary blood obtained at home. The study aimed to compare serum ADL concentrations obtained via venipuncture to ADL concentrations in DBS.Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis receiving induction or maintenance ADL therapy were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Blood was obtained via venipuncture and via DBS during a regular outpatient visit (time point 1). Just before the next ADL administration, patients performed DBS at home (time point ). For this time point, serum ADL concentrations were estimated by Bayesian analysis.Thirty-three patients with  were enrolled. During the outpatient visit, samples were obtained after a median [interquartile range] of 6 [4-10] days after the last ADL dose. A high correlation was found between DBS and venipuncture results (Pearson's correlation: ≥ 0.96), without any clinically relevant bias. For DBS performed by patients at home, initial comparison showed a moderate correlation between DBS results and predicted ADL serum concentrations (Pearson's correlation: 0.51), although no bias was present. In addition, DBS eluate results compared to predicted ADL serum concentrations showed a mean absolute percentage error (i.e., accuracy) of 45%.High correlations were found between ADL serum concentrations obtained via conventional venipuncture and DBS, which indicates that this home-based test can facilitate TDM-based ADL dose adjustments in daily practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515764>Clinical profile and outcome of primary sclerosing cholangitis: A single-centre experience from western India.</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic progressive cholestatic liver disease of unknown cause, is uncommon in India. The aim of this study was to define the profile and outcomes of patients with PSC in a tertiary centre from western India.A retrospective study of the prospectively maintained liver clinic database was searched for cases of PSC between January 2008 and December 2017 with minimum 6 months follow up. All cases were reviewed for clinical profile, inflammatory bowel disease () co-morbidity and major endpoints like death, cholangiocarcinoma and liver transplantation (LT).We identified 28 (18 men) patients with PSC (19, 67% large-duct and 9, 33% small-duct) with a median age of 31.5 years (range 7-63 years) with median duration of follow up of 24 months (6-125 months). Six (21.4%) had autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-PSC) overlap. Inflammatory bowel disease was seen in 12 (43%) cases, all were ulcerative colitis (UC). During follow up, seven patients (25%) developed dominant stricture or recurrent cholangitis, 11 (39%) had  portal hypertension,  (7%) developed cholangiocarcinoma and 5 (17.8%) progressed to hepatic  decompensation on follow up. Ten (35%) patients died, 5 from liver-related complications,  from cholangiocarcinoma, 1 each from brain hemorrhage and systemic sepsis and 1 due to unknown cause; 3 underwent liver transplantation.

Nevertheless, the optimal VTE prevention strategy for women with  in pregnancy and postpartum period has not been established yet. We assessed VTE risks during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with  through systematic review and meta-analysis.Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL (Ovid), and Web of Science (Tomson Reuters) from the database inception till May 2017 to identify relevant studies reporting the risk of VTE during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period in women with .

However, studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects result from local immunomodulation in the inflamed regions. Furthermore, topical inhibition of TNF in  ameliorates inflammation. We therefore hypothesized that orally administered IFX targeted to the ileo-colonic region in  may be an efficacious new treatment option. This study describes the development and validation of the production process of ileo-colonic-targeted 5 mg IFX tablets (ColoPulse-IFX) intended for the oral treatment of  by means of producing three consecutive validation batches (VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3, respectively). UV-VIS spectroscopy, HPLC-SEC analysis (content, fragments, aggregates), fluorescence spectroscopy (tertiary protein structure), and ELISA (potency) showed no noticeable deviations of IFX compounded to ColoPulse-IFX compared to fresh IFX stock. The average ± SD ( = 10) IFX content of VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3 was 96 ± %, 97 ± 3%, and 96 ± %, respectively, and complied with the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements for Content Uniformity. The average ± SD ( = 3) ColoPulse-IFX potency was 105 ± 4%, 96 ± 4%, and 97 ± 5%, respectively, compared to fresh IFX stock. The IFX release profile from the tablet core was complete (≥85%) after 10 min in simulated ileum medium. The in vitro coating performance of ColoPulse-IFX showed that the formulation was targeted to the simulated ileo-colonic region. Stability data showed that ColoPulse-IFX was stable for up to 6 months stored at 25 °C/60% RH. Based on these results, the production process can be considered validated and its application is discussed in light of the rationale and available evidence for the topical treatment of  with IFX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450614> Gene Variants Are Predictive of Osteoporosis in Female Patients with Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Decreased bone mass in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases () is a clinical problem with extremely severe consequences of osteoporotic fractures. Despite its increasing prevalence and the need for mandatory intervention and monitoring, it is often ignored in  patients' care. Determining the biomarkers of susceptibility to bone mineral density disorder in  patients appears to be indispensable. We aim to investigate the impact of estrogen receptor gene () gene polymorphisms on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), as they may contribute both, to osteoporosis and inflammatory processes. We characterised 197 patients with  (97 with UC, 100 with CD), and 41 controls carrying out vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus serum levels, and bone mineral density assessment at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA),  genotyping and haplotype analysis. We observed that women with CD showed the lowest bone density parameters, which corresponded to the  c.454-397T and c.454-351A allele dose. The  gene PvuII and XbaI TA (px) haplotype correlated with decreased femoral neck T-score (OR = .75, CI = [1.21-6.27], -value = 0.016) and may be predictive of osteoporosis in female patients with CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630164>Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of early compared to late or no biologic treatment to manage Crohn's disease using real world data.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early (≤ years after diagnosis) compared to late or no biologic initiation (starting biologics > years after diagnosis or no biologic use) for adults with Crohn's disease in Switzerland.We developed a Markov cohort model over the patient's lifetime from the health system and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early (intervention) and late/no (comparator) biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is reported in Swiss francs (CHF). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed.Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention (CHF384,607; 16.84 QALYs) compared to comparator (CHF340,800; 16.75 QALYs) strategy, resulting in high ICERs (health system: CHF887,450 per QALY; societal: CHF449,130 per QALY). Assuming a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention strategy had a 0.1 and 0.25 probability of being cost-effective from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices (health system: CHF134,502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant).Early biologic use was not cost-effective considering a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY compared to late/no biologic use. However, early identification of patients likely to need biologics and future drug price reductions through increased availability of biosimilars may improve the cost-effectiveness of an early treatment approach.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

The predominant view is that association between 17q12-q21 alleles and increased risk of developing asthma or  is due to regulatory variants. ORM sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising gene candidate for explaining association with disease. However, the relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and disease is complex suggesting contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of several common chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their role in the regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of zona pellucida binding protein  (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin B (GSDMB), and ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first evidence that disease-associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock gene Nr1d1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559354>A series of seton techniques involving "top-down therapy" for patients with Crohn's disease who initially presented with perianal fistulas.</a></h2><p>We determined the outcomes of seton treatment through a series of techniques using biological agents (BIOs) in 18 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who initially presented with perianal fistulas.The patients underwent seton drainage using three seton types: a Penrose tube for fistulas with massive purulent discharge, a vessel loop for a small amount of discharge, and a rubber band for unproductive fistulas. If the distal end of the fistula extended more than 4 cm from the anal orifice, the skin and subcutaneous tissue were dissected along the outer edge of the anal sphincter to divide the fistulous tract into two portions. One seton encircled the sphincter from the primary opening throughout the anal canal (medial seton), and the other was inserted through the distal tract outside the sphincter (lateral seton). A BIO was then introduced immediately. When discharge ceased, the Penrose tube or vessel loop was replaced sequentially with a rubber band, which was tied fittingly and subsequently removed in medial to lateral order.The mean interval between fistula onset and CD diagnosis was .1 years, and that between CD diagnosis and introduction of BIOs was 0.5 years.

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect disease-specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in .A collaborative of 13 high-volume  surgery centers was convened to collect 5 -specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The  most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All 5 novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first disease-specific collaborative within NSQIP.

Women of children aged 1-5 years were approached to fill in a 43-item validated TNO-AZL Preschool Children Quality of Life questionnaire (TAPQOL) to assess HRQoL (Fekkes et al., 2000; Bunge et al., 2005 [1,]). Outcomes were compared to children of mothers without .One-hundred-eighty-two women completed the TAPQOL questionnaire. In total 182 children of mothers with  were included [median age 3.0 years (IQR -4)]. From 70 healthy mothers, 70 children were included as controls. There was no significant difference in the HRQoL between children who were and were not born to mothers with  (P = .18). Also, no effect of the different  related factors was found.In this study, we found no effect of having  during pregnancy on the health-related quality of life of children in the first 5 years of life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Data were collected for 3 years following diagnosis.A total of 631 patients (late-onset 153, adult-onset 161, young adult-onset 317) were included. Colonic disease was more frequent in late-onset (P < 0005), stenosing behaviour was more frequent than in adult-onset (P < 0003), but fistulising disease was uncommon. Surgery rates were not different between the three age groups. Systemic steroids were prescribed more frequently in young adult-onset in the first year, but low bioavailability steroids were used more frequently in late-onset in the first  years after diagnosis (P < 0.036, P < 0.041, respectively). The use of immunomodulators and anti-TNF's even in patients with more complicated disease, that is, B2 or B3 behaviour (Montreal classification), remained significantly inferior (P < 0.0001) in late-onset compared to young adult-onset. Age at diagnosis, Charlson comorbidity index, and steroid used in the first year were negatively associated with the use of immunomodulators and biologics. Comorbidities, related medications and hospitalizations were more frequent in late-onset. Polypharmacy was present in 56% of elderly Crohn's disease patients.Thirty-two percent of late-onset Crohn's disease presented with complicated disease behaviour. Despite a comparable use of steroids and surgery, immunomodulators and biologics were used in a small number of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain Fatty Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (), but the results are conflicting.

However, significant challenges still exist in Latin America to facilitate the access of biological agents for physicians and patients.The aim of this review was to summarize current evidence on penetration of biological agents for CD and UC in Latin America.Data are derived from a previous complete systematic review that explored different characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases () in Latin America. The studies fully included in this previous systematic review which contained detailed descriptions of the percentage of use of biological agents in different cohorts throughout Latin American and Caribbean countries were included, and descriptive findings were compiled, describing CD and UC penetration of these drugs in different patient cohorts from different countries.From the 61 studies included in the original systematic review, only 19 included data of the percentage of patients treated with biological agents. Anti-TNF use in CD varied from 1.51% in Mexico up to 46.9% in Colombia, with most of the studies describing anti-TNF use in approximately 20%-40% of CD patients. On the other side, the frequency of the use of biologics was clearly lower in UC, varying from 0% in 2009 to up 16.% in 2018, according to two different Mexican studies. Only two studies described the penetration of anti-TNF agents in  overall: 13.4% in a Colombian and 37.93% in a Brazilian study. No studies described percentage of use of new biologic agents (vedolizumab and ustekinumab).Penetration of anti-TNF agents in Latin America is comparable to the rest of the world in CD, but lower in UC.

The PROMs included the following: self-efficacy (the  Self-Efficacy Scale-Adolescents), resilience (the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), response to stress (the Child Self-Report Responses to Stress-), and self-management and health care transition skills (the Self-Management and Transition to Adulthood with Treatment questionnaire). Starting at age 14, the patient will be offered a 1-hour annual transition consultation with an -specialized nurse. The consultation will be based on the results of the PROMs and will focus on the patient's difficulties. Patients will complete the PROMs on the eHealth program at home, allowing nurses and patients to prepare for the meeting. Symptom scores and medication will be filled out on the eHealth program to support disease self-management. The consultation will be a topic-centered dialogue with practical exercises. During routine outpatient visits with the provider, parents will be left out of half of the consultation when the patient is 16 years old; at 17 years old, the parents will not be present. At the transfer consultation, the pediatric provider, the adult gastroenterologist, the pediatric nurse, the patient, and the parents will be present to ensure a proper transfer.We have conducted a personalized eHealth transition concept consisting of basic elements that measure, train, and monitor the patients' transition readiness.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco- cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor  (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco- cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco- cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627144>Does symptom activity explain psychological differences in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease?

Understanding these geographical differences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating . We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of  in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to  using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR .1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of  globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79·5 (75·9-83·5) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·-89·9) per 100 000 population in 2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 [6·3-7·] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464·5 [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·] per 100 000 population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 population). The total YLDs attributed to  almost doubled over the study period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 2017.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of the pain associated with the subcutaneous administration of adalimumab in patients with  treated with the old formulation and the new low-volume/citrate-free formulation.A specifically-designed questionnaire was completed by 76 patients with , who started treatment with adalimumab before the availability of the low-volume/citrate-free formulation and were switched to this new formulation. Intensity of pain was measured by using visual analog scales (VAS).A total of 62 patients (82%) experienced injection-related pain with the initial formulation. The perception of pain was associated with a decreased adherence to the treatment (37%), an increase in pre-administration anxiety (25%) or, as a consequence, the patient required someone else to carry out the injection (21%). Younger age was the only factor associated with pain perception. After switching to the new formulation, perception of pain persisted only in  patients (3%). Among those who felt pain with the initial formulation, pre-administration anxiety disappeared in 44%; 32% and 42% stated that the new formulation eased adherence and self-administration.The perception of pain related to the subcutaneous administration of therapy negatively impacts on treatment adherence in  patients.

We performed random-effects model meta-analysis to obtain the pooled risk estimates for Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients with rosacea.We included three case-control and three cohort studies. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The meta-analysis on case-control studies showed marginally increased odds of CD (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.69) and a significantly increased odds of UC (pooled OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.43-1.89) in patients with rosacea. The meta-analysis on cohort studies demonstrated significant increased risk of CD (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% CI 1.14-.20) and UC (pooled HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37) in patients with rosacea.The evidence indicates an association of rosacea with . If patients with rosacea suffer from prolonged abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool, referral to gastroenterologists may be considered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota. Multiple clinical and animal data have shown that  is associated with a healthy mucosa. However, its precise role in colitis is currently unknown. Our study aimed to determine its protective effects and underlying mechanisms in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were administered  Muc or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once daily by oral gavage for 14 days. Colitis was induced by drinking % DSS from days 0 to 6, followed by  days of drinking normal water. Mice were weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that  improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology scores and enhanced barrier function. Serum and tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL1α, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF, and KC) decreased as a result of  administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences showed that  induced significant gut microbiota alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines and other injury factors were negatively associated with , , and , which were prominently abundant in -treated mice. We confirmed that  treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut barrier function and reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, or by improving the microbial community. Our findings suggest that  may be a potential probiotic agent for ameliorating colitis.Copyright © 2019 Bian, Wu, Yang, Lv, Wang, Li, Ye, Fang, Wu, Jiang, Shi and Li.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621721>Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei A.

Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with . Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice. Further studies are needed before suggesting the use of xique-xique juice as a new alternative for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504531>The Association of Medications and Vaccination with Risk of Pneumonia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease () are at increased risk for pneumonia, and corticosteroids are reported to amplify this risk. Less is known about the impact of corticosteroid-sparing  therapies on pneumonia risk or the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in reducing all-cause pneumonia in real-world  cohorts.We performed a population-based study using an established Veterans Health Administration cohort of 29,957  patients. We identified all patients who developed bacterial pneumonia. Cox survival analysis was used to determine the association of corticosteroids at study entry and as a time-varying covariate, corticosteroid-sparing agents (immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis-alpha [TNF] inhibitors), and pneumococcal vaccination with the development of all-cause pneumonia.Patients with  who received corticosteroids had a greater risk of pneumonia when controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] .21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-.57 for prior use; HR = 3.42; 95% CI, .92-4.01 for use during follow-up). Anti-TNF inhibitors (HR 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-.26), but not immunomodulators (HR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.07), were associated with a small increase in pneumonia. A history of pneumonia was strongly associated with subsequent pneumonia (HR = 4.41; 95% CI, 3.70-5.27). Less than 15% of patients were vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this was not associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80-1.30) in this cohort.In a large US cohort, corticosteroids were confirmed to increase pneumonia risk. Tumor necrosis-alpha inhibitors were associated with a smaller increase in the risk of pneumonia. Surprisingly, pneumococcal vaccination did not reduce all-cause pneumonia in this population, though few patients were vaccinated.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248  biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39./38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.5%). VDZ was associated with later non-persistence in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.675; p = 0.003) compared to anti-TNFα.Only 60-70% of  -patients are still persistent with their biologic therapy after 12 months.

Mice with  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents -like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced -like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented -like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC and inadequate response to existing treatment.This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial was conducted at 17 centers in Japan between April 2012 and September 2014. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC received a treatment protocol comprising 5 mg/kg IFX at Weeks 0, , and 6, and Clinical Activity Index (CAI)-based responders at Week 8 also received treatment at 8-week intervals at Weeks 14 and 22, with a final evaluation at Week 30.A total of 21 patients were treated in this study. IFX therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms, and this effect was maintained for up to 30 weeks. Overall CAI-based remission rate was 42.9% and overall Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)-based remission rate was 19.0%. Median partial Mayo score was 6.0 at baseline and 4.0 at Week 30 (overall). Among the eight patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy, Mayo response was achieved at Week 30 (overall) in three patients (37.5%). Trough serum IFX concentrations in Week 8 CAI-based responders were maintained throughout the study period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were observed in 95. and 14.3% of patients, respectively.These results support the use of IFX in the treatment of pediatric patients with UC with inadequate response to existing treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number:  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504518>Sexual Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multicenter, National-Level Study.</a></h2><p>The impact of inflammatory bowel disease () on sexual health is a leading concern among patients. Most studies focus on sexual dysfunction rather than patient-perceived sexual quality of life (SQoL). We aimed to assess SQoL in  patients compared with healthy controls.This is a multicenter, cross-sectional study of  patients (n = 575 with Crohn's disease and n = 294 with ulcerative colitis), compared with healthy controls (n = 398), that used an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. This multimodal questionnaire included sociodemographic data and 4 validated instruments: Short  Questionnaire, Social Desirability Scale, Sexual QoL Questionnaire-Male/Female, Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire.Inflammatory bowel disease patients reported lower SQoL (men: 77.29 vs 83.83; P < 0.001; women: 70.40 vs 81.63; P < 0.001) compared with controls. Among  patients, SQoL was positively correlated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and negatively correlated with depression symptoms. Perianal disease was associated with lower HRQoL and higher incidence of depression, but only impacted SQoL in men. In linear regression analysis for men, SQoL was associated with age, marital status, and depression (β, -.101; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.505 to -1.696; P < 0.001). In women, SQoL was associated with depression (β, -1.973; 95% CI, -.313 to -1.632; P < 0.001) only.Patients with  had impaired SQoL compared with healthy controls. Age, widow status, and depression were independent predictors of SQoL in men with , whereas in women depression was the only independent predictor. Emotional and self-esteem issues were the main concerns reported by  patients regarding sexual health.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent .We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at  large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1., P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent , we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation.

Children who received conventional therapy (including 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176  patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up.
