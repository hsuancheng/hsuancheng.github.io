However, a range of fecal inflammatory markers now appears to have the potential to greatly assist in these processes. Calprotectin, a prominent neutrophil protein, was identified two decades ago as a potentially revolutionary marker for IBD. Following this discovery, numerous additional markers, including S100A12, lactoferrin, and -pyruvate kinase, have also been suggested as novel markers of IBD. In the present study, we provide an up-to-date review of fecal markers of IBD, and further, provide a novel analysis of each of these fecal markers in severe ulcerative  and compare their expression pattern in contrast to calprotectin.© 2011 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16478631>Triapine and cytarabine is an active combination in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Triapine, an iron chelator and a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, has significant anti-leukemia activity. A phase I study of Triapine in combination with ara-C was conducted in 32 patients with refractory acute leukemia and high-risk MDS. Triapine (105 mg//day 6-h infusion) was followed immediately by ara-C [100 (n=4), 200 (n=6), 400 (n=7), or 800 (n=8)mg//day] as an 18-h infusion for 5 consecutive days. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 800 mg/ ara-C dose level (one patient each with grade 4 mucositis; grade 4 neutropenic , sepsis; grade 4 neuropathy; and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia). Therefore, the study was amended to include an ara-C dose level of 600 mg//day, no DLTs occurred in seven patients treated at this dose level. Mean Triapine C(max) and AUC were 1.13 microg/mL and 251.5 minmicrog/mL. Of 31 evaluable patients, 4 (13%) (3 AML, 1 Ph+ALL) achieved a CR (1 at a dose of 800 mg/; 2 at 600 mg/; 1 at 200mg/).

In this study, we aimed to determine the role of GPBAR1 in mediating leukocyte trafficking in chemically induced models of  and investigate the therapeutic potential of BAR501, a small molecule agonist for GPBAR1. These studies demonstrated that GPBAR1 gene ablation enhanced the recruitment of classically activated macrophages in the colonic lamina propria and worsened the severity of inflammation. In contrast, GPBAR1 activation by BAR501 reversed intestinal inflammation in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and oxazolone models by reducing the trafficking of Ly6C monocytes from blood to intestinal mucosa. Exposure to BAR501 shifted intestinal macrophages from a classically activated (CD11b, CCR7, F4/80) to an alternatively activated (CD11b, CCR7, F4/80) phenotype, reduced the expression of inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCL2 mRNAs), and attenuated the wasting syndrome and severity of  (≈70% reduction in the  Disease Activity Index). The protective effect was lost in Gpbar1 mice. Exposure to BAR501 increased the colonic expression of IL-10 and TGF-β mRNAs and the percentage of CD4/Foxp3 cells. The beneficial effects of BAR501 were lost in Il-10 mice. In a macrophage cell line, regulation of IL-10 by BAR501 was GPBAR1 dependent and was mediated by the recruitment of CREB to its responsive element in the IL-10 promoter. In conclusion, GPBAR1 is expressed in circulating monocytes and colonic macrophages, and its activation promotes a IL-10-dependent shift toward an alternatively activated phenotype. The targeting of GPBAR1 may offer therapeutic options in inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29272479>Surrogate Fecal Biomarkers in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Rivals or Complementary Tools of Fecal Calprotectin?</a></h2><p>Current noninvasive methods for assessing intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unsatisfactory. Along with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin (FC) is the standard test for assessing IBD activity, even though its specificity and accuracy are not optimal and it lacks a validated cutoff. Over the past few decades, several fecal markers released from intestinal inflammatory cells have been investigated in IBD; they are the subject of this systematic review.A systematic electronic search of the English literature up to April 2017 was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English that analyzed fecal biomarkers in IBD were included. In vitro studies, animal studies, studies on blood/serum samples, and studies analyzing FC or fecal lactoferrin alone were excluded.Out of 1023 citations, 125 eligible studies were identified. Data were grouped according to each fecal marker including S100A12, high-mobility group box 1, neopterin, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, fecal hemoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, human neutrophil peptides, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, lysozyme, -pyruvate kinase, myeloperoxidase, fecal eosinophil proteins, human beta-defensin-2, and beta-glucuronidase. Some of these markers showed a high sensitivity and specificity and correlated with disease activity, response to therapy, and mucosal healing. Furthermore, they showed a potential utility in the prediction of clinical relapse.Several fecal biomarkers have the potential to become useful tools complementing FC in IBD diagnosis and monitoring. However, wide variability in their accuracy in assessment of intestinal inflammation suggests the need for further studies.© 2017 Crohn’s &  Foundation of America.

They may be due to inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease, ulcerative  and indeterminate ), malignancy (colorectal cancer), infectious  or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Differentiation between these involves the use of clinical, radiological, endoscopic and serological techniques, which are invasive or involve exposure to radiation. Serological markers include C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antibodies (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody). Faecal markers that can aid in distinguishing inflammatory disorders from non-inflammatory conditions are non-invasive and generally acceptable to the patient. As IBS accounts for up to 50% of cases presenting to the GI clinic and is a diagnosis of exclusion (Rome III criteria), any test that can reliably distinguish IBS from organic disease could speed diagnosis and reduce endoscopy waiting times. Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, -PK and S100A12 will be reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519790>Oxytocin system alleviates intestinal inflammation by regulating macrophages polarization in experimental .</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammation, but the accurate etiology remains to be elucidated. Increasing evidence has shown that macrophages polarize to different phenotypes depending on the intestinal microenvironment and are associated with the progression of IBD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin, a neuroendocrinal, and pro-health peptide, on the modulation of macrophages polarization and the progression of experimental . Our data demonstrated that oxytocin decreased the sensitivity of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but increased the sensitivity to IL-4 stimulation with enhanced expression of -type genes, arginase I (Arg1), CD206, and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3). This bidirectional modulation was partly due to the up-regulation of β-arrestin2 and resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and reinforcement of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 phosphorylation. Moreover, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) myeloid deficiency mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intervention compared with the wild mice. For the first time, we reveal that oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system participates in modulating the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates experimental .

While non-restorative abdomino-endoscopic perineal excision of the anorectum is conceptually similar, it has been less detailed in the literature.Consecutive patients undergoing non-restorative ano-proctectomy including a transperineal endoscopic component were analysed. All cases commenced laparoscopically with initial medial to lateral mobilisation of any left colon and upper rectum. The lower anorectal dissection started via an intersphincteric or extrasphincteric incision for benign and malignant pathology, respectively, and following suture closure and circumferential mobilisation of the anorectum, a single port (GelPOINT Path, Applied Medical) was positioned allowing the procedure progress endoscopically in all quadrants up to the cephalad dissection level. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation was used. Specimens were removed perineally.Of the 13 patients (median age 55 years, median BMI 28.75 kg/, median follow-up 17 months, 6 males), ten needed completion proctectomy for ulcerative  following prior total colectomy (three with concomitant parastomal hernia repair) while three required abdominoperineal resection for locally advanced rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Median operative time was 190 min, median post-operative discharge day was 7. Eleven specimens were of high quality. Four patients developed perineal wound complications (one chronic sinus, two abscesses needing drainage) within median 17-month follow-up.Convergence of transabdominal and transanal technology and technique allows accuracy in combination operative performance. Nuanced appreciation of transperineal operative access should allow specified standardisation and innovation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434400>Dynamic changes and functions of macrophages and M1/ subpopulations during ulcerative -associated carcinogenesis in an AOM/DSS mouse model.</a></h2><p>The high risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), from ulcerative  (UC), is well known. Macrophages are widely distributed immune cells that have an indispensable role in UC, as well as in CRC. However, little is currently known about the dynamic changes that occur in macrophage and M1/ macrophage subpopulations, during UC‑associated carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the alteration of colorectal macrophages and M1/ macrophage subpopulations during UC‑associated carcinogenesis. Both expression level alterations and functional changes were determined during UC‑associated carcinogenesis in an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate‑induced chemically ‑associated carcinoma mouse model of Crj:CD‑1 (ICR) mice. Notable evidence from immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytokine detection, and gene expression analyses demonstrated that  macrophages have a critical role in CRC initiation, promotion, and metastasis.  macrophages are associated with unbalanced pro‑inflammatory and anti‑inflammatory axes and aberrant enhancement of migration/invasion‑associated factors. Functional changes, similar to  polarized macrophages, were shown to occur in the M1 macrophages, without phenotypical changes, during the development of carcinoma and metastasis. The results of the present study suggest that  macrophages have a pro‑tumor role during UC‑associated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, similar functional changes occurred in the M1 macrophages, without polarization alterations, during carcinogenesis and metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30990953>Prediction of steroid demand in the treatment of patients with ulcerative  by immunohistochemical analysis of the mucosal microenvironment and immune checkpoint: role of macrophages and regulatory markers in disease severity.</a></h2><p>We aimed to characterize the mucosal immune microenvironment and immune checkpoint of Ulcerative  (UC) by immunohistochemistry with correlation to prognosis: requirement of second-line steroid-therapy within the 2-years after diagnosis (SR). A series of 72 cases included 56 UC, 43 non-SR (with first-line treatment 5-ASA) and 13 SR, 11 infectious  and 5 normal colonic biopsies. Normal mucosa was characterized by low infiltrates but high BTLA and TNFRSF14. Compared to normal, UC had increased pan-immune-markers of CD3, CD8, FOXP3, PD-1, CD68, CD16, CD163, PTX3 and CD11C but had decreased BTLA (P < 0.05); by GSEA analysis comparable results were found in an independent UC gene-expression-data set (GSE38713). Compared to infectious, UC had higher CD4, CD8, PTX3 and CD11C but lower BTLA (P < 0.05). Compared to non-SR, SR had lower FOXP3 + Tregs (Odds-Ratio = 0.114, P = 0.002), PD-1 (OR = 0.176, P = 0.002) and CD163/CD68 -ratio (OR, 0.019, P = 0.019) but higher CD68 + pan-macrophages (OR = 6.034, P = 0.002). Higher Baron endoscopic and Geboes histologic disease activity scores also correlated with SR. In summary, UC was characterized by increased pan-immune-markers, normal TNFRSF14 and low BTLA. SR had increased CD68 + pan-macrophages but lower immune inhibitors of FOXP3 + Tregs, PD-1 and CD163/CD68 -macrophage ratio.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates  induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic  scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10.  macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to - macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating . This article is protected by copyright.

Increased proinflammatory macrophages (M1) have been documented in tissue from patients with CD. Anti-inflammatory macrophages () may play a role in UC given the preponderance of Th2 cytokines in this variant of IBD. Animal and clinical studies have shown that the probiotic VSL#3 can ameliorate signs and symptoms of IBD. Although animal data suggests a modulatory effect on macrophage phenotype, the effect of VSL#3 on human macrophages remains unknown.To determine the effect of the probiotic VSL#3 on the phenotype of polarized (M1/) and unpolarized (MΦ) human macrophages.Human monocyte-derived macrophages, generated by culturing monocytes with M-CSF, were left unpolarized or were polarized towards an M1 or an  phenotype by culture with LPS and IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively, and were then cultured in the presence or absence of VSL#3 for 3 days. Changes in macrophage morphology were assessed. Cytokine and chemokine levels in supernatants were determined by multiplex assay.VSL#3 decreased the granuloma-like aggregates of M1 macrophages, increased fibroblast-like  macrophages, and decreased fibroblast-like MΦ macrophages. VSL#3 increased the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and G-CSF by M1, , and MΦ macrophages. VSL#3 exposure maintained the proinflammatory phenotype of M1 macrophages, sustaining IL-12 secretion, increasing IL-23 secretion, and decreasing MDC secretion. Both VSL#3-treated  and MΦ macrophages secreted higher levels of anti-inflammatory and pro-healing factors such as IL-1Ra, IL-13, EGF, FGF-2, TGF-α, and VEGF, as well as proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and TNF-α.Under our experimental conditions VSL#3 induced a mixed proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotype in polarized and unpolarized macrophages. This differential effect could explain why patients with CD do not respond to probiotic therapy as well as patients with UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971761>Upregulated claudin-1 expression promotes -associated cancer by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation and activation in Notch/p-AKT-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>In IBD patients, integration between a hyper-activated immune system and epithelial cell plasticity underlies colon cancer development. However, molecular regulation of such a circuity remains undefined. Claudin-1 (Cld-1), a tight-junction integral protein deregulation alters colonic epithelial cell (CEC) differentiation, and promotes  severity while impairing -associated injury/repair. Tumorigenesis is a product of an unregulated wound-healing process and therefore we postulated that upregulated Cld-1 levels render IBD patients susceptible to the -associated cancer (CAC). Villin Cld-1 mice are used to carryout overexpressed studies in mice. The role of deregulated Cld-1 expression in CAC and the underlying mechanism was determined using a well-constructed study scheme and mouse models of DSS /recovery and CAC. Using an inclusive investigative scheme, we here report that upregulated Cld-1 expression promotes susceptibility to the CAC and its malignancy. Increased mucosal inflammation and defective epithelial homeostasis accompanied the increased CAC in Villin-Cld-1-Tg mice. We further found significantly increased levels of protumorigenic  macrophages and β-cateninSer552 (β-CatSer552) expression in the CAC in Cld-1Tg vs. WT mice. Mechanistic studies identified the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in Cld-1-dependent activation of the β-CatSer552, which, in turn, was dependent on proinflammatory signals. Our studies identify a critical role of Cld-1 in promoting susceptibility to CAC. Importantly, these effects of deregulated Cld-1 were not associated with altered tight junction integrity, but on its noncanonical role in regulating Notch/PI3K/Wnt/ β-CatSer552 signaling. Overall, outcome from our current studies identifies Cld-1 as potential prognostic biomarker for IBD severity and CAC, and a novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20801771>Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, -pyruvate kinase and S100A12 in severe ulcerative : a prospective multicentre comparison of predicting outcomes and monitoring response.</a></h2><p>To compare four faecal markers for their ability to predict steroid refractoriness in severe paediatric ulcerative  (UC).

Stool samples from 101 children (13.3 + or - 3.6 years; Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) at admission 72 + or - 12 points) were obtained at the third day of intravenous steroid therapy. Repeated samples at discharge were obtained from 24 children. Predictive validity was assessed using diagnostic utility statistics to predict steroid failure (ie, the need for salvage treatment). Concurrent validity was assessed using correlational analysis with the following constructs: PUCAI, Lindgren and Seo scores, physician's global assessment, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP). Responsiveness was assessed using test utility and correlational strategies.Median values (IQR) were very high at baseline for all four markers (calprotectin 4215 microg/g (2297-8808); lactoferrin 212 microg/g (114-328); -pyruvate kinase (-PK) 363 U/g (119-3104); and S100A12 469 microg/g (193-1112)). -PK was numerically superior to the other three markers and CRP in predicting response to corticosteroid treatment (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.85; p<0.001) vs <0.65 for the others). However, it did not add to the predictive ability of the PUCAI (area under the ROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89)). -PK also had the highest construct validity but with a modest mean correlation with all constructs (r=0.3; p<0.05). None of the markers was responsive to change (Spearman's rho correlation with change in the PUCAI <0.1; p>0.05, area under the ROC curve <0.65; p>0.05).The four markers were greatly elevated in severe paediatric UC. Only -PK had good construct and predictive validity, and none was responsive to change.

Previous steroid therapy induced diabetes, and he was obese, with a height of 170.3 cm, weight of 89.6 kg, and BMI of 30.89 kg/, indicating that laparoscopic dissection near the anus would be difficult to perform. Therefore, the patient was scheduled for transanal minimally invasive surgery(TAMIS). The surgery involved as much laparoscopic rectal dissection as possible in the ventral to dorsal direction, followed by the TAMIS procedure. Dissection was started from the dentate line, and, after the closure of the anal stump, GelPOINT was placed, and made continuous with the previous dissection layer by applying the technique of down-to-up total mesorectal excision(TME)by TAMIS. The large intestine was excised through a small abdominal incision to create an ileal pouch, hand-sewn anastomosis was performed transanally to create a temporary colostomy, and the surgery was completed. Regarding TAMIS-TME several problems remain to be solved, including an understanding of its unique anatomy and the mastery of single-port surgical techniques.

Wild-type p53 suppresses inflammation, but it is unclear whether the role of p53 in suppression of inflammation is linked to its tumor suppression function. Here, we established mouse models of myeloid lineage-specific p53 deletion or activation to examine its role in inflammation-related intestinal tumorigenesis. Impaired p53 in the myeloid linage resulted in elevated levels of inflammatory mediators and stimulated adenoma initiation in Apc(Min/+) mice. In contrast, mice with mild p53 activation in the myeloid lineage attenuated the inflammatory response and were more resistant to intestinal tumor development and invasion, which were initiated through Apc(Min/+) mutation or carcinogen and promoted by . Furthermore, p53 activation also suppressed alternative () macrophage polarization together with c-MYC downregulation. Therefore, as a regulator of macrophage function, p53 is critical to protection against tumorigenesis in a non-cell-autonomous manner.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the effects of docosahexaenoic acid-derived lipid mediator maresin 1 (MaR1) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced  in mice. Systemic treatment with MaR1 significantly attenuated both DSS- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colonic inflammation by improving the disease activity index and reducing body weight loss and colonic tissue damage. MaR1 treatment also induced a significant decrease in levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ, in the acute protocol, as well as IL-1β and IL-6, but not TNF-α and INF-γ, in the chronic DSS  protocol. Additionally, MaR1 decreased ICAM-1 mRNA expression in both the acute and chronic protocols of DSS-induced . Furthermore, the beneficial effects of MaR1 seem to be associated with inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, incubation of LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures with MaR1 reduced neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production, besides decreasing IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and INF-γ production. Interestingly, macrophages incubated only with MaR1 showed a significant upregulation of mannose receptor C, type 1 mRNA expression, an  macrophage phenotype marker. These results indicate that MaR1 consistently protects mice against different models of experimental , possibly by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and consequently multiple inflammatory mediators, as well as by enhancing the macrophage  phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579851>Transformation of Follicular Lymphoma to a High-Grade B-Cell Lymphoma With MYC and BCL2 Translocations and Overlapping Features of Burkitt Lymphoma and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Case Report and Literature Review.</a></h2><p>Most commonly, histologic transformation (HT) from follicular lymphoma (FL) manifests as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS). Less frequently, HT may result in a high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC and B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements, also known as "double-hit" or "triple-hit" lymphomas. In the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms, the category B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable was eliminated due to its vague criteria and limiting diagnostic benefit. Instead, the WHO introduced the HGBL category, characterized by MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. Cases that present as an intermediate phenotype of DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) will fall within this HGBL category. Very rarely, HT results in both the intermediate DLBCL and BL phenotypes and exhibits lymphoblastic features, in which case the WHO recommends that this morphologic appearance should be noted. In comparison with de novo patients with DLBCL, NOS, those with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements have a worse prognosis. A 63-year-old woman presented with left neck adenopathy. Laboratory assessments, including complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and β-microglobulin, were all normal. A whole-body computerized tomographic (CT) scan revealed diffuse adenopathy above and below the diaphragm. An excisional node biopsy showed grade 3A nodular FL. The Ki67 labeling index was 40% to 50%. A bone marrow biopsy showed a small focus of paratrabecular CD20+ lymphoid aggregates. She received 6 cycles of bendamustine (90 mg/ on days +1 and +2) and rituximab (375 mg/ on day +2), with each cycle delivered every 4 weeks. A follow-up CT scan at completion of therapy showed a partial response with resolution of axillary adenopathy and a dramatic shrinkage of the large retroperitoneal nodes. After 18 months, she had crampy abdominal pain in the absence of B symptoms. Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-d-glucose integrated with CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan showed widespread adenopathy, diffuse splenic involvement, and substantial marrow involvement. Biopsy of a 2.4-cm right axillary node (SUVmax of 16.1) showed involvement by grade 3A FL with a predominant nodular pattern of growth. A bone marrow biopsy once again showed only a small focus of FL. She received idelalisib (150 mg twice daily) and rituximab (375 mg/, monthly) beginning May 2015. After 4 cycles, a repeat CT scan showed a complete radiographic response. Idelalisib was subsequently held while she received corticosteroids for immune-mediated . A month later, she restarted idelalisib with a 50% dose reduction. After 2 weeks, she returned to clinic complaining of bilateral hip and low lumbar discomfort but no B symptoms. A restaging 18F-FDG PET/CT in January 2016 showed dramatic marrow uptake. A bone marrow aspirate showed sheets of tumor cells representing a spectrum from intermediate-sized cells with lymphoblastic features to very large atypical cells with multiple nucleoli. Two distinct histologies were present; one remained consistent with the patient's known FL with a predominant nodular pattern and the other consistent with HT (the large atypical cells expressed PAX5, CD10, BCL2, and c-MYC and were negative for CD20, MPO, CD34, CD30, and BCL6). Focal areas showed faint, heterogeneous expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase best seen on the clot section. Ki67 proliferation index was high (4+/4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed 2 populations with MYC amplification and/or rearrangement and no evidence of BCL6 rearrangement; a karyotype analysis showed a complex abnormal female karyotype with t(14;18) and multiple structural and numerical abnormalities. She started dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin with concomitant prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. She had but a short-lived response before dying in hospice from progressive lymphoma. Whether idelalisib could provide a microenvironment for selection of more aggressive clones needs to be addressed. Our patient's clinical course is confounded by the incorporation of idelalisib while being further complicated by the complexity of HT and the mechanisms in which first-line chemotherapy regimens affect double-hit lymphoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26224047>Berberine ameliorates TNBS induced  by inhibiting inflammatory responses and Th1/Th17 differentiation.</a></h2><p>Th1 and Th17 cells, and their associated cytokines, have been associated with the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicines, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating experimental . In this study, we show that BBR had a protective effect on mice with TNBS-induced . BBR inhibited levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α both in the local colon and sera, and transiently increased levels of IL-22. BBR also markedly increased sIgA expression in the colon. BBR had pronounced effects on macrophage populations. Treatment with BBR adjusted the /M1 ratio. In addition, BBR exerted effects on adaptive immunity by suppressing numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as expression levels of their associated cytokines and transcriptional factors. BBR downregulated STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation, and inhibited phosphorylation of NF-kB. In vitro experiments showed that BBR inhibited the differentiation of Th17 and, to a lesser degree, Th1 cells, without affecting regulatory T cells. Therefore, we conclude that BBR plays a regulatory role in modulating the balance of immune responses in TNBS-induced . Our study will help us understand the regulatory mechanisms exerted by BBR in the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently SIRT2 was revealed to play an important role in inflammation, directly binding, deacetylating, and inhibiting the p65 subunit of NF-κB.A Sirt2 deficient mouse line (Sirt2-/-) was generated by deleting exons 5-7, encoding part of the SIRT2 deacetylase domain, by homologous recombination. Age- and sex-matched Sirt2-/- and Sirt2+/+ littermate mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  and analyzed for  susceptibility.Sirt2-/- mice displayed more severe clinical and histological manifestations after DSS  compared to wild type littermates. Notably, under basal condition, Sirt2 deficiency does not affect the basal phenotype and intestinal morphology Sirt2 deficiency, however, affects macrophage polarization, creating a pro-inflammatory milieu in the immune cells compartment.These data confirm a protective role for SIRT2 against the development of inflammatory processes, pointing out a potential role for this sirtuin as a suppressor of . In fact, SIRT2 deletion promotes inflammatory responses by increasing NF-κB acetylation and by reducing the -associated anti-inflammatory pathway. Finally, we speculate that the activation of SIRT2 may be a potential approach for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698557>Timosaponin AIII and its metabolite sarsasapogenin ameliorate  in mice by inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK activation and restoring Th17/Treg cell balance.</a></h2><p>The rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (AA, family Liliaceae), which contains furostanol and spirostanol saponins, is a typical herbal medicine that improves learning and memory in rats and inhibits inflammation. In a preliminary study, timosaponin AIII, one of AA main constituents, was metabolized to sarsasapogenin by gut microbiota and inhibited NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Here we have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of AIII and sarsasapogenin in vitro and in vivo. Both AIII and sarsasapogenin potently inhibited NF-κB and MAPK activation, as well as IRAK1, TAK1, and IκBα phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Further, AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited the binding of LPS to macrophage Toll-like receptor 4, as well as polarization of  to M1 macrophages. Oral administration of AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited 2,3,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice, along with reducing NF-κB activation and interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 levels, while simultaneously increasing IL-10. Both compounds inhibited Th17 cell differentiation in colonic lamina propria, but induced Treg cell differentiation. Further, AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited the differentiation of splenic CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells in vitro. The vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of sarsasapogenin were more potent than AIII. These results suggest that orally administered AIII may be metabolized to sarsasapogenin by gut microbiota, which may ameliorate inflammatory diseases such as  by inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway and restoring Th17/Treg cell balance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These patients also have compromised antioxidant defenses as the result of nutritional deficiencies. The micronutrient selenium is essential for selenoprotein production and is transported from the liver to target tissues via selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Target tissues also produce SEPP1, which is thought to possess an endogenous antioxidant function. Here, we have shown that mice with Sepp1 haploinsufficiency or mutations that disrupt either the selenium transport or the enzymatic domain of SEPP1 exhibit increased -associated carcinogenesis as the result of increased genomic instability and promotion of a protumorigenic microenvironment. Reduced SEPP1 function markedly increased -polarized macrophages, indicating a role for SEPP1 in macrophage polarization and immune function. Furthermore, compared with partial loss, complete loss of SEPP1 substantially reduced tumor burden, in part due to increased apoptosis. Using intestinal organoid cultures, we found that, compared with those from WT animals, Sepp1-null cultures display increased stem cell characteristics that are coupled with increased ROS production, DNA damage, proliferation, decreased cell survival, and modulation of WNT signaling in response to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. Together, these data demonstrate that SEPP1 influences inflammatory tumorigenesis by affecting genomic stability, the inflammatory microenvironment, and epithelial stem cell functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601639>Tofacitinib ameliorates atherosclerosis and reduces foam cell formation in apoE deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease with high mortality worldwide. Tofacitinib (CP-690,550), an oral small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and ulcerative . However, its protective effect against atherosclerosis remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Tofacitinib on atherogenic diet (ATD)-induced atherosclerosis using apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Atherosclerosis-prone apoE-/- mice were fed with ATD and treated with or without Tofacitinib through intragastrical administration (10 mg kg day) for 8 weeks. Our results showed that Tofacitinib did not change plasma lipids, while significantly reduced the levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. It also significantly attenuated atherosclerotic plaque lesion in the aortic root and macrophages contained in plaque as shown with Mac2 immuno-staining. Peritoneal macrophages (PMC) were separated from apoE-/- mice fed with 8-week ATD, and then subjected to inflammation tests. Flow cytometry analysis of F4/80 and CD206 and mRNA levels of M1 and  macrophages markers showed that M1 macrophages decreased while  macrophages increased in Tofacitinib treated group. Expressions of other inflammatory genes also indicated an anti-inflammatory status in mice treated with Tofacitinib. Ox-LDL was used to induce foam cell formation from PMC in wild type mice, and the results displayed a reduced formation of foam cells and decreased inflammation in mice with Tofacitinib administration (1 μM). The mRNA and protein levels of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), a key gene involved in cholesterol efflux, remarkably increased, while it was absence of alterations in scavenger receptors expression. Therefore, we demonstrated that Tofacitinib could attenuate atherosclerosis and foam cells formation by inhibiting inflammation and upregulating ABCA1 expression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported that embelin suppresses -associated tumorigenesis. Here, the role of macrophage targeting in the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties of embelin was investigated. By using -associated cancer (CAC) model, we demonstrated that embelin significantly depleted colon macrophages by blocking their recruitment. Moreover, embelin attenuated -like polarization of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment and eliminated their tumor-promoting functions during the development of CAC. Embelin potently inhibited NF-κB signaling in macrophages and decreased the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumorigenic factors involved in CAC, such as TNFα, IL-6 and COX-2. In addition, embelin directly reduced the polarization of  macrophages in vitro even in the presence of Th2 cytokines. These results suggested that targeting macrophages is, at least in part, responsible for the anti-tumor activity of embelin in CAC.

Neoangiogenesis and vascular injury are observed in IBD along with increased lymphangiogenesis. While the pathogenic role of angiogenesis in IBD is well characterized, it is not clear how or if increased lymphangiogenesis promotes disease. Here, we determined that enhancing lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function reduces experimental IBD. Specifically, we demonstrated that adenoviral induction of prolymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C provides marked protection against the development of acute and chronic  in 2 different animal models. VEGF-C-dependent protection was observed in combination with increased inflammatory cell mobilization and bacterial antigen clearance from the inflamed colon to the draining lymph nodes. Moreover, we found that the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway regulates macrophage (MΦ) plasticity and activation both in cultured MΦs and in vivo, imparting a hybrid M1- phenotype. The protective function of VEGF-C was meditated by the so-called resolving MΦs during chronic experimental  in a STAT6-dependent manner. Together, these findings shed light on the contribution of lymphatics to the pathogenesis of gut inflammation and suggest that correction of defective lymphatic function with VEGF-C has potential as a therapeutic strategy for IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837080>A comprehensive review and update on ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disorder of the colon that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending from the rectum to the more proximal colon, with variable extents. UC is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. UC was first described by Samuel Wilks in 1859 and it is more common than Crohn's disease worldwide. The overall incidence and prevalence of UC is reported to be 1.2-20.3 and 7.6-245 cases per 100,000 persons/year respectively. UC has a bimodal age distribution with an incidence peak in the 2nd or 3rd decades and followed by second peak between 50 and 80 years of age. The key risk factors for UC include genetics, environmental factors, autoimmunity and gut microbiota. The classic presentation of UC include bloody diarrhea with or without mucus, rectal urgency, tenesmus, and variable degrees of abdominal pain that is often relieved by defecation. UC is diagnosed based on the combination of clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, histology, and the absence of alternative diagnoses. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of UC, it is also important to define the extent and severity of inflammation, which aids in the selection of appropriate treatment and for predicting the patient's prognosis. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of UC. A pathognomonic finding of UC is the presence of continuous colonic inflammation characterized by erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, granularity, erosions, friability, bleeding, and ulcerations, with distinct demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed bowel. Histopathology is the definitive tool in diagnosing UC, assessing the disease severity and identifying intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) or cancer. The classical histological changes in UC include decreased crypt density, crypt architectural distortion, irregular mucosal surface and heavy diffuse transmucosal inflammation, in the absence of genuine granulomas. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the preferred initial radiographic imaging study in UC patients with acute abdominal symptoms. The hallmark CT finding of UC is mural thickening with a mean wall thickness of 8 mm, as opposed to a 2-3 mm mean wall thickness of the normal colon. The Mayo scoring system is a commonly used index to assess disease severity and monitor patients during therapy. The goals of treatment in UC are three fold-improve quality of life, achieve steroid free remission and minimize the risk of cancer. The choice of treatment depends on disease extent, severity and the course of the disease. For proctitis, topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are used as the first line agents. UC patients with more extensive or severe disease should be treated with a combination of oral and topical 5-ASA drugs +/- corticosteroids to induce remission. Patients with severe UC need to be hospitalized for treatment. The options in these patients include intravenous steroids and if refractory, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (infliximab) are utilized. Once remission is induced, patients are then continued on appropriate medications to maintain remission. Indications for emergency surgery include refractory toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, or severe colorectal bleeding.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, there have been no reports on the kinetics of AIM in IBD and the impact of AIM on the pathogenesis of IBD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic utility of levels of AIM and their correlation with the activity of Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD.We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine AIM serum levels in 16 healthy subjects and 90 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, namely 39 with CD and 51 with ulcerative  (UC), as well as 17 patients with Behcet's disease (BD) as intestinal disease controls. We compared serum AIM levels among groups and examined whether there were correlations between serum AIM levels and disease activity and type. We also performed immunohistochemical staining of AIM in intestinal tissues of patients with CD.Serum AIM levels were significantly higher in patients with CD than in patients with UC, BD, and controls (3.27 ± 2.14, 1.88 ± 1.43, 2.34 ± 1.37, and 2.13 ± 0.64 μg/ml, respectively; P < 0.01). There was no difference in serum AIM levels before and after treatment in patients with CD. However, in these patients the diagnostic rate using AIM was better than that based on anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. AIM was expressed in macrophages that were positive for CD14, CD16, or both in the intestinal tissues of patients with CD.AIM is a novel biomarker of CD that can distinguish CD from UC or BD.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced  were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α.  severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced  in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80/iNOS cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas  macrophages (F4/80/CD206 cells) were increased.

Macrophages coordinate tissue repair and several phenotypes have been reported which differ in the expression of surface proteins, cytokines and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). We analysed the role of HIFs in the expression of Notch ligands in macrophages and the relevance of this pathway in mucosal regeneration.Human monocytes and U937-derived macrophages were polarized towards the M1 and  phenotypes and the expression levels of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, Jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta-like 4 (Dll4) were evaluated.

Phenotype macrophage markers and Notch signalling were evaluated in the mucosa of CD patients.M1 macrophages were associated with HIF-1-dependent induction of Jag1 and Dll4, which increased HES1 protein levels and IAP activity in co-cultured epithelial cells. In the mucosa of CD patients a high percentage of M1 macrophages expressed both HIF-1α and Jag1 while  macrophages mainly expressed HIF-2α and we detected a good correlation between the ratio of M1/ macrophages and both HES1 and IAP protein levels.M1, but not , macrophages are associated with HIF-1-dependent induction of Notch ligands and activation of epithelial Notch signalling pathway.

A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA decreases the risk of Crohn's disease. However, the function of PTPN22 and the mechanism by which this SNP reduces the risk of Crohn's disease are poorly understood. We find that PTPN22 is expressed in macrophages. It suppresses M1 macrophage polarization and reciprocally promotes the expression of -associated genes. PTPN22-deficient mice develop severe  induced by dextran sulfate sodium, and their intestinal macrophages express higher levels of M1 genes but lower levels of -associated genes. Furthermore, the protective T allele of the C1858T SNP is associated with attenuated expression of inflammatory cytokines and a higher level of PTPN22 in human M1 macrophages. This T allele-associated aberrant expression of PTPN22 is partly attributed to an autoinhibition mechanism, in which PTPN22 suppresses its own expression in M1 but not  macrophages.

We found that partial inhibition of the mitochondrial ATP synthase in the intestine of transgenic mice triggers an anti-inflammatory response through NFκB activation mediated by mitochondrial mtROS. This shielding phenotype is revealed when mice are challenged by DSS-induced , which, in control animals, triggers inflammation, recruitment of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages, and the activation of the pro-oncogenic STAT3 and Akt/mTOR pathways. In contrast, transgenic mice can polarize macrophages to the  anti-inflammatory phenotype. Using the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ to quench mtROS in vivo, we observe decreased NFκB activation, preventing its cellular protective effects. These findings stress the relevance of mitochondrial signaling to the innate immune system and emphasize the potential role of the ATP synthase as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and other related diseases.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

The performances of fNeo and fZon were weaker in this setting.The performance of fM2-PK at W2 to predict response to induction therapy with IFX was superior to that of fLact and fCal, whereas monitoring fLact was the best tool to predict adequately the course of the disease at one year under maintenance IFX in UC.Copyright © 2016.

Macrophages obtain pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory () phenotypes, which can be modulated by soluble factors, including natural products. Despite the crucial protective role of inflammation, chronic or deregulated inflammation can lead to pathological states, such as autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. In this case, we studied the anti-inflammatory activity of neorogioltriol () in depth and identified two structurally related diterpenes, neorogioldiol (), and ,15-cyclo-14-bromo-14,15-dihydrorogiol-3,11-diol (), with equally potent activity. We investigated the mechanism of action of metabolites ⁻ and found that all three suppressed macrophage activation and promoted an -like anti-inflammatory phenotype by inducing expression of Arginase1, MRC1, IRAK-M, the transcription factor C/EBPβ, and the miRNA miR-146a. In addition, they suppressed iNOS induction and nitric oxide production. Importantly, treatment of mice with  or  suppressed DSS-induced  by reducing tissue damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Thus, all these three diterpenes are promising lead molecules for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting macrophage polarization mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043835>Onset of Ulcerative  after Helicobacter pylori Eradication Therapy: A Case Report.</a></h2><p>In Japan, Helicobacter pylori eradication has been approved since 2013 for treatment of H pylori-induced chronic gastritis, in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of gastric cancer, a leading cancer in Japan. H pylori infection affects more than 50% of the world's population. H pylori eradication therapy is generally safe. To our knowledge, no case of newly diagnosed ulcerative  occurring immediately after H pylori eradication therapy has previously been reported.A 63-year-old man received a diagnosis of chronic gastritis and H pylori infection. In early March 2014, primary H pylori eradication therapy was initiated; lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin were administered for 1 week. Beginning on the fourth day, he had watery diarrhea twice a day. From the 11th day, bloody stools and watery diarrhea increased to 6 times a day. Colonoscopy, performed on the 40th day after termination of drug therapy, revealed diffuse inflammation in the distal aspect of the colon, with histologic findings consistent with ulcerative . He was admitted to the hospital and was provided with a semivegetarian diet and metronidazole. He noticed a gradual decrease in the amount of blood in his feces then a disappearance of the blood. A fecal occult blood test on the 11th hospital day recorded 337 ng/mL. Fecal occult blood test is not indicated during macroscopic bloody stool but is indicated after disappearance of bloody stool. Therefore, he achieved clinical remission by the 11th hospital day. He was in remission on discharge.New onset of ulcerative  should be added to a list of adverse events of H pylori eradication therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544348>Protective effect of curcumin on TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation is mediated through the JAK/STAT pathway.</a></h2><p>Curcumin displays a protective role in rat models of intestinal inflammation. However, the mechanism of how curcumin affects on intestinal inflammation is less known. The purpose of the current study is to explore the signal pathway in which the curcumin protecting rat from intestinal inflammation.The intestinal inflammation rat models were made by TNBS treatment. Curcumin was added to their diet 5 days before the TNBS instillation. After that, body weight change, score of macroscopic assessment of disease activity and microscopic scoring were utilized to analyse the severity of the induced inflammation. In addition, the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory were detected to determine the effect of curcumin on intestinal inflammation. The JAK/STAT pathway of pro-inflammation response was also evaluated. Finally, the impact of curcumin on apoptosis in intestinal inflammation was assessed by TUNEL staining.Rats pretreated with curcumin significantly reversed the decrease of body weight and increase of colon weight derived from TNBS-induced . Histological improvement was observed in response to curcumin. In addition, curcumin attenuated TNBS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1/ ratio, while stimulated the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The inhibition of pro-inflammation response was mediated by SOCS-1, which could efficiently suppress JAK/STAT pathways. Furthermore, curcumin efficiently suppressed the TNBS-induced apoptosis, and reduced the accumulation of cytochrome C in cytosol.The anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin is realized by enhancing SOCS-1 expression and inhibiting JAK/STAT pathways. Curcumin also plays an anti-apoptotic role in TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation. We propose that curcumin may have therapeutic implications for human intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505888>Bone mineral density in patients with inflammatory bowel disease from north-eastern Romania.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased prevalence of bone demineralization. One of the risk factors for low bone density is the inadequate level of 25-OH vitamin D.To determine the degree of bone demineralization in patients with IBD and the main causes leading to this condition.A prospective study was carried out between April, 2011 and October, 2012 in 143 patients diagnosed with IBD at the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Centre of Iaşi.The IBD diagnosis was made on clinical, biological, and endoscopic criteria and confirmed histologically. The diagnosis of osteopenia/osteoporosis was based on World Health Organization criteria.Osteopenia was found in 48.07% of the patients with ulcerative colits (UC) and in 56.41% of the patients with Crohn's disease (CD); osteoporosis was present in 18.26% of the patients with UC and 15.38% of those with CD. The main causes identified were inadequate vitamin D level, extended high-dose corticotherapy in patients with CD, BMI < 18.5 kg/, and smoking, especially in the patients with UC.Bone demineralization and hypovitaminosis D are frequently associated with IBD and require specific treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427627>Anti-inflammatory actions of Caesalpinin  in experimental  as a selective glucocoricoid receptor modulator.</a></h2><p>Although repression of inflammatory gene expression makes glucocorticoids (GCs) powerful anti-inflammatory agents, side effects limit usage and drive the search for improved glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands. It has been postulated that the anti-inflammatory effects of GCs are primarily mediated by GR's activity in transrepressing major inflammation pathways such as NF-κB pathway, whereas their side effects are mostly mediated by GR's transactivation. In this study, we found that Caesalpinin  (C-), a cassane furanoditerpene isolated from a Chinese medical plant, exerts an anti-inflammatory potential both in vitro and in vivo. C- inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages. Meanwhile, C- treatment attenuated DSS-induced experimental acute  in mice and did not cause side effects, such as spleen involution, like dexamethasone treatment. Molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay demonstrated that C- could bind to GR in the ligand binding site. We showed that C- mediates gene-inhibitory effects by activating GR. More importantly, C- failed to induce GR binding to glucocorticoid response element-dependent genes and in turn activate their transcription. But it did repress NF-κB-dependent transcription by facilitating the interaction between GR and p65. Taken together, this non-steroidal compound of plant origin may exert anti-inflammatory actions as a selective GR modulator and might hold great potential for therapeutic use in inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recently increased fecal PKM2 has been found in Crohn's disease (CD), but little is known regarding its function in the pathophysiology of the disease.The intestinal expression of PKM2 and its involvement in CD was investigated.Pyruvate kinase  expression in mucosal biopsies from patients with CD and normal controls was detected by immunohistochemistry. A murine model of  induced by trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) was established and expression of PKM2, B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl), active caspase-3 as well as cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was examined for association of PKM2 with intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis. Furthermore, we treated human IEC line HT-29 by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and used RNA interference to analyze the role of PKM2 in IEC apoptosis.Intestinal expression of PKM2 was higher in patients with CD compared with normal controls mainly locating in IECs. In TNBS-induced , up-regulation of PKM2 was accompanied by the elevated expression of Bcl-xl, active caspase-3, and cleaved PARP. PKM2 was co-localized with active caspase-3 in IECs marked by E-cadherin, suggesting its role in IEC apoptosis. Expression of PKM2 and Bcl-xl in TNF-α-induced HT-29 cells was increased, while TNF-α had no effect on cellular localization of PKM2. Furthermore, knockdown of PKM2 by siRNA could inhibit expression of Bcl-xl but enhance apoptosis in TNF-α-treated HT-29 cells.The up-regulation of PKM2 might protect IECs against apoptosis possibly through Bcl-xl in CD, indicating its important role in the pathophysiology of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022622>IL-10 deficiency exacerbates the brain inflammatory response to permanent ischemia without preventing resolution of the lesion.</a></h2><p>Stroke induces inflammation that can aggravate brain damage. This work examines whether interleukin-10 (IL-10) deficiency exacerbates inflammation and worsens the outcome of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Expression of IL-10 and IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) increased after ischemia. From day 4, reactive astrocytes showed strong IL-10R immunoreactivity. Interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice kept in conventional housing showed more mortality after pMCAO than the wild type (WT). This effect was associated with the presence of signs of  in the IL-10 KO mice, suggesting that ongoing systemic inflammation was a confounding factor. In a pathogen-free environment, IL-10 deficiency slightly increased infarct volume and neurologic deficits. Induction of proinflammatory molecules in the IL-10 KO brain was similar to that in the WT 6 hours after ischemia, but was higher at day 4, while differences decreased at day 7. Deficiency of IL-10 promoted the presence of more mature phagocytic cells in the ischemic tissue, and enhanced the expression of  markers and the T-cell inhibitory molecule CTLA-4. These findings agree with a role of IL-10 in attenuating local inflammatory reactions, but do not support an essential function of IL-10 in lesion resolution. Upregulation of alternative immunosuppressive molecules after brain ischemia can compensate, at least in part, the absence of IL-10.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27981571>Haematopoietic prolyl hydroxylase-1 deficiency promotes  macrophage polarization and is both necessary and sufficient to protect against experimental .</a></h2><p>Prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs) regulate the adaptation of cells to hypoxia. Pan-hydroxylase inhibition is protective in experimental , in which PHD1 plays a prominent role. However, it is currently unknown how PHD1 targeting regulates this protection and which cell type(s) are involved. Here, we demonstrated that Phd1 deletion in endothelial and haematopoietic cells (Phd1 Tie2:cre) protected mice from dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced , with reduced epithelial erosions, immune cell infiltration, and colonic microvascular dysfunction, whereas the response of Phd2 Tie2:cre and Phd3 Tie2:cre mice to DSS was similar to that of their littermate controls. Using bone marrow chimeras and cell-specific cre mice, we demonstrated that ablation of Phd1 in haematopoietic cells but not in endothelial cells was both necessary and sufficient to inhibit experimental . This effect relied, at least in part, on skewing of Phd1-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory  phenotype. These cells showed an attenuated nuclear factor-κB-dependent response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which in turn diminished endothelial chemokine expression. In addition, Phd1 deficiency in dendritic cells significantly reduced interleukin-1β production in response to LPS. Taken together, our results further support the development of selective PHD1 inhibitors for ulcerative , and identify haematopoietic cells as their primary target.

However, the precise mechanisms by which IL-33 modulates IBD are controversial. The aim of this study was thus to clarify the role of IL-33 in IBD. The plasma levels of IL-33 were significantly decreased, but soluble ST2 levels were increased in patients with IBD compared to healthy individuals. Moreover, IL-33 restored goblet cell numbers and induced macrophage switching from the M1 to the  phenotype. These effects were sufficient to ameliorate  in dextran sodium sulfate, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, and peritoneal cavity cell transfer models. IL-33 facilitated goblet cell restoration via modulating macrophages toward the  phenotype. In addition, wound healing was significantly faster in IL-33-treated human monocyte-derived macrophages than in control cells, which could be attributed to increased polarisation into  macrophages. We found that patients with IBD show decreased serum levels of IL-33 compared with healthy individuals and that IL-33 can attenuate  and aid tissue repair in mice. The mechanism by which IL-33 exerts these effects appears to involve the stimulation of differentiation of goblet cells and  macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29273328>Elevation of serum pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) in IBD and its relationship to IBD indices.</a></h2><p>Endoscopy remains the gold standard to diagnose and evaluate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity. Current biomarkers or their combinations cannot adequately predict IBD risk, diagnosis, progression or relapse, and response to therapy. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is emerging as a significant mediator of the inflammatory process. We aimed to assess levels of serum PKM2 in healthy and newly diagnosed IBD patients and its relationship with IBD indices and microbiota changes.IBD serum samples from newly diagnosed patients were collected and analyzed using a PKM2-ELISA and correlated with disease activity scores, IBD disease type, and intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, we tested the genetic and protein expression of PKM2 in an in vitro intestinal cell model of inflammation.Serum PKM2 levels were 6-fold higher in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, with no sensitivity to disease phenotype (Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative ) or localization of inflammation. Serum PKM2 had considerably less interindividual variability than established IBD fecal biomarkers. A positive Pearson correlation (r=0.6121) existed between serum PKM2 and Bacteroidetes fecal levels in Crohn's disease (CD), while a negative (r=-0.6128) correlation was observed with Actinobacteria fecal levels. Furthermore, LPS (500ng/mL) significantly increased PKM2 expression in vitro, which was significantly suppressed by an anti-inflammatory flaxseed bioactive agent.Our data suggests PKM2 as a putative biomarker for IBD and the dysbiosis of microflora in CD. Investigations involving larger number of clinical patients are necessary to validate its use as a serum biomarker of IBD.Copyright © 2017 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Inducing macrophages from an inflammatory ('M1') to anti-inflammatory ('') phenotype has significant implications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and regeneration of injured tissues. Although certain cytokines, such as interleukin-4 and -13, are known to induce this phenotypic switch, their therapeutic use in vivo has both safety and efficacy concerns. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach to change macrophage phenotype from M1 to , through inducing the clustering of mannose receptors (MR) on the cell surface, by using carbohydrate-presenting substrates. We prepared and screened glucomannan-decorated silicon oxide of different sizes ranging from 10 to 1000 nm, and identified one type (KSiNP30) that could potently induce MR clustering on macrophages and thereby stimulated the cells into an  phenotype - as an unexpected consequence of MR activation. Further administration of KSiNP30 in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease efficiently alleviated the  symptoms, indicating the translational potential of our finding for therapeutic applications. In summary, we report for the first time an approach to modulate cellular immune responses by manipulating the assembly of cell-surface receptors, without the aid of cytokines. Our approach may provide insights for the development of new anti-inflammatory therapies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the effects of COMP-Ang1 on an experimental colonic inflammation model. Experimental  was induced in mice by administering 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) via drinking water. We determined body weight, disease activity indices, histopathological scores, lymphatic density, anti-ER-HR3 staining, and the expression of members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and various inflammatory cytokines in the mice. The density of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) and VEGFR-3-positive lymphatic vessels increased in mice with DSS-induced . We observed that COMP-Ang1-treated mice showed less weight loss, fewer clinical signs of , and longer colons than Ade-DSS-treated mice. COMP-Ang1 also significantly reduced the density of LYVE-1-positive lymphatic vessels and the disruption of colonic architecture that is normally associated with  and repressed the immunoregulatory response. Further, COMP-Ang1 treatment reduced both M1 and  macrophage infiltration into the inflamed colon, which involved inhibition of VEGF-C and D expression. Thus, COMP-Ang1, which acts by reducing inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis, may be used as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of IBD and other inflammatory diseases.COMP-Ang1 decreases inflammatory-induced lymphangiogenesis in experimental acute .

Previous studies emphasize the role of the M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in mediating the effects of cholinergic agonists on intestinal ion transport. With the prevalence of mouse models to study intestinal (patho)physiology, it is crucial that ion transport be understood in this species. Using M3 receptor-deficient (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice, we examined M3 receptor contributions to ion transport as well as its role in  induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In the Ussing chambers, ileal and colonic tissue from M3 KO and WT mice displayed similar baseline ion transport properties. Short-circuit current (ISC) responses to the muscarinic receptor agonist bethanechol were slightly decreased in ileal tissue from M3 KO mice compared with tissue from WT mice, whereas responses were not significantly different in colonic tissue. ISC responses to bethanechol were partially inhibited by pirenzepine in WT ileum, but not tetrodotoxin, suggesting involvement of a non-neuronal M1 muscarinic receptor. In the ileum, the M3 receptor may inhibit neuronally evoked ion transport, as indicated by the increased ISC responses to electrical stimulation in tissue from M3 KO mice. Furthermore, whereas all DSS-treated mice developed , M3 KO mice displayed more rapid mass loss and more severe disease than DSS-treated WT mice, even following a reduction in the amount and time of DSS treatment. Thus, M3 receptor-KO mice are compensated in their ability to evoke muscarinic receptor-driven ion transport responses, but are more sensitive to DSS.

Resolution represents not only an increase in anti-inflammatory actions, but also a paradigm shift in immune cell function to restore homeostasis. PPARγ, a ligand activated transcription factor, has long been studied for its anti-inflammatory actions, but an emerging body of literature is investigating the role of PPARγ and its ligands (including thiazolidinediones, prostaglandins, and oleanolic acids) in all phases of resolution. PPARγ can shift production from pro- to anti-inflammatory mediators by neutrophils, platelets, and macrophages. PPARγ and its ligands further modulate platelet and neutrophil function, decreasing trafficking, promoting neutrophil apoptosis, and preventing platelet-leukocyte interactions. PPARγ alters macrophage trafficking, increases efferocytosis and phagocytosis, and promotes alternative  macrophage activation. There are also roles for this receptor in the adaptive immune response, particularly regarding B cells. These effects contribute towards the attenuation of multiple disease states, including COPD, , Alzheimer's disease, and obesity in animal models. Finally, novel specialized proresolving mediators-eicosanoids with critical roles in resolution-may act through PPARγ modulation to promote resolution, providing another exciting area of therapeutic potential for this receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17058139>Salivary gland carcinoma treated with concomitant chemoradiation with intraarterial cisplatin and docetaxel.</a></h2><p>Malignant neoplasms of the salivary gland are uncommon entities in which surgical resection of the primary lesion has been accepted as a standard therapeutic option.

Notably, GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in prostate, gastric, cervical, thyroid, and colon cancers. We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis, a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, comparing Gpx3(-/-) mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory colon carcinogenesis. Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number, though not size, along with a higher degree of dysplasia. In addition, they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic  macrophage subsets, increased proliferation, hyperactive WNT signaling, and increased DNA damage. To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established colon cancer line, we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells, resulting in increased ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, combined with decreased contact-independent growth. Taken together, our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of -associated carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824967>Onset of Ulcerative  during a Low-Carbohydrate Weight-Loss Diet and Treatment with a Plant-Based Diet: A Case Report.</a></h2><p>Overweight and obesity are global health concerns. Various effective weight-loss diets have been developed, including the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is known as an extreme low-carbohydrate diet. This diet reduces body weight and has gained widespread popularity. However, the metabolite profiles of such a diet have been shown to be detrimental to colonic health. Therefore, a concern for the long-term health effects of this diet exists. We encountered a case in which ulcerative  developed while the patient was following the Atkins diet.A man, 172 cm in height and weighing 72 kg, at age 36 years followed a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet. His weight decreased to 66 kg as desired. Thereafter he noticed bloody stool. Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation limited to the rectum, and he was diagnosed with ulcerative . He underwent an educational hospitalization for ulcerative . A plant-based/semivegetarian diet was provided during hospitalization. Bloody stool disappeared during hospitalization and he achieved remission without medication for inflammatory bowel disease.This case indicates that an onset of ulcerative  can be an adverse event to a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29933526>Lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses intestinal inflammation by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling play significant roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we evaluated whether new therapeutic probiotics have anti-colitic effects, and we investigated their mechanisms related to NF-κB and ER-stress pathways.Luciferase, nitric oxide, and cytokine assays using HT-29 or RAW264.7 cells were conducted. Mouse  was induced using dextran sulfate sodium and confirmed by disease activity index and histology. Macrophages and T-cell subsets in isolated peritoneal cavity cells and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Gene and cytokine expression profiles were determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA1) and Pediococcus pentosaceus inhibited nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells, but only LA1 inhibited Tnfa and induced Il10 expression. LA1 increased the lifespan of dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and attenuated the severity of  by inducing  macrophages in peritoneal cavity cells and Th2 and Treg cells in splenocytes. The restoration of goblet cells in the colon was accompanied by the induction of Il10 expression and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we found that LA1 exerts an anti-colitic effect by improving ER stress in HT-29 cells as well as in vivo.We showed that LA1 significantly interferes with ER stress and suppresses NF-κB activation. Our findings suggest that LA1 can be used as a potent immunomodulator in IBD treatment, and the regulation of ER stress may have significant implications in treating IBD.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26896086>Mechanism of Action of Anti-TNF Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Several anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] blocking strategies have been evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease. Compounds that have been tested included the full monoclonal IgG1 antibodies infliximab and adalimumab, the pegylated anti-TNF F[ab']2 fragment certolizumab, an IgG4 anti-TNF CDP571 with reduced affinity for the Fc receptor, the soluble TNF receptor I onercept, and the TNF receptor II-Fc fusion protein etanercept. The endpoints of these studies suggest that not all methods of blocking TNF are equal. Here we will review the differences in the clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic endpoints of the major clinical studies. Collectively the data suggest that only IgG1 monoclonal antibodies have the ability to induce complete clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic remission. We discuss the potential multiple modes of action that may contribute to the response to full IgG1 anti-TNFs, focusing on the rapid induction of lamina propria T cell apoptosis and Fc receptor-dependent induction of -type wound-healing macrophages. We discuss how novel insights into the mechanism of action of anti-TNFs in Crohn's disease may contribute to the development of novel anti-TNFs with improved efficacy.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

In this study, we demonstrate that mice deficient in the p110δ catalytic subunit activity of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kp110δ) have increased clinical disease activity and histological damage during dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced . Increased disease severity in PI3Kp110δ-deficient mice is dependent on professional phagocytes and correlates with reduced numbers of arginase I+  macrophages in the colon and increased production of inflammatory nitric oxide. We further demonstrate that PI3Kp110δ-deficient macrophages are defective in their ability to induce arginase I when skewed to an  phenotype with IL-4. Importantly, adoptive transfer of IL-4-treated macrophages derived from WT mice, but not those from PI3Kp110δ-deficient mice, protects mice during DSS-induced . Moreover,  macrophages mediated protection is lost when mice are cotreated with inhibitors that block arginase activity or during adoptive transfer of arginase I deficient  macrophages. Taken together, our data demonstrate that arginase I activity is required for  macrophages mediated protection during DSS-induced  in PI3Kp110δ-deficient mice.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying polarization and the generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages is an area of high current interest. Our previous work has demonstrated that integrin CD11b promotes IL-10 production in macrophages by activating the Sarcoma gene (Src), yet whether and how Src modulates anti-inflammatory macrophages is not known. Here we show that Src inhibitor (Dasatinib)-treated mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , with a much more sever inflammation response, accompanying by high TNF-α, and low IL-10 expression. Inhibition of Src enhanced the expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage marker inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but reduced the expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage marker arginase1 (Arg1) in both intestinal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Overexpression of constitutively activated Src promoted IL-4-induced expression of Arg1 through STAT6 phosphorylation, and Jak1 was also involved in this process. Our results reveal that the IL-4-Src-STAT6 pathway plays a major role in polarizing anti-inflammatory macrophage generation and suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role for Src in inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its precise mechanism remains to be further studied. In this work, we investigated whether (+)-Borneol could improve the efficacy of EDA against DSS-induced . We found that C.EDA at 7.5 and 15mg/kg could significantly relieve the disease activity index (DAI) and reduce the loss of body weight and colon length in a dose-dependent manner, while EDA or (+)-Borneol alone only had moderate effects even at the highest dose. Additionally, ELISA revealed that C.EDA could more dramatically decrease the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines and increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine than EDA or (+)-Borneol alone both in colon tissues and serum. H&E staining and IHC assay also indicated that C.EDA exhibited more prominent effects on increasing the population of  macrophages, decreasing M1 macrophages infiltration and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, in vitro studied demonstrated that C.EDA, EDA or (+)-Borneol failed in inhibiting M1 macrophages activation but could specifically induce the activation of  macrophages in a STAT3-dependent manner. Knockdown the expression of STAT3 successfully abolished the effect of C.EDA and EDA on promoting  macrophages activation. Consistent with in vivo study, C.EDA exhibited a more efficient ability of inducing  macrophages polarization and STAT3 activation than EDA or (+)-Borneol alone in vitro. In conclusion, we confirmed that (+)-Borneol improved the efficacy of EDA against DSS-induced  by promoting  macrophages polarization via JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, it was shown that adoptive transfer of -polarized peritoneal macrophages reduced the severity of experimental  in mice. However, it is still unclear whether peritoneal macrophages possess the same ability to be polarized to cells with functionally different phenotypes and cytokine production patterns as bone-marrow-derived macrophages. To address this question, we examined the ability of peritoneal macrophages to be polarized to the M1 and  phenotypes and determined the specific cytokine profiles of cells with each phenotype. We showed that peritoneal macrophages, as well as bone-marrow-derived macrophages, were differentiated into M1 and  phenotypes following stimulation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13, respectively. Following in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, -polarized peritoneal macrophages predominantly expressed T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and regulatory cytokines, including IL-4, IL-13, transforming growth factor-β and IL-10, whereas M1-polarized peritoneal macrophages expressed negligible amounts of Th1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines. ELISA showed that -polarized peritoneal macrophages produced significantly more IL-10 than M1-polarized peritoneal macrophages. Notably, -polarized peritoneal macrophages contributed more to the suppression of T-cell proliferation than did M1-polarized peritoneal macrophages. The mRNA expression of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, increased in T-cells co-cultured with -polarized macrophages. Hence, our findings showed that  polarization of peritoneal macrophages induced regulatory cytokine production and suppressed T-cell proliferation in vitro, and that resident peritoneal macrophages could be used as a new adoptive transfer therapy for autoimmune/inflammatory diseases after polarization to the regulatory phenotype ex vivo.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391152>LZ205, a newly synthesized flavonoid compound, exerts anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization through regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Macrophage polarization is involved in the process of inflammation.

To investigate metabolism and functionality of two different batches of a probiotic blend commercialized under the same name in Europe in models of intestinal inflammation.  Boxes of VSL#3, a probiotic mixture used in the treatment of pouchitis, were obtained from pharmacies in UK subjected to metabolomic analysis and their functionality tested in mice rendered  by treatment with DSS or TNBS.  VSL#3-A (lot DM538), but not VSL#3-B (lot 507132), attenuated "clinical" signs of  in the DSS and TNBS models. In both models, VSL#3-A, but not VSL#3-B, reduced macroscopic scores, intestinal permeability, and expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNAs, while increased the expression of TGFβ and IL-10, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNAs and shifted colonic macrophages from a M1 to  phenotype ( < 0.05 vs. TNBS). In contrast, VSL#3-B failed to reduce inflammation, and worsened intestinal permeability in the DSS model ( < 0.001 vs. VSL#3-A). A metabolomic analysis of the two formulations allowed the identification of two specific patterns, with at least three-folds enrichment in the concentrations of four metabolites, including 1-3 dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an intermediate in the fructose metabolism, in VSL#3-B supernatants. Feeding mice with DHA, increased intestinal permeability.  Two batches of a commercially available probiotic show divergent metabolic activities.

Loss of plasma FXIII-A has been reported after surgery, sepsis, and inflammatory conditions. In the intestinal mucosa, FXIII-A is expressed by macrophages and cellular FXIII-A has been associated with phagocytosis and migration of macrophages. The objective was to evaluate the consequences of intestinal inflammation on resident mucosal macrophages, focusing on the level and distribution of FXIII-A.Plasma and colonic biopsies were collected from 67 patients with ulcerative  and controls. Intestinal samples were stained using immunohistochemistry for FXIII-A and macrophages (CD68, CD163 and iNOS). In situ hybridization were used to assess the intestinal expression of FXIII-A. FXIII-A antigen and activity levels were measured in plasma.Increased infiltration of CD68 positive macrophages in the inflamed mucosa coincided with increased extracellular deposited FXIII-A and decreased expression and intracellular protein levels of FXIII-A. A decreased proportion of FXIII-A/CD68/CD163 triple-positive macrophages was observed in inflamed mucosa, indicating a reduction of the  phenotype with consequent loss of FXIII-A. No induction of iNOS positive macrophages was observed. Stimulation of naïve monocytes with physiological concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators negatively affected the expression of FXIII-A. Measurements in plasma confirmed the loss of both FXIII antigen and activity during active disease.Intestinal inflammation in UC induces loss of  macrophages with subsequent loss of FXIII-A synthesis. The loss of cellular FXIII-A may impact migration and phagocytosis, and hence limit pathogen eradication in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815859>Lactobacillus plantarum CLP-0611 ameliorates  in mice by polarizing M1 to -like macrophages.</a></h2><p>The TNF-α expression-inhibitory effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from kimchi were measured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages.

Alternative activated macrophages () as well as T cells, a target for immunomodulation by the helminth parasite, play a critical role in initiating and modulating the host immune response to parasite. The precise mechanism by which helminths modulate host immune response is not fully understood. To determine the functions of parasite-induced  macrophages, we compared the effects of M1 and  macrophages obtained from Trichinella spiralis-infected mice with those of T. spiralis excretory/secretory (ES) protein-treated macrophages on experimental intestinal inflammation and allergic airway inflammation. T. spiralis infection induced  macrophage polarization by increasing the expression of CD206, ARG1, and Fizz2. In a single application, we introduced macrophages obtained from T. spiralis-infected mice and T. spiralis ES protein-treated macrophages into mice tail veins before the induction of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , ovalbumin (OVA)-alum sensitization, and OVA challenge.  severity was assessed by determining the severity of  symptoms, colon length, histopathologic parameters, and Th1-related inflammatory cytokine levels. Compared with the DSS- group, T. spiralis-infected mice and T. spiralis ES protein-treated macrophages showed significantly lower disease activity index (DAI) at sacrifice and smaller reductions of body weight and proinflammatory cytokine level. The severity of allergic airway inflammation was assessed by determining the severity of symptoms of inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), differential cell counts, histopathologic parameters, and levels of Th2-related inflammatory cytokines. Severe allergic airway inflammation was induced after OVA-alum sensitization and OVA challenge, which significantly increased Th2-related cytokine levels, eosinophil infiltration, and goblet cell hyperplasia in the lung. However, these severe allergic symptoms were significantly decreased in T. spiralis-infected mice and T. spiralis ES protein-treated macrophages.

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a representative DAMP, and has been shown to transmit signals through receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs) and TLRs, including TLR2 and TLR4. HMGB1 does not, however, bind to TLRs with high affinity; therefore, the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated TLR activation remains unclear. In this study, we found that fluorescently labeled HMGB1 was efficiently internalized into macrophages through class A scavenger receptors. Although both M1- and -type macrophages internalized HMGB1, only M1-type macrophages secreted cytokines in response to HMGB1. The pan-class A scavenger receptor competitive inhibitor, maleylated bovine serum albumin (M-BSA), inhibited HMGB1 internalization and reduced cytokine production from macrophages in response to HMGB1 but not to LPS. The C-terminal acidic domain of HMGB1 is responsible for scavenger receptor-mediated internalization and cytokine production. HMGB1 and TLR4 co-localized in macrophages, and this interaction was disrupted by M-BSA, suggesting that class A scavenger receptors function as co-receptors of HMGB1 for TLR activation. M-BSA ameliorated LPS-induced sepsis and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  models in which HMGB1 has been shown to play progressive roles. These data suggest that scavenger receptors function as co-receptors along with TLRs for HMGB1 in M1-type inflammatory macrophages.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2017. All rights reserved.

In contrast, the colonic level of NBT was about 20-fold lower than the total colonic level of three metabolites. Cell culture studies demonstrated that the colonic metabolites of NBT significantly inhibited the growth of human colon cancer cells, caused cell-cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and profoundly modulated signaling proteins related with cell proliferation and cell death.

Hence, using normal weight subjects as the reference, adjusted HRs for risk of developing CD (at age 18-<40 years) were 1.8(95%CI, 0.9-3.7) for underweight, 0.6(0.3-1.2) for overweight, and 1.5(0.8-2.7) for obese individuals (pre-pregnancy BMI).

Splines for CD risk according to waist:height ratio confirmed a U-shaped relationship with CD occurring <40 years, and a linear relationship with CD diagnosed at age 40+. There was no relationship between BMI and risk of UC.For the first time, we demonstrate that both high BMI and low BMI are risk factors for CD. Underweight may be a pre-clinical manifestation of disease being present many years before onset with obesity being a true risk factor. This raises the question as to whether there may be two distinct forms of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26241646>Deficiency of Nuclear Receptor Nur77 Aggravates Mouse Experimental  by Increased NFκB Activity in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Nuclear receptor Nur77, also referred to as NR4A1 or TR3, plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. Nur77 is crucial in regulating the T helper 1/regulatory T-cell balance, is expressed in macrophages and drives  macrophage polarization. In this study we aimed to define the function of Nur77 in inflammatory bowel disease. In wild-type and Nur77-/- mice,  development was studied in dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced models. To understand the underlying mechanism, Nur77 was overexpressed in macrophages and gut epithelial cells. Nur77 protein is expressed in colon tissues from Crohn's disease and Ulcerative  patients and colons from colitic mice in inflammatory cells and epithelium. In both mouse  models inflammation was increased in Nur77-/- mice. A higher neutrophil influx and enhanced IL-6, MCP-1 and KC production was observed in Nur77-deficient colons after DSS-treatment. TNBS-induced influx of T-cells and inflammatory monocytes into the colon was higher in Nur77-/- mice, along with increased expression of MCP-1, TNFα and IL-6, and decreased Foxp3 RNA expression, compared to wild-type mice. Overexpression of Nur77 in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW macrophages resulted in up-regulated IL-10 and downregulated TNFα, MIF-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression through NFκB repression. Nur77 also strongly decreased expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, IL-8, MIP-1α and TNFα in gut epithelial Caco-2 cells. Nur77 overexpression suppresses the inflammatory status of both macrophages and gut epithelial cells and together with the in vivo mouse data this supports that Nur77 has a protective function in experimental . These findings may have implications for development of novel targeted treatment strategies regarding inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30045418>Development of a screening tool to detect nutrition risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition is a known complication of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). We assessed a known screening tool, as well as developed and validated a novel screening tool, to detect nutrition risk in outpatients with IBD.The Saskatchewan IBD-Nutrition Risk (SaskIBD-NR Tool) was developed and administered alongside the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). Nutrition risk was confirmed by the IBD dietitian (RD) and gastroenterologist (GI). Agreement between screening tools and RD/GI assessment was computed using Cohen's kappa.Of the 110 patients screened, 75 (68.2%) patients had Crohn's Disease and 35 (31.8%) ulcerative . Mean BMI was 26.4 kg/ (SD=5.8). RD/GI assessment identified 23 patients (20.9%) at nutrition risk. The SaskIBD-NR tool classified 21 (19.1%) at some nutrition risk, while MUST classified 17 (15.5%). The SaskIBD-NR tool had significant agreement with the RD/GI assessment (k 0.83, p<0.001), while MUST showed a lack of agreement (k 0.15, p=0.12). The SaskIBD-NR had better sensitivity (82.6% vs 26.1%), specificity (97.7% vs 87.4%), positive predictive value (90.5% vs 35.3%), and negative predictive value (95.5% vs 81.7%) than the MUST.The SaskIBD-NR, which assesses GI symptoms, food restriction, and weight loss, adequately detects nutrition risk in IBD patients.

Anti-TNF induced macrophages [Mϕind] have immunosuppressive and wound healing properties. The factors that contribute to the induction of Mϕind remain to be explored. Autophagy has been described as a factor that is important for the induction and function of  type macrophages. We studied the contribution of autophagy to the induction of Mϕind.We studied the effect of autophagy on Mϕind in vitro using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interferon gamma [IFN-γ] induced macrophages [Mφ1] were generated by culturing monocytes in the presence of IFN-γ. Mϕind were generated by performing mixed lymphocyte reactions [MLR] in the presence of anti-TNF antibodies; 28 healthy donors were genotyped for rs_2241880 [ATG16L1]. Cells were analysed by autophagy gene array, immunofluorescence, western blot, flowcytometry, 3H-thymidine incorporation and MTS assay.Mϕind had a different expression profile of autophagy related transcripts with increased expression of 33/40 altered genes compared with Mφ1. In addition, autophagic activity was increased in Mϕind compared with Mφ1. Induction of Mϕind was positively correlated to the number of wild-type alleles for the ATG16L1 T300A risk allele present in the culture. Finally, the autophagy-related protein cathepsin S was highly expressed in Mφind and inhibition resulted in decreased viability as well as decreased expression of CD206.Mϕind have increased levels of autophagy compared with inflammatory Mφ1, and the induction of these macrophages is impaired in donors carrying the T300A risk allele for the ATG16L1. Given the association between Mϕind and clinical response, this suggests that an intact autophagy pathway may be important for an optimal response to anti-TNF therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2015 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

However, the role of macrophage ODC in colonic epithelial-driven inflammation is unknown. Here, we investigate cell-specific effects of ODC in  and -associated carcinogenesis (CAC). Human colonic macrophages expressed increased ODC levels in active ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, -associated dysplasia, and CAC. Mice lacking  in myeloid cells ( mice) that were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) exhibited improved survival, body weight, and colon length and reduced histologic injury versus control mice. In contrast, GI epithelial-specific  knockout had no effect on clinical parameters. Despite reduced histologic damage,  tissues of  mice had increased levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and enhanced expression of M1, but not  markers. In the azoxymethane-DSS model of CAC,  mice had reduced tumor number, burden, and high-grade dysplasia. Tumors from  mice had increased M1, but not  macrophages. Increased levels of histone 3, lysine 9 acetylation, a marker of open chromatin, were manifest in tumor macrophages of  mice, consistent with our findings that macrophage ODC affects histone modifications that upregulate M1 gene transcription during GI infections. These findings support the concept that macrophage ODC augments epithelial injury-associated  and CAC by impairing the M1 responses that stimulate epithelial repair, antimicrobial defense, and antitumoral immunity. They also suggest that macrophage ODC is an important target for colon cancer chemoprevention. Ornithine decarboxylase contributes to the pathogenesis of  and associated carcinogenesis by impairing M1 macrophage responses needed for antitumoral immunity; targeting ODC in macrophages may represent a new strategy for chemoprevention. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589026>Single port laparoscopic surgery for patients with complex and recurrent Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Single port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) is a modified access technique allowing grouping of instruments at a single parietal site. It is intuitively appealing specifically for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as its minimal invasiveness favors cosmesis and facilitates any future (re)operation.Consecutive patients presenting either electively or urgently for resectional surgery for CD over a 36 month period were considered for SPLS using, by preference, a transumbilical 'Surgical Glove Port'. Standard, straight laparoscopic instrumentation was used without additional resources.Of 33 consecutive, unselected patients, 28 (92%) had their procedure initiated by SPLS including those needing urgent intervention (n=15) and those with prior abdominal operation (n=8), obstruction (n=7), mass (n=6), fistula (n=6) and/or abscess (n=4). The median (range) age and BMI of the patients were 31 (17-69) years and 21.3 (18.6-28) kg/ respectively. 31 had ileocolonic resection (6 with recurrent disease) while two underwent segmental colectomy. No-one suffered intraoperative or anastomotic complication. Both conversion (15%) and postoperative complication (13 Clavian-Dindo complications - I: 8; II: 2; IIIa: 3) rates were predominantly reflective of patient and disease complexity. Median (range) postoperative day of discharge was 6 (3-33) overall and 5 (3-18) in those completed by SPLS. There was one early readmission (for infectiouscolitis) and median follow-up is now 21 months.Complex and recurrent Crohn's resections can be performed by SPLS in the majority of patients presenting elective or urgently for surgery. The Surgical Glove Port performs capably and, by minimizing cost, can facilitate broad embrace of this approach.Copyright © 2014 European Crohn's and  Organisation. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Triptolide exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colon tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 4T1 cells and -polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the  phenotype and abolished  macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of  markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of -polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity. Our findings provide important information for the potential clinical application of triptolide in cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28614718>SIRT5 Desuccinylates and Activates Pyruvate Kinase  to Block Macrophage IL-1β Production and to Prevent DSS-Induced  in Mice.</a></h2><p>LPS-activated macrophages undergo a metabolic shift from dependence on mitochondria-produced ATP to reliance on aerobic glycolysis, where PKM2 is a critical determinant. Here, we show that PKM2 is a physiological substrate of SIRT5 and that SIRT5-regulated hypersuccinylation inhibits the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2 by promoting its tetramer-to-dimer transition. Moreover, a succinylation-mimetic PKM2 K311E mutation promotes nuclear accumulation and increases protein kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that SIRT5-dependent succinylation promotes PKM2 entry into nucleus, where a complex of PKM2-HIF1α is formed at the promoter of IL-1β gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Activation of PKM2 using TEPP-46 attenuates Sirt5-deficiency-mediated IL-1β upregulation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Finally, we find that Sirt5-deficient mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced , which is associated with Sirt5 deficiency prompted PKM2 hypersuccinylation and boosted IL-1β production. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism by which SIRT5 suppresses the pro-inflammatory response in macrophages at least in part by regulating PKM2 succinylation, activity, and function.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The Wnt signaling pathway mediates mucosal repair and  macrophages that coordinate efficient healing have been related to Wnt ligand expression. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) mediates  polarization in vitro and we hypothesize that a STAT6-dependent macrophage phenotype mediates mucosal repair in acute murine  by activating the Wnt signaling pathway. Our results reveal an impaired mucosal expression of  macrophage-associated genes and delayed wound healing in STAT6(-/-) mice treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). These mice also exhibited decreased mucosal expression of Wnt2b, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a, diminished protein levels of nuclear β-catenin that is mainly located in crypts adjacent to damage, and reduced mRNA expression of two Wnt/β-catenin target molecules Lgr5 and c-Myc when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Murine peritoneal macrophages treated with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and polarized toward an M2a phenotype overexpressed Wnt2b, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a in a STAT6-dependent manner. Administration of a Wnt agonist as well as transfer of properly polarized M2a macrophages to STAT6(-/-) mice activated the Wnt signaling pathway in the damaged mucosa and accelerated wound healing. Our results demonstrate that a STAT6-dependent macrophage phenotype promotes mucosal repair in TNBS-treated mice through activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30047999>Increased M1 macrophages in young miR-15a/16 mice with tumour grafts or dextran sulphate sodium-induced .</a></h2><p>M1 macrophages are involved in inflammation by producing proinflammatory cytokines, whereas  macrophages are associated with wound healing and tissue regeneration by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines. MicroRNAs are involved in macrophage polarization. To evaluate whether miR-15a/16 is involved in macrophage polarization under tumour or inflammation microenvironments, we observed the growth of transplanted hepatic cancer (H22) cells or severity of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  in 8-week-old miR-15a/16 knockout (KO) mice. Compared with littermate controls, the miR-15a/16 mice exhibited retarded tumour growth and increased sensibility to DSS-induced . Meanwhile, the M1 cell frequencies were higher in tumour tissues and inflamed colons of KO mice than of littermate controls. Macrophages with miR-15a/16 deletion revealed an enhanced NF-κB transcription under the physiological state and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) stimulation. STAT3 expression was also significantly increased in miR-15a/16 macrophages under LPS or HMGB1 stimulation. The polarization of M1 macrophages can be associated with the coactivation of NF-κB and STAT3. Results indicated that miR-15a/16 deficiency in the macrophages directs M1 polarization for tumour suppression and proinflammation. Thus, miR-15a/16 deletion in macrophages holds a distinct biological significance from that of the microRNA deficiency in tumour cells.© 2018 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23545299>Hookworm excretory/secretory products induce interleukin-4 (IL-4)+ IL-10+ CD4+ T cell responses and suppress pathology in a mouse model of .</a></h2><p>Evidence from human studies and mouse models shows that infection with parasitic helminths has a suppressive effect on the pathogenesis of some inflammatory diseases. Recently, we and others have shown that some of the suppressive effects of hookworms reside in their excretory/secretory (ES) products. Here, we demonstrate that ES products of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum (AcES) suppress intestinal pathology in a model of chemically induced . This suppression was associated with potent induction of a type 2 cytokine response characterized by coexpression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 by CD4(+) T cells, downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression in the draining lymph nodes and the colon, and recruitment of alternatively activated () macrophages and eosinophils to the site of ES administration. Protease digestion and heat denaturation of AcES resulted in impaired induction of CD4(+) IL-4(+) IL-10(+) cell responses and diminished ability to suppress , indicating that protein component(s) are responsible for some of the immunosuppressive effects of AcES.

Fecal  isoform of pyruvate kinase (-PK) and fecal calprotectin (FC) are noninvasive markers of mucosal inflammation in IBD. The aim of this study was to compare performance of -PK and FC in assessment of pediatric ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) severity and activity.121 patients with IBD, including 75 with UC and 46 with CD were recruited. Control group consisted of 35 healthy children (HS). Patients were assigned to groups depending on disease severity and activity. -PK and calprotectin concentration were determined in stool samples using ELISA. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for FC and -PK with cut-off level at which -PK specificity was matching FC specificity were calculated and compared.Performance of -PK at identifying patients with IBD, UC and CD among HS was inferior to FC. The differences in AUC were respectively: -0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.13-(-0.06)], p<0.0001), -0.14 (95% CI [-0.19-(-0.09)], p<0.0001) and -0.03 (95% CI [-0.05-(-0.001)], p<0.02). -PK was inferior to FC in discriminating patients with mild UC from those with HS (AUC difference -0.23, 95% CI [-0.31-(-0.15)], p<0.0001).FC reflects pediatric IBD severity and activity better than -PK.

Macrophages promote  and -associated CRC. M1 macrophages contribute to  directly through the production of proinflammatory cytokines and through activation of proinflammatory immune cell phenotypes. In cancer, both M1 and  macrophages participate in tumor development and progression through cytokine production, changes in cell signaling and activation of T cells. We have identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) as a regulator of macrophages during -associated CRC (CAC). MK2 is a proinflammatory kinase that promotes production of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. MK2 mice have decreases in macrophages, macrophage-associated chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines. Most significantly, MK2 mice do not develop neoplasms in an inflammatory model of CRC. However, addition of MK2 macrophages to MK2 mice increases production of proinflammatory cytokines. In wild type mice, both cytokines and tumor burdens increase upon addition of additional macrophages. These data support the importance of MK2 in macrophage regulation during inflammation-associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30540970>1,25‑Dihydroxyvitamin D regulates macrophage polarization and ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease by suppressing miR-125b.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are highly plastic cells. Depending on stimulation, macrophages rapidly polarize to functionally distinct phenotypes that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 1,25‑Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) has immunomodulatory activity, and 1,25(OH)D deficiency is correlated with autoimmune diseases, especially IBD. This study aimed to explore whether 1,25(OH)D modulates macrophage polarization in inflammation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and  mice were treated with 1,25(OH)D. Macrophages were transfected with siRNA-vitamin D receptor (VDR) or miR-125b mimic or inhibitor, and 1,25(OH)D-pretreated  mice were injected with a miR-125b agomir. The distribution of macrophage subsets and macrophage subtype characteristics was analyzed. As expected, 1,25(OH)D transformed lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 macrophages to the  subset, downregulated tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-6 expression and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) phosphorylation, and upregulated IL-10, arginase-1, VDR, and IRF4 expression. SiRNA-VDR and miR-125b mimic significantly impaired 1,25(OH)D activity. In  mice, 1,25(OH)D pretreatment ameliorated disease activity, converted M1 macrophages to the  subtype, suppressed IRF5 phosphorylation, and increased IRF4 expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC). miR-125b agomir injections reversed 1,25(OH)D action. Collectively, the results demonstrate that 1,25(OH)D downregulates miR-125b expression and promotes M1 macrophage polarization to the  subtype. 1,25(OH)D pretreatment ameliorated  by restoring the LPMC macrophage subtype balance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Regarding the timing of administration, early (day 3) injection significantly ameliorated DSS-induced  in terms of both DAI and histological score, compared to those parameters with delayed (day 11) injection. With early cell injection, the tissue mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes (Il10, Tgfb) increased, whereas those of inflammatory cytokine genes (Il6, Tnfa and Il17a) decreased significantly. Regarding the associated mechanism, hAdMSCs suppressed T cell proliferation and activation in vitro, increased the number of regulatory T cells in vivo and changed the polarity of macrophages (into the anti-inflammatory  phenotype) in vitro.

In our preliminary study, arctigenin inhibited IKKβ and NF-κB activation in peptidoglycan (PGN)- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced peritoneal macrophages. To understand the anti-inflammatory effect of arctigenin, we investigated its anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages and on LPS-induced systemic inflammation as well as 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  in mice. Arctigenin inhibited LPS-increased IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α expression in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, but increased LPS-reduced IL-10 and CD204 expression. Arctigenin inhibited LPS-induced PI3K, AKT and IKKβ phosphorylation, but did not suppress LPS-induced IRAK-1 phosphorylation. However, arctigenin did not inhibit NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated PI3K siRNA-treated peritoneal macrophages. Arctigenin suppressed the binding of p-PI3K antibody and the nucleus translocation of NF-κB p65 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Arctigenin suppressed blood IL-1β and TNF-α level in mice systemically inflamed by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Arctigenin also inhibited colon shortening, macroscopic scores and myeloperoxidase activity in TNBS-induced colitic mice.

Previous studies have demonstrated that taheebo water extract (TWE) derived from Tabebuia avellanedae Lorentz ex Griseb., as folk remedy, has been used to treat various inflammatory diseases. Although TWE has been previously shown to display anti-inflammatory activities, the in vivo effects of TWE on mucosal immune responses remain unclear.We examined the anti-inflammatory effects of TWE on innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages and also on the differentiation of T helper cells. Lastly, adopting a method for dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , we investigated whether the oral administration of TWE can modulate mucosal inflammatory responses.We found that TWE could activate DCs to produce immunosuppressive IL10 and polarize macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN).

Similar functional changes occurred during peritoneal metastasis in M1 macrophages without changed polarization.These results suggested that peritoneal  macrophages played a critical role in ulcerative -associated carcinogenesis, including unbalanced pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory axis and enhanced expression of migration/invasion-associated factors. Furthermore, functional changes of M1 macrophages occurred without changed polarization during carcinogenesis and metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937198>A Case of Syrian Child with Cerebral Infarction as an Extraintestinal Manifestation of Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Thromboembolic complications are rare but well-recognized manifestation of ulcerative , especially because of their associated high mortality.

It improves  outcomes in the clinical setting, but the mechanism underlying its function yet to be uncovered. We investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of cinobufacini on  using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  mouse model, mainly focusing on the impact of macrophage polarization. Our results showed that cinobufacini dramatically ameliorated DSS-induced  in mice. Cinobufacini treatment reduced the infiltration of activated F4/80 and/or CD68 macrophages into the colon in DSS-induced  mice. More importantly, cinobufacini significantly decreased the quantity of M1 macrophages and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor , and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Cinobufacini also increased the population of  macrophages and the expression of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-10 and arginase-1 in DSS-induced  mice. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that cinobufacini inhibited M1 macrophage polarization in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Mechanistically, our in vivo and in vitro results showed that cinobufacini inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization may be associated with the suppression of nuclear factor B activation. Our study suggests that cinobufacini could ameliorate DSS-induced  in mice by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202097>Loss of solute carrier family 7 member 2 exacerbates inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Solute carrier family 7 member 2 (SLC7A2, also known as CAT2) is an inducible transporter of the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg), which has been implicated in wound repair. We have reported that both SLC7A2 expression and L-Arg availability are decreased in colonic tissues from inflammatory bowel disease patients and that mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibit a more severe disease course when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Here, we present evidence that SLC7A2 plays a role in modulating colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of -associated carcinogenesis (CAC). SLC7A2 was localized predominantly to colonic epithelial cells in WT mice. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, Slc7a2 mice had significantly increased tumor number, burden, and risk of high-grade dysplasia vs. WT mice. Tumors from Slc7a2 mice exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-1β, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-3, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but decreased levels of IL-4, CXCL9, and CXCL10 compared to tumors from WT mice. This was accompanied by a shift toward pro-tumorigenic  macrophage activation in Slc7a2-deficient mice, as marked by increased colonic CD11bF4/80ARG1 cells with no alteration in CD11bF4/80NOS2 cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The shift toward  macrophage activation was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Slc7a2 mice. In bone marrow chimeras between Slc7a2 and WT mice, the recipient genotype drove the CAC phenotype, suggesting the importance of epithelial SLC7A2 in abrogating neoplastic risk. These data reveal that SLC7A2 has a significant role in the protection from CAC in the setting of chronic , and suggest that the decreased SLC7A2 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may contribute to CAC risk. Strategies to enhance L-Arg availability by supplementing L-Arg and/or increasing L-Arg uptake could represent a therapeutic approach in IBD to reduce the substantial long-term risk of colorectal carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856920>Recurrent intestinal obstruction with acquired angio-oedema, due to C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency.</a></h2><p>A 52-year male with past history of ulcerative  20 years back (now in remission), developed recurrent small intestinal obstruction at intervals of a few months.

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not completely understood. We sought to investigate the therapeutic effects of human adipose tissue-derived (hAT)-MSCs in an IBD mouse model and to explore the mechanisms of the regulation of inflammation. Dextran sulfate sodium-induced  mice were infused with hAT-MSCs intraperitoneally and colon tissues were collected on day 10. hAT-MSCs were shown to induce the expression of  macrophage markers and to regulate the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the colon. Quantitative real time-PCR analyses demonstrated that less than 20 hAT-MSCs, 0.001% of all intraperitoneally injected hAT-MSCs, were detected in the inflamed colon. To investigate the effects of hAT-MSC-secreted factors in vitro, transwell co-culture system was used, demonstrating that tumour necrosis factor-α-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) released by hAT-MSCs induces  macrophages. In vivo, hAT-MSCs transfected with TSG-6 small interfering RNA, administered intraperitoneally, were not able to induce  macrophage phenotype switch in the inflamed colon and had no significant effects on IBD severity.

Its major constituent kakkalide is metabolized to irisolidone by gut microbiota. This research study was undertaken to understand the anti- mechanism of kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro and in vivo. Kakkalide and its metabolite irisolidone inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression in macrophages. They also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of IRAK1 and TAK1 and activation of NF-κB by inhibiting the binding of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated LPS in vitro. Orally administered irisolidone or kakkalide alleviated colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced . Their treatments also protected epithelial cell disruption and infiltration of CD11b/CD11c cells in the colon. Furthermore, they suppressed TNBS-induced expression of M1 macrophage markers TNF-α, CD80, CD86, and Arg2 expression while the expression of  macrophage markers Arg1, CD163, CD206, and IL-10 was induced. They also suppressed the fecal Proteobacteria population. Overall, the anti-colitic effects of irisolidone were superior to those of kakkalide.

Studies have focused on the role of EGFR signaling in epithelial cells, although the exact nature of the role of EGFR in colorectal carcinogenesis remains a topic of debate. Here, we present evidence that EGFR signaling in myeloid cells, specifically macrophages, is critical for colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate (AOM-DSS) model of -associated carcinogenesis (CAC). In a human tissue microarray, colonic macrophages demonstrated robust EGFR activation in the pre-cancerous stages of  and dysplasia. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of Egfr had significantly decreased tumor multiplicity and burden, protection from high-grade dysplasia and significantly reduced . Intriguingly, mice with gastrointestinal epithelial cell-specific Egfr deletion demonstrated no differences in tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS model. The alterations in tumorigenesis in myeloid-specific Egfr knockout mice were accompanied by decreased macrophage, neutrophil and T-cell infiltration. Pro-tumorigenic  macrophage activation was diminished in myeloid-specific Egfr-deficient mice, as marked by decreased Arg1 and Il10 mRNA expression and decreased interleukin (IL)-4, IL10 and IL-13 protein levels. Surprisingly, diminished M1 macrophage activation was also detectable, as marked by significantly reduced Nos2 and Il1b mRNA levels and decreased interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β protein levels. The alterations in M1 and  macrophage activation were confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice with the myeloid-specific Egfr knockout. The combined effect of restrained M1 and  macrophage activation resulted in decreased production of pro-angiogenic factors, CXCL1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and reduced CD31 blood vessels, which likely contributed to protection from tumorigenesis. These data reveal that EGFR signaling in macrophages, but not in colonic epithelial cells, has a significant role in CAC. EGFR signaling in macrophages may prove to be an effective biomarker of CAC or target for chemoprevention in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202619>Exopolysaccharide from  Induces Anti-Inflammatory  Macrophages That Prevent T Cell-Mediated Disease.</a></h2><p>Commensal bacteria contribute to immune homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the underlying mechanisms for this are not well understood.

Thus, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of ketanserin in  and the possible underlying mechanisms. The expression of 5-HT2AR was assessed in the colon tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced . The therapeutic potential of ketanserin was investigated in the mice with . In the colon tissue samples from the patients with IBD, a high expression level of 5-HT2AR was observed. Treatment with ketanserin attenuated the progression of experimental  in the mice, as indicated by body weight assessment, colon length, histological scores and cytokine release. The colonic macrophages from the ketanserin-treated mice with  exhibited a decreased production of inflammatory cytokines, with  polarization and impaired migration. The knockdown of 5-HT2AR using siRNA partly abolished the inhibitory effects of ketanserin on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMDMs), thus demonstrating that the inhibitory effects of ketanserin on the production of inflammatory cytokines are partly dependent on 5-HT2AR. Ketanserin also inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in BMDMs. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrate that ketanserin alleviates .

Previous studies suggested two inflammatory conditions in UC-patients: 'acute' and 'remodeling' and that the design of a disease network might improve the understanding of the inflammatory processes. The objective of the study was to design and validate a disease network in the NOD-SCID IL2rγ (NSG)-UC mouse model to get a better understanding of the inflammatory processes.Leukocytes were isolated from the spleen of NSG-UC mice and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. RT-PCR and RNAseq analysis were performed from distal parts of the colon. Based on these analyses and the effects of interleukins, chemokines and growth factors described in the literature, a disease network was designed. To validate the disease network the effect of infliximab and pitrakinra was tested in the NSG-UC model. A clinical- and histological score, frequencies of human leukocytes isolated from spleen and mRNA expression levels from distal parts of the colon were determined.Analysis of leukocytes isolated from the spleen of challenged NSG-UC mice corroborated CD64, CD163 and CD1a expressing CD14+ monocytes, CD1a expressing CD11b+ macrophages and HGF, TARC, IFNγ and TGFß1 mRNA as inflammatory markers. The disease network suggested that a proinflammatory condition elicited by IL-17c and lipids and relayed by cytotoxic T-cells, Th17 cells and CD1a expressing macrophages and monocytes. Conversely, the remodeling condition was evoked by IL-34 and TARC and promoted by Th2 cells and  monocytes. Mice benefitted from treatment with infliximab as indicated by the histological- and clinical score. As predicted by the disease network infliximab reduced the proinflammatory response by suppressing M1 monocytes and CD1a expressing monocytes and macrophages and decreased levels of IFNγ, TARC and HGF mRNA. As predicted by the disease network inflammation aggravated in the presence of pitrakinra as indicated by the clinical and histological score, elevated frequencies of CD1a expressing macrophages and TNFα and IFNγ mRNA levels.The combination of the disease network and the NSG-UC animal model might be developed into a powerful tool to predict efficacy or in-efficacy and potential mechanistic side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21278694>The diameter of the ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis as an important risk factor of pouchitis - clinical observations.</a></h2><p>Patients' quality of life after restorative proctocolectomy depends on the potential complications.

We focused here on the effects of guggulsterone on macrophage modulation in  as a potential therapeutic molecule in human IBD and explore the underlying mechanisms. Gene expression in macrophages was examined and wound-healing assay using HT-29 cells was performed.  in wild-type and IL-10-, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-, and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-deficient mice was induced via the administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) into the colon. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, guggulsterone suppressed intestinal inflammation amplified by TREM-1 stimulation, in which the suppression of NF-κB, activating protein-1, and proteasome pathways was involved. In the TNBS-induced  model, guggulsterone reduced disease activity index scores and TREM-1 expression, stimulated IL-10 production, and improved survival in wild-type mice. These effects were not observed in IL-10-, TLR4-, and MyD88-deficient mice. Guggulsterone also suppressed M1 polarization, yet induced the  phenotype in macrophages from IBD patients as well as from mice. These findings indicate that guggulsterone blocks the hyperactivation of macrophages via TREM-1 suppression and induces  polarization via IL-10 mediated by the TLR4 signaling pathway. Furthermore, this study provides a new rationale for the therapeutic potential of guggulsterone in the treatment of IBD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that guggulsterone attenuates triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1)-mediated hyperactivation of macrophages and polarizes macrophages toward the  phenotype. This was mediated by IL-10 and partly Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways. Overall, these data support that guggulsterone as a natural plant sterol modulates macrophage phenotypes in , which may be of novel therapeutic importance in inflammatory bowel disease treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25254662>Interleukin-17 induces an atypical -like macrophage subpopulation that regulates intestinal inflammation.</a></h2><p>Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts on both immune and non-immune cells and is generally implicated in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although IL-17 as well as their source, mainly but not limited to Th17 cells, is also abundant in the inflamed intestine, the role of IL-17 in inflammatory bowel disease remains controversial. In the present study, by using IL-17 knockout (KO) mice, we investigated the role of IL-17 in , with special focus on the macrophage subpopulations. Here we show that IL-17KO mice had increased susceptibility to DSS-induced  which was associated with decrease in expression of mRNAs implicated in  and/or wound healing macrophages, such as IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, arginase 1, cyclooxygenase 2, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Lamina propria leukocytes from inflamed colon of IL-17KO mice contained fewer CD11b+Ly6C+MHC Class II+ macrophages, which were derived, at least partly, from blood monocytes, as compared to those of WT mice.

To evaluate the inflammatory effect of G-101, we examined its inhibitory effect in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitic mice.The colitic mice were prepared by intrarectal injection of TNBS. We measured intestinal mucosal cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; activation of transcription factors, by immunoblotting; and macrophage polarization markers, by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of 200 LAB strains tested, Lact. brevis G-101 showed most potent activity for induction of IL-10 expression in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. However, it significantly inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and the phosphorylation of IRAK1 and AKT, and activated NF-κB and MAPKs. Treatment with TNBS caused colon shortening; increased myeloperoxidase activity; and increased IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α expression in mice. Oral administration of Lact. brevis G-101 significantly inhibited these activities. Lactobacillus brevis G-101 inhibited TNBS-induced IRAK-1 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, as well as the expression of COX-2 and iNOS. Lactobacillus brevis G-101 inhibited the expression of M1 macrophage markers, but increased the expression of  macrophages in the colons of TNBS-treated mice.Lactobacillus brevis G-101 may improve  by inhibiting the IRAK1/NF-κB, MAPK and AKT pathways and by polarizing M1 macrophages to -like macrophages.These results suggest that IL-10 expression-inducing LAB can ameliorate  by inhibiting NF-κB activation and macrophage polarization.© 2013 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802726>Naringenin promotes recovery from colonic damage through suppression of epithelial tumor necrosis factor-α production and induction of -type macrophages in colitic mice.</a></h2><p>Our previous study demonstrated that supplemental naringenin reduced the development of  induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in mice, however, the effect of naringenin on the recovery from colonic damage was totally unknown. The primary purpose was to investigate if naringenin promoted recovery from colonic damage in DSS-administered mice and colonic tissues. When mice were fed diets lacking or containing naringenin (0.3%, w/w) for 11 days after  induction through DSS administration, the supplemental naringenin was found to promote a reversal of body weight loss and suppress tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA expression in the DSS-administered mice. Moreover, protein expression of two tight junction proteins, claudin-3 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, was higher in DSS-administered mice that were fed naringenin than in the mice that did not receive naringenin. To examine the early mechanisms underlying the naringenin-mediated reduction of colonic damage, the inflamed colonic tissues of DSS-administered mice were incubated with or without naringenin for 24 hours; in tissues incubated with naringenin, TNF-α production was lower and interleukin (IL)-10 and CD206 mRNA expression was higher than in tissues incubated without naringenin, but naringenin did not affect the expression of the tight junction proteins. Flow cytometry results further demonstrated that naringenin reduced TNF-α-positive epithelial cells, but not macrophages, and promoted the polarization of -type macrophages in the colonic tissues. Thus, supplemental naringenin promoted recovery from colonic damage in mice with , and suppression of epithelial TNF-α production and induction of -type macrophages might represent the early mechanisms underlying this naringenin effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we have reported that IL-33 functions as a protective modulator in TNBS-induced , which is closely related to a Th1-to-Th2/Treg switch. Here, we present novel evidence suggesting that IL-33 primes macrophage into alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) in TNBS-induced . The strong polarized effect of IL-33 was tightly associated with the markedly increased induction of Th2-type cytokines. To confirm the beneficial effects of AAM induced by IL-33, peritoneal AAMs isolated from IL-33-treated mice were transferred to recipient mice with TNBS . The adoptive transfer resulted in prominent inhibition of disease activity and inflammatory cytokines in the TNBS-treated mice. In conclusion, our data provide clear evidence that IL-33 plays a protective role in TNBS-induced , which is closely related to AAM polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29580350>Frailty Predicts Morbidity after Colectomy for Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The rate of ulcerative  (UC), an inflammatory bowel disease, has been on the rise in the United States for the last several decades. Colectomy can be performed when other treatment options cannot provide a reasonable quality of life to patients with UC. Frailty has been shown to be a strong tool for evaluating preoperative risk factors for poor postoperative outcomes. The National Surgical Quality and Improvement Program cross-institutional database was used for this study. Data from 943 patients who underwent colectomy for UC between 2005 and 2012 were evaluated. Modified frailty index (mFI) is a previously described and validated 11-variable frailty measure used in the National Surgical Quality and Improvement Program to assess frailty. Outcome measures included serious morbidity; overall morbidity; cardiopulmonary, septic, and wound complications; and Clavien class IV (requiring ICU) and V (mortality) complications. Median age was 46 years and median body mass index was 25.5 Kg/. In all, 54.3 per cent of patients were male and 39.38 per cent of patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists Class lll or higher. The median mFI was 0 (0-0.54). As the mFI increased from 0 (nonfrail) to 0.18 and above, the overall morbidity increased from 25.40 to 52.1 per cent (P < 0.05), serious morbidity increased from 14.9 to 42.1 per cent (P < 0.05), septic complications increased from 9.87 to 21.49 per cent (P < 0.05), cardiopulmonary complications increased from 2.98 to 23.14 per cent (P < 0.05), Clavien class IV complications increased from 3.5 to 26.5 per cent (P < 0.05), and Clavien V complications increased from 0.16 to 6.61 per cent (P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, mFI was an independent predictor of septic complications [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 31.26; P = 0.006], cardiopulmonary complications (AOR: 216.3; P ≤ 0.001), serious morbidity(AOR: 66.8; P ≤ 0.001), overall morbidity (AOR: 25.5; P ≤ 0.001), Clavien class IV (AOR: 204.9; P ≤ 0.001) complications, and return to the operating room (AOR: 14.29; P = 0.048). Frailty is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality after colectomy in patients with UC. mFI is an easy-to-use tool and can play an important role in the risk stratification of these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21197548>Single-port laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: initial operative experience.</a></h2><p>Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) has been used in urologic, gynecologic, general, and colorectal surgery. We herein report our experience with the use of SPLS for total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (RP/IPAA).All patients who underwent a RP/IPAA using SPLS between June and September 2009 were identified from a prospectively maintained laparoscopic database. All procedures were performed with the use of a 5-mm Olympus EndoEye™ and traditional laparoscopic instruments via a SILS™ port placed at the planned ileostomy site.There were five patients (3 male) included in the study. Median age was 43 years (range=13-47 years). Median body mass index was 20.66 kg/ (range=14.63-25.97 kg/). Diagnoses included ulcerative  (n=4) and familial adenomatous polyposis (n=1). Median ASA score was 2 (range=1-3). Median operative time was 153 min (range=132-278 min). Median estimated blood loss was 100 ml (range=50-200 ml). There were no conversions to either a conventional laparoscopic or an open procedure. Median time to return of bowel function was 2 days. Median length of stay was 4 days (range=3-6 days). Postoperative complications included two patients with partial small-bowel obstructions. Both resolved with conservative management. All patients had their ileostomies closed.RP/IPAA using SPLS is a safe technique. Additional studies are needed to compare SPLS to conventional laparoscopy and open surgery with respect to operative times, convalescence, and outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19300275>Faecal -pyruvate kinase: a novel, noninvasive marker of ileal pouch inflammation.</a></h2><p>Dimeric -pyruvate kinase (dM2-PK) is overexpressed in tumour cells with rapid cell turnover. Its concentrations correlate well with the staging and metastatic capability of the tumour cells. We investigated the use of faecal dM2-PK as a noninvasive marker of pouch inflammation (pouchitis) in patients having undergone restorative proctocolectomy.Stool samples were obtained from 46 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and eight with familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis was defined using the objective pouchitis score (OPS) and the pouch disease activity index. Faecal dM2-PK was measured using a quantitative sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay (ScheBo Biotech UK) and the results compared with reciprocal faecal calprotectin concentrations.Using the OPS, 6 of the 46 patients with UC had pouchitis and prepouch ileitis, 13 had UC pouchitis alone, and 27 had a non-inflamed UC pouch. One patient with familial adenomatous polyposis had pouchitis and prepouch ileitis and 7 had an non inflamed pouch. Respective median dM2-PK values (U/ml) for these five groups were 49.5 (4.5-110), 12 (1-192.3), 2.2 (0.1-95.2), 19.5 and 1 (0.1-3). Statistically significant differences were noted between inflamed and non inflamed pouches (P<0.0001). dM2-PK correlated significantly with the OPS, pouch disease activity index, endoscopic appearances, acute histological and neutrophil scores (<0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 70.6%, respectively. dM2-PK and faecal calprotectin concentrations correlated closely (r=0.87, P<0.0001).This study demonstrates that faecal dM2-PK is a sensitive marker of pouch inflammation and that its concentration directly correlates with the objective markers of pouchitis severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399840>Macrophage uptake and accumulation of folates are polarization-dependent in vitro and in vivo and are regulated by activin A.</a></h2><p>Vitamin B9, commonly known as folate, is an essential cofactor for one-carbon metabolism that enters cells through three major specialized transporter molecules (RFC, FR, and PCFT), which differ in expression pattern, affinity for substrate, and ligand-binding pH dependency. We now report that the expression of the folate transporters differs between macrophage subtypes and explains the higher accumulation of 5-MTHF-the major folate form found in serum-in  macrophages in vitro and in vivo. M1 macrophages display a higher expression of RFC, whereas FRβ and PCFT are preferentially expressed by anti-inflammatory and homeostatic  macrophages. These differences are also seen in macrophages from normal tissues involved in folate transit (placenta, liver, colon) and inflamed tissues (ulcerative , RA), as -like macrophages from normal tissues express FRβ and PCFT, whereas TNF-α-expressing M1 macrophages from inflamed tissues are RFC+. Besides, we provide evidences that activin A is a critical factor controlling the set of folate transporters in macrophages, as it down-regulates FRβ, up-regulates RFC expression, and modulates 5-MTHF uptake. All of these experiments support the notion that folate handling is dependent on the stage of macrophage polarization.© 2014 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29441068>Control of Intestinal Inflammation, -Associated Tumorigenesis, and Macrophage Polarization by Fibrinogen-Like Protein 2.</a></h2><p>Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is critical for immune regulation in the inflammatory state. Elevated Fgl2 levels are observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little is known about its functional significance. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of Fgl2 in the development of intestinal inflammation and -associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Here, we report that Fgl2 deficiency increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced  and CAC in a mouse model. During  development, the expression of the membrane-bound and secreted forms of Fgl2 (mFgl2 and sFgl2, respectively) in the colon were increased and predominantly expressed by colonic macrophages. In addition, using bone marrow chimeric mice, we determined that Fgl2 function in  is strictly related to its expression in the hematopoietic cells. Loss of Fgl2 induced the polarization of M1, but suppressed that of  both  and , independent of intestinal inflammation. Thus, Fgl2 suppresses intestinal inflammation and CAC development through its role in macrophage polarization and may serve as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, including IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21986011>Colonic inflammation increases the contribution of muscarinic  receptors to carbachol-induced contraction of the rat colon.</a></h2><p>Carbachol-induced contraction of the rat colon is impaired in rats with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced . The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of  on the expression and function of muscarinic (M) receptor subtypes in the rat colon.Rats (n = 80) were treated with TNBS and used 5 days later for measurement of contractility, myeloperoxidase activity, histology and expression of muscarinic receptor isoforms using Western blot analysis.Carbachol produced concentration-dependent contractions of colonic segments from control (n = 40) and TNBS-treated (n = 40) rats with no significant difference in potency. However, the maximum response to carbachol was significantly reduced in colon segments of TNBS-treated rats. The selective muscarinic receptor antagonists 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine (4-DAMP, M(3)), pirenzepine (M(1)) and methoctramine (M(2)) antagonized carbachol-induced contraction in control (9.1 ± 0.1, 6.7 ± 0.3 and 6.0 ± 0.1, respectively) and TNBS-treated rats (9.2 ± 0.2, 6.9 ± 0.2, 6.7 ± 0.2). The -logK(B) values in control rats are consistent with an action of carbachol on muscarinic M(3) receptors. There was no significant difference in -logK(B) values for 4-DAMP and pirenzepine in control and TNBS-treated rats, but methoctramine was fivefold more potent in TNBS-treated rats, possibly indicating an increased contribution of muscarinic M(2) receptors to carbachol-induced contraction in the inflamed colon. The expression of M(2) receptors was also significantly increased in colon segments from TNBS-treated rats, confirming the increased role of muscarinic M(2) receptors in the inflamed colon.The data show that while only M(3) receptors appeared to mediate carbachol-induced contraction in control segments, expression of both M(2) and M(3) receptors was increased in the inflamed rat colon.Copyright © 2011 S.

This study examined the anti-inflammatory effects of n-6 docosapentaenoic acid-derived (17S)-hydroxy-docosapentaenoic acid (17-HDPAn-6) and (10,17S)-dihydroxy-docosapentaenoic acid (10,17-HDPAn-6) as well as n-3 docosahexaenoic acid-derived 17(R/S)-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA).The effects of 17-HDPAn-6, 10,17-HDPAn-6 or 17-HDHA on activity and M1/ polarization of murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were examined by phagocytosis assay and real-time PCR. To assess anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)  was induced in mice treated with 17-HDPAn-6, 10,17-HDPAn-6, 17-HDHA or NaCl.Our results show that 17-HDPAn-6, 10,17-HDPAn-6 and 17-HDHA increase phagocytosis in macrophages in vitro and promote polarization towards the anti-inflammatory  phenotype with decreased gene expression of TNF-α and inducible Nitric oxide synthase and increased expression of the chemokine IL-1 receptor antagonist and the Scavenger receptor Type A. Intraperitoneal treatment with 17-HDPAn-6, 10,17-HDPAn-6, or 17-HDHA alleviated DSS- and significantly improved body weight loss, colon epithelial damage, and macrophage infiltration.These results suggest that DPAn-6-derived 17-HDPAn-6 and 10,17-HDPAn-6 as well as the DHA-derived 17-HDHA have inflammation-dampening and resolution-promoting effects that could be used to treat inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21476030>The protective effect of the recombinant 53-kDa protein of Trichinella spiralis on experimental  in mice.</a></h2><p>Helminth infection has been proven to reduce the severity of experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Disease activities and macroscopic and microscopic scores were evaluated. To determine immune response provoked by rTsP53, we measured specific IgG1 and IgG2a values against rTsP53 in sera of mice. We also detected cytokine profiles as well as the markers of alternatively activated macrophages () in mice.RTsP53 ameliorated significantly the disease activity index (DAI) as well as the macroscopic and microscopic scores. IgG1 but not IgG2a was the predominant specific antibody detected in the sera of immunized mice, indicating the potential of stimulating T-helper (Th) 2 bias response by rTsP3. Pre-treatment with rTsP53 decreased serum Th1 cytokines (TNF-a, IFN-γ) and elevated serum levels of serum Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13); it also decreased colonic Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and colonic regulatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β1).

The dimeric -isoform of pyruvate kinase (-PK) has been reported to be elevated in fecal specimens from colorectal cancer (CA) patients, but its role in IBD is unknown. This study investigated the usefulness of fecal -PK in cohorts of patients with IBD, IBS, and CA.Stool samples were obtained for calprotectin and -PK measurements in patients with previously diagnosed IBD or new patients being investigated for lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in a UK university hospital. Other investigations were performed as directed by the investigating physician and patients with known IBD were assessed for disease activity by a physician global assessment, Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), or endoscopic grading.Fecal -PK and calprotectin measurements were obtained for 148 patients: 50 with ulcerative  (UC); 31 with Crohn's disease (CD), 43 with irritable bowel syndrome/functional bowel disorders (IBS); 7 with colorectal CA, and 17 with miscellaneous conditions (excluded from the analysis). Median -PK values (U/mL) were significantly elevated in UC: 20.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.4-69.0, P < 0.0001), CD: 24.3 (95% CI 6.4-44.0, P < 0.0001), and CA: 7.0 (95% CI 4.3-88.0, P < 0.0006) compared to IBS: 0.1 (95% CI 0.0-3.2). There was a strong linear correlation of -PK with calprotectin levels. A predetermined cutoff level of 3.7 U/mL for a normal -PK test produced a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 73%, 74%, and 89%, respectively, for organic disease. Furthermore, -PK levels were significantly elevated in active, compared to inactive, disease for CD (30 versus 0.55 U/mL, P < 0.005) and UC (40 versus 1.2 U/mL, P = 0.006), respectively.Fecal -PK is elevated in IBD as well as in CA patients and is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for organic GI pathology, with a PPV of 89%.

Here, we describe the efficiency of primary antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to specifically target chronic inflammatory processes, specially  macrophages, in tissue sections of ulcerative  (UC) and steatohepatitis in rats which may lead to colorectal cancer and liver carcinoma, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that AuNPs synthesized by a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally compatible method can be easily conjugated with the antibodies anti-COX-2, anti-MIF, and Alexa Fluor® 488 (ALEXA) to perform immunofluorescence staining in inflamed tissues.

We designed three immunofluorescence staining protocols of tissue section with AuNPs for 30 min and overnight incubation, as well as one flow cytometry protocol of  macrophage labeling with AuNPs for 30 min. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry results suggest that conjugation was achieved by direct adsorption of antibodies on the AuNPs surface. When compared to the standard ALEXA protocol in immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry (FC), our 30-min incubation protocol using AuNPs instead of ALEXA decreased from approximately 23 h to 5 h for IF and from 4 h to 1 h for FC, proving to be less laborious, which makes the method eligible for inflammation-induced cancer diagnostic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26856241>Sorting nexin 10 acting as a novel regulator of macrophage polarization mediates inflammatory response in experimental mouse .</a></h2><p>In response to changes in microenvironment, macrophages polarize into functionally distinct phenotypes, playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Recent studies have reported that chronic  increases the risk of ischemic stroke, but it is unknown whether chronic  participates in ischemic brain injury directly. A combined mouse model of chronic  induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and ischemic stroke induced by photochemical infarction was used in this study. We demonstrated that chronic  significantly increased the infarction volume, activated microglia/macrophage numbers, proliferation of M1 microglia/macrophage, non-gut-derived CD4+ T lymphocyte penetration and decreased neuron numbers in the peri-infarction at 7 d after stroke. Furthermore, gut-derived CD4+ T cell accumulation on the meninges was observed at 7 d after stroke. In addition, selective depletion of meningeal macrophages resulted in a reduction of infarction volume and the non-gut-derived CD4+ T lymphocyte penetration. We concluded that chronic  exacerbated ischemic stroke by promoting CD4+ T cell migration from the gut to the meninges and disequilibrium of M1 and  microglia/macrophages. We speculated that the gut-derived CD4+ T cells may interact with meningeal macrophages and result in non-gut-derived CD4+ T lymphocyte infiltration that aggravated brain injury in ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2018.

We investigated the role of the -polarizing p50 NF-κB subunit in orchestrating TAM phenotype, tumor microenvironment composition, and colorectal cancer progression. We first demonstrated, by parallel studies in -associated cancer (CAC) and in genetically driven Apc mouse models, that the p50-dependent inhibition of M1-polarized gut inflammation supported colorectal cancer development. In accordance with these studies, p50 mice displayed exacerbated CAC with fewer and smaller tumors, along with enhanced levels of M1/Th1 cytokines/chemokines, including IL12 and CXCL10, whose administration restrained CAC development  The inflammatory profile supporting tumor resistance in colons from p50 tumor bearers correlated inversely with TAM load and positively with both recruitment of NK, NKT, CD8 T cells and number of apoptotic tumor cells. In agreement, myeloid-specific ablation of p50 promoted tumor resistance in mice, whereas in colorectal cancer patients, a high number of p50 TAMs at the invasive margin was associated with decreased  and  expression and worse postsurgical outcome.

Macrophages are essential in the innate immune response, and contribute to tissue remodeling. Naïve macrophages have two major potential fates: polarization to (1) the classical pro-inflammatory M1 defense response to bacterial pathogens and tumor cells, and (2) the alternatively activated  response, induced in the presence of parasites and wounding, and also implicated in the development of tumor-associated macrophages. ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, leads to an increase in putrescine levels, which impairs M1 gene transcription. Additionally, spermidine and spermine can regulate translation of pro-inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages. In this review, we focus on polyamines in macrophage activation patterns in the context of gastrointestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. We seek to clarify mechanisms of innate immune regulation by polyamine metabolism and potential novel therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28826742>A comprehensive review and update on Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers principally to two major categories of chronic relapsing inflammatory intestinal disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC). In the United States, it is currently estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from IBD, causing considerable suffering, mortality and economic loss every year. Yet the cause of IBD is unknown, and until we understand more, prevention or cure will not be possible. There is a lot of variation in the incidence and prevalence of CD based on geographic region, environment, immigrant population, and ethnic groups. The annual incidence of CD in North America is reported to be 3.1-20.2 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 201 per 100,000 population. Based on the epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, CD is considered to be a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial etiology in which genetics and environment interact to manifest the disease. Several genes have been studied so for with respect to CD, but thus far the strong and replicated associations have been identified with NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genes. The risk factors implicated with CD include smoking, low fiber- high carbohydrate diet, altered microbiome and medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CD is typically characterized by transmural inflammation of the intestine and could affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to perianal area. In terms of distribution of the disease 25% of the patients have  only, 25% is ileitis only and 50% have ileocolitis. The Montreal classification is based on the age at diagnosis (<16, 17-40, > 40), disease location (Ileal, colonic, Ileocolonic) and the disease behavior (nonstricturing/nonpenetrating, stricturing, penetrating). The key features for diagnosing CD comprises a combination of radiographic, endoscopic and pathological findings demonstrating focal, asymmetric, transmural or granulomatous features. Abdominal Computed tomography (CT) enterography is the most preferred first-line radiologic study used in the assessment of small bowel CD. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis is similar to that of CT scans and also prevents exposure to ionizing radiation. Endoscopic scores are considered to be the gold standard tool to measure the activity of CD and they are used more commonly in the clinical trials to measure the efficacy of various drugs on inducing and maintaining mucosal healing. The most common scoring systems used to measure clinical disease activity include Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), HBI- Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and Lehmann score. Management of Crohn's disease has been seen as an evolving challenge owing to its widely heterogeneous manifestations, overlapping characteristics with other inflammatory disorders, often elusive extraintestinal manifestations and uncertain etiology. Therapeutic interventions are tailored to address symptomatic response and subsequent tolerance of the intervention. Chronology of treatment should favor treatment dose acute disease or "induction therapy", followed by maintenance of adequate response or remission, i.e. "maintenance therapy". The medications which are highly effective in inducing remission include steroids and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors. Medications used to maintain remission include 5-aminosalicyclic acid products, immunomodulators (Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and TNF inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and golimumab). Surgical interventions like bowel resection, stricturoplasty or drainage of abscess is required in up to two thirds of CD patients during their lifetime. The most common indications for surgical resection are medically refractory disease, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess not amenable to percutaneous drainage, intractable hemorrhage, dysplasia or cancer. Endoscopic recurrence in postoperative CD patients, as defined by Rutgeers score i2-i4 occur in 30-90% of the patients at the neoterminal ileum within 12 months of surgery and almost universally by 5 years. Treating CD requires a comprehensive care team including the patient, primary care provider, and gastroenterologist. In summary CD is a chronic inflammatory condition with a remitting and relapsing course primarily affecting relatively younger population with significant socioeconomic effects.Copyright © 2018 Mosby, Inc.

In this study, we compared the immunomodulatory effects on the CD4 T cells of M1, M2a and M2c macrophages with the macrophages that directly and indirectly cultured with MSCs. We analyzed the changes in CD14, CD64, CD80, CD163 and CD200R expression to evaluate macrophage phenotypes, and the changes in CD4, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-17a and FoxP3 expression to evaluate T helper subsets using the FACS method. The changes in IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17a and IFN-g in the media supernatants were analyzed using the Luminex method. We also performed WST-1 and Caspase-3 ELISA analyses to observe the proliferation and apoptosis status of the T cells. MSCs were found to differentiate macrophages into a distinctive phenotype, which was close to the M2c phenotype, but was not considered as an M2c cell due to the low expression of CD163, a characteristic marker for M2c. While MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSCs showed similar inhibitory effects on the Th2 and Th17 cells, the most significant increase in Treg cell frequencies was seen in MEM-D cells. Macrophages can alter their phenotypes and functions according to the stimuli from the environment. The fact that macrophages educated with MSCs suppressed the production of all the cytokines we evaluated even after the removal of MSCs suggests that these cells may be differentiated by MSCs into a suppressive macrophage subgroup. However, the Treg cell activation caused by direct interactions between MSCs and macrophage cells may be the most prominent observation of this study compared to previous work. As a result, according to our data, the interactions between MSCs and macrophages may lead to differentiation of macrophage cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype, and these macrophages may suppress the T lymphocyte subgroups at least as effectively as MSCs. However, our data obtained from in vitro experiments should be supported by future in vivo studies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

To analyze inflammation-associated colonic tumorigenesis, we developed a chronic form of oxazolone-induced  in mice that, similar to UC, was distinguished by the presence of IL-13-producing NKT cells. In this model, the induction of tumors using azoxymethane was accompanied by the coappearance of F4/80+CD11b(high)Gr1(low)  macrophages, cells that undergo polarization by IL-13 and are absent in tumors that lack high level IL-13 production. Importantly, this subset of macrophages was a source of tumor-promoting factors, including IL-6. Similar to dextran sodium sulfate-induced , F4/80+CD11b(high)Gr1(intermediate) macrophages were present in the mouse model of chronic oxazolone-induced  and may influence tumor development through production of TGF-β1, a cytokine that inhibits tumor immunosurveillance. Finally, while robust chronic oxazolone-induced  developed in myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88-deficient (Myd88-/-) mice, these mice did not support tumor development. The inhibition of tumor development in Myd88-/- mice correlated with cessation of IL-6 and TGF-β1 production by  and F4/80+CD11b(high)Gr1(intermediate) macrophages, respectively, and was reversed by exogenous IL-6. These data show that an UC-like inflammation may facilitate tumor development by providing a milieu favoring development of MyD88-dependent tumor-supporting macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21844787>The hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxallyl glycine attenuates endotoxic shock via alternative activation of macrophages and IL-10 production by B1 cells.</a></h2><p>Localized tissue hypoxia is a feature of infection and inflammation, resulting in the upregulation of the transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) via inhibition of oxygen sensing hydroxylase enzymes. Previous studies have demonstrated a beneficial role for the hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) in inflammatory conditions, including experimental , by regulating the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and NF-κB. We have demonstrated in vivo that pretreatment with DMOG attenuates systemic LPS-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, mice treated with DMOG had significantly increased survival in LPS-induced shock. Conversely, in models of polymicrobial sepsis, DMOG exacerbates disease severity. Dimethyloxallyl glycine treatment of mice promotes  polarization in macrophages within the peritoneal cavity, resulting in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. In addition, in vivo DMOG treatment upregulates IL-10 expression, specifically in the peritoneal B1 cell population. This study demonstrates cell type-specific roles for hydroxylase inhibition in vivo and provides insight into the mechanism underlying the protection conveyed by DMOG in models of endotoxic shock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094081>Microbial metabolite butyrate facilitates  macrophage polarization and function.</a></h2><p>Metabolites from intestinal microbes modulate the mucosal immune system by regulating the polarization and expansion of T cells. Whether the microbial metabolites influence macrophage polarization, however, is poorly understood. Here, we show that the large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, facilitates  macrophage polarization, in vitro and in vivo. The supernatant from butyrate-treated  macrophage increased the migration and enhanced the wound closure rate of MLE-12 cells. Butyrate attenuated intestinal inflammation in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , with a significant increase in colonic expression of the  macrophage-associated protein, Arg1.  macrophage treated with butyrate, had increased activation of the H3K9/STAT6 signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanism for butyrate facilitated  macrophage polarization. Collectively, our study indicated that commensal microbe-derived butyrate is a novel activator of STAT6-mediated transcription through H3K9 acetylation driving  macrophage polarization, and delineated new insights into the immune interplay underlying inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26384117>Fecal pyruvate kinase is not suitable for discrimination between inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation and acute gastroenteritis.</a></h2><p>In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) diarrhea can be caused by exacerbation and/or infectious agents. Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a well-established biomarker of intestinal inflammation in IBD. However, its usefulness in depiction of IBD exacerbation from infectious diarrhea is limited. The value of fecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type 2 (-PK) in this application remains unknown.To compare the performance of -PK and FC in discriminating between diarrhea caused by IBD and infectious agents.One hundred three patients were enrolled for the study, including 32 with ulcerative  (UC), 21 with Crohn's disease (CD), 29 with acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus (AD-RV), and 21 with acute diarrhea caused by Salmonella enteritidis (AD-SE). -PK and FC were measured using ELISA. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities and specificities for both tests in distinguishing between patient subgroups with moderate to severe UC and CD from AD-RV and AD-SE were calculated.Differences in AUCs between -PK and FC for distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were -0.06 (p < 0.028) [-0.10 (p < 0.0018)] and for differentiating UC [CD] from AD-SE were 0.03 (NS) [-0.19(p < 0.0011)].-PK sensitivities and specificities in distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were 75.0%[71.4%] and 89.7% [89.7%] and for differentiation of UC [CD] from AD-SE were 56.3% [71.4%] and 95.2[57.1%].The performance of -PK in distinguishing between children with moderate-to-severe IBD and patients with infectious gastroenteritis was inferior to FC.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of TissuCol (fibrin glue), Histoacryl Flex (n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate), and Duraseal (polyethylene glycol) on colorectal anastomotic healing during experimental .We first performed colectomy 7 days after 10 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  to validate a rat TNBS--colectomy model. Subsequently, this TNBS--colectomy model was used in 73 Wistar rats that were stratified into a  group (CG, no adhesive), a TissuCol group (TG), a Histoacryl group (HG), and a Duraseal group (DG). Anastomotic sealant was applied with one adhesive after constructing an end-to-end hand-sewn anastomosis. Clinical manifestations, anastomotic bursting pressure, and immunohistochemistry of macrophage type-one (M1) and type-two () was performed on postoperative day (POD)3 or POD7.TNBS-caused mucosal and submucosal colon damage and compromised anastomotic healing (i.e., abscess formation and low anastomotic bursting pressure). On POD3, higher severity of abscesses was seen in CG. Average anastomotic bursting pressure was 53.2 ± 35.5 mm Hg in CG, which was significantly lower than HG (134.4 ± 27.5 mm Hg) and DG (95.1 ± 54.3 mm Hg) but not TG (83.4 ± 46.7 mm Hg). Furthermore, a significantly higher /M1 index was found in HG. On POD7, abscesses were only seen in CG (6/9) but not in other groups; HG had the lowest severity of adhesion.We describe the first surgical IBD model by performing colectomy in rats with TNBS-induced , which causes intra-abdominal abscess formation and compromises anastomotic healing. Anastomotic sealing with Histoacryl Flex prevents these complications in this model. Alternative activation of macrophages seems to be involved in its influence on anastomotic healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727542>Chemerin aggravates DSS-induced  by suppressing  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Chemerin is present in various inflammatory sites and is closely involved in tissue inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that chemerin treatment can cause either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory effects according to the disease model being investigated. Elevated circulating chemerin was recently found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the role of chemerin in intestinal inflammation remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the administration of exogenous chemerin (aa17-156) aggravated the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , which was characterized by higher clinical scores, extensive mucosal damage and significantly increased local and systemic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α and interferon (IFN-γ). Interestingly, chemerin did not appear to influence the magnitudes of inflammatory infiltrates in the colons, but did result in significantly decreased colonic expression of  macrophage-associated genes, including Arginase 1 (Arg-1), Ym1, FIZZ1 and IL-10, following DSS exposure, suggesting an impaired  macrophage skewing in vivo. Furthermore, an in vitro experiment showed that the addition of chemerin directly suppressed  macrophage-associated gene expression and STAT6 phosphorylation in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Significantly elevated chemerin levels were found in colons from DSS-exposed mice and from ulcerative  (UC) patients and appeared to positively correlate with disease severity. Moreover, the in vivo administration of neutralizing anti-chemerin antibody significantly improved intestinal inflammation following DSS exposure. Taken together, our findings reveal a pro-inflammatory role for chemerin in DSS-induced  and the ability of chemerin to suppress the anti-inflammatory  macrophage response. Our study also suggests that upregulated chemerin in inflamed colons may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026504>Isoliquiritigenin, a flavonoid from licorice, blocks  macrophage polarization in -associated tumorigenesis through downregulating PGE2 and IL-6.</a></h2><p> macrophage polarization is implicated in colorectal cancer development. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid from licorice, has been reported to prevent azoxymethane (AOM) induced colon carcinogenesis in animal models. Here, in a mouse model of -associated tumorigenesis induced by AOM/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), we investigated the chemopreventive effects of ISL and its mechanisms of action. Mice were treated with AOM/DSS and randomized to receive either vehicle or ISL (3, 15 and 75 mg/kg). Tumor load, histology, immunohistochemistry, and gene and protein expressions were determined. Intragastric administration of ISL for 12 weeks significantly decreased colon cancer incidence, multiplicity and tumor size by 60%, 55.4% and 42.6%, respectively. Moreover, ISL inhibited  macrophage polarization. Such changes were accompanied by downregulation of PGE2 and IL-6 signaling. Importantly, depletion of macrophages by clodronate (Clod) or zoledronic acid (ZA) reversed the effects of ISL. In parallel, in vitro studies also demonstrated that ISL limited the  polarization of RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages with concomitant inactivation of PGE2/PPARδ and IL-6/STAT3 signaling. Conversely, exogenous addition of PGE2 or IL-6, or overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 reversed ISL-mediated inhibition of  macrophage polarization. In summary, dietary flavonoid ISL effectively inhibits -associated tumorigenesis through hampering  macrophage polarization mediated by the interplay between PGE2 and IL-6. Thus, inhibition of  macrophage polarization is likely to represent a promising strategy for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These cells could be induced to differentiate into M1 or  macrophages in vitro. In the current study, we sought to determine whether bone marrow cell-derived innate macrophages (BMIMs) could be used to fulfill an anti-inflammatory purpose by intravenous transplantation in vivo after being stimulated to differentiate into  macrophages. Because Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin IL-4 and IL-13, can induce macrophage polarization into  macrophages, we treated the BMIMs with IL-4 and IL-13 in vitro. Next, the  macrophages were intravenously transplanted into a typical Th2-mediated inflammatory disease model, oxazolone (OXZ)-induced , to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of BMIM-derived  macrophages (BMIM-M2Ms) in vivo. After transplantation, the severity of intestinal inflammation was attenuated. In addition, colon lengths and mouse body weights were noticeably improved. F4/80 CD206 double-positive cells (displaying the markers of  macrophages) had accumulated in the colon tissue of BMIM-M2M-transplanted mice. This evidence demonstrated that bone marrow-derived BMIM-M2Ms could be used to alleviate OXZ-induced Th2-mediated inflammation in a mouse model in vivo.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Fifteen cases of synchronous onset of CMV  and UC have been reported in literature. A careful prospective and retrospective survey identified CMV  in newly diagnosed UC patients at 4.5% (3/65 cases) and 8.2% (5/61 cases), respectively. This means that a majority of synchronous CMV  may be missed in newly diagnosed UC patients in routine practice. Such a case is presented.A 50-year-old woman, with a history of right partial mastectomy two years ago, had a persistent high fever for 9 days, after which a thickness of the colonic wall was detected on abdominal ultrasonography. Laboratory data showed inflammation and 2% atypical lymphocytes with the normal number of white blood cells. Although there was no bloody stool, fecal occult blood was over 1000 ng/ml. Colonoscopy showed diffuse inflammation in the entire large bowel and pseudomembranes in the sigmoid colon. The diagnosis was UC with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous . Metronidazole followed by sulfasalazine resulted in defervescence and improvement in laboratory data of inflammation. It took one month for normalization of fecal occult blood. Endoscopic remission was simultaneously confirmed. Later, it was found that a report of positive CMV antigenaemia (2/150,000) had been missed. Reevaluation of biopsy specimens using a monoclonal antibody against CMV identified positive cells, although inclusion bodies were not found in hematoxylin and eosin sections. Finally, the case was concluded to be synchronous onset of CMV  and UC.Synchronous CMV  is not routinely investigated in newly diagnosed UC patients. Together with a recent observation in animal studies, it is plausible that a subset (a few to several per cent) of UC patients develop synchronous CMV infection.

Analyzing colonoscopic biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients, we found significantly decreased level of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in patients compared to that in non-inflamed tissues. Similar reduction of intestinal epithelial PKM2 was observed in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced . Moreover, intestinal epithelial-specific PKM2-knockout (Pkm2) mice displayed more severe intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by a shortened colon, disruption of epithelial tight junctions, an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels, and immune cell infiltration, when compared to wild-type mice.

To corroborate that inflammation has a metabolic effect , a mouse model was used that is based on immunocompromised NOD-scid   mice reconstituted with PBMCs from patients with ulcerative  (UC). Inflammation had a significant effect on amino acid (AA) levels (Glu =1E-07, Asp =1E-04). Principal component analysis (PCA) discriminated between unchallenged and challenged groups. Finally, the efficacy of ritonavir was tested in the same mouse model. Dependent variables were clinical and histological scores, frequencies of human leukocytes isolated from spleen and colon, and levels of AA in sera of mice. Mice benefited from treatment with ritonavir as indicated by significantly decreased colon (=7E-04) and histological (=1E-04) scores, frequencies of  monocytes (CD14+ CD163; =0.02), and Glu levels (=2E-05).

Therefore, alleviation of inflammation is very important to treat IBD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been highlighted as new candidates for treating autoimmune disease based on their immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism and therapeutic effects of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) using THP-1 macrophages and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mice with chronic . LPS-treated THP-1 cells expressed mRNA of CD11b, an M1 macrophage marker, at day 2. However, THP-1 co-cultured with ASCs expressed mRNA of CD206, CD68, CCL18, legumain, and IL-10, markers of  macrophages. In THP-1 cells co-cultured with ASCs, precursor (pro)-IL-1β, Cox-2, and NLRP3 increased dramatically compared to LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 was significantly inhibited by ASCs, but PGE2 production was highly increased in co-culture conditions of THP-1 and ASCs. IL-18 secretion was inhibited by PGE2 treatment, and PGE2 inhibited inflammasome complex (ASC/Cas-1/NLRP3) formation in THP-1 cells. In the DSS-induced chronic  model, ASCs ameliorated  by decreasing the total number of macrophages and the M1 macrophage population. Our results suggest that ASCs can suppress the inflammatory response by controlling the macrophage population, and ASCs may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, these issues are rarely addressed in routine care. A model of integrated psychological screening and intervention was trialled to measure prevalence, patient participation, and potential benefits to mental health and/or quality of life.During a 12-month period, 490 adult patients at an established hospital-based service were approached to complete screening instruments for anxiety, depression, general distress, quality of life and medication adherence. Disease-specific and demographic data were also collected. Patients who scored highly on screening questionnaires were offered psychological intervention (in-service or externally referred). Participants were reassessed after 12 months.Psychological screening was well accepted with 68% (N = 335) participating. Psychological care was 'needed', with 55% (N = 183) scoring highly for anxiety, depression and/or general distress. Half of those 'in need' (N = 91) accepted intervention. In those who accepted, levels of anxiety (mean at intake [M1] = 12.11 vs mean at follow-up [] = 9.59, p < 0.001), depression (M1 = 8.38 vs  = 6.42, p < 0.001), general distress (M1 = 17.99 vs  = 13.96, p < 0.001), mental health quality of life (M1 = 54.64 vs  = 59.70, p < 0.001) and overall quality of life (M1 = 57.60 vs  = 64.10, p < 0.001) each improved between intake and follow-up. Engagement in psychological intervention was six times greater for those treated in-service vs externally referred (χ2[1] = 13.06, p < 0.001, odds ratio = 6.47).Mental health issues are highly prevalent in people with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients are open to psychological screening and treatment. Psychological care can improve patient mental health and quality of life, and works best when integrated into routine management.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

High-dose interferon alfa-2b (HDI) was administered concurrently, including intravenous induction at 20 MU//d for 5 d/wk for 4 weeks followed by maintenance at 10 MU//d subcutaneously three times a week for 8 weeks per course. From course 2 onward, HDI maintenance was administered subcutaneously.Thirty-seven patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV (9M1a, 6M1b, and 22M1c) were enrolled. Two patients had previously treated brain metastases. Grades 3 and 4 toxicities included neutropenia (six patients; 17%), diarrhea/ (four patients; 11%), liver enzyme increase (four patients; 11%), rash (four patients; 11%), fatigue (15 patients; 40%), and anxiety/depression (five patients; 14%). Response data were available for 35 patients. The best objective response rate (RR; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) by intention to treat was 24% (90% CI, 13% to 36%; four complete responses [CRs] and five partial responses [PRs] that lasted 6, 6, > 12, > 14, > 18, 20, > 28, 30, and > 37 months, respectively). Fourteen patients (38%) had stable disease (SD) that lasted 1.5 to 21 months. The median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 3.3 to 12.1 months). The median overall survival (OS) was 21 months (95% CI, 9.5 to not reached). There was a weak association between therapy-induced autoimmunity and clinical benefits (CR/PR/SD; P = .0059), baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) less than or equal to 2.7× the upper limit of normal and clinical benefits (P = .0494) and improved probability of survival (P = .0032), and baseline lymphocyte count of at least 1,000/μL and response (CR/PR; P = .0183) and clinical benefits (CR/PR/SD; P = .0255).

Mice were sacrificed 48h after TNBS administration and evaluated for macroscopic and histological scores, myeloperoxidase (MPO) quantification and cytokine messenger RNA expression in the colonic tissues.Both clinical and histological scores significantly decreased in mice treated with P28GST at 5 or 50μg/kg when compared to vehicle- treated mice. A significant reduction of MPO was detected in colonic tissues from P28GST-treated mice, similarly to mice treated with methylprednisolone as the reference treatment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, mRNA as well as serum levels were down-regulated in mice colonic tissues treated with P28GST at 5 or 50μg/kg. In addition, a significant decrease of mRNA expression levels of T-bet, and ROR-γ, respective markers of Th1 and Th17 cells was observed. Whereas no significant effect was detected on Gata3 mRNA, a marker of Th2 cells, the Arg/iNOS mRNA levels significantly increased in P28GST-treated mice, suggesting the induction of  macrophages.These findings provide evidence that P28GST injected locally after  induction induces a potent decrease of  inflammation in mice, associated to downregulation of Th1/Th17 response, and induction of anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30015447>Qualitative and Quantitative Characteristics of Selected Bacterial Groups in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was evaluation of qualitative and quantitative changes in bacterial ecosystem in 109 children with inflammatory bowel diseases.

Baicalin, originally isolated from the root of the Chinese herb Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and its main active ingredient, has a protective effect against inflammatory responses in several diseases. The present study investigated the effects of baicalin on macrophage polarization and its therapeutic role in IBD. Murine peritoneal macrophages and mice with  were treated with baicalin. Macrophage subset distribution, M1 and  macrophage-associated mRNA expression, and interferon regulatory factor 4 and 5 (IRF4 and IRF5) expression were analyzed. siRNA transfection into mouse peritoneal macrophages was utilized to suppress IRF4. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, western blot, and real-time PCR analyses were performed. Baicalin (50μM) limited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 macrophage polarization; decreased LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-23, and IRF5 expression; and increased IL-10, arginase-1 (Arg-1), and IRF4 expression. siRNA-mediated IRF4 silencing significantly impaired baicalin activity. Furthermore, pretreatment with baicalin (100mg/kg) in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  ameliorated the severity of  and significantly decreased the disease activity index (baicalin group, 3.33±0.52 vs. DSS group, 5.67±1.03). Baicalin (100mg/kg) also repressed IRF5 protein expression and promoted IRF4 protein expression in the lamina propria mononuclear cells, and induced macrophage polarization to the  phenotype. In summary, our results showed that baicalin upregulates IRF4 protein expression and reverses LPS-induced macrophage subset redistribution. Thus, baicalin alleviates DSS-induced  by modulating macrophage polarization to the  phenotype.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our in vivo studies showed that cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, effectively inhibited AOM/DSS-induced, -associated tumorigenesis, downregulated -related markers, and decreased F4/80+/CD206+ macrophage populations. Treatment with conditioned medium of colon cancer cells increased macrophage expression of the -related markers arginase-1 (Arg1), CCL17, CCL22, IL-10 and IL-4. By contrast, conditioned medium of EGFR knockout colon cancer cells inhibited expression of these -related markers and induced macrophage expression of the M1-related markers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-12, TNF-α and CCR7. EGFR knockout in colon cancer cells inhibited macrophage-induced promotion of xenograft tumor growth. Moreover, colon cancer-derived insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) increased Arg1 expression, and treatment with the IGF1R inhibitor AG1024 inhibited that increase. These results suggest that inhibition of EGFR signaling in colon cancer cells modulates cytokine secretion (e.g. IGF-1) and prevents M1-to- macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28368514>Vitamin D Receptor-Dependent Signaling Protects Mice From Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced .</a></h2><p>Low vitamin D status potentiates experimental , but the vitamin D-responsive cell in  has not been defined. We hypothesized that vitamin D has distinct roles in colonic epithelial cells and in nonepithelial cells during . We tested this hypothesis by using mice with vitamin D receptor (VDR) deletion from colon epithelial cells (CEC-VDRKO) or nonintestinal epithelial cells (NEC-VDRKO). Eight-week-old mice were treated with 1.35% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days and then euthanized 2 or 10 days after removal of DSS. DSS induced body weight loss and increased disease activity index and spleen size. This response was increased in NEC-VDRKO mice but not CEC-VDRKO mice. DSS-induced colon epithelial damage and immune cell infiltration scores were increased in both mouse models. Although the epithelium healed between 2 and 10 days after DSS administration in control and CEC-VDRKO mice, epithelial damage remained high in NEC-VDRKO mice 10 days after removal of DSS, indicating delayed epithelial healing. Gene expression levels for the proinflammatory, M1 macrophage (Mɸ) cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide synthase 2, and interleukin-1β were significantly elevated in the colon of NEC-VDRKO mice at day 10.

It might be argued that this system is of minor importance. New information obtained shows, however, that the non-neuronal cholinergic system is more widely distributed in the body than what is previously recognised. In recent studies, the existence of such a system has thus been shown for human tendons, especially in chronically painful situations (tendinopathy/tendinosis), in the synovial tissue of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and in the mucosa of ulcerative  patients. There is evidence of both acetylcholine (ACh) production and a marked existence of muscarinic () ACh receptors in these situations. The non-neuronal cholinergic system may be involved in the establishment of a 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway' and in proliferative and tissue reorganisation processes via autocrine/paracrine effects. The new information obtained suggests that this system plays an important functional role in chronically painful tendons and in inflammatory conditions. The findings of such a system in various parts of the body, when taken together, show that not only should the classical neuronal cholinergic system be considered in discussion of the cholinergic influences in the body. Additionally, the production of ACh in local cells in the tissues represents an important extra supply of the transmitter. ACh effects can be obtained whether or not there is a cholinergic innervation in the tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668755>A JAK1 Selective Kinase Inhibitor and Tofacitinib Affect Macrophage Activation and Function.</a></h2><p>Janus kinases (JAKs) mediate cytokine signaling involved in inflammatory bowel disease. The pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib has shown efficacy in the treatment of ulcerative . However, concerns regarding adverse events due to their wide spectrum inhibition fueled efforts to develop selective JAK inhibitors. Given the crucial role of myeloid cells in intestinal immune homeostasis, we evaluated the effect of pan-JAK and selective JAK inhibitors on pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and function (M1/) and in experimental .Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages or human monocytes were treated using JAK1 and JAK3 selective inhibitors (JAK1i;JAK3i) and tofacitinib and were evaluated by transcriptional, functional, and metabolic analyses. In vivo, oral administration of JAK1i and tofacitinib (10 or 30 mg/kg) was tested in both acute and acute rescue dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) .Both tofacitinib and JAK1i but not JAK3i effectively inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon gamma-induced transcripts in M1 polarized macrophages. Strikingly, transcriptional profiling suggested a switch from M1 to  type macrophages, which was supported by increased protein expression of -associated markers. In addition, both inhibitors enhanced oxidative phosphorylation rates. In vivo, JAK1i and tofacitinib did not protect mice from acute DSS-induced  but ameliorated recovery from weight loss and disease activity during acute rescue DSS-induced  at the highest dose.JAK1i and tofacitinib but not JAK3i induce phenotypical and functional characteristics of anti-inflammatory macrophages, suggesting JAK1 as the main effector pathway for tofacitinib in these cells.

The direct effect of H. pylori extract on the polarization status of macrophages was determined in vitro.Gastric H. pylori colonization significantly ameliorated the severity of chronic DSS-induced . H. pylori colonization decreased Th17 cells and mRNA levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21 in the colon. Simultaneously, H. pylori colonization increased Treg cells and IL-10 expression. As to cytokines driving Th17 and Treg differentiation, H. pylori colonization increased TGFβ and decreased IL-6 and IL-23.

One putative target of pelargonidins is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). A synthetic pelargonidin (Mt-P) was synthesized by the methylation of the pelargonidin (the natural compound indicated as P). Mt-P transactivated the AhR with an EC of 1.97 µM and was ~2-fold more potent than the natural compound. In vitro Mt-P attenuated pro-inflammatory activities of Raw264.7 macrophage cells in an AhR-dependent manner. In vivo, administration of the Mt-P in Balb/c mice resulted in a dose-dependent attenuation of signs and symptoms of  induced by TNBS. A dose of 5 mg/kg Mt-P, but not the natural compound P, reversed intestinal inflammation and increased expression of Tnf-α, Ifn-ƴ, and Il-6, while promoted the expansion of regulatory T cells and  macrophages. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), Mt-P attenuated body weight gain, intestinal and liver inflammation, and ameliorated insulin sensitivity, while worsened liver steatosis by up-regulating the liver expression of Cd36 and Apo100b.

Macrophages play pivotal roles in the maintenance of gut homeostasis but they are also implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. They are highly plastic cells and their activation state depends on the local environment. In the healthy intestine, resident macrophages display an  phenotype characterized by inflammatory energy, while inflammatory M1 macrophages dominate in the inflamed intestinal mucosa. In this regard, modifying the balance of macrophage populations into an  phenotype has emerged as a new therapeutic approach in IBD. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed as a promising cell-therapy for the treatment of IBD, considering their immunomodulatory and tissue regenerative potential. Numerous preclinical studies have shown that MSCs can induce immunomodulatory macrophages and have demonstrated that their therapeutic efficacy in experimental  is mediated by macrophages with an -like phenotype. However, some issues have not been clarified yet, including the importance of MSC homing to the inflamed colon and/or lymphoid organs, their optimal route of administration or whether they are effective as living or dead cells. In contrast, the mechanisms behind the effect of MSCs in human IBD are not known and more data are needed regarding the effect of MSCs on macrophage polarization that would support the observation reported in the experimental models. Nevertheless, MSCs have emerged as a novel method to treat IBD that has already been proven safe and with clinical benefits that could be administered in combination with the currently used pharmacological treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29966560>Frailty Predicts Morbidity and Mortality after Colectomy for Clostridium difficile .</a></h2><p>Frailty has been noted as a powerful predictive preoperative tool for 30-day postoperative complications.

The National Surgical Quality and Improvement Program cross-institutional database was used for this study. Data from 470 patients with a diagnosis of C. difficile  were used in the study. Modified frailty index (mFI) is a previously described and validated 11-variable frailty measure used with the National Surgical Quality and Improvement Program to assess frailty. Outcome measures included serious morbidity, overall morbidity, and Clavien IV (requiring ICU) and Clavien V (mortality) complications. The median age was 70 years and body mass index was 26.9 kg/. 55.6 per cent of patients were females. 98.5 per cent of patients were assigned American Society of Anesthesiologists Class III or higher. The median mFI was 0.27 (0-0.63). Because mFI increased from 0 (non-frail) to 0.55 and above, the overall morbidity increased from 53.3 per cent to 84.4 per cent and serious morbidity increased from 43.3 per cent to 78.1 per cent. The Clavien IV complication rate increased from 30.0 per cent to 75.0 per cent. The mortality rate increased from 6.7 per cent to 56.2 per cent.

The effects of macrophages and the role of Wnt1 were analyzed on the expression of β-catenin, Tcf-4, c-Myc and markers of cell differentiation in a co-culture system with Caco-2 cells. Immunohistochemical staining of CD68, CD206, CD86, Wnt1, β-catenin and c-Myc were evaluated in the damaged and non-damaged mucosa of patients with UC. We also determined the mRNA expression of Lgr5 and c-Myc by qPCR and protein levels of β-catenin by western blot. Results show that , and no M1, activated the Wnt signaling pathway in co-culture epithelial cells through Wnt1 which impaired enterocyte differentiation. A significant increase in the number of CD206+ macrophages was observed in the damaged mucosa of chronic vs newly diagnosed patients. CD206 immunostaining co-localized with Wnt1 in the mucosa and these cells were associated with activation of canonical Wnt signalling pathway in epithelial cells and diminution of alkaline phosphatase activity. Our results show that  macrophages, and not M1, activate Wnt signalling pathways and decrease enterocyte differentiation in co-cultured epithelial cells. In the mucosa of UC patients,  macrophages increase with chronicity and are associated with activation of epithelial Wnt signalling and diminution in enterocyte differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19770098>[P-glycoprotein functional activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes in ulcerative ].</a></h2><p>P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by MDR-1, is a transmembrane efflux pump that has been involved in relevant clinical drug transport. It is expressed in lymphocytes, luminal epithelium of colon and other tissues with barrier function. MDR1 was proposed as a candidate gene for ulcerative . The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of P-gp in therapeutic response of ulcerative  by studying its functionality in lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. Samples were taken from 27 patients with active  classified clinically in refractory (n = 16) and responders (n = 11) to treatment. Rhodamine 123 (a fluorescent P-glycoprotein substrate) efflux was studied by flow cytometry as absence and presence of an inhibitor (verapamil, 100 uM). Data were expressed evaluating the behaviour of two markers defined based on % of cells with maximum (M1)/minimum () intracellular fluorescence, reflecting inactivity/activity of the pump. Results were compared with a group of healthy individuals (n = 68). Significant differences were observed in absence and presence of Verapamil inhibition, when comparing refractory vs. responders (p < 0.05) as well as refractory vs. healthy controls (p < 0.01). No differences were observed when comparing responders vs. controls (p > 0.05) (Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn post-test). Rhodamine efflux assay was also performed in 12 patients who required therapeutic change; a significant diminish of rhodamine transport (p < 0.01) was observed without inhibitor when patients achieved clinical response. Finally, our results suggest a possible relevant role of P-gp in ulcerative  treatment response and a possible usefulness of P-gp functional assay in the early detection of individual therapeutic response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27761147>The Rhizome Mixture of  and  Attenuates Mesalazine-Resistant  in Mice.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of DWac on the gut microbiota composition in mice with 2,3,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced . Treatment with DWac restored TNBS-disturbed gut microbiota composition and attenuated TNBS-induced . Moreover, we examined the effect of DWac in mice with mesalazine-resistant  (MRC). Intrarectal injection of TNBS in MRC mice caused severe , as well as colon shortening, edema, and increased myeloperoxidase activity. Treatment with mesalazine (30 mg/kg) did not attenuate TNBS-induced  in MRC mice, whereas treatment with DWac (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated TNBS-induced . Moreover, treatment with the mixture of mesalazine (15 mg/kg) and DWac (15 mg/kg) additively attenuated  in MRC mice. Treatment with DWac and its mixture with mesalazine inhibited TNBS-induced activation of NF-B and expression of M1 macrophage markers but increased TNBS-suppressed expression of  macrophage markers. Furthermore, these inhibited TNBS-induced T-bet, RORt, TNF-, and IL-17 expression but increased TNBS-suppressed Foxp3 and IL-10 expression. However, Th2 cell differentiation and GATA3 and IL-5 expression were not affected. These findings suggest that DWac can ameliorate MRC by increasing the polarization of  macrophage and correcting the disturbance of gut microbiota and Th1/Th17/Treg, as well as additively attenuating MRC along with mesalazine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274006>Chromogranin-A Regulates Macrophage Function and the Apoptotic Pathway in Murine DSS .</a></h2><p>Chromogranin-A (CHGA) is elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little is known about its role in colonic inflammation. IBD is associated with impaired functions of macrophages and increased apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. We investigated CHGA expression in human subjects with active ulcerative  (UC) and the underlying mechanisms in Chga  mice. In UC, CHGA, classically activated macrophage (M1) markers, caspase-3, p53, and its associated genes were increased, while alternatively activated macrophage () markers were decreased without changes in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. CHGA correlated positively with M1 and the apoptotic pathway and negatively with . In the murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced , Chga deletion reduced the disease severity and onset, pro-inflammatory mediators, M1, and p53/caspase-3 activation, while it upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines and  markers with no changes in the extrinsic apoptotic markers. Compared to Chga  , M1 and p53/caspase-3 activation in Chga  macrophages were decreased in vitro, while  markers were increased. CHGA plays a critical role during  through the modulation of macrophage functions via the caspase-3/p53 pathway. Strategies targeting CHGA to regulate macrophage activation and apoptosis might be developed to treat UC patients.• Chromogranin-A (CHGA) is pro-hormone and is secreted in the gut. CHGA is elevated in  and is associated with the disease severity. The lack of GHGA has beneficial immunomodulatory properties during the development of intestinal inflammation.

A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs.To develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).PBD scores were assigned according to the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative  and 70 patients with Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores. Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established.Plant-Based Diet score.The PBD scores differed significantly, in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the ulcerative  and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 ± 9.5 and 8.2 ± 8.2, respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (χ).The PBD score is a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30024891>Genistein induces macrophage polarization and systemic cytokine to ameliorate experimental .</a></h2><p>Mucosal changes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC), two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by a prominent infiltration of inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, macrophages, T cells and neutrophils. The precise etiology of IBD is unknown but it involves a complex interplay of factors associated with the immune system, environment, host genotype and enteric commensal bacteria. As there is no known safe cure for IBD, natural alternative therapeutic options without side effects are urgently needed. To this end, Soy-based foods, which have been eaten for centuries in Asian countries, have potential benefits, including lowering the incidence of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, allergic response, and autoimmune diseases. This study describes the effect of Soy isoflavons 4', 5, 7 Trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced experimental . The extent and severity of disease was analyzed through body weight, histopathological analysis, cellular immune response, systemic cytokine levels, and inflammation score using a disease activity index. Genistein treatment significantly attenuated DSS-induced  severity and resulted in increase in body weight, colon length and reduction in inflammation score. Genistein also skews M1 macrophages towards the  phenotype. Further, gen also reduced the systemic cytokine levels as compared to vehicle control. This serves as the first detailed study towards natural soya based product that shows the polarization of M1 towards  macrophages, and reduction of systemic cytokine in part to attenuate the  symptoms. Thus, our work demonstrates that genistein, a soya compound, may be useful for the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580446>Combination therapy of mesenchymal stromal cells and sulfasalazine attenuates trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced  in the rat: The S1P pathway.</a></h2><p>Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) transplantation is a novel immunomodulatory therapeutic tool to ameliorate the symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of combined sufasalazine and ASCs therapy in a rat model of IBD. After induction of  in rats, ASCs were cultured and intraperitoneally injected (3 × 10 cells/kg) into the rats on Days 1 and 5 after inducing , in conjunction with daily oral administration of low dose of sulfasalazine (30 mg/kg). The regenerative effects of combination of ASCs and sulfasalazine on ulcerative  were assessed by measuring body weight, colonic weight/length ratio, disease activity index, macroscopic scores, histopathological examinations, cytokine, and inflammation markers profiles. In addition, western blot analysis was used to assess the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and apoptosis related proteins in  tissues. Simultaneous treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine was associated with significant amelioration of disease activity index, macroscopic and microscopic  scores, as well as inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced . Moreover, combined ASCs and sulfasalazine therapy effectively inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway, reduced the expression of Bax and prevented the loss of Bcl-2 proteins in colon tissue of the rats with TNBS-induced . Furthermore, combined treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine shifted inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  macrophages by decreasing the levels of MCP1, CXCL9 and increasing IL-10, Arg-1 levels. In conclusion, combination of ASCs with conventional IBD therapy is potentially a much more powerful strategy to slow the progression of  via reducing inflammatory and apoptotic markers than either therapy alone.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22778395>The prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 identifies proinflammatory macrophages and its expression is regulated by activin A.</a></h2><p>Modulation of macrophage polarization underlies the onset and resolution of inflammatory processes, with polarization-specific molecules being actively sought as potential diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Based on their cytokine profile upon exposure to pathogenic stimuli, human monocyte-derived macrophages generated in the presence of GM-CSF or M-CSF are considered as proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory () macrophages, respectively. We report in this study that the prolyl hydroxylase PHD3-encoding EGLN3 gene is specifically expressed by in vitro-generated proinflammatory M1(GM-CSF) human macrophages at the mRNA and protein level. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the expression of PHD3 in CD163(+) lung macrophages under basal homeostatic conditions, whereas PHD3(+) macrophages were abundantly found in tissues undergoing inflammatory responses (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative ) and in tumors. In the case of melanoma, PHD3 expression marked a subset of tumor-associated macrophages that exhibit a weak (e.g., CD163) or absent (e.g., FOLR2) expression of typical -polarization markers. EGLN3 gene expression in proinflammatory M1(GM-CSF) macrophages was found to be activin A dependent and could be prevented in the presence of an anti-activin A-blocking Ab or inhibitors of activin receptor-like kinase receptors. Moreover, EGLN3 gene expression was upregulated in response to hypoxia only in (M-CSF) macrophages, and the hypoxia-mediated upregulation of EGLN3 expression was significantly impaired by activin A neutralization. These results indicate that EGLN3 gene expression in macrophages is dependent on activin A both under basal and hypoxic conditions and that the expression of the EGLN3-encoded PHD3 prolyl hydroxylase identifies proinflammatory macrophages in vivo and in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663429>Presence of a marked nonneuronal cholinergic system in human colon: study of normal colon and colon in ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The body has not only a neuronal but also a nonneuronal cholinergic system. Both systems are likely to be very important, particularly in inflammatory conditions. The patterns and importance of the nonneuronal cholinergic system in patients with ulcerative  (UC) are largely unknown.The colons of UC and non-UC patients were examined for expression patterns of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and the muscarinic receptor of the M(2) subtype.ChAT and VAChT immunoreactions and mRNA reactions for ChAT were detected in epithelial and endocrine cells, in cells in the lamina propria, and in blood vessel walls. Furthermore, a marked M(2) immunoreaction was noted for epithelium, blood vessel walls, and smooth musculature. ChAT and VAChT immunoreactions were significantly higher in endocrine and epithelial cells, respectively, in non-UC mucosa than in UC mucosa. On the other hand, there was a tendency toward higher M(2) levels in epithelium of UC patients.There is a pronounced nonneuronal cholinergic system in the colon, which has previously been ignored when discussing cholinergic influences in UC. Furthermore, it is evident that certain changes in the nonneuronal cholinergic system occur in response to inflammation/derangement in UC. Cholinergic effects in the colon can be considered to be related not only to nerve-related effects but also to effects of acetylcholine from nonneuronal local cells. Thus, the recently discussed phenomenon of a "cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway" in the intestine may have a pronounced nonneuronal component.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26481725>Prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease among coeliac disease patients in a Hungarian coeliac centre.</a></h2><p>Celiac disease, Crohn disease and ulcerative  are inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with some common genetic, immunological and environmental factors involved in their pathogenesis. Several research shown that patients with celiac disease have increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease when compared with that of the general population. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in our celiac patient cohort over a 15-year-long study period.To diagnose celiac disease, serological tests were used, and duodenal biopsy samples were taken to determine the degree of mucosal injury. To set up the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, clinical parameters, imaging techniques, colonoscopy histology were applied. DEXA for measuring bone mineral density was performed on every patient.In our material, 8/245 (3,2 %) coeliac disease patients presented inflammatory bowel disease (four males, mean age 37, range 22-67), 6/8 Crohn's disease, and 2/8 ulcerative . In 7/8 patients the diagnosis of coeliac disease was made first and inflammatory bowel disease was identified during follow-up.

Although this condition occurs primarily in severely myelosuppressed and immunosuppressed patients with leukemia, it may also occur in those with other advanced malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. It has been described most recently in patients with solid tumors who receive taxane-based therapy. A 60-year old woman with medullary breast cancer stage IIIB underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TAC (doxetaxele 100 mg/, doxorubicin 50 mg/ and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/). Sixth day after TAC chemotherapy, she had abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdomen CT scan showed diffuse circumferential thickening of ileum wall typical for ileitis, narrowing of the lumen, disturbance of peristaltic. This abdomen CT scan was thought as abnormality pictures of neutropenic enterocolitis. Neutropenic enterocolitis should be considered in patients with abdominal symptoms especially during the granulocyte nadir following chemotherapy.

A PBD and dietary guidance were provided during a two-week hospitalization.The primary end point was relapse (a flare-up that required more aggressive treatment) during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative relapse rate. Secondary end points were immediate improvement in symptoms or laboratory data during hospitalization and a chronologic change in the PBD score, which evaluated adherence to the PBD.Sixty cases were studied: 29 initial episode cases and 31 relapse cases. Of these, 31 involved proctitis; 7, left-sided ; and 22, extensive . Thirty-seven patients were receiving medication; 23 were not. The median age was 34 years; median follow-up was 3 years 6 months. Eight cases relapsed during follow-up. The cumulative relapse rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of follow-up were 2%, 4%, 7%, 19%, and 19%, respectively. Most patients (77%) experienced some improvement such as disappearance or decrease of bloody stool during hospitalization. The short- and long-term PBD scores after the hospitalization were higher than baseline PBD scores.Relapse rates after educational hospitalization providing a PBD were far lower than those reported with medication.

Therefore, in this study, we isolated 4-methoxylonchocarpin (ML), an anti-inflammatory compound present in AP, and studied its anti-inflammatory effects in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced . In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, ML was found to inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 expression by inhibiting LPS binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in vitro. Oral administration of ML in mice with TNBS-induced  suppressed colon shortening and colonic myeloperoxidase activity. ML treatment significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 in the colon. Treatment with ML also inhibited TNBS-induced expression of IL-1β, IL-17A, and TNF. While ML reduced the TNBS-induced expression of M1 macrophage markers such as arginase-2 and TNF, it was found to increase the expression of  macrophage markers such as arginase-1 and IL-10. In conclusion, oral administration of ML attenuated  in mice by inhibiting the binding of LPS to TLR4 on immune cells and increasing the polarization of M1 macrophages to  macrophages.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

After oral administration, paeonol (20 and 40 mg/kg) reduced the edema increase in paw volumes and also the development of DSS-induced murine . Furthermore, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities of paeonol (1) together with its 10 metabolites (~M11) were investigated by using in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant assays. M3 and M11 exhibited significant 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities (with EC50 values of 93.44 and 23.24 μM, respectively). All the metabolites except M8 showed hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and M3 and M11 were the most potent agents (with EC50 values of 336.02 and 124.05 μM, respectively). Inhibitory effects of paeonol, ~M11 on the overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), and the release of TNF-α were also tested. M3 and M11 potently inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced overproduction of NO in macrophage RAW 264.7. Western blot results demonstrated that paeonol, M3, and M11 downregulated the high expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and COX-2 proteins, and the effects of M3 and M11 were more potent when compared with paeonol. These findings indicated that paeonol may play anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant roles by changing to its active metabolites after absorption. In addition, further investigations on the mechanism showed that paeonol, M3, and M11 blocked the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK 1/2 and p38, whereas they showed no effect on the phosphorylation of JNK.

MicroRNA (miR)-155 is frequently expressed and functions in many immune cell types. Besides its function in adaptive immunity, miR-155 is a key regulator of the innate immune response in macrophages, dendritic cells, and even in epithelia cells. Although the roles of miR-155 within T and B lymphocytes in  have been reported, its function in innate immune cells has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  model was established in wild-type (WT) and miR-155 mice. Our results showed that miR-155 deficiency in macrophages recapitulated the alleviated  feature of miR-155 mice and appeared to skew toward the alterative  phenotype. Notably, the predominance of  in colon can result in dampened intestinal immune cell proliferation and inhibit CD4 T cell polarization toward Th1 and Th17. Moreover, C/EBPβ and SOCS1 were demonstrated as two key functional targets in this process. We also provided evidence for use of miR-155 inhibitor to treat .

MiR-146b appears to control macrophage activation and cell proliferation.By loading miR-146b mimic on mannose-modified trimethyl chitosan [MTC]-conjugated nanoparticles [NPs] [MTC-miR146b], a molecular targeted immunotherapeutic approach was developed to selectively target intestinal macrophages for mucosal regeneration and tumourigenesis in mouse models.We first confirmed that miR-146b expression was significantly enhanced during mucosal regeneration in a murine  model. Moreover， after mucosal damage, MTC-miR146b mimic-treated wild-type mice had dramatically restored body weight and mucosal barrier function compared with MTC-NC treated mice. Strikingly, MTC-miR146b mimic oral administration protected miR-146b-deficient mice from dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] injury and the -associated cancer process. Mechanistically, miR-146b strongly inhibited M1 macrophage activation by suppressing the Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] signalling pathway, resulting in the repression of the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. More importantly, miR-146b overexpression in bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] in M1 differentiation conditions induced a phenotype similar to  macrophages and improved the proliferation of co-cultured colonic epithelial cells via STAT3-dependent IL-10 production.MTC-miR146b should be regarded as an effective candidate for oral delivery and could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies for ulcerative  and -associated cancer.Copyright © 2018 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative  or colorectal cancer (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of -associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the colon and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the colon of PKM2-Tx mice while PKM2-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5 ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole cancer cells or Lgr5 cells obtained from colon polyps of PKM2-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2-Veh mice. Cancer organoids from PKM2-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in energy metabolism.

Mounting evidence suggests that the predominance of the classically activated (M1) macrophages versus the alternatively activated () macrophages plays a role in the progression of IBD. Thus, agents able to shift pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory  macrophages may be beneficial to IBD. The pentacyclic triterpene Lup-20(29)-en-3β-ol (Lupeol), a potent anti-inflammatory natural product, has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting it is potentially able to modulate macrophage polarization, thereby beneficial to IBD.CD4(+) monocytes were differentiated to M1 or  macrophages, which were cocultured with epithelial cell lines, T84 and Caco-2, in the absence or presence of Lupeol (10μM). Experimental  was induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), with or without oral administration of Lupeol (50mg/kg, q.d.). Cytokines were measured with Luminex kits. M1/ genes were measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Macrophage phenotypes were defined by measuring M1 and  markers with confocal microscopy. Proteins were measured with Western blotting, while cell surface markers were measured with confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. Histology was evaluated with H&E staining.Treatment of M1 macrophages with Lupeol resulted in a marked decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, IL6, IL-1β and TNFα, and a marked increase in the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This was associated with a down-regulation of CD86, a typical marker of M1 macrophages, and an up-regulation of CD206, a typical  macrophage marker. IRF5, a transcription factor that is critically involved in M1 polarization, was down-regulated in M1 macrophages after being incubated with Lupeol, associated with a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. Coculture of epithelial cells with M1 macrophages resulted in down-regulation of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and disruption of epithelial integrity, which were blocked by Lupeol treatment of the M1 macrophages. Moreover, oral administration of Lupeol to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  mice resulted in mitigated intestinal inflammation and increased survival from lethal , associated with decreased expression of M1-related genes and increased expression of -related genes.Lupeol ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease through, at least in part, inhibiting M1 and promoting  macrophages.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Individual diet plans were created for the intervention group according to IgG titers; the control group ate a healthy diet as normal. Observational indices included disease activity, extraintestinal manifestations, nutritional status, and QoL. Relationships between food-specific IgG antibodies and these indices were also analyzed.At baseline, there were no significant differences between the groups. Food-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 70.10% of participants. After intervention, the Mayo score was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (2.41 ± 0.89 vs 3.52 ± 1.15, P < 0.05). The number of patients with extraintestinal manifestations decreased from 7 to 2 in the intervention group and from 6 to 5 in the control group. As for nutritive indices, the intervention group had higher mean body mass index and albumin than the control group (23.88 ± 3.31 vs 21.50 ± 6.24 kg/, respectively, P < 0.05; 48.05 ± 6.39 vs 45.72 ± 5.48 g/L, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas prealbumin and transferrin were not significantly different between the groups. QoL improved after food exclusion (P < 0.05).An IgG-guided exclusion diet ameliorated UC symptoms and improved QoL. Interactions between IgG-based food intolerance and UC warrant further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21277851>Eosinophils express muscarinic receptors and corticotropin-releasing factor to disrupt the mucosal barrier in ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Altered intestinal barrier function has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ulcerative  (UC) in genetic, functional, and epidemiological studies. Mast cells and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) regulate the mucosal barrier in human colon. Because eosinophils are often increased in colon tissues of patients with UC, we assessed interactions among mast cells, CRF, and eosinophils in the mucosal barrier of these patients.Transmucosal fluxes of protein antigens (horseradish peroxidase) and paracellular markers ((51)Cr-EDTA, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000) were studied in noninflamed, colonic mucosal biopsy samples collected from 26 patients with UC and 53 healthy volunteers (controls); samples were mounted in Ussing chambers. We also performed fluorescence and electron microscopy of human tissue samples, assessed isolated eosinophils, and performed mechanistic studies using in vitro cocultured eosinophils (15HL-60), mast cells (HMC-1), and a colonic epithelial cell line (T84).Colon tissues from patients with UC had significant increases in permeability to protein antigens compared with controls. Permeability was blocked by atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist), α-helical CRF(9-41) (a CRF receptor antagonist), and lodoxamide (a mast-cell stabilizer). Eosinophils were increased in number in UC tissues (compared with controls), expressed the most  and M3 muscarinic receptors of any mucosal cell type, and had immunoreactivity to CRF. In coculture studies, carbachol activation of eosinophils caused production of CRF and activation of mast cells, which increased permeability of T84 epithelial cells to macromolecules.We identified a neuroimmune intercellular circuit (from cholinergic nerves, via eosinophils to mast cells) that mediates colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction in patients with UC. This circuit might exacerbate mucosal inflammation.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We and others have shown that TRIM33 is involved in the innate immune response and in the inflammatory response but TRIM33 role in intestinal inflammation is not known. In this study, we investigated the role of TRIM33 in myeloid cells during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced .We study the role of TRIM33 during DSS-induced  which mimics intestinal inflammation using mice deleted for Trim33 only in mature myeloid cells (Trim33 mice) FINDINGS: We first show that Trim33 mRNA level is decreased in CD patient's blood monocytes suggesting a role of TRIM33 in CD. Using Trim33 mice, we show that these mice display an impaired resolution of colonic inflammation with an increased number of blood and colon monocytes and a decreased number of colonic macrophages. Trim33 monocytes are less competent for recruitment and macrophage differentiation. Finally, during resolution of inflammation, Trim33 colonic macrophages display an impaired M1/ switch and express a low level of membrane-bound TNF that is associated with an increased number of colonic neutrophils.Our study shows an important role of TRIM33 in monocytes/macrophages during DSS-induced  and suggests that the decreased expression of TRIM33 in CD patient's blood monocytes might not be a consequence but might be involved in CD progression.

To extend the clinical applicability of these potent nanomedicines, the therapeutic effect of dexamethasone phosphate loaded long-circulating liposomes (LCL-DXP) was evaluated in animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease (CD). In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a model for MS, treatment with LCL-DXP, but not free DXP, resulted in a decrease in disease activity when compared to PBS treated mice. In contrast, in mice with chronic DSS-induced , a model for CD, treatment with LCL-DXP did not induce an improvement, but in fact worsened the fecal blood loss after treatment, indicating an aggravation of the disease. It is hypothesized that modulation of macrophage polarization towards a  phenotype underlies the efficacy of corticosteroid-based drug delivery systems, which is supported by the presented data. On the one hand, M1 polarized macrophages are part of the pathogenesis of MS; the modulation to -polarization by LCL-DXP is therefore beneficial. On the other hand, M1-polarized intestinal macrophages fulfill a protective and inflammation-suppressing role in intestinal homeostasis; changing their phenotype to  causes reduced protection to invading microorganisms, leading to a more severe intestinal inflammation. These findings therefore indicate that the interplay between the specific phenotype of macrophages and the specific inflammatory context of the inflammatory disease in question may be an important determining factor in the therapeutic applicability of liposomal corticosteroids in inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, using two different experimental models, we demonstrated that hCTS-treated mice develop less severe acute . We have also shown the implication of the macrophages in this effect. The aims of this study were to determine (1) whether hCTS treatment could attenuate the reactivation of inflammation in adult mice with previously established chronic ; (2) whether this effect is mediated through macrophages or the gut microbiota. Quiescent  was induced in 7-8-week-old C57BL6 mice using four cycles (2-4%) of dextran sulfate sodium. hCTS (1.5 mg/kg/day) treatment or vehicle started 2 days before the last induction of  and continuing for 7 days. At sacrifice, macro- and microscopic scores were determined. Colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and TNF- α], anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF- β), classically activated (M1) (), and alternatively activated () () macrophages markers were studied using ELISA and/or RT-qPCR. , peritoneal macrophages isolated from naïve mice and treated with hCTS (10 M, 12 h) were exposed to either lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml, 12 h) to polarize M1 macrophages or to IL-4/IL-13 (20 ng/ml) to polarize  macrophages. M1/ macrophage markers along with cytokine gene expression were determined using RT-qPCR. Feces and mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) samples were collected, and the V4 region of 16 s rRNA was sequenced. Micro- and macroscopic scores, colonic IL-6, IL-1β, TNF- α, and M1 macrophages markers were significantly decreased in the hCTS-treated group. Treatment did not have any effect on colonic IL-10, TGF-β, and  markers nor modified the bacterial richness, diversity, or the major phyla in colitic fecal and MAM samples. , pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, as well as their gene expression, were significantly reduced in hCTS-treated M1 macrophages. hCTS treatment did not affect  macrophage markers. These findings suggest that hCTS treatment attenuates the severity of inflammatory relapse through the modulation of the M1 macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453147>NecroX-5 ameliorates inflammation by skewing macrophages to the  phenotype.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the role of NecroX-5, a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, on the functional plasticity of macrophages and the possible underlying mechanism using RAW264.7 cells, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice, and a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced . The change in cell morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The expression of CD206, arginase (Arg)-1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were examined by western blotting. The production of inflammatory cytokines was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and statistical comparisons were made. The results showed that treatment of RAW264.7 cells with NecroX-5 caused an elongated shape in comparison to non-treated cells. The expression levels of macrophage mannose receptor CD206 and Arg-1, specific markers of  cells, were significantly upregulated by NecroX-5 treatment, while those of iNOS (M1 macrophages) was decreased. In addition, NecroX-5 significantly reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, while interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 secretion in the supernatant was significantly enhanced. Treatment with NecroX-5 considerably ameliorated the progression of DSS-induced  and significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that NecroX-5 might dampen inflammation by switching the M1 phenotype to the  phenotype due to IL-4 and IL-13 induction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report that Akt kinases differentially contribute to macrophage polarization, with Akt1 ablation giving rise to an M1 and Akt2 ablation resulting in an  phenotype. Accordingly, Akt2(-/-) mice were more resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  than wild-type mice, whereas Akt1(-/-) mice were more sensitive. Cell depletion and reconstitution experiments in a DSS-induced  model confirmed that the effect was macrophage-dependent. Gene-silencing studies showed that the  phenotype of Akt2(-/-) macrophages was cell autonomous. The microRNA miR-155, whose expression was repressed in naive and in LPS-stimulated Akt2(-/-) macrophages, and its target C/EBPβ appear to play a key role in this process. C/EBPβ, a hallmark of  macrophages that regulates Arg1, was up-regulated upon Akt2 ablation or silencing. Overexpression or silencing of miR-155 confirmed its central role in Akt isoform-dependent M1/ polarization of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005036>Extracellular vesicles derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells attenuate dextran sodium sulfate-induced ulcerative  by promoting  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have shown repairing effects in tissue damage. However, their efficacy and mechanism in the treatment of ulcerative  (UC), a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, are unclear. To investigate the effects and possible mechanism of EVs in UC treatment, we established an in vitro model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages and an in vivo dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model to mimic UC. In vitro, EVs promoted the proliferation and suppressed inflammatory response in LPS-induced macrophages, as demonstrated by the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12) and down-regulation of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. In the in vivo model, EV administration ameliorated the symptoms of UC by reducing weight loss, disease activity index, and colon mucosa damage and severity while increasing colon length. This was additionally accompanied by the increase in IL-10 and TGF-β levels and the decline in VEGF-A, IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, CCL-24, and CCL-17 levels. In terms of the mechanism, EVs promoted -like macrophage polarization, characterized by the increase in the  marker CD163. Furthermore, the positive effect of EVs on UC repair seemed to be related to the JAK1/STAT1/STAT6 signaling pathway. Collectively, BMSC-derived EVs exerted positive therapeutic effects against DSS-induced UC, which could be due to a negative inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We used a T cell transfer model of  to compare the capacity of iTreg and Th17 cells to develop in situ following the transfer of naive CD4(+)CD45RB(hi)T cells intoRag1(-/-)C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice, the prototypical Th1/M1- and Th2/-prone strains. We found that the frequency and number of Foxp3(+)iTreg cells and Th17 cells were significantly reduced in C57BL/6 mice compared with the BALB/c strain. C57BL/6 mice with  were also resistant to natural Treg cell immunotherapy. Pretreatment of C57BL/6Rag1(-/-)mice with IL-4 plus IL-13, or with M2a but not M1 macrophages, dramatically increased the generation of iTreg and Th17 cells. Importantly, M2a transfers, either as a pretreatment or in mice with established , allowed successful immunotherapy with natural Treg cells. M2a macrophages also reduced the generation of pathogenic iTreg cells that lost Foxp3 expression, suggesting that they stabilize the expression of Foxp3. Thus, polarized M2a macrophages drive a directionally concordant expansion of the iTreg-Th17 cell axis and can be exploited as a therapeutic adjuvant in cell-transfer immunotherapy to re-establish mucosal tolerance.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p></html>
