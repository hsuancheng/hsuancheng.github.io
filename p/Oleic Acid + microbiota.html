Its volatile organic compounds (VOCs) possibly contribute to the characteristic odour in humans, as well as to  interaction. The aim of this study was to investigate how the lipid composition of the liquid medium influences the production of VOCs. Growth was performed in four media: (1) mDixon, (2)  (OA), (3)  + palmitic  (OA+PA), and (4) palmitic  (PA). The profiles of the VOCs were characterized by HS-SPME/GC-MS in the exponential and stationary phases. A total number of 61 VOCs was found in , among which alkanes, alcohols, ketones, and furanic compounds were the most abundant. Some compounds previously reported for  (γ-dodecalactone, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, and hexan-1-ol) were also found. Through our experiments, using univariate and multivariate unsupervised (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)) statistical techniques, we have proven that each tested growth medium stimulates the production of a different volatiles profile in . Carbon dioxide, hexan-1-ol, pentyl acetate, isomer5 of methyldecane, dimethyl sulphide, undec-5-ene, isomer2 of methylundecane, isomer1 of methyldecane, and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran were established as differentiating compounds among treatments by all the techniques. The significance of our findings deserves future research to investigate if certain volatile profiles could be related to the beneficial or pathogenic role of this yeast.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25992463>Lipid hydrolysis products affect the composition of infant gut microbial communities in vitro.</a></h2><p>Some lipid hydrolysis products such as medium-chained NEFA (MC-NEFA), sphingosine and monoacylglycerols (MAG) possess antibacterial activity, while others, including , are essential for the optimal growth of Lactobacillus species. Thus, changes in the concentrations of NEFA and MAG in the distal ileum and colon can potentially selectively modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, especially in early life when lipid absorption efficacy is reduced. As medium-chained fatty acids are enriched in mothers' milk, such effects may be highly relevant during gut colonisation. In the present study, we examined the effect of selected NEFA, MAG and sphingosine on the composition of faecal microbial communities derived from infants aged 2-5 months during a 24 h anaerobic in vitro fermentation. We tested lipid mixtures in the concentration range of 0-200 μm, either based on MC-NEFA (10 : 0 to 14 : 0 and MAG 12 : 0) or long-chained NEFA (LC-NEFA; 16 : 0 to 18 : 1 and MAG 16 : 0) with and without sphingosine, representing lipid hydrolysis products characteristic for intestinal hydrolysis of breast milk lipids. Ion Torrent sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene revealed that the relative abundance of lactic -producing genera, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was generally increased in the presence of 50 μm or higher concentrations of MC-NEFA. For Bifidobacterium, the same effect was also observed in the presence of a mixture containing LC-NEFA with sphingosine. On the contrary, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was significantly decreased in the presence of both lipid mixtures. Our findings suggest that the high concentration of medium-chained fatty acids in breast milk might have functional effects on the establishment of the gut microbiota in early life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27301664>Comprehensive pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial  of the skin of patients with seborrheic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory dermatologic condition in which erythema and itching develop on areas of the body with sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face and chest. The inflammation is evoked directly by , which is hydrolyzed from sebum by lipases secreted by skin microorganisms. Although the skin fungal genus, Malassezia, is thought to be the causative agent of SD, analysis of the bacterial  of skin samples of patients with SD is necessary to clarify any association with Malassezia because the skin  comprises diverse bacterial and fungal genera. In the present study, bacterial microbiotas were analyzed at non-lesional and lesional sites of 24 patients with SD by pyrosequencing and qPCR. Principal coordinate analysis revealed clear separation between the  of non-lesional and lesional sites. Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium were abundant at both sites. Propionibacterium was abundant at non-lesional sites, whereas Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus predominated at lesional sites; however, the extent of Propionibacterium colonization did not differ significantly between lesional and non-lesional sites according to qPCR. Given that these abundant bacteria hydrolyze sebum, they may also contribute to SD development. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial microbiotas of the skin of SD patients.© 2016 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30243517>Inhibitory effect of the gut microbial linoleic  metabolites, 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic  and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic , on BV-2 microglial cell activation.</a></h2><p>10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic  (KetoC) and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA) are long-chain fatty acids generated from linoleic  by the gut lactic  bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum. These fatty acids have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity in the intestine. However, little is known about their effects in the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of these fatty acids on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory processes in mouse microglial cells (BV-2 cells). KetoC and HYA inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase in BV-2 cells. NO changes in these inhibitory effects were observed with AH7614, a G-protein coupled receptor 120 antagonist, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors antagonists, GW6471 and GW9662. In addition, KetoC and HYA did not inhibit translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, or IκB degradation. Similarly, no effect on p38 or JNK phosphorylation was observed. However, KetoC and HYA were found to inhibit ERK phosphorylation induced by LPS, suggesting that these fatty acids may exert their anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of ERK activation in microglial cells.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

PLFs at a concentration of 0 (control, CON) and 15 mg/250 mg dry matter (DM) were mixed with 30 mL of buffered rumen fluid and were incubated for 24 h. Methane (CH4) production (mL/250 mg DM) was the highest (P < 0.05) for CON (7.65) and lowest for the chloroform fraction (5.41) compared to those of other PLFs at 24 h of incubation. Acetate to propionate ratio was the lowest for PLFs compared to that of CON. Supplementation of the diet with PLFs significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the rate of BH of C18:1n-9 (; OA), C18:2n-6 (linoleic ; LA), and C18:3n-3 (α-linolenic ; LNA) compared to that of CON after 24 h of incubation.

Dark Agouti 2-month old rats (25 males) were divided into five groups: (i) control group, (ii) EAE group, (iii) EAE+EVOO, (iv) EAE+HT, and (v) EAE+OA. At 65 days, the animals were sacrificed and the glutathione redox system and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) products of the  in brain, spinal cord, and blood were evaluated.

In addition, it reduced the levels of LPS and LBP, which appeared as being increased in the EAE correlated with the oxidative stress produced by the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581036>Structure-function relationship of the milk fat globule.</a></h2><p>The complex biochemical composition and physical structure of the milk fat globule (MFG) are presented as a basis for its paradoxical metabolic fate: MFG is a rapid conveyor of energy through its triacylglycerol (TAG) core but contains some low-digestible bioactive complex lipids and proteins, which influence lipid metabolism and contribute to intestinal and systemic health.MFG structure modulates gastrointestinal lipolysis, postprandial lipemia and even the postprandial fate of ingested fatty acids. Proof-of-concept of the nutritional programming induced by early consumption of an emulsion biomimetic of MFG compared with a typical infant formula was published in an animal model (mice). The metabolic response to a high-fat diet during adulthood was improved following neonatal exposure to the biomimetic emulsion.MFG TAG are tailored with a unique regiodistribution delivering in priority short to medium-chain fatty acids in gastric phase, an important amount of quickly metabolizable  and protecting palmitic  in sn-2 position. MFG digestion may not only trigger rapid TAG and chylomicron plasma peaks with fast clearance but also the luminal release of nonhydrolysable bioactive compounds (glycosylated compounds and sphingomyelin), which contribute to intestinal and systemic health by shaping the  and modulating the immune system. These bioactive compounds form self-assembled structures, protect specific micronutrients and lower cholesterol absorption.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of an -derived compound (S1) and a combination of n-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA, S2) to modulate both body weight and the GM in HFD-induced obese mice. A total of eighty mice were fed either a control diet or a HFD, non-supplemented or supplemented with S1 or S2. At week 19, faeces were collected in order to analyse the GM. Group-specific primers for accurate quantification of several major bacterial groups from faecal samples were assayed using quantitative PCR. The HFD induced an increase in body weight, which was reduced by supplementation with S1. Furthermore, S1 supplementation markedly increased total bacterial density and restored the proportions of bacteria that were increased (i.e. clostridial cluster XIVa and Enterobacteriales) or decreased (i.e. Bifidobacterium spp.) during HFD feeding. S2 supplementation significantly increased the quantities of Firmicutes (especially the Lactobacillus group). Correlation analysis revealed that body weight correlated positively with the phylum Firmicutes and clostridial cluster XIVa, and negatively with the phylum Bacteroidetes. In conclusion, the consumption of a HFD induced changes in the faecal , which were associated with the appearance of an obese phenotype. Supplementation of the HFD with S1 counteracted HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, together with an improvement in body weight. These data support a role for certain fatty acids as interesting nutrients related to obesity prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493085>Alterations in the porcine colon  induced by the gastrointestinal nematode Trichuris suis.</a></h2><p>Helminth parasites ensure their survival by regulating host immunity through mechanisms that dampen inflammation. These properties have recently been exploited therapeutically to treat human diseases. The biocomplexity of the intestinal lumen suggests that interactions between the parasite and the intestinal  would also influence inflammation. In this study, we characterized the  in the porcine proximal colon in response to Trichuris suis (whipworm) infection using 16S rRNA gene-based and whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. A 21-day T. suis infection in four pigs induced a significant change in the composition of the proximal colon  compared to that of three parasite-naive pigs. Among the 15 phyla identified, the abundances of Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres were changed in infected pigs. The abundances of approximately 13% of genera were significantly altered by infection. Changes in relative abundances of Succinivibrio and Mucispirillum, for example, may relate to alterations in carbohydrate metabolism and niche disruptions in mucosal interfaces induced by parasitic infection, respectively. Of note, infection by T. suis led to a significant shift in the metabolic potential of the proximal colon , where 26% of all metabolic pathways identified were affected. Besides carbohydrate metabolism, lysine biosynthesis was repressed as well. A metabolomic analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the luminal contents showed a relative absence in infected pigs of cofactors for carbohydrate and lysine biosynthesis, as well as an accumulation of , suggesting altered fatty  absorption contributing to local inflammation. Our findings should facilitate development of strategies for parasitic control in pigs and humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27777570>Interactions between Obesity Status and Dietary Intake of Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Oils on Human Gut Microbiome Profiles in the Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial (COMIT).</a></h2><p>Long-term dietary fatty  intake is believed to induce changes in the human gut microbiome which might be associated with human health or obesity status; however, considerable debate remains regarding the most favorable ratios of fatty acids to optimize these processes. The objective of this sub-study of a double-blinded randomized crossover clinical study, the canola oil multi-center intervention trial, was to investigate effects of five different novel oil blends fed for 30 days each on the intestinal  in 25 volunteers with risk of metabolic syndrome. The 60 g treatments included three MUFA-rich diets: (1) conventional canola oil (Canola); (2) DHA-enriched high  canola oil (CanolaDHA); (3) high  canola oil (CanolaOleic); and two PUFA-rich diets: (4) a blend of corn/saﬄower oil (25:75) (CornSaff); and (5) a blend of flax/saﬄower oil (60:40) (FlaxSaff). Stool samples were collected at the end of each period. DNA was extracted and amplified for 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. A total of 17 phyla and 187 genera were identified. While five novel oil treatments failed to alter bacterial phyla composition, obese participants resulted in a higher proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes than overweight or normal weight groups ( = 0.01). Similarly at the genus level, overall bacterial distribution was highly associated with subjects' body mass index (BMI). Treatment effects were observed between MUFA- and PUFA-rich diets, with the three MUFA diets elevating , and Enterobacteriaceae's populations, while the two PUFA-rich diets favored the higher abundance of . High MUFA content feedings also resulted in an increase of  and a decrease of  in obese, but not overweight subjects. Data suggest that BMI is a predominant factor in characterization of human gut  profile, and that MUFA-rich and PUFA-rich diets impact the composition of gut  at lower taxonomical levels mainly in obese subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855510>Effect of different types of olive oil pomace dietary supplementation on the rumen microbial community profile in Comisana ewes.</a></h2><p>Olive oil pomace (OOP) is a bio-waste rich in highly soluble polyphenols. OOP has been proposed as an additive in ruminant feeding to modulate rumen fermentations. Three groups of ewes were fed the following different diets: a control diet and two diets supplemented with OOP, obtained with a two-phase (OOP2) or three-phase (OOP3) olive milling process. Rumen liquor (RL) showed a higher content of 18:3 cis9 cis12 cis15 (α-linolenic , α-LNA) with OOP2 inclusion, and of 18:2 cis9 trans11 (rumenic , RA) with OOP3 inclusion. The overall composition of the RL  did not differ among treatments. Significant differences, between control and treated groups, were found for six bacterial taxa. In particular, RL  from animals fed OOPs showed a reduction in Anaerovibrio, a lipase-producing bacterium. The decrease in the Anaerovibrio genus may lead to a reduction in lipolysis, thus lowering the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids available for biohydrogenation. Milk from animals fed OOP showed a higher content of 18:1 cis9 (, OA) but the α-LNA concentration was increased in milk from animals treated with OOP2 only. Therefore, inclusion of OOP in ruminant diets may be a tool to ameliorate the nutritional characteristics of milk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514066>Lactobacillus gasseri in the Upper Small Intestine Impacts an ACSL3-Dependent Fatty -Sensing Pathway Regulating Whole-Body Glucose Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-dependent upper small intestinal lipid metabolism activates pre-absorptive pathways to regulate metabolic homeostasis, but whether changes in the upper small intestinal  alter specific fatty -dependent pathways to impact glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We here first find that upper small intestinal infusion of Intralipid, , or linoleic  pre-absorptively increases glucose tolerance and lowers glucose production in rodents. High-fat feeding impairs pre-absorptive fatty  sensing and reduces upper small intestinal Lactobacillus gasseri levels and ACSL3 expression. Transplantation of healthy upper small intestinal  to high-fat-fed rodents restores L. gasseri levels and fatty  sensing via increased ACSL3 expression, while L. gasseri probiotic administration to non-transplanted high-fat-fed rodents is sufficient to restore upper small intestinal ACSL3 expression and fatty  sensing. In summary, we unveil a glucoregulatory role of upper small intestinal L. gasseri that impacts an ACSL3-dependent glucoregulatory fatty -sensing pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of KetoA [10-oxo-12()-octadecenoic ]-a linoleic  metabolite produced by gut lactic  bacteria-on whole-body energy metabolism and found that dietary intake of KetoA could enhance energy expenditure in mice, thereby protecting mice from diet-induced obesity. By using Ca imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp methods, KetoA was noted to potently activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and enhance noradrenalin turnover in adipose tissues. In addition, KetoA up-regulated genes that are related to brown adipocyte functions, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT), which was later diminished in the presence of a β-adrenoreceptor blocker. By using obese and diabetic model KK-Ay mice, we further show that KetoA intake ameliorated obesity-associated metabolic disorders. In the absence of any observed KetoA-induced antiobesity effect or UCP1 up-regulation in TRPV1-deficient mice, we prove that the antiobesity effect of KetoA was caused by TRPV1 activation-mediated browning in WAT.

A significant part of the retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequences was most similar to those of uncultured bacteria. Bacteria corresponding to predominant DGGE bands in t-VA enrichment cultures clustered with t-VA biohydrogenated bacteria within Group B.This study provides more insight into the pathway of biohydrogenation.

In this study, a combination of the pyrosequencing and the mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques were used to investigate the effects of a raw potato starch (RPS, high in resistant starch) diet on microbial composition and microbial metabolites in the hindgut of pig. The results showed that Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter increased significantly, while Sarcina and Clostridium decreased in relative abundances in the hindgut of pigs fed RPS. The metabolimic analysis revealed that RPS significantly affected starch and sucrose metabolites, amino  turnover or protein biosynthesis, lipid metabolites, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, inositol phosphate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, a Pearson's correlation analysis showed that Ruminococcus and Coprococcus were positively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate, maltose, arachidonic , 9, 12-octadecadienoic , , phosphate, but negatively correlated with α-aminobutyric . However, the correlation of Clostridium and Sarcina with these compounds was in the opposite direction.

Oleate (C18:1) is generally the dominant LCFA in lipid-containing wastewater, and its conversion in anaerobic bioreactors results in palmitate (C16:0) accumulation. The reason why oleate is continuously converted to palmitate without further degradation via β-oxidation is still unknown. In this work, the influence of methanogenic activity in the initial conversion steps of unsaturated LCFA was studied in 10 bioreactors continuously operated with saturated or unsaturated C16- and C18-LCFA, in the presence or absence of the methanogenic inhibitor bromoethanesulfonate (BrES). Saturated Cn-2-LCFA accumulated both in the presence and absence of BrES during the degradation of unsaturated Cn-LCFA, and represented more than 50% of total LCFA. In the presence of BrES further conversion of saturated intermediates did not proceed, not even when prolonged batch incubation was applied. As the initial steps of unsaturated LCFA degradation proceed uncoupled from methanogenesis, accumulation of saturated LCFA can be expected. Analysis of the active microbial communities suggests a role for facultative anaerobic bacteria in the initial steps of unsaturated LCFA biodegradation. Understanding this role is now imperative to optimize methane production from LCFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491982>Effects of Macronutrients on the In Vitro Production of ClpB, a Bacterial Mimetic Protein of α-MSH and Its Possible Role in Satiety Signaling.</a></h2><p>Gut  can influence the feeding behavior of the host, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recently, caseinolytic protease B (ClpB), a disaggregation chaperon protein of , was identified as a conformational mimetic of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide. Importantly, ClpB was necessary for  to have an anorexigenic effect in mice, suggesting that it may participate in satiety signaling. To explore this further, we determined the short-term (2 h) effects of three macronutrients: protein (bovine serum albumin), carbohydrate (D-fructose) and fat (), on the production of ClpB by  and analyzed whether ClpB can stimulate the secretion of the intestinal satiety hormone, peptide YY (PYY). Isocaloric amounts of all three macronutrients added to a continuous culture of  increased ClpB immunoreactivity. However, to increase the levels of ClpB mRNA and ClpB protein in bacteria and supernatants, supplementation with protein was required. A nanomolar concentration of recombinant  ClpB dose-dependently stimulated PYY secretion from the primary cell cultures of rat intestinal mucosa.

In  palmy oil higher content of  mono unsaturated fatty  and  triglycerides than in creamy fat is established. The biologic availability of palmitic unsaturated palmitic  in the form of free fatty  is decreased at its absorption by enterocytes of small intestines is detected. There are no transforms of mono unsaturated acids in palmy oil in contrast with hydrogenated margarines. In palmy,  oil there is not enough of short-chained fatty acids (C4-C6) and it has no taste quality and it has low level of unsaturated fatty acids and factually it is lacking of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, it is compensated in case of availability offish and sea products in food. If adults, especially older ones, will refuse to consume creamy fat and decrease intake of products with high content of palmitic unsaturated fatty  and palmitic triglycerides (beef, sour cream, fatty cheeses) it'll positively impact their health. The refusal from these products is a real step in prevention of metabolic pandemic (atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, metabolic syndrome, resistance to insulin, obesity).

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut  and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut  and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784489>Impact of multi-functional fermented goat milk beverage on gut  in a dynamic colon model.</a></h2><p>The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of grape probiotic fermented beverages made of goat milk, with or without added grape pomace on gut  in a Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®). SHIME® model was used to investigate to assess changes in microbial composition and fermentation metabolites (short- and branched-chain fatty acids and ammonium), as well as under the antioxidant capacity. The results demonstrated that the beverages formulated, with or without grape pomace extract, exhibited high dietary fiber, , phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity. Both beverages also kept L. rhamnosus and S. thermophilus viable during their passage through the intestinal tract and had a positive effect on gut  metabolism, increasing the antioxidant capacity and the production of short-chain fatty acids, and decreasing the ammonium concentration. Therefore, the multifunctional beverages formulated in this study can offer a new perspective for the production of foods with positive potential effects on human health.Copyright © 2017.

Three formulations were prepared by the emulsion/solvent evaporation method. The nanocapsules showed a mean size distribution around 400 nm, with polydispersity below 0.2 and were stable for 120 days. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity results showed an increase in toxicity of the  + neem formulations according to the amount of  used. The minimum inhibitory concentrations demonstrated that all the formulations containing neem oil were active. The nanocapsules containing neem oil did not affect the soil  during 300 days of exposure compared to the control. Phytotoxicity studies indicated that NC_20 (200 mg of neem oil) did not affect the net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of maize plants, whereas use of NC_10 (100:100 of neem:) and NC_15 (150:50 of neem:) led to negative effects on these physiological parameters. Hence, the use of  as a complement in the nanocapsules was not a good strategy, since the nanocapsules that only contained neem oil showed lower toxicity.

One hundred eighty 1-day-old Cobb-500 broilers were allotted to 3 groups. All groups received a basal diet consisting of maize, wheat, soybean meal, and a fat source (4.5, 7.0, 7.6, and 8.0% of fat product in the diet during d 1 to 9, 10 to 17, 18 to 27, and 28 to 35, respectively) until 35 d of age. The diet of the control group contained a fat with 67% of  and linoleic  and 1.4% of C12 and C14 of total fatty acids, that of the esterified lauric and myristic  (ELA) group a fat with 33% of esterified C12 and C14 and that of the free lauric and myristic  (FLA) group a fat with 31% of both esterified and free (1:1) C12 and C14 (6 replicates/treatment, 10 birds/replicate). Gain and feed consumption did not differ between groups, but feed:gain was lower in FLA group as compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Carcass weight, liver weight, triglyceride content of liver and muscle, and muscle cholesterol were similar between groups; however, breast muscle weight was higher in the FLA than in the control group (P < 0.05). The villus height:crypt depth ratio of the duodenal wall did not differ between groups, but in the jejunum, it was lower in the FLA group as compared to the control group (P < 0.05). DNA copy numbers of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni in jejunal digesta were similar among groups. The study shows that dietary fats rich in free C12 and C14 improved feed:gain and breast muscle yield, but the observed effects could not be conclusively explained based on the parameters measured. The decreased jejunal villi:crypt ratio may point to changes in gut protein or cell turnover.© 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463380>Metronidazole-Loaded Polyethyleneimine and Chitosan-Based Liquid Crystalline System for Treatment of Staphylococcal Skin Infections.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus is a common gram-positive bacterium of the human skin . It is also a dangerous pathogen that can cause serious and even lethal skin infections. The topical administration of metronidazole via nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, such as liquid crystalline systems, can modulate both the drug permeation and activity, decreasing its side effects and increasing the drug potent activity against the gram-positive bacteria. This study aimed at: (1) structurally developing and characterizing a liquid crystalline systems composed of chitosan and polyethyleneimine dispersion as the aqueous phase,  as the oily phase, and ethoxylated and propoxylated cetyl alcohol as the surfactant (FPC) for metronidazole incorporation (0.5% w/w); (2) evaluating the in vitro release and skin permeation and retention properties of the metronidazole-loaded liquid crystalline systems (FPC-M); (3) investigating the in vitro antibacterial activity of FPC-M against Staphylococcus aureus. Polarised light microscopy indicated that both FPC and FPC-M are hexagonal systems. Rheological, texture, and bioadhesion assays showed that both are elastic and bioadhesive systems. According to the results of the in vitro release, permeation, and retention assays, FPC can modulate metronidazole release and allow metronidazole to stay for a longer time on the skin. The determination of FPC-M activity against Staphylococcus aureus showed that it could target the bacterial cell. In conclusion, the liquid crystalline systems developed in this study can improve the clinical performance of metronidazole in the treatment of staphylococcal skin infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240835>Correlation of diet,  and metabolite networks in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been widely reported. The gut  connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut  composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut  were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and ) and medium-chain fatty acids (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites.

In this work, a selective process using carbon feast-famine cycles was applied to obtain an indigenous microbial community of hydrocarbon-degrading and lipid-accumulating bacteria, using a real lubricant-based wastewater as carbon source. In the conditions applied, the enriched bacterial community, dominated by members of the genus Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, was able to degrade almost all hydrocarbons present in the wastewater within 24 h' incubation and to accumulate, although in low levels, triacylglycerol (TAG) (<5% of cell dry weight (CDW)) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.8% ± 1.1% of the CDW) as well as an unknown lipid (29% ± 6% of CDW), presumably a wax ester-like compound. The influence of culture conditions, namely carbon and nitrogen concentrations (and C/N ratio) and cultivation time, on the amount and profile of produced storage compounds was further assessed using a statistical approach based on a central composite circumscribed design and surface response methodology. The regression analysis of the experimental design revealed that only nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio are significant for neutral lipid biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Maximum neutral lipid content, i.e. 33% (CDW basis), was achieved for the lowest carbon and nitrogen concentrations evaluated (10 g COD L and 0.02 g N L). PHA accounted for less than 5% of CDW. In these conditions, neutral lipid content was mainly composed by TAG, about 70% (w/w). TAG precursors, namely monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and fatty acids (FA), accounted for 22% of total neutral lipids and WE for about 7%. Nevertheless, according to the applied response surface model, further improvement of neutral lipids content is still possible if even lower nitrogen concentrations are used. The fatty acids detected in TAG extracts ranged from myristic  (C14:0) to linoleic  (C18:2), being the most abundant palmitic  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0) and  (C18:1). This study shows the feasibility of combining treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated wastewater, herein demonstrated for lubricant-based wastewater, with the production of bacterial neutral lipids using open mixed bacterial communities. This approach can decrease the costs associated to both processes and contribute to a more sustainable waste management and production of lipid-based biofuels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by palmitic  (C, 54.42%),  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C, arachidonic  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. These microbes were involved in short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production and other functions, and significantly increased at 13-15 d after breastfeeding was initiated. C and DHA were relevant to most of the microbes. This study demonstrated the relatively steady profiles of sn-2 FAs in breast milk and gut  of infants, together with their correlation during the breastfeeding period. The above results provided important information for designing the configuration of FAs in next-generation formulas for Chinese infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615022>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Modifies the Changes Induced in Non-Nervous Organs and Tissues by Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Models.</a></h2><p>This study reveals the existence of oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) in non-nervous organs and tissues in multiple sclerosis (MS) by means of a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats. This model reproduces a similar situation to MS, as well as its relationship with intestinal  starting from the changes in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) in the outer wall of the gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the administration of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytirosol (HT), and  (OA) exert beneficial effects.

The glutathione redox system with the EAE was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and small and large intestines. The LPS and the correlation with oxidative stress in the small and large intestines were also investigated. The results showed that (1) the oxidative damage in the EAE model affects non-nervous organs and tissues; (2) The LPS is related to inflammatory phenomena and oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue and in other organs; (3) The administration of EVOO, HT, and OA reduces the LPS levels at the same time as minimizing the oxidative damage; (4) EVOO, HT, and OA improve the disease's clinical score; and (5) on balance, EVOO offers a better neuroprotective effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29386622>Taxonomy of anaerobic digestion microbiome reveals biases associated with the applied high throughput sequencing strategies.</a></h2><p>In the past few years, many studies investigated the anaerobic digestion microbiome by means of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Results obtained from these studies were compared to each other without taking into consideration the followed procedure for amplicons preparation and data analysis. This negligence was mainly due to the lack of knowledge regarding the biases influencing specific steps of the microbiome investigation process. In the present study, the main technical aspects of the 16S rRNA analysis were checked giving special attention to the approach used for high throughput sequencing. More specifically, the microbial compositions of three laboratory scale biogas reactors were analyzed before and after addition of sodium oleate by sequencing the microbiome with three different approaches: 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun DNA and shotgun RNA. This comparative analysis revealed that, in amplicon sequencing, abundance of some taxa (Euryarchaeota and Spirochaetes) was biased by the inefficiency of universal primers to hybridize all the templates. Reliability of the results obtained was also influenced by the number of hypervariable regions under investigation. Finally, amplicon sequencing and shotgun DNA underestimated the Methanoculleus genus, probably due to the low 16S rRNA gene copy number encoded in this taxon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27426954>Characterization of aerobic oil and grease-degrading bacteria in wastewater.</a></h2><p>A bacterial consortium that degrades cooking oil (CO) has been isolated in wastewater (WW) samples, by enrichment in olive CO.

Here, we used 16S rRNA analysis and metabolomics to analyze the effect of GOS on  and metabolites. Results show that the abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Oscillibacter decreased significantly in GOS-fed mice. Twenty-one metabolites, including , arachidic , and behenic , decreased significantly in the GOS-fed mice. Fatty  synthesis and blood triglyceride content significantly decreased in the GOS-fed mice compared with those in the control mice, suggesting that GOS may improve lipid metabolism in mice. Additionally, after three weeks of a GOS-rich diet, the mouse  was significantly enriched in Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, and Parasutterella. The blood glucose level of the GOS-fed group was significantly higher than that of the control group, whereas the abundance of Coprococcus and Odoribacter (butyrate-producing bacteria) was significantly decreased. The metabolism of butyrate, known to reduce plasma glucose levels, was significantly downregulated in the GOS-fed mice, an effect potentially detrimental to the glucose metabolism of the host. This dual-omics analysis provided important information on the changes in host-microbe-metabolite interactions resulting from GOS supplementation. Our results provide evidence that GOS may improve lipid metabolism, and that long-term GOS supplementation had a detrimental effect on the host's glucose metabolism, which could be important for optimizing methods of prebiotic supplementation and developing approaches to prevent diseases using prebiotic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23450515>Health effects of olive oil polyphenols: recent advances and possibilities for the use of health claims.</a></h2><p>The Mediterranean diet and consumption of olive oil have been connected in several studies with longevity and a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle, such as regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and the existing social cohesion in Southern European countries have been recognised as candidate protective factors that may explain the Mediterranean Paradox. Along with some other characteristics of the Mediterranean diet, the use of olive oil as the main source of fat is common in Southern European countries. The benefits of consuming olive oil have been known since antiquity and were traditionally attributed to its high content in . However, it is now well established that these effects must also be attributed to the phenolic fraction of olive oil with its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities. The mechanisms of these activities are varied and probably interconnected. For some activities of olive oil phenolic compounds, the evidence is already strong enough to enable the legal use of health claims on foods.

Together, gut microbiome analysis using Illumina sequencing showed that there were significant differences in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and abundance of Roseburia, Lachnospiraceae, and Bifidobacterium between the aging and supplemental procyanidin B2 groups. In summary, procyanidin B2 possessed potential prevention of the cognitive and oxidative impairment via the metabolic pathway regulation related to citrate cycle, fatty , and bile  in the aged mice, accompanied by remodeling the gut flora.Copyright © 2018.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut  in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the  modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut , most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the  alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the  by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The main CLA products in faecal suspensions, rumenic  (cis-9,trans-11-CLA; RA) and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, were labelled at C-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. Traces of trans-10,cis-12-CLA formed were labelled to a much lower extent. In pure culture, Bifidobacterium breve NCFB 2258 formed labelled RA and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, Roseburia hominis A2-183T, Roseburia inulinivorans A2-192T and Ruminococcus obeum-like strain A2-162 converted LA to VA, labelled in a manner indicating that VA was formed via C-13-labelled RA. Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii DSM 4902T, a possible probiotic, formed mainly RA with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-CLA and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, labelled the same as in the mixed . Ricinoleic  (12-OH-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form CLA in the mixed , in contrast to CLA formation described for Lactobacillus plantarum. These results were similar to those reported for the mixed  of the rumen. Thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of RA formation via a 10-OH-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different CLA isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. A hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-OH-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-CLA formation in pure and mixed cultures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394805>Effects of Olive Oil and Its Minor Components on Cardiovascular Diseases, Inflammation, and Gut .</a></h2><p>Olive oil is one of the main ingredients in the Mediterranean diet, being an important ally in disease prevention. Its nutritional composition is comprised of mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, with  being the major , plus minor components which act as effective antioxidants, such as hydroxytyrosol. Studies have shown that the consumption of olive oil, as well as its isolated components or in synergism, can be a primary and secondary protective factor against the development of cardiovascular diseases since it reduces the concentrations of low-density lipoproteins and increases the concentration of high-density lipoproteins. Furthermore, it exerts an influence on the inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, which are pro-inflammatory agents in the body. The components present in olive oil are also associated with the promotion of intestinal health since they stimulate a higher biodiversity of beneficial gut bacteria, enhancing their balance. The objective of this review is to present recent data on investigated effects of olive oil and its components on the metabolism, focused on cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and gut biota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899364>A bacterial metabolite ameliorates periodontal pathogen-induced gingival epithelial barrier disruption via GPR40 signaling.</a></h2><p>Several studies have demonstrated the remarkable properties of  and their metabolites in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a bioactive metabolite generated by probiotic microorganisms during the process of fatty  metabolism, has been studied for its protective effects against epithelial barrier impairment in the intestines. Herein, we examined the effect of HYA on gingival epithelial barrier function and its possible application for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. We found that GPR40, a fatty  receptor, was expressed on gingival epithelial cells; activation of GPR40 by HYA significantly inhibited barrier impairment induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, a representative periodontopathic bacterium. The degradation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, basic components of the epithelial barrier, was prevented in a GPR40-dependent manner in vitro. Oral inoculation of HYA in a mouse experimental periodontitis model suppressed the bacteria-induced degradation of E-cadherin and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production in the gingival tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that HYA exerts a protective function, through GPR40 signaling, against periodontopathic bacteria-induced gingival epithelial barrier impairment and contributes to the suppression of inflammatory responses in periodontal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634462>Time-dependent alteration to the tight junction structure of distal intestinal epithelia in type 2 prediabetic mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) intake has been associated with changes in intestinal  composition, increased intestinal permeability, and onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the , after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

We observed that Corynebacterium spp. are overrepresented in children free of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a common pediatric nasal colonizer and an important infectious agent. Corynebacterium accolens, a benign lipid-requiring species, inhibits pneumococcal growth during in vitro cocultivation on medium supplemented with human skin surface triacylglycerols (TAGs) that are likely present in the nostrils. This inhibition depends on LipS1, a TAG lipase necessary for C. accolens growth on TAGs such as triolein. We determined that C. accolens hydrolysis of triolein releases , which inhibits pneumococcus, as do other free fatty acids (FFAs) that might be released by LipS1 from human skin surface TAGs. Our results support a model in which C. accolens hydrolyzes skin surface TAGS in vivo releasing antipneumococcal FFAs. These data indicate that C. accolens may play a beneficial role in sculpting the human microbiome.Little is known about how harmless Corynebacterium species that colonize the human nose and skin might impact pathogen colonization and proliferation at these sites. We show that Corynebacterium accolens, a common benign nasal bacterium, modifies its local habitat in vitro as it inhibits growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae by releasing antibacterial free fatty acids from host skin surface triacylglycerols. We further identify the primary C. accolens lipase required for this activity. We postulate a model in which higher numbers of C. accolens cells deter/limit S. pneumoniae nostril colonization, which might partly explain why children without S. pneumoniae colonization have higher levels of nasal Corynebacterium. This work narrows the gap between descriptive studies and the needed in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbe-microbe interactions that help shape the human microbiome. It also lays the foundation for future in vivo studies to determine whether habitat modification by C. accolens could be promoted to control pathogen colonization.Copyright © 2016 Bomar et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29488634>Analysis of growth and lipid production characteristics of Chlorella vulgaris in artificially constructed consortia with symbiotic bacteria.</a></h2><p>The aim was to study the effect of artificially constructed consortia of microalgae-bacterial symbionts on growth and lipid production by Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), as well as the inter-relationship between microalgae and bacterial in a photoautotrophic system. The results showed that compared to an axenic culture of C. vulgaris, H1 co-culture system (axenic C. vulgaris-Stenotrophomona smaltophilia) had the strongest effect on the C. vulgaris growth. The biomass, specific growth rate and maximum productivity of C. vulgaris were increased by 21.9, 20.4, and 18%, respectively. The bacteria in co-culture system had a significant effect on the accumulation of lipid and fatty  components of C. vulgaris: the content of lipid was increased by 8.2-33.83%, and the components of the saturated fatty acids and  acids also had an obvious improvement. The results indicate that the microalgae-bacterial co-culture system can improve microalgal biomass and the quality of biodiesel.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
