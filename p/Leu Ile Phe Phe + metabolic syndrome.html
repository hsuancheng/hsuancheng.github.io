Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory  virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (, , Lys, Met, , Thr, Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and Thr was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased Val flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, , Val, and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in Thr and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, Thr, and Val requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Metabolomic analysis and a chemometric approach allow description of the  profile of CDCS as compared to normal subjects. In the present work, UHPLC/MS was employed to analyze blood samples withdrawn from CDCS carriers (n=18) and normal parental subjects (n=18), all aged 0-34 years, aiming to set up a representative CDCS profile constructed from 33 targeted amino acids and biogenic amines. Methionine sulfoxide (MetO) was of particular concern with respect to CDCS redox balance. Increased serotonin (3-fold), methionine sulfoxide (2-fold), and Asp levels, and a little lower Orn, citrulline, , Val, , Asn, Gln, Trp, Thr, His, , Met, and creatinine levels were found in the plasma of CDCS patients. Nitrotyrosine and Trp did not differ in normal and CDCS individuals.The accumulated metabolites may reflect, respectively, disturbances in the redox balance, deficient purine biosynthesis, and altered behavior, whereas the amino acid abatement in the latter group may affect the homeostasis of the urea cycle, citric acid cycle, branched chain amino acid synthesis, Tyr and Trp metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis. The identification of enzymatic deficiencies leading to the amino acid burden in CDCS is further required for elucidating its molecular bases and eventually propose specific or mixed amino acid supplementation to newborn patients aiming to balance their metabolism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
