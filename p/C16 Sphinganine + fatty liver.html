<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110363>A critical role for ceramide synthase 2 in  homeostasis: I. alterations in lipid metabolic pathways.</a></h2><p>Ceramide is an important lipid signaling molecule that plays critical roles in regulating cell behavior. Ceramide synthesis is surprisingly complex and is orchestrated by six mammalian ceramide synthases, each of which produces ceramides with restricted acyl chain lengths. We have generated a CerS2 null mouse and characterized the changes in the long chain base and sphingolipid composition of livers from these mice. Ceramide and downstream sphingolipids were devoid of very long (C22-C24) acyl chains, consistent with the substrate specificity of CerS2 toward acyl-CoAs. Unexpectedly, -ceramide levels were elevated, and as a result, total ceramide levels were unaltered; however, -ceramide synthesis in vitro was not increased. Levels of  were also significantly elevated, by up to 50-fold, reminiscent of the effect of the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1. With the exceptions of glucosylceramide synthase and neutral sphingomyelinase 2, none of the other enzymes tested in either the sphingolipid biosynthetic or degradative pathways were significantly changed. Total glycerophospholipid and cholesterol levels were unaltered, although there was a marked elevation in C18:1 and C18:2  acids in phosphatidylethanolamine, concomitant with a reduction in C18:0 and C20:4  acids. Finally, differences were observed in the biophysical properties of lipid extracts isolated from  microsomes, with membranes from CerS2 null mice displaying higher membrane fluidity and showing morphological changes. Together, these results demonstrate novel modes of cross-talk and regulation between the various branches of lipid metabolic pathways upon inhibition of very long acyl chain ceramide synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632963>Monitoring the Sphingolipid  Synthesis by Stable-Isotope Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that share a sphingoid base backbone. They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C  acid palmitoyl-CoA and the amino acid L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid metabolism will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat  microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following lipid extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, , dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for metabolism studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229635>Oral administration of fumonisin B and T-2 individually and in combination affects hepatic total and mitochondrial membrane lipid profile of rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaned rabbits were fed diets contaminated with 2 mg/kg diet T-2 toxin alone, or 10 mg/kg diet fumonisin B (FB) alone, and both toxins in combination (2 + 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared to a toxin-free control diet. Samplings were performed after 4 weeks (blood and ). Bodyweight of T-2-fed group was lower after 4 weeks; the  weight was increased dramatically (threefold of control).  total phospholipids (PLs) provided slight alterations in the  acid (FA) composition; all three toxin-treated groups showed a decrease in palmitoleic acid (:1 n7) proportion. In the  mitochondrial PL FA composition, margaric acid (C17:0) proportion decreased in the separated toxin treatments compared to the combined setting. Oleic acid (C18:1 n9) proportion was increased and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n6) was decreased in the FB-treated group, while docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n3) was decreased in the separated treatments. The total monounsaturation was significantly higher in the FB group's mitochondrial PL FA profile. After 4 weeks, all toxin treatments decreased the blood plasma reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity, and FB increased the plasma /sphingosine ratio. Both mycotoxins seem to cross the hepatocellular and the hepatic mitochondrial membrane, without drastic membrane disruption, as assessed from the PL FA composition, but inducing detectable lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070706>A metabonomic analysis of the effect of quercetin on toxicity induced by chronic exposure to low-level dichlorvos in rat plasma.</a></h2><p>A previous study of ours has reported that chronic exposure to low-level dichlorvos (DDVP, 7.2 mg per kg bw) damages the , interferes with  acid metabolism, and disturbs the antioxidant defense system in rats. This study aims to investigate whether or not quercetin can protect against DDVP-induced toxicity through metabonomics and to elucidate the mechanism underlying this protective effect. Rats were randomly assigned into the control group, DDVP-treated group, quercetin-treated group, and quercetin plus DDVP-treated group. DDVP and quercetin were administered to the rats daily via drinking water and gavage, respectively, continuously for 90 d. The metabonomic profiles of rat plasma were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Finally, 11 metabolites were identified, including those of quercetin, isorhamnetin, and quercetin-3-glucuronide. The 11 metabolites showed significant changes in some treatment groups compared with the control group. Arachidonic acid, phytosphingosine, and   significantly decreased while p-cresol, lysoPE (16:0/0:0), lysoPC (15:0/0:0), lysoPC (16:0/0:0), lysoPC (0:0/18:0), and tryptophan significantly increased in the DDVP-treated group compared with the control group. The tendency of the aforementioned metabolites to change was significantly ameliorated in the high-dose quercetin (50 mg per kg bw per day) plus DDVP-treated group compared with the DDVP-treated group. However, the levels of these metabolites in the high-dose quercetin plus DDVP-treated group were still significantly different from those in the control group. The results indicate that high-dose quercetin (50 mg per kg bw per day) elicits a partial protective effect on DDVP-induced toxicity. The histopathology of the  tissues was consistent with the above results. Quercetin demonstrated regulatory effects on the metabolism of lipids and amino acids, the antioxidant defense system, etc. Therefore, increasing the daily intake of quercetin can ameliorate the toxicity induced by chronic exposure to low-level DDVP residue in food and/or water.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149242>Metabolomic Responses of Human Hepatocytes to Emodin, Aristolochic Acid, and Triptolide: Chemicals Purified from Traditional Chinese Medicines.</a></h2><p>The present study was undertaken to investigate the metabolic responses of human  cells HL-7702 on chemicals purified from traditional Chinese medicine: emodin, triptolide, and aristolochic acid. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated a dose-dependent toxic effect of emodin, triptolide, and aristolochic acid on HL7702 cells for 48 h. Emodin (14 μM), aristolochic acid (12 μg/mL), or triptolide (18 nM) was individually administrated to HL7702 and cell samples were collected after 48 h for metabolites extraction and analysis. Pattern recognition analysis reflected the significant difference in metabolic profiles between chemical-treated groups and the control group. Finally, eight metabolites including N1 -acetylspermidine, Glu Gly, N-undecanoylglycine,  , , glutathione, l-palmitoylcarnitine, and elaidic carnitine were detected as potential common biomarkers. Three pathways including  metabolism,  acid oxidation, and oxidative stress were identified. Our findings indicated that metabolomics would be an efficient approach to understand the molecular mechanism of hepatotoxicity induced by chemicals.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
