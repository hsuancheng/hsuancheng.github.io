Nicolson (Araceae), commonly called Suran or Jimmikand, has high medicinal value and is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of different gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders.The present study evaluated the effects of extracts of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tubers on acetic acid-induced ulcerative  (UC) in rats.Wistar rats were orally administered methanol extract (APME) or aqueous extract (APAE) (250 and 500 mg/kg) or standard drug, prednisolone (PRDS) (4 mg/kg) for 7 days. On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h  was assessed by measuring  parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon.APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05-.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in body weight and increase in  parameters viz. stool consistency, colon weight/length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05-.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on .APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon. The effects may be attributed to presence of phytochemicals, , β-sitosterol, and glucomannan. In conclusion, the tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited an anticolitic effect through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827806>The effects of a TGR5 agonist and a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor on dextran sulfate sodium-induced  in mice.</a></h1><p>Luminal nutrients stimulate enteroendocrine L cells to release gut hormones, including intestinotrophic glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Because L cells express the bile acid receptor TGR5 and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV) rapidly degrades GLPs, we hypothesized that luminal TGR5 activation may attenuate intestinal injury via GLP-2 release, which is enhanced by DPPIV inhibition.Intestinal injury was induced in mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water (free access to water containing 5% DSS for 7 days). The selective TGR5 agonist  (BTA) and the DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate (STG) were administered orally for 7 days. Male C57BL/6 mice (6-7 weeks old) were divided into five groups: normal control group, disease control group, BTA low group (drinking water containing 15 mg/L BTA), BTA high group (50 mg/L BTA), and BTA high + STG (3 mg/kg, i.g.) group.The selective TGR5 agonist BTA dose-dependently suppressed disease activity index and mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the colon. Nevertheless, STG administration had little additive effect on BTA-induced protection. Fibroblast activation protein mRNA expression, but not expression of other DPP family members, was increased in the colon of DSS-treated mice with increased mucosal DPPIV. Co-administration of the selective GLP-2 antagonist GLP-2 (3-33) reversed the effect of BTA.The selective TGR5 agonist BTA ameliorated DSS-induced  in mice via the GLP-2 pathway with no effect of DPPIV inhibition, suggesting that other DPP enzymatic activity is involved in GLP-2 degradation.© 2015 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279966> alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced  and visceral pain in mice.</a></h1><p> (BA) exhibits many biological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators play an important role in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated pain. We, therefore, examined the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive potential of BA in .  was induced with 3% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water in mice for 1to7 days. BA (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) was given orally for 0 to 7 days. BA was also tested for its efficacy in acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral nociception in mice at same doses. BA significantly prevented diarrhea; bleeding and colonic pathological changes induced by DSS. Further, BA reduced the colon nitrite, malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and lipid hydroperoxide levels and restored the superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione levels to normalize the redox balance in DSS-exposed mice. Inflammatory mediators like matrix metalloproteinase-9 and prostaglandin E2 levels were also significantly attenuated by BA in  mice. Additionally, BA reduced acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral pain in mice. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that BA possesses good anti-nociceptive activity and the anti-IBD effects of BA are due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794808>Banxia xiexin decoction protects against dextran sulfate sodium-induced chronic ulcerative  in mice.</a></h1><p>Banxia Xiexin decoction (BXD), one of a traditional Chinese medicine chronicled in Shang Han Lun, is commonly used to treat gastroenteritis, ulcerative  and diarrhea. In our study, we used current biomedical approaches to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of BXD and possible protective mechanism involved in inhibiting dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic ulcerative  model.Chronic DSS  was induced in C57BL/6 male mice by three cycles of 5 days of 2% DSS in drinking water, alternating with 5 days of normal water, totaling 30 days. In BXD group, the mice were administered at a dose of 8.7g/kg BXD for 5 days before and during DSS treatment via oral gavage per day. Mice in vehicle group and DSS group were given orally the same volume of drinking water, instead. Body weight, stool characters and hematochezia were observed everyday. The colorectal tissues were used to detect levels of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23 and MPO by ELISA or qRT-PCR. The expression of COX-2, 8-Oxoguanine and Nrf2 were examined by IHC, and p-p65 was examined by western blotting. ThOD and the content of MDA were measured according to kits respectively.BXD significantly protected against DSS-induced chronic ulcerative  by amelioration of body weight loss, DAI and histology score. The level of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, COX-2 and p-p65 were decreased significantly, while the level of IL-10 improved with the treatment of BXD. MDA, MPO and 8-Oxoguanine were decreased, meanwhile SOD activity and Nrf2 expression were elevated significantly by BXD.BXD possesses the potential of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation to treat . The protective mechanism of BXD may involve in inhibition of NF-κBp65 activation and increasement of Nrf2 expression in colorectums of mice.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
