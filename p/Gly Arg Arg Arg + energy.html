A single-nucleotide polymorphism leading to a glutamine () by arginine () substitution at codon 460 of the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) has been associated with mood disorders. No change in function (loss or gain) has been described for this SNP so far. Here we show that although the P2X7R-Gln460Arg variant per se is not compromised in its function, co-expression of wild-type P2X7R with P2X7R-Gln460Arg impairs receptor function with respect to calcium influx, channel currents and intracellular signaling in vitro. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation and FRET studies show that the P2X7R-Gln460Arg variant physically interacts with P2X7R-WT. Specific silencing of either the normal or polymorphic variant rescues the heterozygous loss of function phenotype and restores normal function. The described loss of function due to co-expression, unique for mutations in the P2RX7 gene so far, explains the mechanism by which the P2X7R-Gln460Arg variant affects the normal function of the channel and may represent a mechanism of action for other mutations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29356900>Structural insights on bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using microalgae: a modelling-based computational study.</a></h2><p>Research on bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has established that several remediating microbial species are capable of degrading only low molecular weight (LMW)-PAHs, whereas high molecular weight (HMW)-PAHs are hardly degradable. In the present study, the efficiency of degradation of both LMW and HMW-PAHs by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) of microalgae was studied. CYP have a key role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. So far, the structure of CYP in microalgae is not predicted; the protein structure was constructed by molecular modelling in the current study using the available template of microalgal CYP. Modelled microalgae 3D structures were docked against 38 different PAH compounds, and the information regarding the interaction between protein and PAHs viz. binding sites along with mode of interactions was investigated. We report that CYP from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis and Parachlorella kessleri was found to possess broad oxidising capability towards both LMW and HMW-PAHs. P. kessleri showed a least value with extra precision glide score of - 10.23 and glide  of - 23.48 kcal/mol. PAHs bind to CYP active sites at Lys , Trp ,   and   through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Also, study revealed that PAHs interacted with CYP active sites through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic bonding, π-π interactions and van der waals interactions. Thus, structural elucidation study confirms that microalgae Parachlorella kessleri have the capacity to remediate HMW more efficiently than other microorganisms. Our results provide a framework in understanding the structure and the possible binding sites of CYP protein for degradation of PAH and that could be a screening tool in identifying the phycoremediation potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26262824>Adsorption of Modified , Lys, Asp, and  to Dry and Hydrated ZnO Surface: A Density Functional Theory Study.</a></h2><p>The interface of biological molecules with inorganic surfaces has been the subject of several recent studies. Experimentally some amino acids are evidenced to play a critical role in the adhesion and selectivity on oxide surfaces; however, detailed information on how the water molecules on the hydrated surface are able to mediate the adsorption is still missing. Accurate total  ab initio calculations based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory have been performed to investigate the adsorption of selected amino acids on the hydrated ZnO(101̅0) surface, and the results are presented and discussed in this paper. We have also investigated the role played by water in the determination of the most energetically favorable adsorption configurations of the selected amino acids. We have found that for some amino acids the most energetically favorable configurations involve the deprotonation of the molecule if the water screening is not effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27318092>Six independent fucose-binding sites in the crystal structure of Aspergillus oryzae lectin.</a></h2><p>The crystal structure of AOL (a fucose-specific lectin of Aspergillus oryzae) has been solved by SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) and MAD (multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction) phasing of seleno-fucosides. The overall structure is a six-bladed β-propeller similar to that of other fucose-specific lectins. The fucose moieties of the seleno-fucosides are located in six fucose-binding sites. Although the  and Glu/ residues bound to the fucose moiety are common to all fucose-binding sites, the amino-acid residues involved in fucose binding at each site are not identical. The varying peak heights of the seleniums in the electron density map suggest that each fucose-binding site has a different carbohydrate binding affinity.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Assay 1 determined apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and metabolizable  (AME) by the difference method. Assay 2 determined apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids by the index method. Two reference diets (RD) - an 85% corn based and a 5% casein-cornstarch diet fortified with vitamins and minerals - were made for assays 1 and 2, respectively. For each assay, the test diets were made by mixing RD and CM 7:3 wt/wt basis and fed without or with MC or Phy or combination. A total of 245 day-old male broilers (Cobb 500) was allocated to 5 treatments to give 7 replicates (7 birds/cage). The birds were fed a commercial diet from day zero to 10 followed by assay 1 fed from d 11 to 18 and assay 2 fed from d 19 to 21. Excreta samples were collected on d 15 to18, and all birds were slaughtered on d 21 for ileal digesta. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between MC and Phy on ATTD of DM, N, and P. There was no interaction (P > 0.05) between MC and Phy on AMEn; however, MC and Phy individually improved AMEn retention. Enzymes interacted (P < 0.05) on SID of , His, Leu, Met, Thr, Ala, Asp, , and Gly. In this context, feeding a combination of MC and Phy resulted in higher (P < 0.05) SID of , His, Met, and Thr relative to single activity or control. Both enzymes improved (P < 0.05) SID of Lys independently. The combination of carbohydrase and Phy may be an effective strategy to improve amino acid utilization in CM for poultry.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205752>Investigation of the probable homo-dimer model of the  complementation group A (XPA) protein to represent the DNA-binding core.</a></h2><p>The  complementation group A (XPA) protein functions as a primary damage verifier and as a scaffold protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER) in all higher organisms. New evidence of XPA's existence as a dimer and the redefinition of its DNA-binding domain (DBD) raises new questions regarding the stability and functional position of XPA in NER. Here, we have investigated XPA's dimeric status with respect to its previously defined DBD (XPA) as well as with its redefined DBD (XPA). We studied the stability of XPA and XPA homo-dimer systems using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, and we have also characterized the protein-protein interactions (PPI) of these two homo-dimeric forms of XPA. After conducting the root mean square deviation (RMSD) analyses, it was observed that the XPA homo-dimer has better stability than XPA. It was also found that XPA has a larger number of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions than the XPA homo-dimer. We further found that Lys, Glu, , Asn, and  residues shared the major contribution toward the intermolecular interactions in XPA homo-dimers. The binding free  (BFE) analysis, which used the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann method (MM-PBSA) and the generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation model (GBSA) for both XPA homo-dimers, also substantiated the positive result in favor of the stability of the XPA homo-dimer.

RON (Recepteur d'Origine Nantais) tyrosine kinase receptor has gained considerable attention as promising target in cancer therapy. The activation of RON via its ligand, macrophage stimulation protein (MSP) is the most common mechanism of activation for this receptor. The aim of the current study was to perform in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis and to calculate binding  for prediction of hot spots in protein-protein interface between RON and MSPβ chain (MSPβ).  In this work the residues at the interface of RON-MSPβ complex were mutated to alanine and then molecular dynamics simulation was used to calculate binding free .  The results revealed that , , Glu, Pro, Glu, and His residues from RON and , His, Ser, Glu, and  from MSPβ may play important roles in protein-protein interaction between RON and MSP.  Identification of these RON hot spots is important in designing anti-RON drugs when the aim is to disrupt RON-MSP interaction. In the same way, the acquired information regarding the critical amino acids of MSPβ can be used in the process of rational drug design for developing MSP antagonizing agents, the development of novel MSP mimicking peptides where inhibition of RON activation is required, and the design of experimental site directed mutagenesis studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220616>Amino acid and glucose metabolism in fed-batch CHO cell culture affects antibody production and glycosylation.</a></h2><p>Fed-batch Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture is the most commonly used process for IgG production in the biopharmaceutical industry. Amino acid and glucose consumption, cell growth, metabolism, antibody titer, and N-glycosylation patterns are always the major concerns during upstream process optimization, especially media optimization. Gaining knowledge on their interrelations could provide insight for obtaining higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and better controlling glycosylation-related product quality. In this work, different fed-batch processes with two chemically defined proprietary media and feeds were studied using two IgG-producing cell lines. Our results indicate that the balance of glucose and amino acid concentration in the culture is important for cell growth, IgG titer and N-glycosylation. Accordingly, the ideal fate of glucose and amino acids in the culture could be mainly towards  and recombinant product, respectively. Accumulation of by-products such as NH4(+) and lactate as a consequence of unbalanced nutrient supply to cell activities inhibits cell growth. The levels of Leu and  in the culture, which relate to cell growth and IgG productivity, need to be well controlled. Amino acids with the highest consumption rates correlate with the most abundant amino acids present in the produced IgG, and thus require sufficient availability during culture. Case-by-case analysis is necessary for understanding the effect of media and process optimization on glycosylation. We found that in certain cases the presence of Man5 glycan can be linked to limitation of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis as a result of insufficient extracellular . However, under different culture conditions, high Man5 levels can also result from low α-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 2-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnTI) and UDP-GlcNAc transporter activities, which may be attributed to high level of NH4+ in the cell culture. Furthermore, galactosylation of the mAb Fc glycans was found to be limited by UDP-Gal biosynthesis, which was observed to be both cell line and cultivation condition-dependent. Extracellular glucose and glutamine concentrations and uptake rates were positively correlated with intracellular UDP-Gal availability. All these findings are important for optimization of fed-batch culture for improving IgG production and directing glycosylation quality.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25344233>Uptake of amino acids and their metabolic conversion into the compatible solute proline confers osmoprotection to Bacillus subtilis.</a></h2><p>The data presented here reveal a new facet of the physiological adjustment processes through which Bacillus subtilis can derive osmostress protection. We found that the import of proteogenic (Glu, , Asp, Asn, and ) and of nonproteogenic (Orn and Cit) amino acids and their metabolic conversion into proline enhances growth under otherwise osmotically unfavorable conditions. Osmoprotection by amino acids depends on the functioning of the ProJ-ProA-ProH enzymes, but different entry points into this biosynthetic route are used by different amino acids to finally yield the compatible solute proline. Glu, , Asp, and Asn are used to replenish the cellular pool of glutamate, the precursor for proline production, whereas , Orn, and Cit are converted into γ-glutamic semialdehyde/Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, an intermediate in proline biosynthesis. The import of Glu, , Asp, Asn, , Orn, and Cit did not lead to a further increase in the size of the proline pool that is already present in osmotically stressed cells. Hence, our data suggest that osmoprotection of B. subtilis by this group of amino acids rests on the savings in biosynthetic building blocks and  that would otherwise have to be devoted either to the synthesis of the proline precursor glutamate or of proline itself. Since glutamate is the direct biosynthetic precursor for proline, we studied its uptake and found that GltT, an Na(+)-coupled symporter, is the main uptake system for both glutamate and aspartate in B. subtilis. Collectively, our data show how effectively B. subtilis can exploit environmental resources to derive osmotic-stress protection through physiological means.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Up to 15% ethanol can blend with diesel to make e-diesel that can be used in fuel compression ignition engine. Urea-modified amino acids can be used as a very good vitalizer for yeast (, Baker's yeast (ATCC 204508)) growth and thus promote ethanol production. A simple, one-step, room-temperature synthetic procedure has been developed for urea-appended α-amino acids from amino acid by treatment with KCNO. Single-crystal X-ray studies confirm the successful synthesis and molecular structures of the urea-appended α-amino acids. Out of 20 urea-appended amino acids, -, Pro-, His-, and -containing compounds promote yeast growth significantly after 12 h at pH 6.8 and 38 °C. These compounds are nontoxic. The urea-appended  shows 2-fold increase of yeast growth. However, urea-appended -aminobenzoic acid and -aminobenzoic acid inhibit yeast growth. NMR experiments confirmed the enhanced production of ethanol by glucose fermentation in the presence of 2.5 μmol urea-appended . Not only glucose but also commercially available sugars and feedstock of the starch slurry drained out after boiling of rice exhibit significant enhancement of ethanol production under same conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28952652>Identification of a suitable promoter for the sigma factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</a></h2><p>Promoter binding specificity is one of the important characteristics of transcription by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) sigma (σ) factors, which remains unexplored due to limited structural evidence. Our previous study on the structural features of Mtb-SigH, consisting of three alpha helices, and its interaction with core RNA polymerase has been extended herein to determine the little known DNA sequence recognition pattern involving its cognate promoters. Herein, high resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of the protein-DNA complexes were inspected to determine the tentative DNA-binding helix of the σ factor. The binding interface in the available crystal structures is found to be populated mainly with specific residues such as , Asn, Lys, , and Ser. We uncovered the helix 3 of Mtb-SigH containing most of these amino acids, which ranged from  64 to  75, forming the predicted active site. The complex of Mtb-SigH:DNA is modelled with 20 promoter sequences. The binding affinity is predicted by scoring these protein-DNA complexes through proximity and interaction parameters obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. The promoters are ranked considering hydrogen bonding,  of interaction, buried surface area, and distance between centers of masses in interaction with the protein. The ranking is validated through in vitro transcription assays. The trends of these selected promoter interactions have shown variations parallel to the experimental evaluation, emphasizing the success of the active site determination along with screening of the promoter strength. The promoter interaction of Mtb-SigH can be highly beneficial for understanding the regulation of gene expression of a pathogen and also extends a solid platform to predict promoters for other bacterial σ factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559274>Structure of N-formimino-L-glutamate iminohydrolase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</a></h2><p>N-Formimino-l-glutamate iminohydrolase (HutF), from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a locus tag of Pa5106 ( gi|15600299 ), is a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily. This enzyme catalyzes the deamination of N-formimino-l-glutamate to N-formyl-l-glutamate and ammonia in the histidine degradation pathway. The crystal structure of Pa5106 was determined in the presence of the inhibitors N-formimino-l-aspartate and N-guanidino-l-glutaric acid at resolutions of 1.9 and 1.4 Å, respectively. The structure of an individual subunit is composed of two domains with the larger domain folding as a distorted (β/α)8-barrel. The (β/α)8-barrel domain is composed of eight β-strands flanked by 11 α-helices, whereas the smaller domain is made up of eight β-strands. The active site of Pa5106 contains a single zinc atom that is coordinated by His-56, His-58, His-232, and Asp-320. The nucleophilic solvent water molecule coordinates with the zinc atom at a distance of 2.0 Å and is hydrogen bonded to Asp-320 and His-269. The α-carboxylate groups of both inhibitors are hydrogen bonded to the imidazole moiety of His-206, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-121, and the side chain amide group of -61. The side chain carboxylate groups of the two inhibitors are ion-paired with the guanidino groups of -209 and -82. Computational docking of high- tetrahedral intermediate forms of the substrate, N-formimino-l-glutamate, to the three-dimensional structure of Pa5106 suggests that this compound likely undergoes a re-faced nucleophilic attack at the formimino group by the metal-bound hydroxide.

Despite their distinct functions inside cells, they are generally considered indistinguishable using mass spectrometry due to their identical masses. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that characteristic w ions can be produced by electron-transfer/higher  collision dissociation (EThcD) dual fragmentation technique to confidently discriminate 3-HyP/4-HyP isomers. An integrated and high throughput strategy was developed which combined online LC separation with EThcD for large-scale differentiation of 3-HyP/4-HyP in complex samples. An automated algorithm was developed for charge state dependent characterization of 3-HyP/4-HyP isomers. Using this combined discrimination approach, we identified 108 3-HyP sites and 530 4-HyP sites from decellularized pancreas, allowing more than 5-fold increase of both 3-HyP and 4-HyP identifications compared to previous reports. This approach outperformed ETD and HCD in the analysis of HyP-containing peptides with unique capacity to generate w ions for HyP discrimination, improved fragmentation of precursor ions, as well as unambiguous localization of modifications. A high content of 3-HyP was observed in the C-terminal (GPP) domain of human CO1A1, which was previously only identified in vertebrate fibrillar collagens from tendon. Unexpectedly, some unusual HyP sites at Xaa position in Gly-HyP-Ala, Gly-HyP-Val, Gly-HyP-, Gly-HyP-Ser, and Gly-HyP- were also confirmed to be 3-hydroxylated, whose functions and enzymes are yet to be discovered.

The CgProt force field, original developed with the multiscale coarse graining method, is assessed by comparing the potentials of mean force for sidechain insertion in a DOPC bilayer to results reported for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Reassignment of select CG sidechain sites from the apolar to polar site type was found to improve the attractive interfacial behavior of tyrosine, phenylalanine and asparagine as well as charged lysine and arginine residues. The solvation  at membrane depths of 0, 1.3 and 1.7 nm correlates with experimental partition coefficients in aqueous mixtures of cyclohexane, octanol and POPC, respectively, for sidechain analogs and Wimley-White peptides. These experimental values serve as important anchor points in choosing between alternate CG models based on their observed permeation profiles, particularly for , Lys and  residues where the all-atom OPLS solvation  does not agree well with experiment. Available partitioning data was also used to reparameterize the representation of the peptide backbone, which needed to be made less attractive for the bilayer hydrophobic core region.

The patients were randomly allocated into the control group or the group that consumed HMB// supplementation (HMB// group). HMB// supplementation or control food were consumed for 5 days before the surgery and for 28 days after the surgery, and maximal quadriceps strength was measured at 7 days before the surgery, and at 14, 28 and 42 days after the surgery. During the study, total  expenditure was measured using a lifestyle recording device. The two groups followed the rehabilitation in the same way.The maximal quadriceps strength was 1.1±0.62 Nm/Kg before surgery and 0.7±0.9 Nm/Kg after surgery 14 days in the control group (p=0.02), and 1.1±0.3 Nm/Kg before surgery and 0.9±0.4 Nm/Kg after surgery 14 days in the HMB// group. Although the control group experienced a significant loss of muscle strength after the surgery, the HMB// group did not. There was no significant difference in total  expenditure between the two groups.Consuming HMB// supplementation may suppress the loss of muscle strength after TKA.

The report that several high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) failed to provide a consensus mechanism for enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation of OMP to form uridine 5'-monophosphate, therefore, provoked a flurry of controversy. This controversy was fueled by the enormous 10-fold rate acceleration for this enzyme, which had " jolted many biochemists' assumptions about the catalytic potential of enzymes." Our studies on the mechanism of action of OMPDC provide strong evidence that catalysis by this enzyme is not fundamentally different from less proficient catalysts, while highlighting important architectural elements that enable a peak level of performance. Many enzymes undergo substrate-induced protein conformational changes that trap their substrates in solvent occluded protein cages, but the conformational change induced by ligand binding to OMPDC is incredibly complex, as required to enable the development of 22 kcal/mol of stabilizing binding interactions with the phosphodianion and ribosyl substrate fragments of OMP. The binding  from these fragments is utilized to activate OMPDC for catalysis of decarboxylation at the orotate fragment of OMP, through the creation of a tight, catalytically active, protein cage from the floppy, open, unliganded form of OMPDC. Such utilization of binding  for ligand-driven conformational changes provides a general mechanism to obtain specificity in transition state binding. The rate enhancement that results from the binding of carbon acid substrates to enzymes is partly due to a reduction in the carbon acid p K that is associated with ligand binding. The binding of UMP to OMPDC results in an unusually large >12 unit decrease in the p K = 29 for abstraction of the C-6 substrate hydrogen, due to stabilization of an enzyme-bound vinyl carbanion, which is also an intermediate of OMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylation. The protein-ligand interactions operate to stabilize the vinyl carbanion at the enzyme active site compared to aqueous solution, rather than to stabilize the transition state for the concerted electrophilic displacement of CO by H that avoids formation of this reaction intermediate. There is evidence that OMPDC induces strain into the bound substrate. The interaction between the amide side chain of -215 from the phosphodianion gripper loop and the hydroxymethylene side chain of Ser-154 from the pyrimidine umbrella of ScOMPDC position the amide side chain to interact with the phosphodianion of OMP. There are no direct stabilizing interactions between dianion gripper protein side chains -215, Tyr-217, and -235 and the pyrimidine ring at the decarboxylation transition state. Rather these side chains function solely to hold OMPDC in the catalytically active closed conformation. The hydrophobic side chains that line the active site of OMPDC in the region of the departing CO product may function to stabilize the decarboxylation transition state by providing hydrophobic solvation of this product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27108103>Dynamics simulation of soybean agglutinin (SBA) dimer reveals the impact of glycosylation on its enhanced structural stability.</a></h2><p>The legume lectins are widely used as a model system for studying protein-carbohydrate and protein-protein interactions. They exhibit a fascinating quaternary structure variation. Recently, it has become clear that lectins exist as oligomers. Soybean agglutinin is a tetrameric legume lectin, each of whose subunits are glycosylated. In the present study we explore the main origin for the stability of soybean agglutinin dimer. In order to understand the role of glycosylation on the dimeric interface, we have carried out normal (298K), high temperatures (380K, 500K) long explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compared the structural and conformational changes between the glycosylated and non-glycosylated dimers. The study reveals that the high degree of stability at normal temperature is mostly contributed by interfacial ionic interactions (~200 kcal/mol) between polar residues like Lys, , Asp, Thr, Ser, Asn and  (62%). It maintains its overall folded conformation due to high subunit interactions at the non-canonical interface. Mainly five important hydrogen bonds between CO of one β sheet of one subunit with the N-H of other β strand of the other subunit help to maintain the structural integrity. Ten inter subunit salt-bridge interactions between  185-Asṕ192, Lys 163-Asṕ169, Asp 169-Lyś 163 and Asp 192-Arǵ 185 at non-canonical interface appear to be important to maintain the three dimensional structure of SBA dimer. Moreover, our simulation results revealed that increase in vibrational entropy could decrease the free  and contribute to the glycan-induced stabilization by ~45 kcal/mol at normal temperature.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

No effect of the ADRB2 gene was shown on final weight, BMI, or body composition, although in the supervised male group, Glu27 carriers tended to have greater weight (p = 0.019, 2.5 kg) and BMI (p = 0.019, 0.88 kg/m(2)) reductions than did noncarriers. There seems to be an individual effect of the ADRB3 polymorphism on fat mass (p = 0.004) and fat percentage (p = 0.036), in addition to an interaction with exercise for fat mass (p = 0.038). After the intervention, carriers of the Arg64 allele had a greater fat mass and fat percentage than did noncarriers (p = 0.004, 2.8 kg). In conclusion, the ADRB2 Gln27Glu and ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphisms may influence weight loss and body composition, although the current evidence is weak; however, further studies are necessary to clarify their roles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197843>Preventive effects of citrulline on Western diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats.</a></h2><p>A Western diet induces insulin resistance, liver steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) and intestinal dysbiosis, leading to increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation, thus contributing to the progression of NAFLD to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In the present study, we sought, in a model of Western diet-induced NAFLD, to determine whether citrulline (Cit), an amino acid that regulates protein and  metabolism, could decrease Western diet-induced liver injuries, as well as the mechanisms involved. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (45 %) and fructose (30 %) in drinking water or a control diet associated with water (group C) for 8 weeks. The high-fat, high-fructose diet (Western diet) was fed either alone (group WD) or with Cit (1 g/kg per d) (group WDC) or an isonitrogenous amount of non-essential amino acids (group WDA). We evaluated nutritional and metabolic status, liver function, intestinal barrier function, gut microbiota and splanchnic inflammatory status. Cit led to a lower level of hepatic TAG restricted to microvesicular lipid droplets and to a lower mRNA expression of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress, of pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 (P<0·05) and Tnfα, and of toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) (P<0·05). Cit also improved plasma TAG and insulin levels. In the colon, it decreased inflammation (Tnfα and Tlr4 expressions) and increased claudin-1 protein expression. This was associated with higher levels of Bacteroides/Prevotella compared with rats fed the Western diet alone. Cit improves Western diet-induced liver injuries via decreased lipid deposition, increased insulin sensitivity, lower inflammatory process and preserved antioxidant status. This may be related in part to its protective effects at the gut level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27637923>Fluorescent substrates for ADAM15 useful for assaying and high throughput screening.</a></h2><p>A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 15 (ADAM15), also known as metargidin, plays important roles in regulating inflammation, wound healing, neovascularization, and is an attractive drug target. Fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET)-based peptide substrates were tested to identify candidate reagents for high throughput screening and detection of ADAM15 in biological samples. ADAM15 exhibits a unique and diverse activity profile compared to other metalloproteinases. Two FRET substrates, Dabcyl-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Met--Gly-Lys(FAM)-NH2 (PEPDAB011) and Dabcyl-Ala-Pro--Trp-Ile--Asp-Lys(FAM)-NH2 (PEPDAB017), which also detect activities of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs -2, -9, and -13), were efficiently cleaved by ADAM15 with specificity constants of 5800 M s and 4300 M s, respectively. Additionally, ADAM15 efficiently processed Dabcyl-Leu--Glu----Leu-Lys-Ser-Lys(FAM)-NH2 (PEPDAB022), which is based on a physiological CD23 cleavage site, with a specificity constant (k/K) of 5200 M s. PEPDAB022 was used to screen the ability of known metalloproteinase inhibitors including TAPI-2, marimastat, GI-254023, and the Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases(TIMPs) 1 and 3 to block ADAM15 activity. Even though ADAM15 exhibits similar substrate preferences to other metalloproteinases, many broad spectrum inhibitors failed to block ADAM15 activity at concentrations as high as 50 μM. Thus, a clear need exists to develop potent and selective ADAM15 inhibitors, and the FRET substrates described herein should aid future research efforts towards this aim.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, , Ile, Leu, Phe, Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, , Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0,  and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower  concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, Thr, and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (, , Phe, and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

The answer given by bioinformatics relies on the frequency of change of each amino acid by another one and the propensity of each to remain unchanged. We propose that these replacement rules are recoverable from the secondary structural trends of amino acids. A distance measure between high-resolution Ramachandran distributions reveals that structurally similar residues coincide with those found in substitution matrices such as BLOSUM: Asn ↔ Asp, P™he ↔ Tyr, Lys ↔ ,  ↔ Glu, Ile ↔ Val, Met → Leu; with Ala, Cys, His, Gly, Ser, Pro, and Thr, as structurally idiosyncratic residues. We also found a high average correlation ([Formula: see text] = 0.85) between thirty amino acid mutability scales and the mutational inertia (I  ), which measures the energetic cost weighted by the number of observations at the most probable amino acid conformation. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions follow two optimally-efficient principles: (a) amino acids interchangeability privileges their secondary structural similarity, and (b) the amino acid mutability depends directly on its biosynthetic  cost, and inversely with its frequency. These two principles are the underlying rules governing the observed amino acid substitutions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606217>Nutritional support for low birth weight infants: insights from animal studies.</a></h2><p>Infants born with low birth weights (<2500 g, LBW), accounting for about 15 % of newborns, have a high risk for postnatal growth failure and developing the metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes, CVD and obesity later in life. Improper nutrition provision during critical stages, such as undernutrition during the fetal period or overnutrition during the neonatal period, has been an important mediator of these metabolic diseases. Considering the specific physiological status of LBW infants, nutritional intervention and optimisation during early life merit further attention. In this review, the physiological and metabolic defects of LBW infants were summarised from a nutritional perspective. Available strategies for nutritional interventions and optimisation of LBW infants, including patterns of nutrition supply, macronutrient proportion, supplementation of amino acids and their derivatives, fatty acids, nucleotides, vitamins, minerals as well as hormone and microbiota manipulators, were reviewed with an aim to provide new insights into the advancements of formulas and human-milk fortifiers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25893548>Computational studies of pandemic 1918 and 2009 H1N1 hemagglutinins bound to avian and human receptor analogs.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this work was to study the binding properties of two pandemic influenza A virus 1918 H1N1 (SC1918) and 2009 H1N1 (CA09) hemagglutinin (HA) with avian and human receptors. The quantum chemical calculations have been performed to analyze the interactions of 130 loop, 190 helix, 220 loop region, and conserved residues 95,145,153-155, of pandemic viruses' HA with sialo-trisaccharide receptor of avian and human using density functional theory. The HA's residues Tyr 95, Ala 138,  191,  220, and Asp 225 from the above regions have stronger interaction with avian receptor. The residues Thr 136, Trp 153, His 183, and Asp 190 of HA are important and play a significant role to bind with human receptor. The residues Tyr 95, Ala 138, Lys 145, Trp 153,  192, and  226 of HA of CA09 virus have found more interaction energies with human than avian receptors. Due to mutations in the active residues of HA of CA09 virus comparing with SC1918, the binding capabilities of HA with human have been increased. The molecular dynamics simulation was made to understand the different dynamical properties of HA and molecular interactions between HA of these two viruses with sialo-trisaccharide receptors of avian and human receptors. The interaction  of HA of CA09 virus with human receptor decreases due to the human receptor far away from conserved residue region of HA protein. This reveals that the conserved residues particularly Lys 145 play major contribution to interaction with human receptor in HA of CA09 virus.</p></html>
