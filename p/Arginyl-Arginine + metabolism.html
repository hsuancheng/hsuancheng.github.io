A histochemical study using amino acid-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamides as chromogenic substrates.</a></h2><p>Proteases are reported to play an essential part in the proliferative, invasive, and metastasizing behavior of malignant tumors. The aim of the current study was to determine the activity and localization of proteases in basal cell carcinomas (BCC) histochemically.Various proteases were identified histochemically in frozen sections of BCC. The following amino acid-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamides (MNA) were used as chromogenic substrates:alanine-MNA for the detection of aminopeptidase M (APM), glycyl-proline-MNA for dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), lysyl-proline-MNA and lysyl-alanine-MNA for dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPP II), glycyl-arginine-MNA for dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPP I), and carbobenzoxy (CBZ)--MNA for cathepsin B.APM activity was high in the peritumorous connective tissue, whereas the tumor epithelium and epidermis had negative results. DPP IV showed a highly positive reaction in both tumor epithelium and surrounding connective tissue. Cathepsin B and DPP I reacted strongly in the tumor epithelium but not in the peritumorous connective tissue.The marked activity of APM, DPP IV, DPP I, and cathepsin B may be related to the proliferation and invasive growth of BCC. The distribution of the activity of APM and DPP IV indicates dynamic interactions between the tumor epithelium and the adjacent connective tissue in the neoplastic process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6378897>Purification and characterization of two distinct dipeptidyl aminopeptidases in soluble fraction from monkey brain and their action on enkephalins.</a></h2><p>Two distinct dipeptidyl aminopeptidases, which were designated DPP-A and DPP-B, were purified from soluble fraction of monkey brain using Leu-enkephalin as the substrate. The enzymes were purified 187 and 136 fold, respectively. Both enzymes showed the optimum pH in neutral range. Their molecular weights were almost equal and were estimated to be about 100,000. Their Km values with Leu-enkephalin as the substrate were 5.6 X 10(-5) and 1.1 X 10(-5) M, respectively. Among synthesized substrates, the highest affinity of the enzymes was toward  beta-naphthylamide with the Km values of 6.25 X 10(-5) and 6.41 X 10(-5) M, respectively. Both enzyme activities were inhibited by the metal-chelators DFP and PCMB. Two hundred fifty microM arphamenine A inhibited DPP-A and -B with inhibition of 36.6% and 44.1%, respectively. Beta-endorphin, ACTH, and glucagon inhibited only DPP-B, while beta-lipotropin and angiotensin II inhibited both DPP-A and -B when Leu-enkephalin was used as the substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8073612>Characterisation of proteolytic activity of excretory-secretory products from adult Strongylus vulgaris.</a></h2><p>An excretory-secretory (ES) preparation derived from adult Strongylus vulgaris in vitro was assessed for proteolytic activity using azocasein and synthetic, fluorogenic, peptide substrates. Fractionation was by molecular sieve fast protein liquid chromatography (molecular sieve FPLC) and resolution by gelatin-substrate sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (gelatin-substrate SDS-PAGE). The cysteine proteinase activator, dithiothreitol (DTT), enhanced azocaseinolysis and hydrolysis of carbobenzoxy-phenylalanyl-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Phe-Arg-NMec) by the ES preparation and was a requirement for the detection of carbobenzoxy--7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg-NMec) hydrolysis. Assays of FPLC-eluted fractions, with DTT, detected a broad peak of azocaseinolytic activity (22-24 kDa) and two peaks (24 and 18 kDa) of hydrolysis using the synthetic substrates. Hydrolysis by these peaks of Z-Phe-Arg-NMec was 50-fold greater than that of Z-Arg-Arg-NMec suggesting that their specificities are more like papain or cathepsin L rather than cathepsin B. In gelatin-substrate SDS-PAGE, DTT was required to detect proteolysis by the ES preparation which was optimal at pH 6.0 and resolved into eight bands (87-29 kDa). Cysteine proteinase inhibitors were the most effective in all assays. Collectively, these data indicate that cysteine-class proteolytic activity predominates in the ES preparation of adult S. vulgaris.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9461491>A novel peptide-processing activity of insect peptidyl-dipeptidase A (angiotensin I-converting enzyme): the hydrolysis of lysyl-arginine and  from the C-terminus of an insect prohormone peptide.</a></h2><p>Insect peptidyl-dipeptidase A [angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)] is a soluble single-domain peptidyl-dipeptidase that has many properties in common with the C-domain of mammalian somatic ACE and with the single-domain mammalian germinal ACE. Mammalian somatic ACE is important in blood homoeostasis, but the role of ACE in insects is not known. Immunocytochemistry has been used to localize ACE in the neuroendocrine system of the locust, Locusta migratoria. Staining was observed in five groups of neurosecretory cells in the brain and suboesophageal ganglion, in the nervi corpori cardiaci, the storage part of the corpora cardiaca and in the nervi corpori allati. In three groups of neurosecretory cells, ACE co-localized with locustamyotropins, suggesting a possible role for the enzyme in the  of these neuropeptides. We demonstrate in vitro a novel activity of ACE that removes pairs of basic amino acid residues from a locustamyotropin peptide extended at the C-terminus with either Gly-Lys-Arg or Gly-Arg-Arg, corresponding to a consensus recognition sequence for endoproteolysis of prohormone proteins by prohormone convertases. The low Km and high kcat values (Km 7.3 and 5.0 microM, kcat 226 and 207 s-1 for the hydrolysis of Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-Lys-Arg and Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-Arg-Arg, respectively) obtained for the hydrolysis of these two peptides by insect ACE means that these peptides, along with mammalian bradykinin, are the most favoured in vitro ACE substrates so far identified. The discovery of this in vitro prohormone-processing activity of insect ACE provides a possible explanation for the intracellular co-localization of the enzyme with locustamyotropin peptides, and provides evidence for a new role for ACE in the biosynthesis of peptide hormones and transmitters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2993267>Hydrolysis of protamine by calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP).</a></h2><p>To determine the substrate recognition mechanism in calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP), the hydrolytic velocities for some possible substrates were compared. In general, succinylated polypeptides were poorer substrates than unmodified ones, suggesting that CANP interacts with positively charged amino groups and/or repels negatively charged succinyl groups in substrates. Among the substrates examined, protamine was degraded quite rapidly in a restricted manner. This degradation of protamine was remarkably accelerated by the addition of salt, and, in the absence of salt, protamine was inhibitory as to the degradation of vimentin by CANP. Protamine was separated into components and the sites cleaved by CANP were determined. CANP cleaved the clupeine YII and Z components at two sites, both being  bonds, and the amino acid sequences around these sites were almost identical between YII and Z. No other  bond was cleaved at all. These results showed that CANP prefers basic amino acid side chains but its specificity is very restricted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9371719>Cleavage of  and lysyl-arginine from the C-terminus of pro-hormone peptides by human germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and the C-domain of human somatic ACE.</a></h2><p>Mammalian germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme (gACE) is a single-domain dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase found exclusively in male germ cells, which has almost identical sequence and enzymic properties with the C-domain of the two-domain somatic ACE. Mutant mice that do not express gACE are infertile, suggesting a role for the enzyme in the processing of undefined peptides involved in fertilization. A number of spermatid peptides [e.g. cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin] are processed from pro-hormones by endo- and exo-proteolytic cleavages which might generate substrates for gACE. We have shown that peptide hormone intermediates with Lys/Arg-Arg at the C-terminus are high-affinity substrates for human gACE. gACE from human sperm cleaved Arg-Arg from the C-terminus of the CCK5-GRR (GWMDFGRR), a peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of a CCK-gastrin prohormone intermediate. Hydrolysis of CCK5-GRR by recombinant human C-domain ACE was Cl- dependent, with maximal activity achieved in 5-10 mM NaCl at pH 6.4. C-Domain ACE cleaved Lys/Arg-Arg from the C-terminus of dynorphin-(1-7), a pro-TRH peptide KRQHPGKR, and two insect peptides FSPRLGKR and FSPRLGRR. C-Domain ACE displayed high affinity towards all these substrates with Vmax/Km values between 14 and 113 times greater than the Vmax/Km for the conversion of the best known ACE substrate, angiotensin I, into angiotensin II. In conclusion, we have identified a new class of substrates for human gACE, and we suggest that gACE might be an alternative to carboxypeptidase E for the trimming of basic dipeptides from the C-terminus of intermediates generated from pro-hormones by subtilisin-like convertases in human male germ cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9711218>Fluostatins A and B, new inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase III, produced by Streptomyces sp. TA-3391. I. Taxonomy of producing strain, production, isolation, physico-chemical properties and biological properties.</a></h2><p>New inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidaseIII (EC 3.4.14.4) from human placenta, designated as fluostatins A and B, were discovered in the fermentation broth of a strain isolated in our institute. The strain has been identified as Streptomyces sp. TA-3391 on the basis of taxonomic studies. Fluostatins A and B were purified by Diaion HP-20 chromatography, ethyl acetate extraction, silica gel chromatography and reverse phase preparative HPLC. With the synthetic substrate, -2-naphthylamide, the IC50 values of fluostatins A and B were 0.44 and 24.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Fluostatins A and B were slightly inhibitory against other dipeptidyl peptidases. Fluostatin A showed mixed-type (competitive and noncompeptitive) inhibition with human leucine-enkephalin as a substrate, and the inhibition constant (Ki) was 14.2 microM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7071020>Recognition of base pairs by polar peptides in double stranded DNA.</a></h2><p>The resonance Raman spectrum of native DNA has been obtained using excitation at 257 nm. In a first part, the spectral lines are assigned to the different nucleotide bases which provide the resonance effect. In a second part, the interactions of DNA with basic peptides (Arginine Methylester, Lysine Methylester, ) are investigated using excitation at 300 nm and 257 nm, which give complementary information about the DNA. Both Arginine Methylester and  recognize the A-T base pairs, the first one in the large groove, the second one in the narrow groove of DNA. The DNA-Lysine Methylester interaction is very likely not specific but can take place in the large groove of DNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12072215>A preliminary analysis of proteolytic activity of excretory-secretory products from Cyathostominea.</a></h2><p>The excretory-secretory product (ESP) derived from Cyathostominea in vitro was assessed, in terms of subunit composition, and proteolytic activity using as substrates azocasein and two synthetic fluorogenic peptides. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) resolved 13 subunits, and the presence of the protein cysteine proteinase activator dithiothreitol (DTT) revealed 21 subunits. DTT also enhanced azocaseinolysis, and hydrolysis of carbobenzoxy-phenylalanyl-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec) and carbobenzoxy--7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec). At the optimum pH of 5.5, hydrolysis of Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec was three-fold greater than that of Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec suggesting that the proteolytic specificities of the ESP are more like those of papain or cathepsin L, rather than cathepsin B. In SDS-PAGE gelatin gels, DTT was a requirement for proteolysis by the ESP. Optimum resolution was at pH=5.5, resolving six bands ranging from 114-20kDa. Cysteine proteinase inhibitors abolished all gelatinolytic activity at the pH values tested. Such data indicate the presence of cysteine-class proteinases in the ESP of Cyathostominea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657450>The pathway of secretion of proteinases in Trichomonas vaginalis.</a></h2><p>Trichomonads secrete large amounts of hydrolytic enzymes into liquid growth medium. Proteinase release by Trichomonas vaginalis has been quantified after resuspension of the parasite in a simple buffered maltose medium. After 6 h incubation, 70-90% of each of two cysteine proteinase activities, one towards benzyloxycarbonyl- 4-nitroanilide (Z-RR-Nan) and the other active towards N-benzoyl-prolyl-phenylalanyl-arginine 4-nitroanilide (Bz-PFR-Nan), was extracellular. This release was insensitive to changes in pH within the range from 5.5 to 8.6 but was partially inhibited by chloride ions. The secretion of activity towards Bz-PFR-Nan was temperature-sensitive but was still detectable down to 14 degrees C. Neither this nor other cysteine proteinase activities were detectable on the surface of parasites. Release was stimulated by various amines and monensin, suggesting that secretion was from or via acidic compartments. The intracellular activity towards Bz-PFR-Nan could be totally and irreversibly inhibited by treating the parasites with benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-alanine diazomethylketone (Z-FA-DMK), without otherwise harming the cells. Regeneration and routing of the proteinases responsible for this activity was followed after removal of the inhibitor. There was a significant rise in the intracellular level of activity before it became detectable in the medium. The release of this activity was accelerated by amines and monensin, but the build-up of enzyme activity within cells was not prevented. Organelles containing cysteine proteinases banded as a single peak in Percoll density gradients. The density of these increased when cells were treated with dextran. The activity towards Bz-PFR-Nan which reappeared after Z-FA-DMK treatment has a similar distribution. The proteinase-containing fraction could be distinguished from an early (5 min) endosome fraction, suggesting that it was composed of late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus these results imply that the secretion pathway for proteinases necessarily involves lysosomes/late endosomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7576237>Quantification of intracellular cathepsin activities in human lung tumor cell lines by flow cytometry.</a></h2><p>The cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L are very likely involved in invasive processes of normal and malignant cells, they become relevant for a number of diseases and are possibly prognostic markers for the outcome of human lung cancer. Therefore, we have determined activities of these related enzymes in cells and in cell extracts of human lung carcinoma cell lines of different cathepsin composition by flow cytometry and by spectrophotometry, respectively. To this end we applied the synthetic dipeptidyl substrates benzoxycarbonyl-- and benzoxycarbonyl-phenyl-arginine- coupled to 4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide, aminomethyl-coumarine or rhodamine R110. The apparent enzymatic activities were differentially defined by protease inhibitors, particularly E-64 and CA-074. Independent of the dipeptidyl-composition more than 99 per cent of the apparent activity was due to cathepsin B when 4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide or aminomethylcoumarine were the leaving groups. The 4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide precipitate used for detection of cell associated activities revealed a wide spectrum of excitation to fluorescence thwarting the application of other possible fluorescent tags. Therefore, its application is restricted to uniparametric fluorescence investigations. Both dipeptidylgroups coupled to rhodamine R110 were promiscuous: only 25 to 30% of the apparent activity were due to cathepsin B; the predominant activity came from cathepsin L, irrespective whether intracellular or activities of cellular extracts were analyzed. However, rhodamine R110-coupled substrates open the way for multiparametric fluorescent analysis of cathepsins B and L containing cells if appropriate inhibitors for specification of the enzymatic activities are additionally applied. In very contrast to 4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide, which causes irreparable damage to the cells, the rhodamine substrates permit studies with living cells and live cell sorting.</p></html>
