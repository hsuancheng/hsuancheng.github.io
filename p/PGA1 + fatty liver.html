It was shown that  is incorporated into phospholipids in a much lesser degree than oleic acid.  is incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine and, in a lesser degree, into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol + phosphatidylserine. The exogenous cofactors of  acid acylation (ATP, CoA, Mg2+) exert no marked influence on the incorporation of  into the phospholipids.  interacts with isolated rat  phospholipids; the -phospholipid conjugate formed is not destroyed in the course of one- or two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. On the other hand,  binding to unsaturated phosphatidylcholines is strictly dependent on the phospholipid oxidation index. It is concluded that  incorporation into rat  phospholipids is a result of interaction of  with peroxidized phospholipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566475>CYP4F3B is induced by  in human  cells: a regulation of the 20-HETE synthesis.</a></h2><p>The regulation of the human -specific cytochrome P450 4F3B (CYP4F3B) isoform, a splice variant of the CYP4F3 gene with strong substrate specificity for long chain  acids, is yet an unsolved question. This report provides the first evidence that CYP4F3B is uniquely induced by  () in human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells and leads to the synthesis of 20-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Real time PCR, immunoblot analysis with a specific antipeptide antibody, and determination of  acid omega-hydroxylase activity demonstrate that  treatment strongly increases expression of CYP4F3B. This induction drives the production of 20-HETE (19-fold increase). SiRNA-mediated-silencing of CYP4F3 suppresses both 20-HETE synthesis and  induced 20-HETE production. Taken together, these results provide evidence that CYP4F3B is the key enzyme to produce 20-HETE by omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid in  cells. Since 20-HETE is a potent activator of PPARalpha and an important inflammatory mediator, CYP4F3B may exert important functions in lipid homeostasis and in inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6089235>Some effects of the essential  acids linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid and of their metabolites gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and of prostaglandins A1 and E1 on the proliferation of human osteogenic sarcoma cells in culture.</a></h2><p>Gamma-linolenic acid has been shown to suppress the rate of proliferation of a number of malignant cell lines in culture. To test the proposal that this was a specific prostaglandin 1- or 2-series effect, 379 batches of MG63 human osteogenic sarcoma cells were seeded in Greiner flasks and cultured in media supplemented with a range of unsaturated  acids and prostaglandins. The monounsaturated  acid oleic acid enhanced the rate of cancer cell proliferation. The polyunsaturated  acids linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, as well as prostaglandins E1 and A1 suppressed the rate of cell proliferation. Total suppression of colony forming and cell proliferation occurred at high levels of polyunsaturated  acid supplementation. In addition gamma-linolenic in the form of evening primrose seed oil and vitamin C has been given to 6 patients with histologically diagnosed primary  cell cancer. Some clinical improvement and reduction in tumor size occurred in 3 cases. One patient has shown remarkable improvement in reduction of  and tumor size on the CAT scan and reduction of the serum alkaline phosphatase from 2830 to 295 units and gamma-glutamyl transaminase from 274 to 82 units. Thus preliminary clinical results suggest that gamma-linolenic acid may be effective in the management of human cancer patients and further trials should be conducted. However, the cell culture results suggest that although the essential  acids suppress proliferation, eicosanoids of all 3 series may be involved. The proliferation suppressive effect of docosahexaenoic acid suggests that other aspects than only eicosanoid activity may also be important in the suppression of cancer cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3830160>Prostaglandin E1 binds to Z protein of rat .</a></h2><p>Z protein or -acid-binding protein is abundant in the cytosol of many cell types including  cells. It is considered to play an important role in intracellular transport and metabolism of long-chain  acids and other organic anions. We studied the role of Z protein in the metabolism of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Binding of tritiated prostaglandin E1 to this -acid-binding protein (Z protein) purified from rat  was determined. The binding of [3H]prostaglandin E1 to Z protein is rapid, saturable and reversible. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PGE1 binding to Z protein showed a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 37 nM. The binding capacity is 110 nmol/mg Z protein. Optimal [3H]PGE1 binding occurred at pH 7.4. The presence of 3 mM MgCl2 stimulated the prostaglandin E1 binding to Z protein. Competition experiments show that the binding of this autacoid to Z protein is highly specific. It could not be displaced by other prostaglandins (, PGA2, PGE2, PGB1, PGI2, PGD2, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto PGF1 alpha). Z protein might be involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins in the cytosol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2251282>Preferential binding of growth inhibitory prostaglandins by the target protein of a carcinogen.</a></h2><p>  acid binding protein (L-FABP) is the principal target protein of the hepatic carcinogen N-(2-fluorenyl)acetamide (2-acetylaminofluorene) in rat . In addition, the cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PG), PGA, PGJ2, and delta 12-PGJ2, inhibit the growth of many cell types in vitro. This report describes the preferential binding of the growth inhibitory prostaglandins by L-FABP and the reversible inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA by PGA2 and delta 12-PGJ2 in primary cultures of purified rat hepatocytes. As a model ligand, [3H] bound to L-FABP specifically, reversibly, rapidly, and with high affinity. Its dissociation constants were 134 nM (high affinity) and 3.6 microM (low affinity). The high-affinity binding of [3H] was 9- and approximately 13-fold more avid than the binding of the conventional  acid ligands, oleic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively. The abilities of different prostaglandins to compete with the high-affinity binding of [3H] correlated with their growth inhibitory activities reported previously and here. The growth inhibitory cyclopentenone prostaglandins (, PGA2, delta 12-PGJ2, and PGJ2) were the best competitive ligands, intermediate competitors were the weak growth inhibitors PGE1 and PGD2, and the poorest competitors were PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, which stimulate rather than inhibit DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The in vitro actions of L-FABP are compatible with those of a specific and dissociable carrier of growth inhibitory prostaglandins in rat hepatocytes and suggest that the carcinogen may usurp the cellular machinery of the growth inhibitory prostaglandins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2172223>Leukotriene B4 omega-hydroxylase in rat  microsomes: identification as a cytochrome P-450 that catalyzes  omega-hydroxylation, and participation of cytochrome b5.</a></h2><p>The omega-hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by rat  microsomes requires NADPH and molecular oxygen, suggesting that the hydroxylation is catalyzed by a cytochrome P-450 (P-450)-linked monooxygenase system. The reaction is inhibited by CO, and the inhibition is reversed by irradiation of light at 450 nm in a light-intensity-dependent manner. The extent of the reversal is strongly dependent on the wavelength of the light used, the 450-nm light is most efficient. The finding provides direct evidence for the identification of the LTB4 omega-hydroxylase as a P-450. The P-450 seems to be also responsible for  () omega-hydroxylation, but not for lauric acid omega-hydroxylation. The LTB4 omega-hydroxylation is competitively inhibited by , but not affected by lauric acid. The Ki value for  of 38 microM agrees with the Km value for  omega-hydroxylation of 40 microM. LTB4 inhibits the  omega-hydroxylation by rat  microsomes in a competitive manner with the Ki of 43 microM, which is consistent with the Km for the LTB4 omega-hydroxylation of 42 microM. An antiserum raised against rabbit pulmonary PG omega-hydroxylase (P-450p-2) inhibits slightly the omega-hydroxylations of LTB4 and , while it has stronger inhibitory effect on lauric acid omega-hydroxylation. In addition to NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, cytochrome b5 appears to participate in the LTB4 omega-hydroxylating system, since the reaction is inhibited by an antibody raised against the cytochrome b5 as well as one raised against the reductase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2361958>Purification and characterization of two forms of cytochrome P-450 with omega-hydroxylase activities toward prostaglandin A and  acids from rabbit  microsomes.</a></h2><p>Two forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450), designated as P-450LPGA omega 1 and P-450LPGA omega 2, have been purified to specific contents of 17.9 and 11.1 nmol P-450/mg protein, respectively, from  microsomes of rabbits treated with di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), a peroxisomal proliferator. The purified P-450LPGA omega 1 and P-450LPGA omega 2 were found to have apparent molecular weights of 52,500 and 53,000, respectively. They showed absorption maxima at 451 and 450 nm in the carbon monoxide-difference spectra for their reduced forms, respectively. The two P-450s both efficiently catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of prostaglandins A1 () and A2 (PGA2), as well as the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of  acids such as laurate, myristate, and palmitate. In a reconstituted system, various metal ions such as Na+ and Mg2+ stimulated these reactions. The P-450s exhibited no detectable activity toward several xenobiotics tested. The two P-450s showed different peptide map patterns following limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or papain. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences (ALNPTRLPGSLSGLLQVAGL and ALSLTRLPGSFSGFLQAxGLLGLLL) of P-450LPGA omega 1 and P-450LPGA omega 2 were identical at 18/20 and 19/24 positions with that of the lung prostaglandin omega-hydroxylase from pregnant rabbits, respectively. An antibody against P-450LPGA omega 2 recognized a 52,000-53,000 molecular weight protein(s) in rabbit  microsomes. The intensity of the immunoblot was significantly increased in  microsomes from rabbits treated with DEHP, but not with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11728177>Stimulated release of arachidonic acid by agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and retinoic acid receptors.</a></h2><p>Release of arachidonic acid from rat  cells is stimulated after a 6-hour incubation with 9-cis retinoic acid, all trans retinoic acid, the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma synthetic thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone, the cyclopentenones, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 and  and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, celecoxib and indomethacin. The rates of the release stimulated by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 differ from those observed with celecoxib. Arachidonic acid release by9-cis retinoic acid in the presence of either ciglitazone or trans retinoic acid is synergistic. It is additive in the presence of celecoxib. Cycloheximide and actinomycin inhibit the release of arachidonic acid stimulated by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 but not by celecoxib. The findings indicate that agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and retinoic acid receptors stimulate the release of arachidonic acid. The mechanisms involved may differ in the cases of 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 and celecoxib.Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8239664>Expression of rabbit cytochromes P4504A which catalyze the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid,  acids, and prostaglandins.</a></h2><p>The omega-hydroxylation product of arachidonic acid is thought to be a potent vasoconstrictor or a precursor thereof in kidney. In this report, we have measured the capacity of four rabbit CYP4A enzymes, each expressed in COS-1 cells, to catalyze the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid. These rates were compared to those obtained for other substrates such as lauric acid, palmitic acid, and prostaglandins PGE1 and . With the exception of P4504A5, all of the enzymes tested exhibited relatively high rates for the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid. P4504A5 showed very little activity toward arachidonic or palmitic acids as compared to that toward lauric acid (< 10%). In contrast, P4504A6 and P4504A7 catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid at rates that were roughly 50% of that observed for lauric acid. P4504A4 was not active toward lauric acid, but it also catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid at a rate that was roughly 20% of that exhibited for PGE1. Thus, each enzyme exhibits a distinct substrate specificity profile across this panel of substrates. A sensitive RNase protection assay was used to provide a more quantitative estimate of the relative abundance of mRNAs encoding P4504A5, P4504A6, and P4504A7 in  and kidney from control, pregnant, and clofibrate-treated animals. CYP4A5 is the most abundant of the mRNAs, but it was not induced in kidney and only moderately (2-fold) in  by clofibric acid. CYP4A7 exhibits a similar pattern of induction by clofibrate. In contrast, CYP4A6 is induced 12-fold in  and 6-fold in kidney. The higher induction ratio largely reflects a lower basal level of expression for CYP4A6 than for CYP4A7 and CYP4A5. Following treatment with clofibrate, the amount of CYP4A6 mRNA is similar to those of CYP4A5 and CYP4A7. Pregnancy did not affect the expression of CYP4A5, CYP4A6, or CYP4A7, although it induced the expression of CYP4A4 to detectable levels in the  and kidney, where it is not normally found in nonpregnant animals. Our results indicate that the enzyme whose mRNA is most highly induced by clofibric acid (P4504A6) and the enzyme selectively elevated during pregnancy (P4504A4) both exhibit relatively high rates for the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid.</p></html>
