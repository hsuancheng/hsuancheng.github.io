An alternative pathway of TMAO formation from carnitine is via the microbiota-dependent intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about TMAO in . Given the proposed contribution of microbiota alterations in  and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of , lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its microbiota-dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not microbiota dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk. Prospective studies of gut microbiota composition and related metabolites in relation to long-term cardiovascular risk after bariatric surgery are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25817784>Carnitine protects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from glucose-induced reduction of survival depending on the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12.</a></h2><p>Besides its function in transport of fatty acids into mitochondria in order to provide substrates for β-oxidation, carnitine has been shown to affect also glucose metabolism and to inhibit several mechanisms associated with diabetic complications. In the present study we used the mev-1 mutant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans fed on a high glucose concentration in liquid media as a  model and tested the effects of carnitine supplementation on their survival under heat-stress. Carnitine at 100 μM completely prevented the survival reduction that was caused by the application of 10 mM glucose. RNA-interference for sir-2.1, a candidate genes mediating the effects of carnitine revealed no contribution of the sirtuin for the rescue of survival. Under daf-12 RNAi rescue of survival by carnitine was abolished. RNA-interference for γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 2, encoding the key enzyme for carnitine biosynthesis did neither increase glucose toxicity nor prevent the rescue of survival by carnitine, suggesting that the effects of carnitine supplementation on carnitine levels were significant. Finally, it was demonstrated that neither the amount of lysosomes nor the proteasomal activity were increased by carnitine, excluding that protein degradation pathways, such as autophagy or proteasomal degradation, are involved in the protective carnitine effects. In conclusion, carnitine supplementation prevents the reduction of survival caused by glucose in C. elegans in dependence on a nuclear hormone receptor which displays high homologies to the vertebrate peroxisomal proliferator activated receptors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Prebiotic supplementation has been purported to reduce TMAO production, but whether prebiotics reduce fasting or postprandial TMAO levels is unclear. Sedentary, overweight/obese adults at risk for T2DM ( = 18) were randomized to consume a standardized diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat) with 10 g/day of either an inulin supplement or maltodextrin placebo for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained in the fasting state and hourly during a 4-h high-fat challenge meal (820 kcal; 25% carbohydrate, 63% fat; 317.4 mg choline, 62.5 mg betaine, 8.1 mg l-carnitine) before and after the diet. Plasma TMAO and trimethylamine (TMA) moieties (choline, l-carnitine, betaine, and &gamma;-butyrobetaine) were measured using isocratic ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). There were no differences in fasting or postprandial TMAO or TMA moieties between the inulin and placebo groups at baseline (all  > 0.05). There were no significant changes in fasting or postprandial plasma TMAO or TMA moiety concentrations following inulin or placebo. These findings suggest that inulin supplementation for 6 weeks did not reduce fasting or postprandial TMAO in individuals at risk for T2DM. Future studies are needed to identify efficacious interventions that reduce plasma TMAO concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19553674>Carnitine insufficiency caused by aging and overnutrition compromises mitochondrial performance and metabolic control.</a></h2><p>In addition to its essential role in permitting mitochondrial import and oxidation of long chain fatty acids, carnitine also functions as an acyl group acceptor that facilitates mitochondrial export of excess carbons in the form of acylcarnitines. Recent evidence suggests carnitine requirements increase under conditions of sustained metabolic stress. Accordingly, we hypothesized that carnitine insufficiency might contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-related impairments in glucose tolerance. Consistent with this prediction whole body carnitine diminution was identified as a common feature of insulin-resistant states such as advanced age, genetic , and diet-induced obesity. In rodents fed a lifelong (12 month) high fat diet, compromised carnitine status corresponded with increased skeletal muscle accumulation of acylcarnitine esters and diminished hepatic expression of carnitine biosynthetic genes. Diminished carnitine reserves in muscle of obese rats was accompanied by marked perturbations in mitochondrial fuel metabolism, including low rates of complete fatty acid oxidation, elevated incomplete beta-oxidation, and impaired substrate switching from fatty acid to pyruvate. These mitochondrial abnormalities were reversed by 8 weeks of oral carnitine supplementation, in concert with increased tissue efflux and urinary excretion of acetylcarnitine and improvement of whole body glucose tolerance. Acetylcarnitine is produced by the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT). A role for this enzyme in combating glucose intolerance was further supported by the finding that CrAT overexpression in primary human skeletal myocytes increased glucose uptake and attenuated lipid-induced suppression of glucose oxidation. These results implicate carnitine insufficiency and reduced CrAT activity as reversible components of the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23052862>Metabolic profiling reveals new serum biomarkers for differentiating diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Capillary electrophoresis coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to explore new serum biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for diabetic nephropathy (DN) diagnosis, through comprehensive analysis of serum metabolites with 78 diabetic patients. Multivariate analyses were used for identification of marker candidates and development of discriminative models. Of the 289 profiled metabolites, orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis identified 19 metabolites that could distinguish between DN with macroalbuminuria and diabetic patients without albuminuria. These identified metabolites included creatinine, aspartic acid, γ-butyrobetaine, citrulline, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), kynurenine, azelaic acid, and galactaric acid. Significant correlations between all these metabolites and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios (p < 0.009, Spearman's rank test) were observed. When five metabolites (including γ-butyrobetaine, SDMA, azelaic acid and two unknowns) were selected from 19 metabolites and applied for multiple logistic regression model, AUC value for diagnosing DN was 0.927 using the whole dataset, and 0.880 in a cross-validation test. In addition, when four known metabolites (aspartic acid, SDMA, azelaic acid and galactaric acid) were applied, the resulting AUC was still high at 0.844 with the whole dataset and 0.792 with cross-validation. Combination of serum metabolomics with multivariate analyses enabled accurate discrimination of DN patients. The results suggest that capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry based metabolome analysis could be used for DN diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12439634>The use of partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitors for metabolic therapy of angina pectoris and heart failure.</a></h2><p>Partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitors have raised great interest since they are expected to counteract a dysregulated gene expression of hypertrophied cardiocytes. Some of these compounds have been developed for treating non-insulin-dependent  and stable angina pectoris. A shift from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation leads to a reduced gluconeogenesis and improved economy of cardiac work. An increased glucose oxidation can be achieved with the following enzyme inhibitors: etomoxir, oxfenicine, methyl palmoxirate, S-15176, metoprolol, amiodarone, perhexiline (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1); aminocarnitine, perhexiline (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2); hydrazonopropionic acid (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase); MET-88 ( hydroxylase); 4-bromocrotonic acid, trimetazidine, possibly ranolazine (thiolases); hypoglycin (butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase); dichloroacetate (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase). CLINICAL TRIALS with trimetazidine and ranolazine showed that this shift in substrate oxidation has an antianginal action. Etomoxir and MET-88 improved the function of overloaded hearts by increasing the density of the Ca(2+) pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2). The promoters of SERCA2 and alpha-myosin heavy-chain exhibit sequences which are expected to respond to transcription factors responsive to glucose metabolites and/or peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPAR) agonists. Further progress in elucidating novel compounds which upregulate SERCA2 expression is closely linked to the characterization of regulatory sequences of the SERCA2 promoter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29325058>Serum Carnitine Metabolites and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Patients With Suspected Stable Angina Pectoris.</a></h2><p>Carnitine and its metabolites are centrally involved in fatty acid metabolism. Although elevated circulating concentrations have been observed in  and insulin resistance, prospective studies examining whether these metabolites are associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are sparse.We performed a comprehensive evaluation of metabolites along the carnitine pathway relative to incident T2D.A total of 2519 patients (73.1% men) with coronary artery disease, but without T2D, were followed for median 7.7 years until the end of 2009, during which 173 (6.9%) new cases of T2D were identified. Serum levels of free carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine (TML) and γ-butyrobetaine, and the esters acetyl-, propionyl-, (iso)valeryl-, octanoyl-, and palmitoylcarnitine were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Risk associations were explored by logistic regression and reported per (log-transformed) standard deviation increment.Median age at inclusion was 62 years and median body mass index (BMI) 26.0 kg/m2. In models adjusted for age, sex, fasting status, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glycated hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and study center, serum levels of TML and palmitoylcarnitine associated positively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.22 (1.04 to 1.43) and 1.24 (1.04 to 1.49), respectively], whereas γ-butyrobetaine associated negatively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98)] with T2D risk.Serum levels of TML, γ-butyrobetaine, and the long-chained palmitoylcarnitine predict long-term risk of T2D independently of traditional risk factors, possibly reflecting dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism in patients susceptible to T2D development.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730694>Acylcarnitines as markers of exercise-associated fuel partitioning, xenometabolism, and potential signals to muscle afferent neurons.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Does improved metabolic health and insulin sensitivity following a weight-loss and fitness intervention in sedentary, obese women alter exercise-associated fuel metabolism and incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as tracked by blood acylcarnitine patterns? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite improved fitness and blood sugar control, indices of incomplete mitochondrial FAO increased in a similar manner in response to a fixed load acute exercise bout; this indicates that intramitochondrial muscle FAO is inherently inefficient and is tethered directly to ATP turnover. With insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, mismatches between mitochondrial fatty acid fuel delivery and oxidative phosphorylation/tricarboxylic acid cycle activity may contribute to inordinate accumulation of short- or medium-chain acylcarnitine fatty acid derivatives [markers of incomplete long-chain fatty acid oxidation (FAO)]. We reasoned that incomplete FAO in muscle would be ameliorated concurrent with improved insulin sensitivity and fitness following a ∼14 week training and weight-loss intervention in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women. Contrary to this hypothesis, overnight-fasted and exercise-induced plasma C4-C14 acylcarnitines did not differ between pre- and postintervention phases. These metabolites all increased robustly with exercise (∼45% of pre-intervention peak oxygen consumption) and decreased during a 20 min cool-down. This supports the idea that, regardless of insulin sensitivity and fitness, intramitochondrial muscle β-oxidation and attendant incomplete FAO are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate. Acute exercise also led to branched-chain amino acid acylcarnitine derivative patterns suggestive of rapid and transient diminution of branched-chain amino acid flux through the mitochondrial branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. We confirmed our prior novel observation that a weight-loss/fitness intervention alters plasma xenometabolites [i.e. cis-3,4-methylene-heptanoylcarnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (a co-metabolite possibly derived in part from gut bacteria)], suggesting that host metabolic health regulated gut microbe metabolism. Finally, we considered whether acylcarnitine metabolites signal to muscle-innervating afferents; palmitoylcarnitine at concentrations as low as 1-10 μm activated a subset (∼2.5-5%) of these neurons ex vivo. This supports the hypothesis that in addition to tracking exercise-associated shifts in fuel metabolism, muscle acylcarnitines act as signals of exertion to short-loop somatosensory-motor circuits or to the brain.© 2016 The Authors.

Since l-carnitine is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, the decline in its levels stimulates glucose metabolism and decreases concentrations of l-carnitine related metabolites, such as long-chain acylcarnitines and trimethylamine-N-oxide.

Declines in skeletal muscle and functionality not only impacts mobility but also increases chronic disease risk, such as type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to measure adaptive metabolic responses to acute changes in habitual activity in a cohort of overweight, pre-diabetic older adults (age = 69 ± 4 years; BMI = 27 ± 4 kg/m,  = 17) when using non-targeted metabolite profiling by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Participants completed two weeks of step reduction (<1000 steps/day) followed by a two week recovery period, where fasting plasma samples were collected at three time intervals at baseline, after step reduction and following recovery. Two weeks of step reduction elicited increases in circulatory metabolites associated with a decline in muscle energy metabolism and protein degradation, including glutamine, carnitine and creatine ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.30), as well as methionine and  ( < 0.05; effect size ≈ 0.20) as compared to baseline. Similarly, decreases in uremic toxins in plasma that promote muscle inflammation, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid, as well as oxoproline, a precursor used for intramuscular glutathione recycling, were also associated with physical inactivity ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.20). Our results indicate that older persons are susceptible to metabolic perturbations due to short-term step reduction that were not fully reversible with resumption of normal ambulatory activity over the same time period. These plasma biomarkers may enable early detection of inactivity-induced metabolic dysregulation in older persons at risk for sarcopenia not readily measured by current imaging techniques or muscle function tests, which is required for the design of therapeutic interventions to counter these deleterious changes in support of healthy ageing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270397>Validated method for the quantification of free and total carnitine, butyrobetaine, and acylcarnitines in biological samples.</a></h2><p>A validated quantitative method for the determination of free and total carnitine, butyrobetaine, and acylcarnitines is presented. The versatile method has four components: (1) isolation using strong cation-exchange solid-phase extraction, (2) derivatization with pentafluorophenacyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, (3) sequential ion-exchange/reversed-phase (ultra) high-performance liquid chromatography [(U)HPLC] using a strong cation-exchange trap in series with a fused-core HPLC column, and (4) detection with electrospray ionization multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry (MS). Standardized carnitine along with 65 synthesized, standardized acylcarnitines (including short-chain, medium-chain, long-chain, dicarboxylic, hydroxylated, and unsaturated acyl moieties) were used to construct multiple-point calibration curves, resulting in accurate and precise quantification. Separation of the 65 acylcarnitines was accomplished in a single chromatogram in as little as 14 min. Validation studies were performed showing a high level of accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. The method provides capabilities unavailable by tandem MS procedures, making it an ideal approach for confirmation of newborn screening results and for clinical and basic research projects, including treatment protocol studies, acylcarnitine biomarker studies, and metabolite studies using plasma, urine, tissue, or other sample matrixes.</p></html>
