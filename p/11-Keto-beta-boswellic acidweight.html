<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23092618>Enhanced absorption of boswellic acids by a lecithin delivery form (Phytosome(®)) of Boswellia extract.</a></h1><p>The anti-inflammatory potential of Boswellia serrata gum resin extracts has been demonstrated in vitro and in animal studies as well as in pilot clinical trials. However, pharmacokinetic studies have evidenced low systemic absorption of boswellic acids (BAs), especially of KBA and AKBA, in rodents and humans. This observation has provided a rationale to improve the formulation of Boswellia extract. We present here the results of a murine comparative bioavailability study of Casperome™, a soy lecithin formulation of standardized B. serrata gum resin extract (BE), and its corresponding non-formulated extract. The concentration of the six major BAs [11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), β-boswellic acid (βBA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (AβBA), α-boswellic acid (αBA), and acetyl-α-boswellic acid (AαBA)] was evaluated in the plasma and in a series of tissues (brain, muscle, eye, liver and kidney), providing the first data on tissue distribution of BAs.  equivalent and equimolar oral administration of Casperome™ provided significantly higher plasma levels (up to 7-fold for KBA, and 3-fold for βBA quantified as area under the plasma concentration time curve, AUC(last)) compared to the non-formulated extract. This was accompanied by remarkably higher tissue levels. Of particular relevance was the marked increase in brain concentration of KBA and AKBA (35-fold) as well as βBA (3-fold) following Casperome™ administration. Notably, up to 17 times higher BA levels were observed in poorly vascularized organs such as the eye. The increased systemic availability of BAs and the improved tissue distribution, qualify Casperome™ for further clinical development to fully exploit the clinical potential of BE.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Topical application of BE to the backs of mice markedly inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced increases in skin inflammation, epidermal proliferation, the number of epidermal cell layers, and tumor promotion in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. Feeding 0.2% of BE in the diet to CF-1 mice for 10-24 weeks reduced the accumulation of parametrial fat pad  under the abdomen, and inhibited azoxymethane (AOM)-induced formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) by 46%. Addition of pure beta-boswellic acid, 3-O-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid,  or 3-O-acetyl- to human leukemia HL-60 cell culture inhibited DNA synthesis in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values ranging from 0.6 to 7.1 microM. These results indicate that beta-boswellic acid and its derivatives (the major constituents of Boswellin) have anti-carcinogenic, anti-tumor, and anti-hyperlipidemic activities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11587352>Development of a high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of  in human plasma.</a></h1><p>A validated HPLC method for the determination of  (KBA) in human plasma was developed. The method involves the solid-phase extraction of KBA from plasma followed by a separation with reversed-phase HPLC. Calibration was based on external standardisation and ranged between 0.1 and 2.0 microg KBA per ml plasma. Linearity was established over the entire calibration range and in each case the coefficient of correlation (r2) was above 0.99. The recovery of KBA from plasma was 85.7%. It was further demonstrated that the method can be applied successfully to monitor the level of KBA in plasma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980494>In Vivo Osteoinduction: Evaluating 2-Beta Coxatene as an Immunoinductive Compound and Novel Ingredient for Joint Support.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage. Many treatments lack the ability to stimulate the growth of native cartilage tissue while they simultaneously increase joint comfort. For the past few decades, dietary supplements have been investigated for the ability to both address joint inflammation and stimulate cartilage tissue.The present study intended to examine the supplement's in vivo osteoinductive capabilities and clinical efficacy for overall joint health.The research team designed a randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical trial.The study took place via telephone interviews.Participants had self-reported OA of a weight-bearing joint (ie, of the knee, hip, spine, or ankle). Patients were recruited using the Health Science Institute, a consumer supplement newsletter.Participants in the intervention group were blindly given 135 mg of 2-Beta Coxatene (2BCT) orally, which contained (1) a custom blend of low-dose Cyplexinol, an osteoinductive protein complex derived from bovine bone tissue, and (2)  resin enriched to 65% 3--Acetyl-11-keto-β-Boswellic acid. A positive control group was blindly given 1500 mg of glucosamine hydrogen chloride and 1200 mg of chondroitin sulfate. Participants took the supplements for 3 mo.A histological evaluation was performed on an athymic rat to test the supplement's in vivo osteoinductive capabilities. A negative control, commercially purchased, unhydrolyzed type 2 collagen was used for that test. Participants were evaluated for parameters of pain and joint function at baseline (day 0) and at days 7, 30, and 90 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA index and a visual analogue scale (VAS).The histological evaluation of the athymic rat confirmed that the Cyplexinol component of the 2BCT was positive for de novo bone tissue and collagen synthesis, corroborating osteoinduction. In the clinical trial, the intervention group reported significant decreases of 57.4%, 52.5%, and 58% in normalized WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness, and joint functionality, respectively, from baseline to postintervention. The control group reported a decrease of 17.5%, 18.1%, and 23.9% for pain, stiffness, and joint functionality, respectively. For the intervention group, pain intensity and frequency, as measured by the VAS, also decreased 57.1% and 56.3%, respectively, from baseline to postintervention, whereas the control group showed a decrease in VAS scores of 18.0% and 14.8%, respectively. In total, an average of 81.2% of participants administered the 2BCT had reported a statistically significant improvement from baseline to postintervention, compared with 22.9% of participants administered glucosamine and chondroitin.In vivo studies confirmed that the bioactive proteins (Cyplexinol) within the 2BCT stimulated de novo bone and cartilage tissue production, demonstrating osteoinduction. The intervention group reported greater improvements in the psychometric evaluations that assessed joint comfort when compared with participants given the glucosamine and chondroitin. The results suggest that 2BCT may provide a novel and synergistic response to preserving joint homeostasis and improving quality of life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29970196>3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid exerts anti-tumor effects in glioblastoma by arresting cell cycle at G2/M phase.</a></h1><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common, malignant, and lethal primary brain tumor in adults accounting for about 50% of all gliomas. Up to now, the chemotherapy approaches for GBM were limited. 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), the major active ingredient of the gum resin from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carteri Birdw., was reported to inhibit the growth of many types of  cells; however, the underlying mechanism of its anticancer effects are still unclear.The effects of AKBA on cell viability and its cytotoxicity were determined using CCK8 and LDH kits respectively. The EdU-DNA synthesis assay was used to evaluate inhibition of cell proliferation by AKBA. The role of AKBA in glioblastoma cell functions such as migration/invasion, and colony formation was evaluated using transwell chambers and soft agar, respectively. Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to detect AKBA-induced apoptosis. Potential mechanisms of AKBA action were explored by RNA sequencing and the identified hub genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. Finally, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of AKBA was evaluated against a human glioblastoma cell line, U87-MG, in a xenograft mouse model.AKBA inhibited cell proliferation, caused the release of LDH, decreased DNA synthesis, and inhibited the migration, invasion, and colony formation of U251 and U87-MG human glioblastoma cell lines. AKBA increased apoptosis as well as the activity of caspase 3/7 and the protein expression of cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. RNA-sequencing analyses showed that AKBA suppressed the expression of pRB, FOXM1, Aurora A, PLK1, CDC25C, p-CDK1, cyclinB1, Aurora B, and TOP2A while increasing the expression of p21 and GADD45A. These findings were validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which AKBA arrested the cell cycle in glioblastoma cells at the G2/M phase by regulating the p21/FOXM1/cyclin B1 pathway, inhibited mitosis by downregulating the Aurora B/TOP2A pathway, and induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Oral administration of AKBA (100 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of U87-MG cells in a xenograft mouse model.Taken together, these results suggest that AKBA (molecular weight, 512.7 Da) might be a promising chemotherapy drug in the treatment of GBM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20021046>Safety and Toxicological Evaluation of a Novel, Standardized 3-O-Acetyl- (AKBA)-Enriched Boswellia serrata Extract (5-Loxin(R)).</a></h1><p>The novel anti-inflammatory properties of the gum resin derived from Boswellia serrata, also known as Salai guggal in Ayurvedic medicine, are well recognized and highly recommended for human consumption. The active constituents of the gum resin are boswellic acids (BAs). Among the BAs, AKBA potently inhibits 5-lipoxygenase product formation with an IC(50) of 1.5 m muM. We developed a novel Boswellia serrata extract (5-Loxin(R)) enriched with 30% AKBA (US Patent 2004/0073060A1). The genetic basis of the anti-inflammatory effects of 5-Loxin(R) was explored in a system of TNFalpha-induced gene expression in human microvascular endothelial cells. 5-Loxin(R) significantly prevented the TNFalpha-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and inducible expression of the mediators of apoptosis. With such interesting findings, we planned to determine the broad-spectrum safety of 5-Loxin(R). Acute oral, acute dermal, primary skin and eye irritation, and dose-dependent 90-day subchronic toxicity studies were conducted. In safety studies, acute oral LD(50) of 5-Loxin(R) was found to be greater than 5,000 mg/kg in both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. No changes in  or adverse effects were observed following necropsy. Acute dermal LD(50) of 5-Loxin(R) was found to be >2,000 mg/kg. Primary skin irritation test was conducted with 5-Loxin(R) on New Zealand Albino rabbits and 5-Loxin(R) was classified as nonirritating. Primary eye irritation test was conducted with 5-Loxin on rabbits and 5-Loxin(R) was classified as mildly irritating to the eye. A dose-dependent 90-day subchronic toxicity study demonstrated no significant changes in selected organ  individually and as percentages of  and brain . 5-Loxin(R) supplementation did not cause changes in hepatic DNA fragmentation on 30, 60, or 90 days of treatment. Hematology, clinical chemistry, and histopathological evaluations did not show any adverse effects in all organs tested. Taken together, these results demonstrate the broad spectrum safety of 5-Loxin(R).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069256>Separation and quantification of terpenoids of Boswellia serrata Roxb. extract by planar chromatography techniques (TLC and AMD).</a></h1><p>An high-performance TLC (HPTLC) method for the separation of boswellic acids, the active constituents in Boswellia serrata extract, has been developed and TLC of these compounds on silica by automated multiple development (AMD) using solvent gradients was performed. Enhancement of the separation of boswellic acids on HPTLC plates was carried out by AMD chromatography. Densitometric analysis of the developed plate was carried out to quantify the four boswellic acids.  (KBA) and acetyl- (AKBA) were quantified by densitometric scanning of the developed plate at 254 nm. beta-Boswellic acid (BA) and acetyl-beta-boswellic acid (ABA) were quantified after derivatization with anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent at 560 nm. The AMD system provided a clean separation according to polarity for each of the four groups studied and good results were obtained. The proposed HPTLC method for the simultaneous quantification of the major boswellic acids BA, ABA, KBA, and AKBA was found to be simple, precise, specific, sensitive, and accurate and can be used for routine quality control and for the quantification of these compounds in plant materials. The study of market products revealed significant variations in the content of these pharmacologically active compounds in commercial samples.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171201>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid suppresses docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing chemoresistant stem cell-like properties.</a></h1><p>Acquired docetaxel-resistance of prostate cancer (PCa) remains a clinical obstacle due to the lack of effective therapies. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid isolated from the fragrant gum resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, which has shown intriguing antitumor activity against human cell lines established from PCa, colon cancer, malignant glioma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the effects of AKBA against docetaxel-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo as well as its anticancer mechanisms. We showed that AKBA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PC3/Doc cells; its IC value in anti-proliferation was ∼17 μM. Furthermore, AKBA dose-dependently suppressed the chemoresistant stem cell-like properties of PC3/Doc cells, evidenced by significant decrease in the ability of mammosphere formation and down-regulated expression of a number of stemness-associated genes. The activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling  was remarkably enhanced in PC3/Doc cells, which contributed to their chemoresistant stem-like phenotype. AKBA (10-30 μM) dose-dependently suppressed the activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling  in PC3/Doc cells. In contrast, overexpression of Akt and Stat3 significantly attenuated the inhibition of AKBA on PC3/Doc cell proliferation. In docetaxel-resistant PCa homograft mice, treatment with AKBA significantly suppresses the growth of homograft RM-1/Doc, equivalent to its human PC3/Doc, but did not decrease their body weight. In summary, we demonstrate that AKBA inhibits the growth inhibition of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells in vitro and in vivo via blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing their cancer stem cell-like properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11355324>Acetyl-, a constituent of a herbal medicine from Boswellia serrata resin, attenuates experimental ileitis.</a></h1><p>The gum resin extract from Boswellia serrata (H15), an herbal product, was recently shown to have positive therapeutic effects in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the mechanisms and constituents responsible for these effects are poorly understood. This study examined the effect of the Boswellia extract and its single constituent acetyl- (AKBA) on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in an experimental model of IBD. Ileitis was induced by two subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats 24 h apart. Rats also received oral treatment with the Boswellia extract (H15) or AKBA at two different doses (low and high) equivalent to recommendations in human disease over 2 days. Controls received only the carriers NaHCO3 (subcutaneously) and tylose (orally). Effects of treatment were assessed by intravital microscopy in ileal submucosal venules for changes in the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes and by macroscopic and histological scoring. Increased leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interactions and severe tissue injury accompanied indomethacin-induced ileitis. Treatment with the Boswellia extract or AKBA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rolling (up to 90%) and adherent (up to 98%) leukocytes. High-dose Boswellia extract as well as both low- and high-dose AKBA significantly attenuated tissue injury scores. Oral therapy with the Boswellia extract or AKBA significantly reduces macroscopic and microcirculatory inflammatory features normally associated with indomethacin administration, indicating that the anti-inflammatory actions of the Boswellia extract in IBD may be due in part to boswellic acids such as AKBA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27782055>Quantitative Determination of 3-O-Acetyl-11-Keto-βBoswellic Acid (AKBA) and Other Boswellic Acids in Boswellia sacra Flueck (syn. B. carteri Birdw) and Boswellia serrata Roxb.</a></h1><p>Boswellia serrata and Boswellia sacra (syn. B. carteri) are important medicinal plants widely used for their content of bioactive lipophilic triterpenes. The qualitative and quantitative determination of boswellic acids (BAs) is important for their use in dietary supplements aimed to provide a support for osteoarthritic and inflammatory diseases. We used High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-Diode Array Detector (DAD) coupled to ElectroSpray Ionization and tandem Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) for the qualitative and quantitative determination of BAs extracted from the gum resins of B. sacra and B. serrata. Limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and Matrix Effect were assessed in order to validate quantitative data. Here we show that the BAs quantitative determination was 491.20 g·kg-1 d. wt (49%) in B. sacra and 295.25 g·kg-1 d. wt (30%) in B. serrata. Lower percentages of BAs content were obtained when BAs were expressed on the gum resin weight (29% and 16% for B. sacra and B. serrata, respectively). The content of Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) was higher in B. sacra (70.81 g·kg-1 d. wt; 7%) than in B. serrata (7.35 g·kg-1 d. wt; 0.7%). Our results show that any claim of BAs content in either B. sacra or B. serrata gum resins equal to or higher than 70% or AKBA contents of 30% are simply unrealistic or based on a wrong quantitative determination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759942>11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid Inhibits Lymphocyte (CD3) Infiltration Into Pancreatic Islets of Young None Obese Diabetic (NOD) Mice.</a></h1><p>11-Keto-β-Boswellic acid (KBA) has been shown to prevent infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by injection of Multiple Low Doses of Streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), which is a chemical compound belonging to the class of nitrososureas. The aim of this work was to study whether or not KBA can also prevent/attenuate infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by genetic dysfunction resembling human type 1  in several important features. Four weeks old female NOD mice received daily i.p. injections of 7.5 mg/kg of KBA over a period of 3 weeks. Compared to 4 weeks old animals there was significant infiltration of lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in the period between 4 and 7 weeks. During this time plasma glucose dropped significantly and body weight did not increase. As far as pro-inflammatory cytokines are concerned, except a small increase of IFN-γ, there was no change in the blood. In mice that had been treated with KBA between 4 and 7 weeks after birth no significant infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells was observed, when compared to 4 weeks old mice. Moreover, there was no drop of blood glucose and the animals gained body weight. It is concluded that - similar to the model of MLD-STZ- - also in the NOD mouse model KBA is able to attenuate or even prevent development of insulitis, suggesting that KBA protects islets from autoimmune reaction regardless whether the signal is provided by a chemical compound or by genetic dysfunction. Whether this also holds for human type 1  remains to be established.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12008153>Determination of  in human plasma.</a></h1><p>A sensitive, specific, accurate, fast and reproducible GC/MS-method for the quantitative determination of  in human plasma using 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid as the internal standard was developed and validated.  and the internal standard were separated from acidified plasma by liquid/liquid extraction.

One such agent is acetyl- (AKBA), derived from the gum resin of the Boswellia serrata known as Salai guggal or Indian frankincense. Traditionally, it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat proinflammatory conditions. In this report, we hypothesized that AKBA can affect the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) in orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice. We found that the oral administration of AKBA (50-200 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the growth of CRC tumors in mice, resulting in decrease in tumor volumes than those seen in vehicle-treated mice without significant decreases in . In addition, we observed that AKBA was highly effective in suppressing ascites and distant metastasis to the liver, lungs and spleen in orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice. When examined for the mechanism, we found that markers of tumor proliferation index Ki-67 and the microvessel density cluster of differentiation (CD31) were significantly downregulated by AKBA treatment. We also found that AKBA significantly suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in the tumor tissue and expression of proinflammatory (cyclooxygenase-2), tumor survival (bcl-2, bcl-xL, inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP-1) and survivin), proliferative (cyclin D1), invasive (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9) and angiogenic C-X-C (CXC) receptor 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor) biomarkers. When examined for serum and tissue levels of AKBA, a dose-dependent increase in the levels of the drug was detected, indicating its bioavailability. Thus, our findings suggest that this boswellic acid analog can inhibit the growth and metastasis of human CRC in vivo through downregulation of cancer-associated biomarkers.Copyright © 2011 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643550>Effect of food intake on the bioavailability of boswellic acids from a herbal preparation in healthy volunteers.</a></h1><p>In this study we investigated the effects of concomitant food intake on the bioavailability of distinct boswellic acids (BAs) from the test preparation BSE-018, a dry extract from Boswellia serrata gum resin. In a randomised, open, single-dose, two-way crossover study, healthy male subjects received three capsules of BSE-018 equivalent to 786 mg dry extract of Boswellia serrata gum resin either in the fasted state or together with a standardised high-fat meal. BA plasma concentrations were analysed for up to 60 h after oral dosing by reversed phase HPLC. As compared to the fasted state (treatment A), the administration of BSE-018 concomitantly with a high-fat meal (treatment B) led to several-fold increased areas under the plasma concentration-time curves as well as peak concentrations of beta-boswellic acid (betaBA),  (KbetaBA) and acetyl- (AKbetaBA). Plasma levels of both acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid (AalphaBA) and alphaBA became only detectable when administered with treatment B, i.e., the high-fat meal. Accordingly, pharmacokinetic data could be calculated for betaBA, KbetaBA and AKbetaBA (treatment A) and for betaBA, KbetaBA, AKbetaBA, alphaBA, and AalphaBA (treatment B). For the first time these data reveal detailed kinetics of BAs after oral dosing of an extract and demonstrate a profound effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetic profile of the BAs. This finding should be very important whenever BAs would be considered for therapeutic use.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18796232>A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the estimation of boswellic acids from the market formulations containing Boswellia serrata extract.</a></h1><p>A simple, rapid, and reproducible reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is developed for the estimation of boswellic acids, the active constituents in Boswellia serrata oleo-gum resin.
