To study the mechanism of  and detoxification of silk gland under  exposure, we measured the residual quantity of  in silk gland and hemolymph after  exposure, and the detoxifying enzymes-related genes and enzyme activity were also investigated. Results indicated that the residual amount of  existed up to 24 h in silk gland compared with that in hemolymph, suggesting that  can accumulate in the silk glands within a certain time course. The transcriptional levels of PI3K/Akt genes, including Akt, Tor1, p70s6k and 4e-bp, were up-regulated by 6.919, 1.358, 10.766 and 7.708-fold, respectively. The expression of two downstream genes (CncC and Keap1) was up-regulated by 1.939 and 3.373-fold, respectively. In addition, the transcriptional levels of detoxification-related genes including CYP6AB, CYP306A, CarE2, GST1 and GSTd1 were up-regulated by 1.731, 1.221, 1.366, 1.376 and 6.591-fold, respectively. The enzymatic activity of CYP450, CarE and GST were increased over time.

Eggs (1 g) were blended with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (1 g) for sample pretreatment and extracted with acetonitrile. The extracts were then further purified with SPE silica gel tubes deactivated with trimethylamine. Residues were analyzed via a reversed phase-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS/MS) in positive-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Tebufenozide was utilized as an internal standard for the quantification of  and its metabolite residues. The identification and quantification of analytes were based on ion transitions monitored by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). LC-MS/MS analysis was performed from 0.02 to 1 mg kg(-1) and correlation coefficients (r(2)) ranging from 0.998 to 0.999 were obtained for both analytes in blank egg extracts. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra- and inter-day variations ranged from 2.1% to 6.7% and from 2.8% to 6.4% for  and DCTP in chicken and quail eggs. At all levels of fortification (0.02, 0.05, and 0.125 mg kg(-1)), the recoveries fell within a range of 81.3% to 93.6% for  and 83.3% to 90.1% for DCTP. The matrix effect was <2%, due to the partial dilution of the sample. Decision limits (CCalpha) and detection capabilities (CCbeta) were in the range of 0.0005-0.0044 and 0.0054-0.0224 mg kg(-1), respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine the importance of P-gp for susceptibility to insecticides in the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) gene-editing technology. We cloned an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the S. exigua P-gp protein (SeP-gp) predicted to display structural characteristics common to P-gp and other insect ABCB1 transporters. A knockout line with a frame shift deletion of four nucleotides in the SeP-gp ORF was established using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system to test its potential role in determining susceptibility to chemical insecticides or insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Results from comparative bioassays demonstrate that knockout of SeP-gp significantly increases susceptibility of S. exigua by around threefold to abamectin and emamectin benzoate (EB), but not to spinosad, chlorfenapyr, beta-cypermethrin, carbosulfan indoxacarb, chlorpyrifos, , diafenthiuron, chlorfluazuron, chlorantraniliprole or two Bt toxins (Cry1Ca and Cry1Fa). Our data support an important role for SeP-gp in susceptibility of S. exigua to abamectin and EB and imply that overexpression of SeP-gp may contribute to abamectin and EB resistance in S. exigua.© 2017 The Royal Entomological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7817649>[The characteristics of the action on hydrobionts of the insecticide Valexon].</a></h2><p>The effect of organophosphorus insecticide, valexon, has been investigated on hydrobionts from different taxonomic groups.

Fenvalerate was shown to mimic estrogenic activity, whereas  did not induce similar effects. Our previous studies demonstrated that JWA, a novel retinoic acid-inducible and cytoskeleton-associated gene, is also a potential environmental-responsive gene with increased expression to oxidative and heat-shock stresses. In the present study, the influence of both fenvalerate and  was examined on the expression of JWA in MCF-7 (ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-) human breast carcinoma cell lines. Concentrations of 0.01, 1, and 100 micromol/L of fenvalerate or  were selected to treat both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at 1, 3, and 5 d, respectively. The MTT results only showed that fenvalerate stimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation. Western blot assay was employed to detect the expressions of JWA and heat-shock proteins (hsp27 and hsp70). The results showed that after treatment with fenvalerate, both JWA and hsp70 showed similar expression patterns in the both cell lines; however, all the expression patterns of JWA, hsp27, and hsp70 were evidently reversed between ER+ and ER- cells. In addition, -treated cells showed a concentration-dependent relationship in JWA expression at all time points. These results suggest that JWA has similar functions with respect to hsp27 and hsp70, and might be a novel signal molecule in estrogen receptor-related signal transduction  in mammalian cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7816740>Ketamine protects acetylcholinesterase against inhibition by propoxur and .</a></h2><p>In the present study the effect of ketamine on the contractions caused by propoxur and  on the isolated guinea pig ileum was investigated.

However, these pesticides pose various threats to organisms, including humans, and are thus a cause of concern. Five organophosphorous pesticides, monocrotophos, omethoate, parathion-methyl,  and dichlorvos, were examined for their effects on mammalian cell lines to determine their potential impact on physiological functions in vivo. Results show an increased proliferation of MCF-7 cells treated with 0.2 microM monocrotophos or 0.4 microM omethoate, suggesting that these compounds can induce breast cancer cell proliferation at relatively low concentrations. Murine primary spleen cells markedly decreased in number starting at a pesticide concentration of 0.01 microM; no cytotoxicity was observed below 0.001 microM. BALB/c3T3 murine fibroblasts treated with 0.25 microM monocrotophos showed enhanced DNA synthesis, while those treated with the other pesticides showed results similar to that of the control. The different pesticides reduced the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of the rat neuronal cell line PC12 in a dose-dependent manner up to 100 microM. Parathion-methyl and  showed acute toxicity at 0.01 microM. Finally,  and parathion-methyl significantly reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of human intestinal Caco-2 cells, indicating that these pesticides can disrupt the tight-junction permeability of cell monolayers. These in vitro assays, which are rapid, reproducible, simple and inexpensive, clearly show the effects of organophosphorous pesticides on mammalian cells and suggest the potential impact of these pesticides on organisms in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239122>Exposure to herbicides reduces larval sensitivity to insecticides in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).</a></h2><p>Herbicides and insecticides are widely used in modern agriculture. It has been reported in various studies that application of insecticides can increase tolerance of herbivorous insects to insecticides. However, limited information exists on susceptibility to insecticides when insects are exposed to herbicides. This study was conducted to investigate the potential impact of the herbicides trifluralin and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid sodium salt (MCPA-Na) on the susceptibility of the nocturnal moth Spodoptera litura to the insecticides λ-cyhalothrin,  and bifenthrin. We found that larvae exposed to trifluralin or MCPA-Na became significantly less susceptible to both insecticides than non-exposed control larvae. Herbicide-treated larvae did not show altered growth under the used test conditions. However, heads of herbicide-treated larvae showed increased expression of the acetylcholinesterase genes SlAce1 and SlAce2. Moreover, the fat body and midgut of herbicide-treated larvae displayed elevated expression of detoxification genes (the carboxylesterase gene SlCarE; the glutathione S-transferase genes SlGSTe2 and SlGSTe3; the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes CYP6B48, CYP9A40 and CYP321B1). The CYP6B48 gene exhibited highest inducibility. In conclusion, the data of this study suggest that exposure of S. litura larvae to herbicides may stimulate detoxification mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of insecticides.© 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014821>[The influence of sodium bicarbonate combined with ulinastatin on cholinesterase activity for patients with acute  pesticide poisoning].</a></h2><p>To observe the effect of sodium bicarbonate combined with ulinastatin on cholinesterase activity for patients with acute  pesticide poisoning.A total of 67 eligible patients with acute  pesticide poisoning, Who were admitted to the emeryency department of hospital from March 2011 to February 2014, Acording to different treatments au patients were randomly divided into the conventional treatment group (n=34) and the sodium bicarbonate+ulinastatin group (n=35) .

Normal nerve conduction was severely affected by  treatments, as revealed by: increases in the contents of neurotransmitters Glu, NO, and ACh by 63.65%, 61.14%, and 98.54%, respectively; decreases in the contents of 5-HT and DA by 53.19% and 43.71%, respectively; reductions in the activities of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-ATPase, and AChE by 85.27%, 85.63%, and 85.63%, respectively; and increase in the activity of TNOS by 22.33%. CeCl3 pretreatment can significantly reduce such damages. Results of DGE and qRT-PCR indicated that CeCl3 treatments significantly upregulated the expression levels of CYP4G23, cyt-b5, GSTs-σ1, ace1, esterase-FE4, and β-esterase 2. Overall,  treatments cause nerve tissue lesions, neuron death, and nerve conduction hindrance, but CeCl3 pretreatments can promote the expression of  resistance-related genes in silkworm brains to reduce -induced damages.

Here we describe the application of the recombinant insecticide-resistant mosquito carboxylesterase B1 to detoxify organophosphorous compounds. However, this approach has a major limitation: 1:1 stoichiometry of the enzyme detoxification of those organophosphorous compounds containing no carboxyl ester bonds, such as paraoxon, chlorpyrifos etc. To improve the effectiveness of the enzymatic detoxification of organophosphorous compounds, we used a combination of carboxylesterase B1 with the uncharged oxime diacetylmonoxime. It was demonstrated that the repeated addition of 20 times the molar concentration of paraoxon to carboxylesterase B1 every 2 h in the presence of 4 mM diacetylmonoxime did not result in significant inhibition of the enzyme. The stoichiometry of enzyme detoxification was higher than 45:1 and 20:1 for paraoxon and chlorpyrifos, respectively. The kinetic experiments on reactivation of organophosphorus compound-inhibited carboxylesterase B1 showed that the half-life for paraoxon- and chlorpyrifos-inhibited carboxylesterase reactivation is 0.75 and 0.88 h, respectively. Using the recombinant insecticide-resistant mosquito carboxylesterase with oxime is an effective approach for detoxification of organophosphorous compounds.Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mutations in AChE may significantly reduce insects susceptibility to these pesticides. Bombyx mori is an important beneficial insect, and no OP- or CB-resistant strains have been generated. In this study, wild-type ace1 (wace1) and mutant ace1 (mace1) were introduced into BmN cells, confirmed by screening and identification. The expression of wace1 and mace1 in the cells was confirmed by Western blot and their expression levels were about 21-fold higher than the endogenous ace1 level. The activities of AChE in wace1 and mace1 transgenic cells were 10.6 and 20.2% higher compared to control cells, respectively. mace1 transgenic cells had higher remaining activity than wace1 transgenic cells under the treatment of physostigmine (a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor) and  (an OP acaricide). The results showed that ace1 transgene can significantly improve ace1 expression, and ace1 mutation at a specific site can reduce the sensitivity to AChE inhibitors.

Using algae to eliminate CO2, which has been proposed as an effective way to reduce the greenhouse effect in the past decades, can be disturbed by a growing number of artificial chemicals. Thus, seven types of chemicals and Selenastrum capricornutum (algae) were examined in this study, and the good consistency between the toxicity of artificial chemicals to algae and the disturbance of carbon fixation by the chemicals was revealed. This consistency showed that the disturbance of an increasing number of artificial chemicals to the carbon fixation of algae might be a "malware" worsening the global greenhouse effect.

Silkworm midgut is the major organ for digestion and nutrient absorption, importantly it is also a  against foreign substances and chemical pesticides. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of oxidative injury in silkworm midgut with  induction. The results showed that the transcription level of oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway genes of midgut under  stress. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed that 24 electron transport chain (ETC)-related genes were upregulated. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the ETC the genes encoding NADH-CoQ1, Succinic-Q, cyt c reductase-S, cyt c oxidase-S, cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide IV, ATP synthase, and vacuolar H+ ATP synthase were all significantly up-regulated by 1.50-, 1.31-, 1.42-, 1.44-, 1.70-, 2.03- and 1.43-fold, respectively.  induction enhanced the activity of ETC complex in mitochondria, and induced the accumulation of ROS in midgut. These results indicated that trace  enhanced respiration in midgut, and the imbalance between the activity changes of ETC may led to reactive oxygen species accumulation. The ETC of mitochondria may be potential biomarkers of midgut toxicity in B. mori caused by  exposure.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hens treated with the insecticide isofenphos (90 mg/kg p.o.) developed severe cholinergic toxicity followed by mild organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP). However, a patient developed severe OPIDP, which was preceded by very mild cholinergic signs, after an attempted suicide with a commercial formulation containing isofenphos and , an insecticide not causing OPIDP (estimated doses were 500 and 125 mg/kg, respectively). To explain this difference the following hypotheses were tested: (1)  is a promoter of isofenphos-induced OPIDP; (2) whereas neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is thought to be the target of OPIDP, activation of isofenphos by liver microsomes causes the formation of more potent NTE inhibitor(s) in humans than in hens; (3) in contrast to hen NTE, the sensitivity of the human enzyme to such inhibitor(s) is higher than that of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the target of cholinergic toxicity. Results showed that  (22.5 mg/kg p.o.) was not a promoter of OPIDP in hens and that the ratio AChE inhibition:NTE inhibition by microsome-activated isofenphos was similar for both hen and human enzymes. The schedule of antidotal treatment in hens is the likely explanation for the observed difference from the patient. Peak AChE inhibition was maintained in hen brain up to 6 days after a single dose of isofenphos, suggesting prolonged pharmacokinetics. However, the AChE reactivator pyridine-2-aldoxime (2-PAM) was given to hens before isofenphos and then every 8 h, whereas continuous 2-PAM infusion was provided to the patient. When 2-PAM was given to hens every hour after isofenphos (90 mg/kg p.o.), the birds remained asymptomatic. Since other organophosphates may have a prolonged pharmacokinetics, testing procedures for the potential of these insecticides to cause OPIDP may underestimate the risk for humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863567>Detoxification of insecticides, allechemicals and heavy metals by glutathione S-transferase SlGSTE1 in the gut of Spodoptera litura.</a></h2><p>Insect glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play important roles in detoxifying toxic compounds and eliminating oxidative stress caused by these compounds. In this study, detoxification activity of the epsilon GST SlGSTE1 in Spodoptera litura was analyzed for several insecticides and heavy metals. SlGSTE1 was significantly up-regulated by chlorpyrifos and xanthotoxin in the midgut of S. litura. The recombinant SlGSTE1 had Vmax (reaction rate of the enzyme saturated with the substrate) and Km (michaelis constant and equals to the substrate concentration at half of the maximum reaction rate of the enzyme) values of 27.95 ± 0.88 μmol/min/mg and 0.87 ± 0.028 mmol/L for glutathione, respectively, and Vmax and Km values of 22.96 ± 0.78 μmol/min/mg and 0.83 ± 0.106 mmol/L for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, respectively. In vitro enzyme indirect activity assay showed that the recombinant SlGSTE1 possessed high binding activities to the insecticides chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, malathion,  and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). SlGSTE1 showed higher binding activity to toxic heavy metals cadmium, chromium and lead than copper and zinc that are required for insect normal growth. Western blot analysis showed that SlGSTE1 was induced in the gut of larvae fed with chlorpyrifos or cadmium. SlGSTE1 also showed high peroxidase activity. All the results together indicate that SlGSTE1 may play an important role in the gut of S. litura to protect the insect from the toxic effects of these compounds and heavy metals.© 2014 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8345567>Percutaneous absorption of organophosphorus insecticides in pigs--the influence of different vehicles.</a></h2><p>In 40 experiments on 20 pigs three different organophosphorus insecticides (OPs), parathion (n = 6),  (n = 7) and phosmet (n = 7), were administered both intravenously (i.v.) and dermally (d.) as 'pour-ons' in a crossover design in order to determine the dermal bioavailability of the OPs. As percutaneous absorption of drugs may be affected by the vehicle used, three chemically different vehicles--DMSO, 1-octanol and macrogol 400-were used for the dermal administration of each of the OPs. The pharmacokinetic parameters measured showed that 15-30% of dermally applied parathion is absorbed when administered in DMSO or octanol, but only 4-5% when administered in macrogol. Absorption was fastest with DMSO and slowest with macrogol. For the two ectoparasiticides,  and phosmet, only between 0.5 and 3% of the dermal dose was absorbed with little difference in the absorption rate between the three vehicles. On the basis of the very limited dermal bioavailability for these two OPs it seems doubtful whether sufficient concentrations can reach the ectoparasites through the systemic route.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396874>Estrogenicity of organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides.</a></h2><p>Although organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides are considered environmental contaminants, their estrogenic potentials are still ubiquitous and unclear. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the estrogenic activities of nine pesticides (, malathion, monocrotophos, dimethoate, opunal, fenvalerate, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin) using three in vitro methods [E-Screen assay, estrogen receptor (ER) competitive binding assay, and pS2 expression assay]. All the pyrethroid pesticides tested induced MCF-7 cell proliferation significantly, while organophosphorus pesticides did not. The estrogenic potency were ranked as permethrin > fenvalerate > cypermethrin > deltamethrin. The proliferation induced by cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin was blocked by ICI 182.780, while fenvalerate only partly inhibited it. In addition, pyrethroid pesticides inhibited the binding of [3H]estradiol to ER, while the organophosphorus failed to do so. Fenvalerate, permethrin, and cypermethrin induced pS2 mRNA expression with varying potency, while there were no significant effects in deltamethrin-treated groups. Our findings provide evidence to support the idea that pyrethroid pesticides tested produce an ER-specific, agonist response. Fenvalerate induced MCF-7 cell proliferation by a mechanism not involving ER-mediated pathway. Organophosphorus pesticides tested showed no estrogenic potential. Compared with the pS2 expression assay, E-Screen was a more sensitive and useful assay for screening of the xenoestrogenic chemicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16125883>Androgen receptor activities of p,p'-DDE, fenvalerate and  detected by androgen receptor reporter gene assay.</a></h2><p>In this study, we have developed a transient human androgen receptor (hAR) reporter gene assay using African monkey kidney cell line CV-1. The assay displayed appropriate response to the known androgen receptor (AR) agonist 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and AR antagonist nilutamide. DHT induced AR-mediated transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner with median effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 3.90 x 10(-10) M. Nilutamide exhibited potent antiandrogenic activity with median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 8.90 x 10(-7) M. The transcription could not be activated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone, which suggested that the assay system be highly specific to androgenic compounds without cross-talk to GR agonist. The assay shows acceptable repeatability to DHT with intra coefficient of variability (CV) of 9.3% and inter CV of 10.9%. We applied this assay to evaluate the androgenic and antiandrogenic activities of some pesticides including organochlorine p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), pyrethroid fenvalerate and organophosphorus . The results showed that p,p'-DDE exhibited potent antiandrogenic activity. Fenvalerate acted as weak AR antagonist and  did not show AR antagonistic activity. We failed to find AR agonistic effects of the three pesticides. The present study provided a promising tool to screen for AR agonists and antagonists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660516>Molecular cloning and characterization of C tetrahydrofolate (C-THF) synthase in Bombyx mori, silkworm.</a></h2><p>Folate metabolism pathway is mainly associated with syntheses of nucleic acids and proteins as well as DNA methylation and repair. Cytoplasmic C tetrahydrofolate (C-THF) synthase is a central enzyme in folate metabolism and plays an important role in C-THF conversion. The full-length sequence of silkworm (Bombyx mori) cytoplasmic C-THF synthase (BmC-THF synthase) gene including an open reading frame (ORF) of 932 amino acid residues was cloned. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BmC-THF synthase shares 84% and 81% identity with C-THF synthase of Papilio Xuthus and Danaus plexippus, respectively. Conserved sequence analysis showed that the 330 to 710 amino acid residues of BmC-THF synthase were highly conserved among various organisms. Recombinant BmC-THF synthase protein with a molecular weight of about 105.5 kDa was expressed in E. coli cells and identified using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. The expression of BmC-THF synthase gene in eight silkworm tissues revealed that BmC-THF synthase gene is widely expressed in various tissues of silkworm and highly expressed in the fat body. The expression characteristics of BmC-THF synthase gene in response to oxidative stress were conducted under  and high temperature (30 °C) exposure. The results showed that the transcriptional level of BmC-THF synthase gene was upregulated by 3.435-fold and 6.845-fold after  and high temperature (30 °C) exposure, respectively, indicating that BmC-THF synthase gene may play a significant role in response of silkworm to oxidative stresses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The expression of the ace1 gene is significantly higher than that of the ace2 gene, and mutations in ace1 are one of the major reasons for pesticide resistance in insects. In order to investigate the effects of the mutations in ace1's characteristic sites on pesticide resistance, we generated mutations for three amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis, which were Ala(GCG)303Ser(TCG), Gly(GGA)329Ala(GCA) and Leu (TCT)554Ser(TTC). The Baculovirus expression system was used for the eukaryotic expression of the wild type ace1 (wace1) and the mutant ace1 (mace1). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were used to detect the targeting proteins with expected sizeof about 76 kDa. The expression products were purified for the determination of AChE activity and the inhibitory effects of physostigmine and . We observed no significant differences in the overall activity of the wild type and mutant AChEs. However, with 10 min of physostigmine (10 μM) inhibition, the remaining activity of the wild type AChE was significantly lower than that of the mutant AChE. Ten min inhibition with 33.4 μM  also resulted in significantly lower remaining activity of the wild type AChE than that of the mutant AChE. These results indicated that mutations for the three amino acids reduced the sensitivity of AChE to physostigmine and , which laid the foundation for future in vivo studies on AChE's roles in pesticide resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27220913>Sublethal dose of  and Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus interact to elevate silkworm mortality.</a></h2><p>Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is an economically important insect. It is relatively less resistant to certain chemicals and environment exposures such as pesticides and pathogens. After pesticide exposures, the silkworms are more susceptible to microbial infections. The mechanism underlying the susceptibility might be related to immune response and oxidative stress.A sublethal dose of  combined with Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) elevated the silkworm mortality at 96 h. We found a higher content of H O and increased levels of genes related to oxidative stress and immune response after treatment with a sublethal dose of  for 24 h or 48 h. However, such response decreased with longer pesticide treatment. Mortality increased by 44% when B. mori was exposed to combined treatment with BmNPV and  rather than BmNPV alone. The level of examined immune-related and oxidative-stress-related genes significantly decreased in the combined treatment group compared with the BmNPV group. Our results indicated that, with long-term exposure to pesticides such as OPs, even at sublethal dose, the oxidative stress response and immune responses in silkworm were inhibited, which may lead to further immune impairment and accumulation of oxidative stress, resulting in susceptibility to the virus and harm to the silkworm.Our study provided insights for understanding the susceptibility to pathogen after pesticide exposures, which may promote the development of better pesticide controls to avoid significant economic losses. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017875>Effects of mutations on the structure and function of silkworm type 1 acetylcholinesterase.</a></h2><p>AChE is the target of organophosphate (OP) and carbamate (CB) pesticides, and mutations in the gene can significantly reduce insects' sensitivity to these pesticides. Bombyx mori is highly sensitive to pesticides. To investigate the effects of mutations on AChE1 structure and function, we used a prokaryotic system to express B.mori wild type AChE1 (wAChE1) and mutant AChE1 (mAChE1) in this study. Active AChE1 proteins were obtained after refolding and purification, and wAChE1 and mAChE1 had similar activities. After incubation with 10(-6)M physostigmine and 10(-3)mg/mL , the remaining enzyme activity of mAChE1 was 4.42% and 8.86% higher than that of wAChE1's, respectively. Three-dimensional analysis of mutation AChE1 (mAChE1) revealed that the Ser and Ala side chains extended toward the central part of S285 with distances of just 2.80Å and 3.68Å, respectively, which changed the spatial structure of the active center and reduced its sensitivity to pesticides. These results indicated that the mutations altered the 3D structure of AChE1, which may affect the binding of physostigmine and  to the serine residue at the active center, leading to reduced sensitivity. Our study helps understand the relationship between AChE1 mutations and pesticide resistance and provides a new direction for the cultivation of new pesticide-resistant varieties of B.mori.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Screening of OP was carried out by molecular docking with hAChE using Glide docking module of Schrodinger suite as the structural information of hAChE and OP together as co-crystal structure is rarely available. The docking was done at three different precision levels, high throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision and extra precision. The ranking was done using over all binding  i.e. dock score and molecular modelling generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA). Investigation reported Tryptophan (Trp86) residue involved in most interactions by forming a π-cation interaction apart from Ser203 on anionic subsite of hAChE. The top rank ligand was  ethyl phosphonate (PEP) interacting with Trp86, Gly121 and Ser203. However contact with Gly121 was lost during simulation and Asp74 appeared and sustained. Molecular dynamic simulation (GROMACS 4.5.5) of hAChE-PEP complex for 4 × 10 pico-second with SPC16 water system at 310 K temperature explained the evident role of Trp86 in stabilizing the ligand at P-site of the enzyme.

The susceptibility of S. litura larvae reared on tobacco, Chinese cabbage, cowpea and sweet potato to , chlorfenapyr, methomyl, fenvalerate and emamectin benzoate under laboratory conditions was determined.Spodoptera litura larvae reared on tobacco were most tolerant to all insecticides, whereas those that fed on sweet potato were most susceptible. When larvae were reared on each host plant for three generations, the susceptibilities to  of larvae that fed on Chinese cabbage and cowpea were similar, whereas the susceptibility of larvae that fed on sweet potato decreased by the third generation, and on tobacco the susceptibility decreased in each consecutive generation. When nicotine was added to their diet for three consecutive generations, the tolerance of larvae to  increased twofold, and to emamectin benzoate 3.1-fold, but the tolerance of larvae to fenvalerate and chlorfenapyr did not change.

Nanoparticulate (NP) titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) has been shown to attenuate damages in B. mori caused by  exposure. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of midgut injury due to organophosphorus insecticide exposure and its repair by nano-TiO2 pretreatment. In this study,  exposure for 36 h led to significant decreases in body weight and survival and increased oxidative stress and midgut injury. Pretreatment with nano-TiO2 attenuated the -induced midgut injury, increased body weight and survival, and decreased oxidative stress in the midgut of B. mori. Digital gene-expression data showed that exposure to  results in significant changes in the expression of 254 genes in the -exposed midgut and 303 genes in  + nano-TiO2-exposed midgut. Specifically,  exposure led to upregulation of Tpx, α-amylase, trypsin, and glycoside hydrolase genes involved in digestion and absorption.  exposure also led to the downregulation of Cyp450 and Cyp4C1 genes involved in an antioxidant capacity. In contrast, a combination of both  and nano-TiO2 treatment significantly decreased the change in α-amylase, trypsin, and glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are involved in digestion and absorption. These results indicated that Tpx, α-amylase, trypsin, GHs, Cyp450, and Cyp4C1 may be potential biomarkers of midgut toxicity caused by  exposure and the attenuation of these toxic impacts by nano-TiO2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008786>sHsp22.6, an intronless small heat shock protein gene, is involved in stress defence and development in Apis cerana cerana.</a></h2><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play an important role in protecting against stress-induced cell damage and fundamental physiological processes. In this study, we identified an intronless sHsp gene from Apis cerana cerana (AccsHsp22.6). The open reading frame of AccsHsp22.6 was 585 bp and encoded a 194 amino acid protein. Furthermore, a 2064 bp 5'-flanking region was isolated, and potential transcription factor binding sites associated with development and stress response were identified. Quantitative PCR and western blot analyses demonstrated that AccsHsp22.6 was detected at higher levels in the midgut than in other tissues tested, and it is highly expressed during the shift to different development stages. Moreover, AccsHsp22.6 was significantly up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stresses, such as 4 °C, 16 °C, 42 °C, cyhalothrin, pyridaben, H2O2, UV, CdCl2, 20-hydroxyecdysone and Ascosphaera apis treatments. However, AccsHsp22.6 was slightly repressed by other stresses, including 25 °C, , paraquat and HgCl2 treatments. The recombinant AccsHSP22.6 also exhibited significant temperature tolerance, antioxidation and molecular chaperone activity. In addition, we found that knockdown of AccsHsp22.6 by RNA interference remarkably reduced temperature tolerance in A. cerana cerana. Taken together, these results suggest that AccsHsp22.6 plays an essential role in the development stages and defence against cellular stress.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant ATCh hydrolysis by 2-PAM Cl, TMB(4) and LUH(6) was found, with the exceptions of those at pH 7.0, 6.2 and 5.8 at 5 degrees C and those at pH 6.2 and 5.8 at 15 degrees C. The hydrolysis by TMB(4) and LUH(6) was significantly stronger than that by 2-PAM Cl. The hydrolysis increased with increasing pH, incubation temperature and three oxime or ATCh concentration. Significant hydrolysis of ATCh by the three oximes could be found when the terminal concentration of oxime was higher than 0.01 mM at pH 7.0 and 7.4 at 30 and 37 degrees C. However, no hydrolysis of natural substrate (acetylcholine iodide) by the three oximes was found when very high terminal concentrations of oximes were used. In addition, the three oximes displayed an extraordinary efficiency in the reactivation of -inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from fish (Carassius auratus) or rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus domestic) brain in vitro. Parallel to the level of ATCh hydrolysis by the oximes, TMB(4) and LUH(6) displayed significantly higher reactivation efficiency than 2-PAM Cl to -inhibited AChE.

However the  of proteins and carbohydrates in -exposed B. mori can be improved by Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). In this study, we explored whether TiO2 NPs treatment can reduce the -induced brain damage of the 5th larval instar of B. mori. We observed that TiO2 NPs pretreatments significantly reduced the mortality of -exposed larva and relieved severe brain damage and oxidative stress under  exposure in the brain. The treatments also relieved the -induced increases in the contents of acetylcholine (Ach), glutamate (Glu) and nitric oxide (NO) and the -induced decreases in the contents of norepinephrine (NE), Dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and reduced the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na+/K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase activities and the activation of total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS) in the brain. Furthermore, digital gene expression profile (DGE) analysis and real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that TiO2 NPs pretreatment inhibited the up-regulated expression of ace1, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3, Bm109 and down-regulated expression of BmIap caused by ; these genes are involved in nerve conduction, oxidative stress and apoptosis.

These farms are monitored to be free from sarcoptic mange, swine enzootic pneumoniae, swine dysentery and progressive atrophic rhinitis. The local veterinarians were instructed to eradicate sarcoptic mange from the herds by 2 ivermectin injections 14 days apart or 3 treatments with  pour-on 6 days apart before the farms were able to join the health class. The study consisted of a questionnaire administered to the farmers, farm visits and follow-ups associated with the regular control of the health class. A questionnaire was sent to all of the 379 accepted farrowing farms. Altogether 323 farmers had initiated an eradication programme at least 7 months before the questionnaire was distributed and 96% of them believed that the mange eradication programme had been successful. In most of the successful herds (90%), the local veterinarian had treated the animals by the recommended methods, and the majority of the farmers (88%) had cleaned and sprayed the pens with insecticides on the days of treatment. Three out of the 7 unsuccessful farms had employed methods other than those recommended. Twenty-five herds were randomly selected for an intensified control. The rubbing index was < or = 0.1 in all herds visited, indicating freedom from mange. Sows or gilts, 15-20 animals per farm, were skin scraped and no Sarcoptes scabiei was found. The same animals were blood sampled and serum antibodies to S. scabiei were measured by an indirect ELISA. All except 1 farm had low optical density (OD) values in most of the samples. The owner of that farm had become uncertain about the mange status of the herd and had recently retreated all animals with acaricides. The number of complaints about mange in the finishing units buying health class feeder pigs was low. The study demonstrates that it is possible to run an eradication programme against sarcoptic mange, in which a large number of farmers together with their veterinarians participate. It is possible to eradicate mange not only at the herd but also at the population level. The ELISA test employed proved to be a possible tool to monitor the efficacy of mange-eradication programmes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17974266>[Susceptibility and related physiological and biochemical mechanisms of Carposina niponensis Walsingham larvae on six insecticides before and after overwintering].</a></h2><p>The study with impregnating method showed that after overwintering, the susceptibility of Carposina niponensis larvae on triazophos, , chlorpyrifos, malathion, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin was 34.50, 16.71, 3.89, 3.28, 5.90 and 2.73 times as much as that before overwintering, the total protein, glycogen and fat contents and carboxylesterase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase activities in C. niponensis larvae were decreased by 17.10%, 41.76% and 30.08%, 62.36%, 53.47%, 76.19%, 80.60%, 18.77%, 14.16% and 64.02%, respectively, and the activity of acetylcholinesterase, the target enzyme of many insecticides, was 1.41 times as much as that before overwintering.

Studies have found that these enzymes show peroxidase-like activity and may thus be involved in protecting organisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, Apis cerana cerana was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P450 family genes in resisting ROS damage. A cytochrome P450 gene was isolated, AccCYP336A1. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491bp in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 °C), heat (42 °C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and ) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress.

Here, we present the first whole-transcriptome analysis of differential expression genes in insecticide-resistant and susceptible G. pyloalis. Clustering and enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed several biological  and enriched Gene Ontology terms were related to detoxification or insecticide resistance. Genes involved in insecticide  processes, including cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferases and carboxylesterase, were identified in the larval midgut of G. pyloalis.

There were many documented examples of this enzyme in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. However, knowledge about APH in insects still remains unknown. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a putative silkworm Bombyx mori APH (BmAPH) gene. The BmAPH gene encodes a protein of 710 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 78.5kDa. The putative BmAPH and mammal APHs share about 36% amino acid sequence identity, yet key catalytic residues are conserved (Ser566, Asp654, and His686). Expression and purification of the recombinant BmAPH in Escherichia coli showed that it has acylpeptide hydrolase activity toward the traditional substrate, Ac-Ala-pNA. Furthermore, organophosphorus (OP) insecticides, chlorpyrifos, , and malathion, significantly inhibited the activity of the APH both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, BmAPH was expressed in all tested tissues and developmental stages of the silkworm. Finally, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that BmAPH protein was localized in the basement membranes. These results suggested that BmAPH may be involved in enhancing silkworm tolerance to the OP insecticides.

At the same time, the expression levels of detoxification enzyme-related genes were also determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Compare to the control levels, the activity of P450 in the midgut and fatbody was increased to 1.72 and 6.72 folds; the activity of GST was no change in midgut, and in fatbody increased to 1.11 folds; the activity of carboxylesterase in the midgut was decreased to 0.69 folds, and in fatbody increased to 1.13 folds. Correspondingly, the expression levels of detoxifying enzyme genes CYP6ae22, CYP9a21, GSTo1 and Bmcce were increased to 15.99, 3.32, 1.86 and 2.30 folds in the midgut and to 3.58, 1.84, 2.14 and 4.21 folds in the fatbody after  treatment. These results demonstrated the important roles of detoxification enzymes in  . In addition, the detected activities of such enzymes were generally lower than those in cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera), which may contribute to the high susceptibility of B. mori to insecticides. Our findings laid the foundation for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms of organophosphorus pesticide  in B. mori.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The current study mainly assessed the effect of the pesticide  on oxidative stress by certain biomarkers in the fat body and midgut of the silkworm, Bombyx mori (L.), after exposure to 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of  for 2 h. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, activity of glutathione transferase (GST), and expression of GST at transcriptional level were assayed. LC50 value of  was 2.5 mg/liter at 2-h exposure for the day 3 of the fifth-instar larvae. After exposure of , MDA content in the fat body significantly increased at 4-20 h posttreatment (p.t.),the highest increase was approximately 4.11-fold from 0.451 +/- 0.053 to 1.854 +/- 0.113 nmol/mg protein compared with corresponding control. In the midgut, significant increase in the MDA content (from 1.40- to 3.16-fold) was observed at 8-42 h p.t. The activity of GSTs increased to 1.48-2.00-fold at 24-42 h p.t. and 1.33-1.48-fold at 20-24 h p.t. in the fat body and midgut, respectively. The peroxidase activity of GSTs also was induced, which increased to 1.46-2.06-fold and 1.31-1.50-fold in the fat body and midgut, respectively. BmGSTe8 showed a late up-regulation of transcripts at 24-42 h after exposure to , which might contribute to the improved  tolerance of silkworm larvae. These results indicated that  could trigger oxidative stress and that MDA content and GST activity might be used as biomarkers of OP insecticide exposure. In addition, activity of GSTs were more inducible in the fat body than in midgut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30090575>Changes in glucose  and mRNA expression of IRS-2 in rats exposed to  and the protective effects of vitamin E.</a></h2><p>Research has shown that organophosphorus pesticides impair glucose homeostasis and cause insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

After exposure to , the animals showed glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia during glucose tolerance tests, and insulin tolerance tests demonstrated an impaired glucose-lowering effect of insulin.  increases the fasting glucose, insulin and cholesterol levels, as well as the liver hexokinase activity (HK) significantly while decreasing the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and glycogen content in the liver and skeletal muscles observably. Furthermore, we observed an increase of insulin resistance biomarkers and a decrease of insulin sensitivity indices. The insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 mRNA expressions of liver and skeletal muscles were down-regulated by , while the expression of IRS-1 showed no difference. There were no differences in triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, and fasting glucose treated with . On the basis of biochemical and molecular findings,  has been determined to impair glucose homeostasis through insulin resistance and insulin signaling pathway disruptions resulting in a reduced function of insulin in hepatocytes and muscles. VE supplementation reduced the fasting glucose, increased the glycogen content and HDL-cholesterol, but did not reduce the insulin resistance indices, when -treated rats were compared to VE supplemented rats. Overall, this study shows that vitamin E modifies the  toxicity in rats only to a moderate degree.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28134300>Clone and functional analysis of Seryl-tRNA synthetase and Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from silkworm, Bombyx mori.</a></h2><p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the key enzymes for protein synthesis. Glycine, alanine, serine and tyrosine are the major amino acids composing fibroin of silkworm. Among them, the genes of alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) and glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) have been cloned. In this study, the seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) genes from silkworm were cloned. Their full length are 1709 bp and 1868 bp and contain open reading frame (ORF) of 1485 bp and 1575 bp, respectively. RT-PCR examination showed that the transcription levels of SerRS, TyrRS, AlaRS and GlyRS are significantly higher in silk gland than in other tissues. In addition, their transcription levels are much higher in middle and posterior silk gland than in anterior silk gland. Moreover, treatment of silkworms with , an inhibitor of silk protein synthesis, but not TiO NP, an enhancer of silk protein synthesis, significantly reduced the transcription levels of aaRS and content of free amino acids in posterior silk gland, therefore affecting silk protein synthesis, which may be the mechanism of -silking disorders. Furthermore, low concentration of TiO NPs showed no effect on the transcription of aaRS and content of free amino acids, suggesting that TiO NPs promotes silk protein synthesis possibly by increasing the activity of fibroin synthase in silkworm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12411190>[Reactivation and aging of acetylcholinesterase in human brain inhibited by  and  oxon in vitro].</a></h2><p>Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human brain caused by  or  oxon, their reactivation with oxime and aging of phosphorylated AChE were studied and compared in vitro.Micro-colorispectrophotometric assay was used to determine the activity of AChE.The pI(50) of inhibition of AChE in human brain by  and  oxon were 5.39 and 5.77, respectively, whereas the pI(90) were 4.60 and 5.00, respectively.

Abuse of organophosphorus pesticides in recent years often leads to poisoning of silkworms, which significantly affects sericulture development by reducing silk production. Previous studies have shown that TiO2 NPs can effectively mitigate the damages caused by organophosphorus pesticides in silk glands and nerve tissues. The fat body is an important  detoxification organ of silkworms, but it is unknown whether TiO2 NPs affect pesticide  in fat body. In this study, we characterized the transcription of antioxidant genes and enzyme activity in fat body after TiO2 NPs and  treatments using transcriptome sequencing, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity assay. Transcriptome sequencing detected 10 720, 10 641, 10 403, and 10 489 genes for control group, TiO2 NPs group,  group, and TiO2 NPs+ group, respectively. The TiO2 NPs+ group had 705 genes with significantly differential expression (FDR<0.001), among which the antioxidant genes thioredoxin reductase 1 and glutathione S-transferase omega 3 were significantly upregulated. In  group, the expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase delta (GSTd), and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) were increased by 1.365 -fold, 1.335 -fold, 1.642 -fold, and 1.765 -fold, respectively. The level changes of SOD, CAT, GSTd, and TPx were validated by real time PCR. The contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were increased by 1.598 -fold, 1.946 -fold, and 1.506 -fold, respectively, indicating that TiO2 NPs treatment can relieve -induced oxidative stress. To clarify the mechanism of TiO2 NPs's effect, the transcription levels of P450 gene family were measured for the TiO2 NPs+ group; the expression levels of CYP4M5, CYP6AB4, CYP6A8, and CYP9G3 were elevated by 2.784 -fold, 3.047 -fold, 2.254 -fold, and 4.253 -fold, respectively, suggesting that high expression of P450 family genes can enhance the  of  in the fat body. The results of this study indicated that TiO2 NPs treatment promoted the transcriptional expression of the P450 family genes to improve the fat body's ability to metabolize  and reduce -induced oxidative stress. This may be the main mechanism of TiO2 NPs' mitigation of -induced damages in the fat body.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The FR was significantly resistant to malathion (57.5-fold), but marginally resistant to chlorpyrifos (5.4) and  (2.9). The malathion resistance of the FR was significantly diminished by TPP (synergism ratio: 16.2) and DEM (3.3), but was unchanged by PBO. In contrast, none of these synergists significantly affected the toxicity of malathion in the LS. Biochemical studies indicated that EST and GST activities in the FR were 2.1- to 3.2-fold and 1.2- to 2.0-fold, respectively, higher than those in the LS, but there was no significant difference in P450 activity between the LS and FR. Furthermore, AChE from the FR showed 4.0-fold higher activity but was 3.2-, 2.2-, and 1.1-fold less sensitive to inhibition by malaoxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and , respectively, than that from the LS. All these results clearly indicated that the observed malathion resistance in the FR was conferred by multiple mechanisms, including increased detoxification by ESTs and GSTs, and increased activity and reduced sensitivity of AChE to OP inhibition.Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521913>Over-expression of multiple cytochrome P450 genes in fenvalerate-resistant field strains of Helicoverpa armigera from north of China.</a></h2><p>Pyrethroid resistance was one of the main reasons for control failure of cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) in China. The promotion of Bt crops decreased the application of chemical insecticides in controlling H.armigera. However, the cotton bollworm still kept high levels of resistance to fenvalerate. In this study, the resistance levels of 8 field-collected strains of H. armigera from north of China to 4 insecticides, as well as the expression levels of related P450 genes were investigated. The results of bioassay indicated that the resistance levels to fenvalerate in the field strains varied from 5.4- to 114.7-fold, while the resistance levels to lambda-cyhalothrin,  and methomyl were low, which were ranged from 1.5- to 5.2-, 0.2- to 1.6-, and 2.9- to 8.3- fold, respectively, compared to a susceptible strain. Synergistic experiment showed that PBO was the most effective synergist in increasing the sensitivity of H. armigera to fenvalerate, suggesting that P450 enzymes were involved in the pyrethroid resistance in the field strains. The results of quantitative RT-PCR indicated that eight P450 genes (CYP332A1, CYP4L11, CYP4L5, CYP4M6, CYP4M7, CYP6B7, CYP9A12, CYP9A14) were all significantly overexpressed in Hejian1 and Xiajin1 strains of H. armigera collected in 2013, and CYP4L5 was significantly overexpressed in all the 6 field strains collected in 2014. CYP332A1, CYP6B7 and CYP9A12 had very high overexpression levels in all the field strains, indicating their important roles in fenvalerate resistance. The results suggested that multiple P450 genes were involved in the high-level fenvalerate-resistance in different field strains of H. armigera collected from north of China.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Beyond these well-known mechanisms, symbiotic bacteria may confer insecticide resistance to host crickets. The current study was designed to screen all possible culturable bacterial groups found living in and on the bodies of Teleogryllus occipitalis crickets. We recovered 263 visible bacterial colonies and cultured them individually. After identifying the colonies based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis, we shortlisted 55 bacterial strains belonging to 28 genera. Of these 55 bacterial strains, 18 degraded at least 50% of the original amount of 400 mg/L chlorpyrifos (CP) after 24 hr of coculture. Six of these strains degraded more than 70% of the original amount of 400 mg/L CP. Three strains had antagonistic effects on Bacillus thuringiensis growth. Additionally, the ability of the isolates to degrade glyphosate, , and esfenvalerate was assessed. We also detected extracellular hydrolase enzyme activities in these isolates. We propose that epiphytic bacterial strains play multiple roles in cricket biology, one of which contributes to chemical and biological pesticide resistance.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24242160>Silencing of an aphid carboxylesterase gene by use of plant-mediated RNAi impairs Sitobion avenae tolerance of  insecticides.</a></h2><p>RNA interference (RNAi) describes the ability of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to inhibit homologous gene expression at the RNA level. Its specificity is sequence-based and depends on the sequence of one strand of the dsRNA corresponding to part or all of a specific gene transcript. In this study we adopted plant-mediated RNAi technology that targets Sitobion avenae (S. avenae) to enable gene silencing in the aphid and to minimize handling of the insects during experiments. S. avenae was selected for this study because it causes serious economic losses to wheat throughout the world. The carboxylesterase (CbE E4) gene in S. avenae was homologously cloned, which increased synthesis of a protein known to be critical to the resistance (tolerance) this species has developed to a wide range of pesticides. A plant RNAi vector was constructed, and transgenic Triticum aestivum (dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 lines) expressing CbE E4 dsRNA were developed. S. avenae were fed on dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 lines stably producing the CbE E4 dsRNA. CbE E4 gene expression in S. avenae was reduced by up to 30-60%. The number of aphids raised on dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 was lower than the number raised on non-transgenic plants. A solution of CbE E4 enzyme from S. avenae fed on dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 plants hydrolyzed only up to 20-30%  solution within 40 min whereas a solution of the enzyme from CbE E4 fed on control plants hydrolyzed 60% of  solution within 40 min.

In this work, a novel 1-Cys thioredoxin peroxidase gene was isolated from Apis cerana cerana and was named AccTpx5. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccTpx5 is 663bp in length and encodes a 220-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 24,921kDa and 5.45, respectively. Promoter sequence analysis of AccTpx5 revealed the presence of putative transcription factor binding sites related to early development and stress responses. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis indicated that AccTpx5 was primarily present in some developmental stages, with the highest expression levels in the first-instar larvae. The expression level of AccTpx5 was up-regulated under various abiotic stresses, including 4°C, 42°C, HgCl2, H2O2,  and acaricide treatments. Conversely, it was down-regulated by UV and pyriproxyfen treatments. Moreover, H2O2 concentration dramatically increased under a variety of stressful conditions. Finally, the purified recombinant AccTpx5 protein protected the supercoiled form of plasmid DNA from damage in the thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. These results suggest that AccTpx5 most likely plays an essential role in antioxidant defence.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Each year, O,O-diethyl O-(alpha-cyanobenzylideneamino) phosphorothioate () pesticide poisoning in China results in huge economic losses in sericulture. Silkworm fat body is the main organ for nutrient storage,  supply, intermediary metabolism, and detoxification. Microarray analysis of silkworm Cytochrome P450 detoxification enzyme genes revealed that all tested P450 4 (CYP4) family genes are expressed in the fat body. Quantitative Real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of CYP4 family genes in silkworm fat body 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after  exposure. The expression levels of silkworm molting hormone synthesis-related genes started to change 24 h after  exposure, with those of CYP302A1, CYP306A1, and CYP314A1 being elevated by 1.38-, 1.33-, and 2.10-fold, respectively. The CYP18A1 gene that participates in steroid hormone inactivation and the CYP15C1 gene that participates in the epoxidation during the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH) from methyl farnesoate (MF) were increased by 3.85- and 7.82-fold, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these endogenous hormone metabolism-related genes belong to CYP mito clan and clan 2, and that  exposure may affect silkworm development and metamorphosis. The CYP4, CYP6, and CYP9 families all showed some degrees of increases in gene expression; among them, CYP49A1, CYP4L6, CYP6AB4, CYP9G3, CYP9A19, and CYP9A22's transcription levels were significantly upregulated to 12.77-, 2.64-, 2.42-, 4.06-, 3.32-, and 2.98-fold, respectively, of the control levels. In the fat body, CYP49A1, CYP6AB4, CYP9A19, and CYP9A22 were constantly expressed at high levels after 24, 48, and 72 h of  treatments; according to phylogenetic analysis, these genes belong to detoxification-related clan 3 and clan 4 CYP families.

In this study, we found that the activity and expression of nutrition -related enzymes were dysregulated in midgut by  exposure. DGE analysis revealed that 40 nutrition -related genes were differentially expressed. qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression levels of insulin/insulin growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway genes Akt, PI3K, PI3K60, PI3K110, IRS and PDK were reduced, whereas PTEN's expression was significantly increased in the midgut at 24 h after  treatment. However, the transcription levels of Akt, PI3K60, PI3K110, IRS, InR and PDK were elevated and reached the peaks at 48 h, which were 1.48-, 1.35-, 1.21-, 2.24-, 2.89-, and 1.44-fold of those of the control, respectively. At 72 h, the transcription of these genes was reduced. Akt phosphorylation level was increasing along with the growth of silkworms in the control group.

Because OPs have inhibitory effects on the activity of α-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) in plants, in this work we evaluated the possibility of detecting OPs in vegetables with ANAE extracted from commercial flour. The limits of detection (LODs) obtained for methamidophos, dichlorvos, , dimethoate, and malathion in lettuce samples with crude ANAE were 0.17, 0.11, 0.11, 0.96, and 1.70 mg/kg, respectively. Based on the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for OPs in food stipulated by Chinese laws which are 0.05, 0.20, 0.05, 1.00, and 8.00 mg/kg for methamidophos, dichlorvos, , dimethoate, and malathion, respectively, the esterase inhibition method with crude ANAE had sufficient sensitivity to detect the residues of dichlorvos, dimethoate, and malathion in lettuce, but it could not be used to guarantee the safety of the same samples if methamidophos or  residue was present. The sensitivity of the method was improved by the use of esterase purified by ammonium sulfate salting-out.

In a previous study by our group, protein expression of E. cloacae under  stress was measured by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance was used to detect differences in E. cloacae metabonomics when under  stress. We determined that there are 29 types of metabolites that differ between  stress and normal culture conditions. Among these, 6 types of metabolites were upregulated in the  stress group, and 23 types of metabolites were inhibited. Though enrichment analysis, seven pathways were identified by different expression levels of metabolites, which were involved in DNA and RNA synthesis, DNA damage repair, antioxidation and functions of the cell membrane and cell wall. The mechanism underlying how  affects E. cloacae was determined by studying the results of both two-dimensional electrophoresis in our prior work and the analysis of E. cloacae metabonomic changes under  stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3245355>[Comparative study of the interaction of acetylcholinesterases of human erythrocytes and the heads of houseflies with phosphorylated alkylchloroformoximes].</a></h2><p>Studies have been made on the interaction of four types of phosphorylated alkylchloroformoximes, i.e. analogues of an insecticide-acaricide valexon, with acetylcholinesterases from human erythrocytes and from the heads of the housefly Musca domestica.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may make a contribution to the decrease of organophosphate residues in crops and/or the degradation in soils, but such effects remain unknown.A greenhouse pot experiment studied the influence of AM fungi and  application on the growth of carrot and green onion, and  concentrations in the two vegetables and their soil media. Treatments included three AM fungal inoculations with Glomus intraradices BEG 141, G. mosseae BEG 167, and a nonmycorrhizal control, and four  application rates (0, 200, 400, 800 mg l(-1), while 400 mg l(-1) rate is the recommended dose in the vegetable production system). Carrot and green onion were grown in a greenhouse for 130 d and 150 d.  solution (100 ml) was poured into each pot around the roots 14d before plant harvest. Results showed that mycorrhizal colonization was higher than 70%, and  application inhibited AM colonization on carrot but not on green onion. Compared with the nonmycorrhizal controls, both shoot and root fresh weights of these two vegetables were significantly increased by AM inoculations irrespective of  application rates.  concentrations in shoots, roots and soils were increased with the increase of  application rate, but significantly decreased by the AM inoculations. Soil phosphatase activity was enhanced by both AM inocula, but not affected by  application rate. In general, G. intraradices BEG 141 had more pronounced effects than G. mosseae BEG 167 on the increase of fresh weight production in both carrot and green onion, and the decrease of  concentrations in plants and soils.Our results indicate a promising potential of AM fungi for enhancing vegetable production and reducing organophosphorus pesticide residues in plant tissues and their growth media, as well as for the phytoremediation of organophosphorus pesticide-contaminated soils.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574008>[Effect of organophosphorous insecticides on Chinese chive insect pests and their degradation by pesticide-degrading bacterium].</a></h2><p>3.00 kg(a. i) x hm(-2) phoxin and 2.63 kg(a. i) x hm(-2) methyl parathion were respectively applied to control the Taeniothrips alliorum on Chinese chive.

However, poisoning of silkworms by organophosphate pesticides causes tremendous loss to the sericulture. The fat body is the major tissue involved in detoxification and produces antimicrobial peptides and regulates hormones. In this study, a microarray system comprising 22,987 oligonucluotide 70-mer probes was employed to examine differentially expressed genes in the fat body of B. mori exposed to  insecticide. The results showed that a total of 774 genes were differentially expressed upon  exposure, including 500 up-regulated genes and 274 down-regulated genes. The expression levels of eight detoxification-related genes were up-regulated upon  exposure, including six cytochrome P450s and two glutathione-S-transferases. It was firstly found that eight antimicrobial peptide genes were down-regulated, which might provide important references for studying the larvae of B. mori become more susceptible to microbial infections after  treatment. In addition, we firstly detected the expression level of metamorphosis-related genes after  exposure, which may lead to impacted reproduction.

GSTs activity towards cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), a substrate of GSH-dependent peroxidase, was significantly increased in the crude homogenate of midguts after long term exposure to the insecticides. An epsilon-class GST gene (BmGSTe2) was identified and showed elevated expression in the midguts of - and fenpropathrin-selected strains. Expression of BmGSTe2 was only detected in the midgut at transcriptional and translational levels. The recombinant BmGSTE2 possessed peroxidase activity and significantly inhibited by fenpropathrin,  and chlorpyrifos in vitro. These results indicated that BmGSTE2 might be one of the enzymes involved in enhancing larval tolerance to the insecticides used. Furthermore, GST activity and expression level of BmGSTe2 might be used as biomarkers of organophosphorus and pyrethroid insecticide exposures.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, the effects of  (an organophosphorus insecticide) and carbaryl (a carbamate insecticide) on antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression were investigated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The results show that  exposure can induce superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and decrease glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity at lower concentrations. The expression levels of sod-3, sod-5, ctl-1, gpx-6, and gpx-8 were up-regulated after treatment with . The mRNA expression levels of sod-5, ctl-1 and gpx-6 were increased approximately 70-, 170- and 130-fold, respectively, in the 0.25mM treatment group compared to the control group. Carbaryl exposure decreased SOD activity and induced CAT and GPx activities. The addition of carbaryl up-regulated the expression of sod-5, ctl-1, ctl-3 and gpx-8. Specifically, ctl-1 expression increased approximately 10-fold, and gpx-8 expression increased <30-fold in the 0.5mM treatment group relative to the control group. The transcript level of sod-5 increased >20-fold, and ctl-3 increased approximately 10-fold in the 1mM treatment group. The functions of the antioxidant enzymes during oxidative stress caused by the two insecticides were investigated using deletion mutants. The LC values  for the of sod-3 (tm760), sod-5 (tm1146), ctl-1 (ok1242), ctl-3 (ok2042) and gpx-8 (tm2108) mutant strains were lower than those observed for the N2 strain. The LC values of carbaryl for the ctl-1 (ok1242), ctl-3 (ok2042) and gpx-6 (tm2535) deletion mutant strains decreased in comparison to the N2 strain. The results suggest that these two insecticides caused oxidative stress and changed altered the antioxidant enzyme activities and their gene expressions in C. elegans.
