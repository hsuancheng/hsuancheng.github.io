In the present study, we investigated the role of Lyn, a member of the Src family  kinases, in modulating inflammatory responses in a murine model of . We examined lung inflammatory signaling in Lyn knockout (Lyn(-/-)) mice and wild-type littermates (Lyn(+/+)) during . Our data indicate that Lyn deletion aggravates endotoxin-induced pulmonary inflammation and proinflammatory signaling. We found increased activation of proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB in the lung tissues of Lyn(-/-) mice after endotoxin challenge. Furthermore, during , the lung tissues of Lyn(-/-) mice showed increased inflammasome activation indicated by augmented caspase-1 and IL-1β cleavage and activation. The aggravated lung inflammatory signaling in Lyn(-/-) mice was associated with increased production of proinflammatory mediators and elevated matrix metallopeptidase 9 and reduced VE-cadherin levels. Our results suggest that Lyn kinase modulates inhibitory signaling to suppress endotoxin-induced lung inflammation.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682019>Whole body periodic acceleration improves survival and microvascular leak in a murine endotoxin model.</a></h1><p>Sepsis is a life threatening condition which produces multi-organ dysfunction with profound circulatory and cellular derangements. Administration of E.Coli endotoxin (LPS) produces systemic inflammatory effects of sepsis including disruption of endothelial barrier, and if severe enough death. Whole body periodic acceleration (pGz) is the headward-footward motion of the body. pGz has been shown to induce pulsatile shear stress to the endothelium, thereby releasing vascular and cardio protective mediators. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not pGz performed as a pre-treatment or post-treatment strategy improves survival in a lethal murine endotoxin model.This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study in mice. pGz was performed in mice as pre-treatment (pGz-LPS, 3 days prior to LPS), post-treatment (LPS- pGz, 30 min after LPS) strategies or Control (LPS-CONT), in a lethal murine model of .  was induced with intraperitoneal injection of E.Coli LPS (40mg/kg). In a separate group of mice, a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) was provided in their drinking water and pGz-LPS and LPS-pGz performed to determine the effect of nitric oxide (NO) inhibition on survival. In another subset of mice, micro vascular leakage was determined. Behavioral scoring around the clock was performed in all mice at 30 min intervals after LPS administration, until 48 hrs. survival or death. LPS induced 100% mortality in LPS-CONT animals by 30 hrs. In contrast, survival to 48 hrs. occurred in 60% of pGz-LPS and 80% of LPS-pGz. L-NAME abolished the survival effects of pGz. Microvascular leakage was markedly reduced in both pre and post pGz treated animals and was associated with increased  kinase endothelial-enriched tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 (TIE2) receptor and its phosphorylation (p-TIE2). In a murine model of lethal , pGz performed as a pre or post treatment strategy significantly improved survival, and markedly reduced microvascular leakage. The effect was modulated, in part, by NO since a non-selective inhibitor of NO abolished the pGz survival effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588712>Lipopolysaccharide-based  produce toxicity in peripheral organs and microglia migration in a dose-dependent manner in rat substantia nigra.</a></h1><p>The peripheral inflammatory stimulus could induce cell damage in peripheral organs and activate microglial cells in the brain. One such stimulus was given to adult male Wistar rats by injecting different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50, 300, 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg i.p.). To verify the systemic effect of the LPS administration, the serum content of C-reactive protein (CRP), the variation of body weight and cellular changes in the spleen, liver and kidney were determined. Motor impairment was evaluated by rotarod and open field tests. Microglia activation and dopaminergic degeneration was confirmed by immunolabelling for CD11b/c (microglia) and  hydroxylase (TH), respectively. The cell counting was performed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), microglial activation was explored in SNpc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), substantia nigra pars compacta dorsal (SNcd) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For the statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05) was used. On day 7 post intraperitoneal administration of LPS, cellular atrophy was detected in the liver, kidney and spleen at 5 mg/kg, without significant changes in CRP levels. Body weight loss and motor impairment was present only on day 1 post LPS administration. The dosage of 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg of LPS caused the loss of dopaminergic neurons (40%) in SNpc and microglia migration in a dose-dependent manner in SNcd, SNpc and SNpr.

Previous studies have implied the crucial role of central inflammation and neuropeptides in the energy balance and muscle metabolism. Insulin has been confirmed to attenuate muscle degradation and inhibit inflammation. We tested the hypothesis whether insulin ameliorating muscle wasting was associated with modulating hypothalamic inflammation and neuropeptides.Thirty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were in intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) or saline, followed by subcutaneous injection of insulin (5 IU/kg) or saline. Twenty-four hours after injection, skeletal muscle and hypothalamus tissues were harvested. Muscle wasting was measured by the mRNA expression of two E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx), as well as 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and  release. Hypothalamic inflammatory markers and neuropeptides expression were also measured in four groups.LPS injection led to significant increase in hypothalamic inflammation as well as muscle wasting. Also, increased hypothalamic neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) and neuropeptides Y (NPY) and decreased agouti-related protein (AgRP) were observed. Insulin treatment ameliorated -induced muscle wasting and hypothalamic inflammation, and attenuated the alteration of neuropeptides, POMC, CART and AgRP.Hypothalamic inflammation and neuropeptides are involved in the -induced muscle wasting. Insulin treatment can reduce muscle wasting, which is associated with reduced hypothalamic inflammation and alteration of hypothalamic neuropeptides.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207668>Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR ameliorates sepsis-induced AKI.</a></h1><p>Despite recent studies have demonstrated that the EGF receptor (EGFR) activation provided a renoprotective role during ischemic and folic acid-induced AKI, the role and regulation mechanism of EGFR in septic AKI remains unclear. Here, gefitinib, a highly selective EGFR inhibitor, abrogated LPS-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, and STAT3 as well as expression of COX, eNOS, and proinflammatory cytokines in HK-2 cells. In addition, c-Src is an upstream of EGFR signaling pathway and mediates LPS-induced EGFR transactivation. , either gefitinib or genetic approaches (Wave-2 mutant mice, which have reduced EGFR  kinase activity) protected against LPS or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced AKI respectively. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of gefitinib or genetic approaches were accompanied by the dephosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, and STAT3, the down regulation of expression of COX, eNOS, macrophage infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines production and the renal cell apoptosis. Furthermore, mRNA array results indicated that gene families involved in cell death, inflammation, proliferation and signal transduction were down regulated in Wave-2 (Wa-2) mice. Take together, these data suggest that EGFR may mediate renal injury by promoting production of inflammatory factors and cell apoptosis.

Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) is a context-dependent regulator of vascular leakage that signals via both endothelial TEK receptor  kinase (TIE2) and integrins. Here, we show that antibodies against β1-integrin decrease LPS-induced vascular leakage in murine , as either a preventative or an intervention therapy. β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo improved the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions and protected mice from -associated cardiac failure, without affecting endothelial inflammation, serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, or TIE receptor signaling. Moreover, conditional deletion of a single allele of endothelial β1-integrin protected mice from LPS-induced vascular leakage. In endothelial monolayers, the inflammatory agents thrombin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IL-1β decreased junctional vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and induced actin stress fibers via β1- and α5-integrins and ANGPT2. Additionally, β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies prevented inflammation-induced endothelial cell contractility and monolayer permeability. Mechanistically, the inflammatory agents stimulated ANGPT2-dependent translocation of α5β1-integrin into tensin-1-positive fibrillar adhesions, which destabilized the endothelial monolayer. Thus, β1-integrin promotes endothelial barrier disruption during inflammation, and targeting β1-integrin signaling could serve as a novel means of blocking pathological vascular leak.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Interestingly, the protein  phosphatases (PTP) SHP-1, has been recognized as a major regulator of inflammation; however their implication in the control of Hep-mediated inflammatory response is still unknown. To study its implication in the regulation of the Hep-mediated inflammatory response during , Cre-Lox mice with a Hep-specific Ptpn6 deletion (Ptpn6  ) were injected with LPS. In contrast to the wild-type mice (Ptpn6  ) that started to die by 24 hrs post-inoculation, the Ptpn6  mice exhibited mortality by 6 hrs. In parallel, higher amounts of metabolic markers, pro-inflammatory mediators and circulating cytokines were detected in Ptpn6  mice. Primary Hep obtained from Ptpn6  , also showed increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) comparatively to its wild type (Ptpn6  ) counterpart. Pharmacological approaches to block TNF-α and NO production protected both the Ptpn6  and the Ptpn6  mice against deadly LPS-mediated . Collectively, these results establish hepatocyte SHP-1 is a critical player regulating systemic inflammation. Our findings further suggest that SHP-1 activation could represent a new therapeutic avenue to better control inflammatory-related pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29285085>Unfractionated heparin protects the protein C system against lipopolysaccharide-induced damage  and .</a></h1><p>Activation of protein C is greatly enhanced by the presence of thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) on the endothelial surface. Impairment of the anticoagulant protein C system occurs during  and contributes to sepsis-associated hypercoagulability. Previous studies have demonstrated that unfractionated heparin (UFH) can attenuate coagulation in endotoxemic mice. However, whether UFH has an effect on the protein C system remains to be elucidated. The current study evaluated the therapeutic effect of UFH on the protein C system in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, and further investigated the effect of UFH on the expression of TM and EPCR  using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The  data indicated that UFH preconditioning attenuated the decline in circulating activated protein C following LPS administration, and also reduced LPS-induced shedding of TM and EPCR. In HUVECs, LPS stimulation led to the downregulation of TM and EPCR expression, and UFH dose-dependently restored the mRNA and protein levels of TM and EPCR. In addition, UFH inhibited the LPS-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 14, proto-oncogene -protein kinase Src and nuclear factor κB signaling in HUVECs. In summary, these results suggest that UFH has a protective effect on the protein C system during sepsis. Thus, UFH may be a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579705>Chronic stress-induced gut dysfunction exacerbates Parkinson's disease phenotype and pathology in a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence provides support for involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. We propose that a pro-inflammatory intestinal milieu, due to intestinal hyper-permeability and/or microbial dysbiosis, initiates or exacerbates PD pathogenesis. One factor that can cause intestinal hyper-permeability and dysbiosis is chronic stress which has been shown to accelerate neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in Parkinsonism rodent models. We hypothesized that stress-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that exacerbates the PD phenotype in the low-dose oral rotenone PD mice model. To test this hypothesis, mice received unpredictable restraint stress (RS) for 12 weeks, and during the last six weeks mice also received a daily administration of low-dose rotenone (10 mg/kg/day) orally. The initial six weeks of RS caused significantly higher urinary cortisol, intestinal hyperpermeability, and decreased abundance of putative "anti-inflammatory" bacteria (Lactobacillus) compared to non-stressed mice. Rotenone alone (i.e., without RS) disrupted the colonic expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1, increased oxidative stress (N-), increased myenteric plexus enteric glial cell GFAP expression and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) protein levels in the colon compared to controls. Restraint stress exacerbated these rotenone-induced changes. Specifically, RS potentiated rotenone-induced effects in the colon including: 1) intestinal hyper-permeability, 2) disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin1), 3) oxidative stress (N-), 4) inflammation in glial cells (GFAP + enteric glia cells), 5) α-syn, 6) increased relative abundance of fecal Akkermansia (mucin-degrading Gram-negative bacteria), and 7) . In addition, RS promoted a number of rotenone-induced effects in the brain including: 1) reduced number of resting microglia and a higher number of dystrophic/phagocytic microglia as well as (FJ-C+) dying cells in the substantia nigra (SN), 2) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reactivity in the SN, and 3) reduced dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) in the striatum compared to control mice. Our findings support a model in which chronic stress-induced, gut-derived, pro-inflammatory milieu exacerbates the PD phenotype via a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate formation and function of the endogenous ligand-receptor complex IL-37-IL-1R8-IL-18Rα. The tripartite complex assembled rapidly on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Silencing of IL-1R8 or IL-18Rα impaired the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-37. Whereas mice with transgenic expression of IL-37 (IL-37tg mice) with intact IL-1R8 were protected from , IL-1R8-deficient IL-37tg mice were not. Proteomic and transcriptomic investigations revealed that IL-37 used IL-1R8 to harness the anti-inflammatory properties of the signaling molecules Mer, PTEN, STAT3 and p62(dok) and to inhibit the kinases Fyn and TAK1 and the transcription factor NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases.

It is unknown if amino acid supplementation reverses these effects during the acute phase of inflammation. The aim was to test whether amino acid supplementation counteracts endotoxin-induced catabolism.Eight young, healthy, lean males were investigated three times in randomized order: (i) normal conditions (Placebo), (ii)  (LPS), and (iii)  with amino acid supplementation (LPS + A). Protein kinetics were determined using phenylalanine, , and urea tracers. Each study day consisted of a four-hour non-insulin stimulated period and a two-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp period. Muscle biopsies were collected once each period.Endotoxin administration created a significant inflammatory response (cytokines, hormones, and vital parameters) without significant differences between LPS and LPS + A. Whole body protein breakdown was elevated during LPS compared with Placebo and LPS + A (p < 0.05). Whole body protein synthesis was higher during LPS + A than both Placebo and LPS (p < 0.003). Furthermore, protein synthesis was higher during LPS than during Placebo (p < 0.02). Net muscle phenylalanine release was markedly decreased during LPS + A (p < 0.004), even though muscle protein synthesis and breakdown rates did not differ significantly between interventions. LPS + A increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation (p < 0.05) and eukaryotic translation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) phosphorylation (p = 0.007) without activating AMPK or affecting insulin signaling through Akt. During insulin stimulation net muscle phenylalanine release and protein degradation were further reduced.Amino acid supplementation in the acute phase of inflammation reduces whole body and muscle protein loss, and this effect is associated with activation of mTOR and downstream signaling to protein synthesis through mTORC1, suggesting a therapeutic role for intravenous amino acids in inflammatory states.The Central Denmark Region Ethics Commitee (1-10-71-410-12) www.clinicaltrials.gov (identification number ).Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

To investigate the participation of PTP1B and SHP-2 in LPS-induced leptin resistance, we injected repeated (6-LPS) intraperitoneal LPS doses (100 μg/kg ip) for comparison with a single (1-LPS) treatment and evaluated the expression of SHP-2, PTP1B, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT3 in the hypothalamus of male Wistar rats. The single LPS treatment increased the expression of p-STAT3 and PTP1B but not SHP-2. The repeated LPS treatment reduced SHP-2, increased PTP1B, and did not change p-STAT3. We observed that the PTP1B expression induced by the endotoxin was highly colocalized with leptin receptor cells in the hypothalamus of LepRb-IRES-Cre-tdTomato reporter mice. The single, but not the repeated, LPS treatment decreased the food intake and body weight. Leptin had no stimulatory effect on the hypophagia, body weight loss, or pSTAT3 expression in 6-LPS rats, indicating leptin unresponsiveness. Notably, the PTP1B inhibitor (3.0 nmol/rat in 5 μl icv) restored the LPS-induced hypophagia in 6-LPS rats and restored the ability of leptin to reduce food intake and body weight as well as to phosphorylate STAT3 in the arcuate, paraventricular, and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. The present data suggest that an increased PTP1B expression in the hypothalamus underlies the development of leptin resistance during repeated exposure to LPS. Our findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms involved in leptin resistance during low-grade inflammation as seen in obesity.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270816>Arctic berry extracts target the gut-liver axis to alleviate metabolic , insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>There is growing evidence that fruit polyphenols exert beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8 weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82.5 ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l × min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1  phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic , insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26620257>The  kinase inhibitor imatinib prevents lung injury and death after intravenous LPS in mice.</a></h1><p>Severe sepsis and septic shock are frequent causes of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and important sources of human mortality. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. LPS exposure induces the production of harmful reactive oxygen species, and the resultant oxidant injury has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both severe sepsis and ARDS. We previously showed that the  kinase inhibitor imatinib increases lung endothelial antioxidant enzymes and protects against pulmonary endothelial antioxidant injury. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that imatinib would protect against lung injury and systemic inflammation caused by intravenous LPS in an intact mouse model of  mimicking early sepsis. We found that intravenous LPS induced a significant increase in the activity of lung xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an enzyme which is a major source of reactive oxygen species and implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Imatinib had no effect of LPS-induced XOR activity. However, pretreatment of mice with imatinib increased lung catalase activity and decreased intravenous LPS-induced lung oxidant injury as measured by γ-H2AX, a marker of oxidant-induced DNA damage, lung apoptosis, and pulmonary edema. Imatinib also attenuated systemic cytokine expression after intravenous LPS exposure. Finally, imatinib completely prevented mortality in an in vivo, intravenous LPS mouse model of  and lung injury. These results support the testing of imatinib as a novel pharmacologic agent in the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS.© 2015 The Authors.

Though the association and subsequent evidences are strong, the mechanisms that connect exposure to intestinal and neurological abnormalities remain unclear. Using an established rodent model of Gulf War Illness, we show that chemical exposure caused significant dysbiosis in the gut that included increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes and Tenericutes, and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes. Several gram negative bacterial genera were enriched in the GWI-model that included Allobaculum sp. Altered microbiome caused significant decrease in tight junction protein Occludin with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2, a signature of a leaky gut. Resultant leaching of gut caused portal  that led to upregulation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in the small intestine and the brain. TLR4 knock out mice and mice that had gut decontamination showed significant decrease in  nitration and inflammatory mediators IL1β and MCP-1 in both the small intestine and frontal cortex. These events signified that gut dysbiosis with simultaneous leaky gut and systemic -induced TLR4 activation contributes to GW chemical-induced neuroinflammation and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28127756>Absence of DCIR1 reduces the mortality rate of endotoxemic hepatitis in mice.</a></h1><p>Dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) is a C-type lectin with an immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motif (ITIM). Mice lacking DCIR1 (Dcir1 mice) show higher susceptibility to chronic arthritis with increasing age, suggesting that DCIR1 is involved in immune modulation via its ITIM. However, the role of DCIR1 in acute immune responses is not clear. In this study, we explored its role in acute experimental hepatitis. Upon injection of d-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide, Dcir1 mice showed decreased mortality rates and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. In early onset hepatitis, serum levels of TNF-α, which primarily cause inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, were significantly lower in Dcir1 mice than in WT mice. In the liver of Dcir1 mice, influx of neutrophils and other leukocytes decreased. Consistently, the levels of neutrophil-chemoattractant chemokine CXCL1/KC, but not CXCL2/MIP-2, were lower in Dcir1 mice than in WT mice. However, chemotaxis of Dcir1 neutrophils to CXCL1/KC appeared normal. Pervanadate treatment induced binding of DCIR1 and Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-2, possibly leading to CXCL1/KC expression. These results suggest that DCIR1 is involved in exacerbation of endotoxemic hepatitis, providing a new therapeutic target for lethal hepatitis.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Previous work mainly focuses on the peripheral molecular mechanism of muscle degradation, however little evidence exists for the role of central nervous system in the process. In the present study, we, for the first time, characterized the relationship between muscle wasting and central neuropeptide changes in a septic model. Thirty-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline. Twelve, 24 and 48 hrs after injection, skeletal muscle and hypothalamus tissues were harvested. Muscle wasting was measured by the mRNA expression of two E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx), as well as 3-methyl-histidine (3-MH) and  release. Hypothalamic neuropeptides and inflammatory marker expressions were also measured in three time points. LPS injection caused an increase expression of MuRF-1 and MAFbx, and a significant higher release of 3-MH and . Hypothalamic neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) presented a dynamic change after LPS injection. Also, hypothalamic inflammatory markers, interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) increased substantially after LPS administration. Importantly, the expressions of POMC, AgRP and CART were well correlated with muscle atrophy gene, MuRF-1 expression. These findings suggest hypothalamic peptides and inflammation may participate in the sepsis-induced muscle wasting, but the exact mechanism needs further study.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The lungs were analysed by histology, NO production in the mouse lungs determined by modified Griess (Sigma-Aldrich) reaction, cytokine levels utilizing commercialkits, and protein abundance by Western blotting.GYY4137, a slowly-releasing H2S donor, improved the histopathological changes in the lungs of endotoxemic mice. Treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, increased anti-oxidant biomarkers such as thetotal antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and theactivities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) but decreased a marker of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) action and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in endotoxemic lung. L-NAME administration also suppressed inflammation in endotoxemic lung, as evidenced by the decreased pulmonary levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the increased level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. GYY4137 treatment reversed endotoxin-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, as evidenced by a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogenperoxide (H2O2) and 3-NT and an increase in the antioxidant biomarker ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione(GSH/GSSG ratio) and T-AOC, CAT and SOD activity. GYY4137 also attenuated endotoxin-induced lung inflammation. Moreover, treatment with GYY4137 inhibited inducible NOS (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in the  lung.GYY4137 conferred protection against acute -associated lung injury, which may have beendue to the anti-oxidant, anti-nitrative and anti-inflammatory properties of GYY4137. The present findings warrant further exploration of the clinical applicability of H2S in the prevention and treatment of ALI.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

However, the exact mechanism of these positive effects remains unkown. Here we investigated the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine could ameliorate muscle wasting in endotoxemic rats and whether it was related to hypothalamic neuropeptides alteration and inflammation. Fourty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) or saline, followed by 50 μg/kg dexmedetomidine or saline administration via the femoral vein catheter (infusion at 5 μg·kg-1·hr-1). Twenty-four hours after injection, hypothalamus tissues and skeletal muscle were obtained. Muscle wasting was measured by the mRNA expression of two E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1) as well as 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and  release. Hypothalamic inflammatory markers and neuropeptides expression were also detected in all four groups. Results showed that LPS administration led to significant increase in hypothalamic inflammation together with muscle wasting. Increased hypothalamic neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) and neuropeptides Y (NPY) and decreased agouti-related protein (AgRP) were also observed. Meanwhile dexmedetomidine administration ameliorated muscle wasting, hypothalamic inflammation and modulated the alteration of neuropeptides, POMC, CART and AgRP, in endotoxemic rats. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine could alleviate muscle wasting in endotoxemic rats, and it could also attenuate the alteration of hypothalamic neuropeptides and reduce hypothalamic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29336487>Mig6 reduces inflammatory mediators production by regulating the activation of EGFR in LPS-induced .</a></h1><p>Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), a  kinase receptor, plays a critical role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced . Meanwhile, EGFR signaling is regulated by multiple feedback regulators, including mitogen-inducible gene 6 protein (Mig6). However, as an EGFR regulator, the role of Mig6 in  is still remained unknown. Here, we reported for the first time that LPS treatment increased the expression of Mig6 and this effect could be inhibited by EGFR inhibitor, PD168393 or erlotinib. Furthermore, knocking down of Mig6 expression led to increased EGFR activation and inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, il-1β) production in response to LPS treatment. On the other hand, the increased EGFR activation and TNF-α or il-1β production in LPS treatment could be inhibited by Mig6 overexpression. Besides, in LPS-induced , ERK1/2 and p-38 activation required Mig6. All these results indicated that Mig6 regulates the production of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, il-1β) through inhibiting the over activation of EGFR, which in turn inhibit MAPKs signaling (ERK1/2, p-38). These finding suggested that Mig6 may be a novel potential target for controlling the over inflammatory response in .© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25930108>Kallistatin treatment attenuates lethality and organ injury in mouse models of established sepsis.</a></h1><p>Kallistatin levels in the circulation are reduced in patients with sepsis and liver disease. Transgenic mice expressing kallistatin are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mortality. Here, we investigated the effect of kallistatin on survival and organ damage in mouse models of established sepsis.Mice were rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), or endotoxemic by LPS injection. Recombinant human kallistatin was administered intravenously six hours after CLP, or intraperitoneally four hours after LPS challenge. The effect of kallistatin treatment on organ damage was examined one day after sepsis initiation, and mouse survival was monitored for four to six days.Human kallistatin was detected in mouse serum of kallistatin-treated mice. Kallistatin significantly reduced CLP-induced renal injury as well as blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) levels. In the lung, kallistatin decreased malondialdehyde levels and HMGB1 and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) synthesis, but increased suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) expression. Moreover, kallistatin attenuated liver injury, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) synthesis. Furthermore, delayed kallistatin administration improved survival in CLP mice by 38%, and LPS-treated mice by 42%. In LPS-induced endotoxemic mice, kallistatin attenuated kidney damage in association with reduced serum creatinine, IL-6 and HMGB1 levels, and increased renal SOCS3 expression. Kallistatin also decreased liver injury in conjunction with diminished serum ALT levels and hepatic TNF-α and TLR4 expression. In cultured macrophages, kallistatin through its active site increased SOCS3 expression, but this effect was blocked by inhibitors of  kinase, protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), indicating that kallistatin stimulates a -kinase-protein kinase C-ERK signaling pathway.This is the first study to demonstrate that delayed human kallistatin administration is effective in attenuating multi-organ injury, inflammation and mortality in mouse models of polymicrobial infection and . Thus, kallistatin therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of sepsis in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871508>A Novel Role of a Chemotherapeutic Agent in a Rat Model of : Modulation of the STAT-3 Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>Sepsis caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a life-threatening disease accompanied by multiple organ failure. This study investigated the curative effects of imatinib (IMA) against hepatic, renal, and pulmonary responses caused by a single administration of LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. Treatment with IMA (15 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min after LPS antagonized the LPS-induced boost of liver enzymes (ALT, AST), kidney functions (BUN, sCr) as well as the elevated pulmonary vascular permeability and edema. IMA declined tissue contents of NF-κB, STAT-3, P38-MAPK, TNF-α, IL-1β, and iNOS. It also amplified the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 as well as the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, a cardinal indicator of the anti-apoptotic effect. Meanwhile, the rats exhibited marked reduction of the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) contents of TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and neutrophil count; however, they revealed prominent augmentation of the BALF content IL-10. In conclusion, these findings suggest that IMA is endowed with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties and hence may provide a novel agent for the management of sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031625>Connecting Metainflammation and Neuroinflammation Through the PTN-MK-RPTPβ/ζ Axis: Relevance in Therapeutic Development.</a></h1><p>Inflammation is a common factor of pathologies such as obesity, type 2 diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic inflammation is considered part of the pathogenic mechanisms of different disorders associated with aging. Interestingly, peripheral inflammation and the associated metabolic alterations not only facilitate insulin resistance and diabetes but also neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the identification of novel pathways, common to the development of these diseases, which modulate the immune response and signaling is key. It will provide highly relevant information to advance our knowledge of the multifactorial process of aging, and to establish new biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes. One novel pathway that regulates peripheral and central immune responses is triggered by the cytokines pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK), which bind its receptor, Receptor Protein  Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ, and inactivate its phosphatase activity. In this review, we compile a growing body of knowledge suggesting that PTN and MK modulate the immune response and/or inflammation in different pathologies characterized by peripheral inflammation associated with insulin resistance, such as aging, and in central disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and . Evidence strongly suggests that regulation of the PTN and MK signaling pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased PTN and/or MK cerebral levels and neuroinflammation. Importantly, we discuss existing therapeutics, and others being developed, that modulate these signaling pathways, and their potential use in pathologies characterized by overt neuroinflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29046432>ALK is a therapeutic target for lethal sepsis.</a></h1><p>Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection, is a major public health concern with limited therapeutic options. We provide evidence to support a role for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tumor-associated receptor  kinase, in the regulation of innate immunity during lethal sepsis. The genetic disruption of ALK expression diminishes the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-mediated host immune response to cyclic dinucleotides in monocytes and macrophages. Mechanistically, ALK directly interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to trigger serine-threonine protein kinase AKT phosphorylation and activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways, enabling STING-dependent rigorous inflammatory responses. Moreover, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the ALK-STING pathway confers protection against lethal  and sepsis in mice. The ALK pathway is up-regulated in patients with sepsis. These findings uncover a key role for ALK in modulating the inflammatory signaling pathway and shed light on the development of ALK-targeting therapeutics for lethal systemic inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

And the activation of hypothalamic neuropeptides is proved to play a crucial role in regulating hypercatabolism, especially skeletal muscle wasting in critical patients, which could lead to serious complications and poor prognosis. Here we investigated the hypothesis that constant light exposure could aggravate skeletal muscle wasting in  rats and whether it was associated with alterations of circadian clock and hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin(POMC) expression. Fifty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide(LPS) or saline, subjected to constant light or a 12:12 h light-dark cycle for 7 days. On day 8, rats were sacrificed across six time points in 24 h and hypothalamus tissues and skeletal muscle were obtained. Rates of muscle wasting were measured by 3-methylhistidine(3-MH) and  release as well as expression of two muscle atrophic genes, muscle ring finger 1(MuRF-1) and muscle atrophy F-box(MAFbx). The expression of circadian clock genes, silent information regulator 1(SIRT1), POMC and hypothalamic inflammatory cytokines were also detected. Results showed that LPS administration significantly increased hypothalamic POMC expression, inflammatory cytokine levels and muscle wasting rates. Meanwhile constant light exposure disrupted the circadian rhythm, declined the expression of SIRT1 as well as aggravated hypothalamic POMC overexpression and skeletal muscle wasting in rats with . Taken together, the results demonstrated that constant light exposure could aggravate POMC-mediated skeletal muscle wasting in  rats, which is associated with alteration of circadian clocks and SIRT1 in the hypothalamus.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Zebra fish provides a genetically tractable model organism for studying innate immunity, with additional advantages in live imaging and drug discovery. However, a   model has not been established in zebra fish. Here, we have developed an acute  model in zebra fish by injecting a single dose of LPS directly into the circulation. Hallmarks of human acute , including systemic inflammation, extensive tissue damage, circulation blockade, immune cell mobilization, and emergency hematopoiesis, were recapitulated in this model. Knocking out the adaptor protein Myd88 inhibited systemic inflammation and improved zebra fish survival. In addition, similar alternations of pathways with human acute  were detected using global proteomic profiling and MetaCore™ pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, treating zebra fish with a protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 11 (Shp2) inhibitor decreased systemic inflammation, immune mobilization, tissue damage, and improved survival in the  model. Together, we have established and characterized the phenotypic and gene expression changes of a zebra fish  model, which is amenable to genetic and pharmacological discoveries that can ultimately lead to a better mechanistic understanding of the dynamics and interplay of the innate immune system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795486>A reassessment of the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids during acute systemic inflammation in humans.</a></h1><p>We reassessed data from a previous study on the transcerebral net exchange of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) using a novel mathematical model of blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport. The study included twelve healthy volunteers who received a 4-h intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion (total dose: 0·3 ng/kg), a human experimental model of the systemic inflammatory response during the early stages of sepsis. Cerebral blood flow and arterial-to-jugular venous LNAA concentrations were measured prior to and after LPS, and the BBB transport and brain extracellular concentrations of LNAAs were calculated. The arterial concentration and unidirectional cerebral influx of phenylalanine increased after LPS. The BBB transport of  was unaffected, while its concentration in the brain extracellular fluid increased. These findings suggest that LPS infusion leads to an increased cerebral uptake of phenylalanine, which is then metabolized to . This may reflect a neuroprotective mechanism that 'detoxifies' excess intracerebral phenylalanine in the clinical setting of sepsis.© 2017 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Supplemented protein may encompass a metabolic requirement for specific amino acids (AA). The current study investigates a method to identify and quantify the amounts of AA required during inflammation induced by an endotoxin challenge. One of each pair of six twin sheep was infused in the jugular vein for 20 h with either saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 ng/kg body weight per min) from Escherichia coli. Between 12 and 20 h a mixture of stable isotope-labelled AA was infused to measure irreversible loss rates. From 16 to 20 h all sheep were supplemented with a mixture of unlabelled AA infused intravenously. Blood samples were taken before the start of infusions, and then continuously over intervals between 14 and 20 h. At 20 h the sheep were euthanised, and liver and kidney samples were taken for measurement of serine-threonine dehydratase (SDH) activity. LPS infusion decreased plasma concentrations of most AA (P<0·05; P<0·10 for leucine and tryptophan), except for phenylalanine (which increased P=0·022) and . On the basis of the incremental response to the supplemental AA, arginine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, lysine (tendency only), glycine, methionine, proline, serine and threonine were important in the metabolic response to the . The AA infusion between 16 and 20 h restored the plasma concentrations in the LPS-treated sheep for the majority of AA, except for glutamine, isoleucine, methionine, serine and valine. LPS treatment increased (P<0·02) SDH activity in both liver and kidney. The approach allows quantification of key AA required during challenge situations.</p></html>
