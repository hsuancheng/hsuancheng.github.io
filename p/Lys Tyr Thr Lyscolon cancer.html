<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6547917>Isolation and primary structure of human PHI (peptide HI).</a></h1><p>The isolation of the human form of PHI (peptide HI) is described. The peptide was purified from human  extracts by using a chemical method for the detection of its C-terminal amidated structure. Human PHI consists of 27 amino acid residues and the complete amino acid sequence is: His-Ala-Asp-Gly-Val-Phe--Ser-Asp-Phe-Ser--Leu-Leu-Gly-Gln-Leu-Ser- Ala----Leu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Met-NH2. The differences between the structures of porcine and human PHI are at position 12 (Arg/ replacement) and at position 27 (Ile/Met).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19035308>Continuous administration of the somatostatin structural derivative /TT-232/ by subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump improves the efficacy and potency of antitumor therapy in different mouse and human tumor models.</a></h1><p>The somatostatin structural derivative, TT-232, has a special 5-residue ring structure (D-Phe-Cys--D-Trp--Cys--NH2) and very different characteristics from the known growth hormone (GH) active somatostatin analogs. This somatostatin structural derivative has no GH release inhibitory or antisecretory activity and does not bind to rat pituitary or the cortex, where all the known somatostatin receptor subtypes are expressed. TT-232 had previously been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a large number of  cell lines in vitro and reduce the size of different tumors in animal models in vivo.The therapeutic efficacy of TT-232 was evaluated in different long-term administration routes: the traditional injection (i.p. or s.c.) versus infusion treatment via s.c.- or i.v.-inserted Alzet osmotic minipump, and on different types of transplantable rodent (S-180 sarcoma, P-388sc lymphoid leukemia, -26 adenocarcinoma, MXT breast carcinoma, B-16 melanoma) and human tumor models (HT-18 lymphoid melanoma, T-47/D breast carcinoma, A-431 epidermoid carcinoma). On the basis of our previous experiments the optimum injected dose of TT-232 was found to be 15 microg/kg twice a day. This dose is equivalent to 0.6 dg/day by infusion therapy.In our experiments, the best results were achieved when TT-232 was applied as an infused treatment. In the S-180 sarcoma and P-388sc lymphoid leukemia rodent tumor models the infusion treatment with TT-232 resulted in 61%-100% tumor growth inhibition and in 20%-60% of the mice being long-term and tumor-free survivors. In the aggressive -26 adenocarcinoma and MXT breast carcinoma models, the infusion treatment resulted in 52%-75% tumor growth inhibition. In the B-16 melanoma model, the infusion treatments resulted in 47% -63% growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of infusion treatment with TT-232 on HT-18 human lymphoid melanoma tumor proved to be significant, resulting in 69%-79% decreases in tumor volume. In the T-47/D human breast carcinoma, the infusion treatment resulted in 48%-53% tumor growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of infusion treatment on A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma tumor resulted in 70%-74% decreases in tumor volume.The antitumor efficacy of TT-232 was seen in almost all the tumors investigated. In our study, the route of infusion was shown to increase drug efficacy relative to conventional delivery methods (injection). The results obtained from this study suggest that TT-232 is a promising new antitumor agent in  chemotherapy and a good candidate for delivery by continuous (infusion) therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2866794>Amino acid sequence of human tumor derived angiogenin.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence and disulfide bond pairing of human tumor derived angiogenin, the first tumor angiogenesis factor to be isolated in pure form from human sources, have been determined by conventional sequencing techniques adapted and applied to nanomole and subnanomole levels of material. Angiogenin, obtained from conditioned media of a human  adenocarcinoma cell line, is a single-chain protein consisting of 123 amino acids with the following sequences: less than Glu1-Asp-Asn-Ser-Arg---His- Phe-Leu--Gln-His--Asp15-Ala--Pro-Gln-Gly-Arg-Asp-Asp- Arg--Cys-Glu-Ser-Ile-Met30- Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Leu--Ser-Pro-Cys--Asp-Ile-Asn-- Phe45-Ile-His-Gly-Asn--Arg-Ser -Ile--Ala-Ile-Cys-Glu-Asn-Lys60-Asn-Gly-Asn-Pro-His-Arg-Glu-Asn -Leu-Arg-Ile -Ser--Ser-Ser75 -Phe-Gln-Val---Cys--Leu-His-Gly-Gly-Ser-Pro-Trp-Pro90-Pro -Cys-Gln- -Arg-Ala--Ala -Gly-Phe-Arg-Asn-Val-Val-Val105-Ala-Cys-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu-Pro-Val- His-Leu-Asp-Gln-Ser-Ile-Phe120-Arg-Arg-Pro123-OH. Three disulfide bonds link the half-cystinyl residues 26-81, 39-92, and 57-107. The sequence is homologous to that of the pancreatic ribonucleases with 35% identity and many of the remaining residues conservatively replaced. Similarities are especially apparent around the major active-site residues His-12, -41, and His-119 of ribonuclease which are conserved as are three of the four disulfide bonds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000121>Furanoid sugar amino acids as dipeptide mimics in design of analogs of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor binding inhibitor.</a></h1><p>In this study we describe the development of peptidomimetic analogs of the potent vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor binding inhibitor, Leu(1) -Met(2) -(3) -Pro(4) -(5) -(6) -Leu(7) -(8) -OH 1, by incorporating furanoid sugar amino acids (SAAs) 2-4 into the molecule. The furanoid SAAs 2-4 were used as dipeptide isosteres to replace (3) -Pro(4) or Pro(4) -(5) in sequence 1. The resulting analogs 5-9 were tested for their anti- activities in vitro, following the standard MTT assay on a panel of human  cell lines. One of the potent analogs, 6a was tested in vivo for tumor regression on primary  tumor xenografted nude mice. Our experimental results suggest that many of these analogs show either retention or enhancement of biological activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22273147>New lyophilized kit for rapid radiofluorination of peptides.</a></h1><p>Radiolabeling compounds with positron-emitting radionuclides often involves a time-consuming, customized process. Herein, we report a simple lyophilized kit formulation for labeling peptides with (18)F, based on the aluminum-fluoride procedure. The prototype kit contains IMP485, a NODA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetate)-MPAA (methyl phenylacetic acid)-di-HSG (histamine-succinyl-glycine) hapten-peptide, [NODA-MPAA-D-(HSG)-D--D-(HSG)-NH(2)], used for pretargeting, but we also examined a similar kit formulation for a somatostatin-binding peptide [IMP466, NOTA-D-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp---Cys-Throl] bearing a NOTA ligand to determine if the benefits of using a kit can be extended to other AlF-binding peptides. The NODA-MPAA ligand forms a single stable complex with (AlF)(2+) in high yields. In order to establish suitable conditions for a facile kit, the formulation was optimized for pH, peptide to Al(3+) ratio, bulking agent, radioprotectant, and the buffer. For optimal labeling, the kit was reconstituted with an aqueous solution of (18)F(-) and ethanol (1:1), heated at 100-110 °C for 15 min, and then simply and rapidly purified using one of two equally effective solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods. Al(18)F-IMP485 was isolated as a single isomer complex, in high yield (45-97%) and high specific activity (up to 223 GBq/μmol), within 20 min. The labeled product was stable in human serum at 37 °C for 4 h and in vivo, urine samples showed the intact product was eliminated. Tumor targeting of the Al(18)F-IMP485 in nude mice bearing human  xenografts pretargeted with an anti-CEACAM5 bispecific antibody showed very low uptake (0.06% ± 0.02 ID/g) in bone, further illustrating its stability. At 1 h, pretargeted animals had high Al(18)F-IMP485 tumor uptake (28.1% ± 4.5 ID/g), with ratios of 9 ± 4, 123 ± 38, 110 ± 43, and 120 ± 108 for kidney, liver, blood and bone, respectively. Tumor uptake remained high at 3 h postinjection, with increased tumor/nontumor ratios. The NOTA-somatostatin-binding peptide also was fluorinated with good yield and high specific activity in the same kit formulation. However, yields were somewhat lower than those achieved with IMP485 containing the NODA-MPAA ligand, likely reflecting this ligand's superior binding properties over the simple NOTA. These studies indicate that (18)F-labeled peptides can be reproducibly prepared as stable Al-F complexes with good radiochemical yield and high specific activity using a simple, one-step, lyophilized kit followed by a rapid purification by SPE that provides the (18)F-peptide ready for patient injection within 30 min.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14501379>TT-232: a somatostatin structural derivative as a potent antitumor drug candidate.</a></h1><p>TT-232 (D-Phe-Cys--D-Trp--Cys--NH2) has been developed as an antitumor somatostatin analog. TT-232 has no growth hormone release inhibitory effect and does not inhibit the secretion of gastric acid. This analog induces apoptosis in and exerts pronounced antiproliferative effects on various human tumors (, pancreas, lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, hepatoma) cell lines. The growth of human xenografts (prostate, breast carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma) and animal tumors (-26, P-388, S-180, B16, MXT) was inhibited by TT-232 (dose range: 30-750 microg/kg/day) in 54-98% of cases. Continuous long-term infusion proved to be the most effective way of administration. TT-232 combined with decarbazine or etoposide treatment enhanced the antitumor activity of these drugs on human melanoma and lymphoma xenografts, respectively. Regarding the mode of action, TT-232 activates cell cycle inhibitors via SSTR receptors, inhibits tyrosine kinases through interfering with the proliferative signaling cascades, and interacts with an intracellular receptor and an enzyme involved in glycolysis causing translocation of this enzyme to the nucleus, thus inducing apoptosis. TT-232 may be a promising candidate in the therapy of human malignancies.</p></html>
