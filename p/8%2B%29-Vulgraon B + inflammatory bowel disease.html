Herein lies the importance of nanotechnology having a wide range of applications in the field of nano-medicine, particularly in drug delivery systems. The exclusive properties particularly small size and high surface area (which can be modified as required), exhibited by these nanoparticlesrender these structures more suitable for the purpose of drug delivery. Various nanostructures, like liposomes, dendrimers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. have been designed for the said purpose. These nanostructures have several advantages over traditional administration of medicine. Apart from overcoming the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics limitations of many potential therapeutic molecules, they may also be useful for advanced drug delivery purposes like targeted drug delivery, controlled release, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In this review, we attempt to describe an up-to-date knowledge on various strategically devised nanostructures to overcome the problems related to oral drug administration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290715>Persistence of antibodies to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to polysaccharide vaccine in patients with Crohn's  - one year follow up.</a></h2><p> Patients suffering from Crohn's  (CD) are at increased risk of infectious , such as pneumococcal infection. The risk increases with immunotherapy. Pneumococcal infection can be prevented by vaccination.  We conducted a randomized trial of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) in groups of CD patients treated with immunosuppressive (IS) drugs in the form of thiopurines (PPV23  = 28, PCV13  = 28) alone or in combination with TNF-α antagonists (PPV23  = 13, PCV13  = 13) and CD patients not treated with any of these drugs (untreated) (PPV23  = 30, PCV13  = 24). In this article, we report the immunogenicity of PPC23 and PCV13 one year after vaccination.  No overall differences in vaccine-induced serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or functional antibodies (opsonophagocytic activity (OPA)) were found between the two vaccines. PCV13 induced a higher concentration of IgG antibodies for serotype 9V than PPV23 in untreated patients. In contrast, PPV23 induced higher OPA for serotypes 6B and 19F than PCV13 in IS treated patients. Untreated patients showed generally higher IgG and OPA antibody levels than patients treated with IS and TNF-α antagonists.  In conclusion, we found no general differences in the persistence of induced antibodies when comparing PPV23 with PCV13 regardless of treatment and also within treatment groups (IS, IS + TNF-α and untreated). This was demonstrated for both serotype-specific IgG antibodies and as functional antibodies (OPA). Patients treated with thiopurines in combination with TNF-α inhibitors have an impaired immune response against both PPV23 and PCV13, as compared to untreated patients. This study has been registered in the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT, record no 2012-002867-86) and ClinicalTrials.gov (record no. ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental Colitis.</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of  (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of  cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350646>Post-Mastectomy Radiotherapy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: A Pooled Retrospective Analysis of Three Prospective Randomized Trials.</a></h2><p>The impact of locoregional radiotherapy (RT) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and mastectomy in breast cancer patients is currently unclear. Several publications have suggested that patients with a favorable response to NACT might not benefit from RT after mastectomy.A retrospective analysis of three prospective randomized NACT trials was performed. Information on the use of RT was available for 817 breast cancer patients with non- breast cancer who underwent mastectomy after NACT within the GeparTrio, GeparQuattro, and GeparQuinto-trials. RT was administered to 676 of these patients (82.7%).The 5-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (LRR) was 15.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.0-22.8%) in patients treated without RT and 11.3% in patients treated with RT (95% CI 8.7-14.3%). In the multivariate analysis, RT was associated with a lower risk of LRR (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-1.0; p = 0.05). This effect was shown especially in patients with cT3/4 tumors, as well as in patients who were cN+ before neoadjuvant therapy, including those who converted to ypN0 after neoadjuvant therapy. In the bivariate analysis, -free survival was significantly worse in patients who received RT, however this was not confirmed in the multivariate analysis.Our results suggest that RT reduces the LRR rates in breast cancer patients who receive a mastectomy after NACT without an improvement in DFS. Prospective randomized controlled trials such as the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and  Project -51/RTOG 1304 trial will analyze whether RT has any benefit in patients who have a favorable response after NACT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413530>Berberine prevents stress-induced gut inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity and reduces intestinal motility in rats.</a></h2><p>Irritable  syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic non-organic  of the digestive system. Berberine (BBR) has been used to treat patients with IBS, but the underlying therapeutic mechanism is little understood. We believe that BBR achieves its therapeutic effect on IBS by preventing stress intestinal inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity and reducing  motility.To test the hypothesis that BBR achieves its therapeutic effect on IBS by preventing subclinical inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and reducing visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal motility.IBS was induced in rats  water avoidance stress (WAS). qRT-PCR and histological analyses were used to evaluate the levels of cytokines and mucosal inflammation, respectively. Modified ELISA and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) signal transduction pathway. Colorectal distention test, gastrointestinal transit measurement, Western blot, and qRT-PCR were used to analyze visceral sensitivity, intestinal motility, the expression of C-kit (marker of Cajal mesenchymal cells), and the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB.WAS led to mucosal inflammation, visceral hyperalgesia, and high intestinal motility. Oral administration of BBR inhibited the NF-κ signal transduction pathway, reduced the expression of pro- cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α], promoted the expression of anti- cytokines (IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β), and improved the terminal ileum tissue inflammation. BBR inhibited the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and C-kit in IBS rats, leading to the reduction of intestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity. The therapeutic effect of BBR at a high dose (100 mg/kg) was superior to than that of the low-dose (25 mg/kg) group.BBR reduces intestinal mucosal inflammation by inhibiting the intestinal NF-κ signal pathway in the IBS rats. BBR reduces the expression of BDNF, its receptor TrkB, and C-kit. BBR also reduces intestinal motility and visceral sensitivity to achieve its therapeutic effect on IBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced  in mice.</a></h2><p>IBD () is a chronic, non-specific,  gastrointestinal  that mainly consists of Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory ) cells, a subset of regulatory  cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with IBD. We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced IBD model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease colitis severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated  cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced IBD.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590413>Beneficial Effects of Oat Beta-Glucan Dietary Supplementation in Colitis Depend on its Molecular Weight.</a></h2><p> are an important health problem. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the impact of isolated oat beta-glucan fractions of low and high molecular weight, taken as dietary supplementation, on  markers in the colitis model.Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats-control and with experimentally induced colitis-were subsequently divided into three subgroups and fed over 21 days feed supplemented with 1% of low (βGl) or high (βGh) molecular weight oat beta-glucan fraction or feed without supplementation. The level of colon  markers, cytokines, and their receptors' genes expressions and immune cells numbers were measured by ELISA, RT-PCR, and by flow cytometry methods, respectively.The results showed moderate inflammation affecting the colon mucosa and submucosa, with significant changes in the number of lymphocytes in the colon tissue, elevated cytokines and eicosanoid levels, as well as disruption of the main cytokine and chemokine cell signaling pathways in colitis rats. Beta-glucans supplementation caused a reverse in the percentage of lymphocytes with stronger effects of βGh and reduction of the levels of the  markers, and improvement of cytokine and chemokine signaling pathways with stronger effects of βGl supplementation.The results indicate the therapeutic effect of dietary oat beta-glucan supplementation in the colitis in evident relation to the molecular weight of polymer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117199>Effect of Forced Physical Activity on the Severity of Experimental Colitis in Normal Weight and Obese Mice. Involvement of Oxidative Stress and Proinflammatory Biomarkers.</a></h2><p> are a heterogeneous group of disorders represented by two major phenotypic forms, Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. Cross talk between adipokines and myokines, as well as changes in intestinal microcirculation, was proposed in pathogenesis of these disorders. C57BL/6 male mice were fed ad libitum for 12 weeks a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). After the adaptation period, two groups of animals fed SD or HFD were subjected to 6 weeks of the forced treadmill exercise and the experimental colitis was induced in both groups of sedentary and exercising mice fed SD and HFD by intra-colonic administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The  activity index (DAI), colonic blood flow (CBF), the weight of animals, caloric intake, the mesenteric fad pad, the colonic oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and intestinal expression and protein content of proinflammatory markers were evaluated. Macroscopic and microscopic colitis in sedentary SD mice was accompanied by a significant fall in CBF and exacerbated in those fed a HFD. The contents of MDA, GSH, and SOD activity were significantly increased in both SD and HFD fed mice with treadmill exercise as compared with sedentary mice. In sedentary HFD mice a significant increase in the intestinal oxidative stress parameters and mucosal expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-10 protein were observed and these effects were aggravated in mice subjected to forced treadmill exercise. The mucosal expression of mRNA for TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, COX-2, SOD-1, SOD-2, GPx mRNAs, and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein expression were upregulated in colonic mucosa of treadmill exercising HFD mice with colitis compared with those without exercise. We conclude that forced treadmill running exacerbates the severity of colonic damage in obese mice due to a fall in colonic microcirculation, an increase in oxidative stress, and the rise in expression and activity of proinflammatory biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406920>Cilostazol against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis: Effect on tight junction, inflammation, and apoptosis.</a></h2><p> are immunologically mediated disorders of gastrointestinal tract, characterized by dysregulated immune responses that result in a chronic intestinal inflammation. The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal ; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced colitis manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa , P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced colitis in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti- and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular tight junctions (TJs). Furthermore, CS can be beneficial as an add-on drug with the conventional treatments of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060878>Antibody responses to influenza vaccine in patients on biological therapy: Results of RIER cohort study.</a></h2><p>Influenza vaccine is recommended for patients with autoimmune  rheumatic  who receive biological therapy. To evaluate if biological therapy impairs immunization after seasonal influenza vaccine.Patients with  arthopathies, psoriasis,  or connective tissue  who were receiving or were going to initiate biological therapy were included and vaccinated during 2014-2015 influenza season. ELISA was used to measure influenza antigen A and  antibodies, before and after vaccination. Demographic parameters, diagnosis and kind of treatment were recorded and their influence on the final serological status against influenza was studied.253 subjects were analyzed. After vaccination, 77% of participants presented detectable antibodies against antigen A and 50.6% of them had detectable antibodies against antigen . Final seropositivity rate against antigen  antibodies increased from baseline (50.6% vs 43.5%, p<0.001). Anti-TNF drugs were associated with better response and rituximab with the worst (79.2% vs 55.0% for final seropositivity against antigen A, p=0.020). Vaccine response in the rituximab group tended to improve when the interval between the drug administration and the vaccination was at least 12 weeks (seropositivity rate 80.0% in those with the longer interval vs 25.0% in the other group, p=0.054).Among the patients on biological therapy vaccinated against influenza, anti-TNF therapy was identified as a predictive factor of final seropositivity. Rituximab presented a lower rate of final seropositivity, which could be increased with an accurate administration schedule.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Although early studies also suggested a functional impact of HLA class II on NK cell activity, the NK cell receptors that specifically recognize HLA class II molecules have never been identified. We investigated whether two major families of NK cell receptors, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), contained receptors that bound to HLA class II, and identified a direct interaction between the NK cell receptor NKp44 and a subset of HLA-DP molecules, including HLA-DP401, one of the most frequent class II allotypes in white populations.

However, the mechanisms employed by IRGM to restrain the inflammation are not known. In our recent study, we showed that IRGM negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IRGM employs 2 parallel approaches to constrain inflammasome activation. First, IRGM directly interacts with NLRP3 and PYCARD/ASC, and mediates their SQSTM1/p62-dependent macroautophagic/autophagic degradation. Second, IRGM impedes inflammasome assembly by blocking the polymerization of NLRP3 and PYCARD.

The neurotoxin 6-OHDA (12.5 µg) was microinjected into the left striatum to induce PD in male rats. Motor behavior was assessed by rotational and elevated narrow beam tests. Oxidative stress markers were measured in striatal and midbrain homogenates.There was a significant increase in contralateral rotations in 6-OHDA group versus sham group (p<0.001), and treatment with  resin extract at doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg significantly decreased the rotations in comparison to 6-OHDA group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The 6-OHDA group also showed considerable elevation in the latency to initiate crossing (p<0.001) and the total time (p<0.001) on narrow beam test. Moreover, treatment with  extract at doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg caused a significant reduction in the latency and total time (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.01, respectively).

Conceptually, these manifestations can be categorised as: (1) disorders that have an association with IBD; (2)  directly and structurally related to intestinal inflammation; (3)  related to the adverse effects of IBD treatment; and (4) disorders stemming from the metabolic derangements caused by IBD. The clinical presentations of these disorders range from a mild transient elevation of liver enzymes to liver failure and death. Given this wide differential diagnosis and spectrum of severity, it is understandable that the evaluation of patients with IBD with a hepatobiliary abnormality is often challenging. In this review, we present a concise summary of the common hepatic manifestations seen in patients with IBD and focus on the relevant practical issues encountered by gastroenterologists caring for patients with IBD. A practical clinical approach to the evaluation of liver enzyme abnormalities in patients with IBD is provided based on the predominant enzyme elevation pattern (hepatocellular vs cholestatic), before presenting a working scheme for the prevention of hepatitis  virus (HBV) reactivation in patients with IBD receiving immunosuppressive medications. Finally, we specify several laboratory alterations seen in patients with IBD that can potentially interfere with the interpretation of liver function tests, before defining the specific circumstances when a referral for a hepatological consultation is required for further assessment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258621>Long-term follow up after switching from original infliximab to an infliximab biosimilar: real-world data.</a></h2><p>Several studies have reported positive efficacy outcomes for patients with  treated with CT-P13, an infliximab biosimilar.

We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the role of emotional processing biases in contributing to depression among people with IBD.One hundred and twenty outpatients with IBD were recruited and: (a) completed questionnaires to record: age, sex, social support, socioeconomic status, anxiety and depression (n = 104), () underwent assessments of biases in emotional recognition (n = 112), emotional memory and reinforcement learning (c) had recorded from clinical records: type of IBD, duration of IBD, IBD activity and (d) provided blood for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (n = 99).Sixty-eight participants had Crohn's  and 49 had ulcerative colitis. Of these, 35 had active  and 26 had depression. Those with depression were more likely to be female, lack social support, have active , be taking corticosteroids but not TNF-alpha inhibitors and exhibit less positive emotional recognition bias. On multivariable regression analysis, depression was associated independently with lack of social support (unstandardized regression coefficient () = -1.40, P = 0.02) and increased  activity ( = 1.29, P = 0.03). Causal steps analysis was consistent with less positive emotional recognition bias partially mediating the effects of  activity on depression.This is the first study to demonstrate links between  activity and less positive biases in emotional recognition that could explain higher rates of depression among people with active IBD. Future prospective studies are required to confirm the effects of emotional processing biases in depression and allow stronger causal inferences to be drawn.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31184523>The anti- protein TNFAIP3/A20 binds the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 to control the autophagic response, NFKB/NF-κ activation and intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The C-terminal domain of ATG16L1 includes 7 WD40-type repeats (WD40 domain, WDD) and is not required for canonical macroautophagy/autophagy. Instead, the WDD allows ATG16L1 to induce LC3/Atg8 lipidation in single-membrane compartments, although a detailed functional characterization of this region is still missing. In a recent report we identify the anti- molecule TNFAIP3/A20 as a binding partner of the WDD. Such physical interaction allows mutual downregulation of the expression levels of both proteins, so that the absence of one of them causes upregulation of the other. This cross-regulation provides a molecular basis for a striking genetic interaction in mice where elimination of both molecules in the intestinal epithelium generates an aggressive  phenotype.  studies reveal unexpected features of the functional interplay between ATG16L1 and TNFAIP3. ATG16L1 requires TNFAIP3 to sustain the canonical autophagic flux measured by SQSTM1/p62 degradation. The WDD mediates lysosomal degradation of TNFAIP3 promoted by ATG16L1, and also regulates the NFKB/NF-κ response. Therefore, our data reveal new roles of the WDD and TNFAIP3 in the regulation of autophagy, protein stability and  signaling. More generally, we identify the interaction between ATG16L1 and TNFAIP3 as a signaling hub that integrates different pathways with important implications for intestinal homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417547>Gut Bacterial Metabolite Urolithin A (UA) Mitigates Ca Entry in T Cells by Regulating miR-10a-5p.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota influences several biological functions including immune responses.  is favorably influenced by consumption of several dietary natural plant products such as pomegranate, walnuts, and berries containing polyphenolic compounds such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid. The gut microbiota metabolizes ellagic acid resulting in the formation of bioactive urolithins A, , C, and D. Urolithin A (UA) is the most active and effective gut metabolite and acts as a potent anti- and anti-oxidant agent. However, whether gut metabolite UA affects the function of immune cells remains incompletely understood. T cell proliferation is stimulated by store operated Ca entry (SOCE) resulting from stimulation of Orai1 by STIM1/STIM2. We show here that treatment of murine CD4 T cells with UA (10 μM, 3 days) significantly blunted SOCE in CD4 T cells, an effect paralleled by significant downregulation of Orai1 and STIM1/2 transcript levels and protein abundance. UA treatment further increased miR-10a-5p abundance in CD4 T cells in a dose dependent fashion. Overexpression of miR-10a-5p significantly decreased STIM1/2 and Orai1 mRNA and protein levels as well as SOCE in CD4 T cells. UA further decreased CD4 T cell proliferation. Thus, the gut bacterial metabolite UA increases miR-10a-5p levels thereby downregulating Orai1/STIM1/STIM2 expression, store operated Ca entry, and proliferation of murine CD4 T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294367>Nutrition Center of Excellence (COE) in -A Model and Rationale for Development.</a></h2><p>The goal of this study was to develop a multi-disciplinary consensus of nutrition care priorities for implementation in an IBD nutrition center of excellence (COE).The role for nutrition care in  is broad and encompasses multiple domains. Gaps exist in the published literature around best nutrition care practices in  and highlight the need for an evidence based approach acceptable to patients, and generalizable to a wide  population.Twelve health leaders in  care attended a 1-day retreat. Two focus groups were completed using traditional focus group methodology for the first half of the retreat and a World Café method for the second half. Data analysis included review of analytic memos and conceptual analysis completed at the time of discussion, theme identification and team consensus for conceptual development.Three primary themes were identified as the main pillars of a COE in an IBD nutrition center of excellence.

The key initial steps identified in this study included standardizing malnutrition screening and support while creating an environment where nutrition therapy is included as a standard of care, developing and examining the effectiveness of novel diet therapies, and translating knowledge to build capacity among care providers and patients.Using a 1-day retreat to identify a future direction for a center focused on nutrition excellence and align our coalition towards common goals was a successful strategy to develop consensus and identify nutrition care priorities for action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614035>The influence of self-criticism on depression symptoms among ambulatory patients with .</a></h2><p>Considering that self-criticism is an important process in the development and maintenance of depression, and taking into account the stigma associated with  (IBD), the present study aimed to analyse whether self-criticism exacerbates the relationships of depression symptoms with IBD symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame. The sample included 53 ambulatory IBD patients (66% females) with ages from 18 to 65. Moderation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. Self-criticism exacerbated the associations of depression with IBD symptoms ( = 0.01; standard error [SE] = 0.00; Z = 3.73; P < .001) and illness shame ( = 0.02; SE = 0.01; Z = 2.40; P = .016). For the same level of IBD symptomatology or chronic illness-related shame, those individuals who present more feelings of inadequacy towards the self, experience more symptoms of depression. This exacerbation effect is stronger when IBD symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame are more intense. A high self-critical IBD patient may view the illness and/or symptomatology as a flaw or error that should be self-corrected. Physicians and other health professionals should be attentive to these pathological mechanisms and should attempt to alleviate them. It may be beneficial to refer high self-critical patients to psychological care.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499154>Neutrophilic Dermatosis of the Dorsal Hands: A Review of 123 Cases.</a></h2><p>Neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands is an uncommon localised variant of Sweet syndrome first described in 1995. It is characterised by tender erythematous plaques, pustules and bullae on the dorsa of the hands.A total of 123 cases of NDDH are included in this review. The mean patient age was 62.1 years and there was a slight female preponderance. 78.0% of cases had reported bilateral involvement and other sites were affected in almost a third of cases. Underlying  was found in around 40% of patients, with the most common associations being haematological disorders (gammopathies, myelodysplasias or malignancies), recent infection, solid organ tumours and . Systemic and/or topical corticosteroids were employed in the treatment of 88.1% of cases while dapsone, colchicine and tetracyclines were the commonest steroid-sparing agents used. Improvement was often rapid and complete resolution the norm.Whilst being uncommon, NDDH is frequently misdiagnosed and thus, its exact prevalence is probably underestimated. This may have significant implications including treatment delays or incorrect management. Moreover, recognition of NDDH is important since a correct diagnosis should trigger a search for underlying  and proper treatment with corticosteroids and/or steroid-sparing agents which is almost invariably curative.Copyright © 2019.

Aberrant regulation of the activation of the transcription factor NF-κ is associated with severe  such as  and arthritis. In the canonical pathway, the inhibitor Iκ suppresses NF-κ's transcriptional activity. NF-κ becomes active upon the degradation of Iκ, a process that is, in turn, regulated by the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP). β-TrCP has therefore been proposed as a promising pharmacological target in the development of novel therapeutic approaches to control NF-κ's activity in . This study explores the extent to which β-TrCP affects the dynamics of nuclear NF-κ using a computational model of canonical NF-κ signaling. The analysis predicts that β-TrCP influences the steady-state concentration of nuclear NF-κ, as well as changes characteristic dynamic properties of nuclear NF-κ, such as fold-change and the duration of its response to pathway stimulation. The results suggest that the modulation of β-TrCP has a high potential to regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644159>Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonists.</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is a bioactive cytokine that is an important component of the  and pain pathways. Inhibition of TNF can decrease the  response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in  (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune  marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “ modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and . The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis . Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis  have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis . However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

However, the impact of tofacitinib on cellular response of monocytes, which are key players in  responses, has not been investigated so far. We aimed to analyze JAK/STAT-inhibition by tofacitinib in monocytes of IBD patients and healthy controls.Primary monocytes of IBD patients with active  and healthy controls (n = 18) were analyzed for cytokine expression and phenotype after granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interferon (IFN)γ-stimulation and tofacitinib pretreatment (1-1000 nM) and capacity to induce Foxp3+-regulatory T cells (Tregs) in cocultures. In total, 20 UC patients and 21 CD patients were included. Additionally, dose-dependent inhibition of JAK/STAT-phosphorylation was analyzed in controls.Pro- costimulation with GM-CSF/IFNγ resulted in significant tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-6 increase, whereas IL-10 expression decreased in monocytes. Tofacitinib modulated the responses of activated monocytes toward a regulatory phenotype through reduced TNFα and IL-6 secretion and enhanced Treg induction in cocultures. However, in monocytes from active IBD patients, higher tofacitinib dosages were needed for blockade of pro- cytokines. Tofacitinib induced stronger regulatory phenotypes in monocytes of UC patients, including more effective inhibition of pro- pathways and better restoration of anti- mechanisms as compared with CD-derived monocytes.Tofacitinib dose-dependently reprograms monocytes toward a more regulatory cell type. This beneficial effect possibly results from selective JAK/STAT-blockade by adequate tofacitinib dosage with inhibition of pro- responses and permission of a balance-shift toward regulatory pathways.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Immunologic response and the development of immunity to the HBV vaccine vary significantly among patients. Multiple studies have looked at patients who are at risk of nonresponse and have offered their own approaches to patients who do not respond. This article reviews the best approaches to HBV vaccine nonresponse.  We searched the PubMed database for all articles on HBV vaccination response from 1981 to January 2018. Recommended and tested approaches to nonresponse were identified.  A total of 71 adequate-quality studies with 2354 patients were identified. Repeat vaccination with the same dose increased immunologic seroconversion in 85.7% of patients who previously reported nonresponse and in over 80% of patients with end-stage renal , HIV infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, advanced age, hypoalbuminemia, liver cirrhosis, and hemodialysis (HD) dependence. Patients with , celiac , and diabetes had a milder response (67.5%). Increasing the vaccination dose to 40 µg improved seroconversion in HIV-infected, HCV-infected, and HD patients of initial nonresponse. The use of a subcutaneous injection route increased response by 12% in patients infected with HIV.  Patients not responding to an initial vaccine series and not actively infected with HBV benefited from reimmunization by repeating the vaccine series or receiving a single-dose vaccine booster. Although the overall response rate was approximately 90% of previous nonresponders, the rate varied among the populations studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31036757>Infants born to mothers with IBD present with altered gut microbiome that transfers abnormalities of the adaptive immune system to germ-free mice.</a></h2><p>Prenatal and early life bacterial colonisation is thought to play a major role in shaping the immune system. Furthermore, accumulating evidence links early life exposures to the risk of developing IBD later in life. We aimed to assess the effect of maternal IBD on the composition of the microbiome during pregnancy and on the offspring's microbiome.We prospectively examined the diversity and taxonomy of the microbiome of pregnant women with and without IBD and their babies at multiple time points. We evaluated the role of maternal IBD diagnosis, the mode of delivery, antibiotic use and feeding behaviour on the microbiome composition during early life. To assess the effects of IBD-associated maternal and infant microbiota on the enteric immune system, we inoculated germ-free mice (GFM) with the respective stool and profiled adaptive and innate immune cell populations in the murine intestines.Pregnant women with IBD and their offspring presented with lower bacterial diversity and altered bacterial composition compared with control women and their babies. Maternal IBD was the main predictor of the microbiota diversity in the infant gut at 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days of life. Babies born to mothers with IBD demonstrated enrichment in  and depletion in . Finally, GFM inoculated with third trimester IBD mother and 90-day infant stools showed significantly reduced microbial diversity and fewer class-switched memory  cells and regulatory T cells in the colon.Aberrant gut microbiota composition persists during pregnancy with IBD and alters the bacterial diversity and abundance in the infant stool.

We aimed to test if an FC test used in combination with FIT could improve the predictive ability. Consecutive out-patients with UC ( = 93) who were admitted for colonoscopy completed a single faecal sample before the start of  preparation. A quantitative CALPRO calprotectin ELISA test and a qualitative FIT (cut-off < 40 ng/mL) were analyzed. An estimated Mayo score and a score of histological inflammation was performed blinded to the result of the faecal tests. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for endoscopic inflammation (Mayo score > 1) was for FIT 85%, 83%, 96%, 57% and for FC > 186 µg/g 73%, 87%, 87%, 54%. Corresponding results for FIT*FC > 186 µg/g (at least one test positive) were 92%, 69%, 97%, 43%. For detecting moderate/severe histological inflammation the results were for FIT 69%, 79%, 92%, 43%, for FC > 75 µg/g 95%, 62%, 98%, 41%, and for FIT*FC > 75 µg/g 100%, 60%, 100%, 36%.

FUT2 encodes α-1,2-fucosyltransferase that regulates the secretion of the α-1-2-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and α-1-3-galactosyltransferase (ABO) antigens in both the gastrointestinal mucosa and secretory glands. Given that CD is thought to arise from dysregulated mucosal immune responses to the gut flora and both the ABO blood group and the FUT2 secretor status affect the composition of the gut microbiota, the goal of this study was to evaluate the associations of variants of FUT2 and ABO with CD in Koreans.Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the FUT2 and ABO genes were genotyped in 1735 patients with CD and 8074 healthy controls.The FUT2 non-secretor allele showed genome-wide significant association with CD in Koreans (rs1047781, odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, P  = 3.52 × 10 ).

In particular, monoclonal antibodies against the pro- cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF) such as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are now in the clinics both in induction and maintenance therapy, and several efforts are currently ongoing to optimize the use of these drugs in children. : This review focuses on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of anti-TNF levels and antidrug antibodies (ADAs), in IBD children. A revision of the analytical assays used for assessing anti-TNF plasma levels is also provided. : Although there is a consensus across studies that higher anti-TNF trough levels are associated with a better clinical outcome, and that early anti-TNF serum measurements could be predictive of long-term response, it is still not clear what the best predictive time of sampling is and what the ideal target drug plasma concentration to achieve.

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of -based disorders of the gut, like  (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin- system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin- antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin- forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated  responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin- system as a pharmacological target in intestinal  disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560862>A modified cholera toxin  subunit containing an ER retention motif enhances colon epithelial repair  an unfolded protein response.</a></h2><p>Cholera toxin  subunit (CTB) exhibits broad-spectrum biologic activity upon mucosal administration. Here, we found that a recombinant CTB containing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (CTB-KDEL) induces colon epithelial wound healing in colitis  the activation of an unfolded protein response (UPR) in colon epithelial cells. In a Caco2 cell wound healing model, CTB-KDEL, but not CTB or CTB-KDE, facilitated cell migration  interaction with the KDEL receptor, localization in the ER, UPR activation, and subsequent TGF-β signaling. Inhibition of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box binding protein 1 arm of UPR abolished the cell migration effect of CTB-KDEL, indicating that the pathway is indispensable for the activity. CTB-KDEL's capacity to induce UPR and epithelial restitution or wound healing was corroborated in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute colitis mouse model. Furthermore, CTB-KDEL induced a UPR, up-regulated wound healing pathways, and maintained viable crypts in colon explants from patients with  (IBD). In summary, CTB-KDEL exhibits unique wound healing effects in the colon that are mediated by its localization to the ER and subsequent activation of UPR in epithelial cells.

Mice were separated into four groups: (a) water only (control), () DSS followed by water (DSS), (c) water followed by MC-LR (MC-LR), and (d) DSS followed by MC-LR (DSS + MC-LR). DSS resulted in weight loss, splenomegaly, and severe colitis marked by transmural acute inflammation, ulceration, shortened colon length, and bloody stools. DSS + MC-LR mice experienced prolonged weight loss and bloody stools, increased ulceration of colonic mucosa, and shorter colon length as compared with DSS mice. DSS + MC-LR also resulted in greater increases in pro- transcripts within colonic tissue (TNF-α, IL-1β, CD40, MCP-1) and the pro-fibrotic marker, PAI-1, as compared to DSS-only ingestion. These findings demonstrate that MC-LR exposure not only prolongs, but also worsens the severity of pre-existing colitis, strengthening evidence of MC-LR as an under-recognized environmental toxin in vulnerable populations, such as those with IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335810>A Prospective Multicenter Study Evaluating Endoscopy Competence Among Gastroenterology Trainees in the Era of the Next Accreditation System.</a></h2><p>The Next Accreditation System requires training programs to demonstrate competence among trainees. Within gastroenterology (GI), there are limited data describing learning curves and structured assessment of competence in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy. In this study, the authors aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a centralized feedback system to assess endoscopy learning curves among GI trainees in EGD and colonoscopy.During academic year 2016-2017 the authors performed a prospective multicenter cohort study, inviting participants from multiple GI training programs. Trainee technical and cognitive skills were assessed using a validated competence assessment tool. An integrated, comprehensive data collection and reporting system was created to apply cumulative sum analysis to generate learning curves that were shared with program directors and trainees on a quarterly basis.Out of 183 fellowships invited, 129 trainees from 12 GI fellowships participated, with an overall trainee participation rate of 72.1% (93/129); the highest participation level was among first-year trainees (90.9%, 80/88) and lowest among third-year trainees (51.2%, 27/53). In all, 1,385 EGDs and 1,293 colonoscopies were assessed. On aggregate learning curve analysis, third-year trainees achieved competence in overall technical and cognitive skills, while first- and second-year trainees demonstrated the need for ongoing supervision and training in the majority of technical and cognitive skills.This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a centralized feedback system for the evaluation and documentation of trainee performance in EGD and colonoscopy. Furthermore, third-year trainees achieved competence in both endoscopic procedures, validating the effectiveness of current training programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669340>4-Methylesculetin, a natural coumarin with intestinal anti- activity, elicits a glutathione antioxidant response by different mechanisms.</a></h2><p>4-methylesculetin (4 ME) is a natural antioxidant coumarin with protective effects on the intestinal inflammation, in which oxidative stress plays a key role in its aetiology and pathophysiology. Based on this, we examined the antioxidant molecular mechanisms involved in the intestinal anti- activity of the 4 ME. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of the 4 ME on the modulation of gene expression and antioxidant-related enzyme activities in TNBS model of intestinal inflammation as well as the molecular interaction between 4 ME and glutathione reductase. Our results showed that 4 ME modulated glutathione-related enzymes, mainly increasing glutathione reductase activity. These effects were related to upregulation of glutathione reductase and Nrf2 gene expression. Fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that interaction between 4 ME and glutathione reductase is collisional, hydrophobic and spontaneous, in which C4 methyl group is the second epitope most buried into glutathione reductase. Molecular modelling calculation showed Lys70-, Arg81-A, Glu381-, Asp443-A, Ser444-A, Glu447- and Ser475-A participated in electrostatic interaction, Lys70-, Glu381- and Arg81-A acted in the hydrophobic interactions and Trp73, Phe377 and Ala446 are responsible for the hydrogen bonds. Based on this, our results showed 4 ME acted by different mechanisms to control oxidative stress induced by intestinal damage, controlling the imbalance between myeloperoxidase activity and glutathione production, upregulating the glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities, preventing the Nrf2 and glutathione gene expression downregulation with consequent glutathione maintenance. Finally, 4 ME interacted at molecular level with glutathione reductase, stabilizing its enzymatic activity and reducing oxidative stress to take place in intestinal  process.Copyright © 2019.

Current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and American College of Gastroenterology vaccine recommendations for patients with IBD are based on low levels of evidence.We conducted a population-based descriptive cohort study using the US National Inpatient Sample ICD-9 codes from 2012 to 2015. We measured the frequency of patients with IBD who were admitted to the hospital with a vaccine-preventable  (VPD). Frequencies and demographics were determined and compared between patients with IBD and patients without IBD.Of discharges, 596,485 (2.08%) were secondary to a VPD, and 7180 (1.2%) were found to have both a VPD and IBD (including Crohn  and ulcerative colitis). The most common VPDs among patients with IBD were herpes zoster virus (HZV) (34.9%) and hepatitis  virus (31.6%), followed by influenza (22.1%). Pneumococcal pneumonia (9.1%) and hepatitis A virus (2.4%) were less common. Inpatients with IBD were twice as likely to have HZV when compared to non-IBD inpatients (odds ratios [OR] = 2.30 [95% CI, 2.06-2.58], P < 0.0001) This finding was consistent for every study year. Pneumococcal pneumonia [OR = 0.62 (95% CI, 0.52-0.74), P < 0.0001] and influenza [OR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81), P < 0.0001] were significantly lower in the IBD population. There was no difference for other VPDs.HZV was the most frequent VPD in IBD inpatients. Patients with IBD have a higher rate of hospital admissions with HZV and a lower rate of pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza admissions when compared with non-IBD patients. For other VPDs, patients with IBD have the same rate of admission as the general population.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

It is increasingly recognized that many patients have continued  activity without symptoms. Subclinical inflammation increases the risk of  flares and long-term complications. A consensus is therefore emerging on the need to treat beyond symptoms and to define clear treatment targets for IBD patients receiving biologic medicines. : We review validated tools used in IBD for monitoring clinical and endoscopic response to therapy. We discuss the value of using non-invasive tests in assessing  activity. We summarise the latest guidelines in IBD treatment and review recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring. We examine the role of monitoring for and prevention of avoidable complications of treatment. : The goals of treatment in IBD are to achieve both clinical remission and mucosal healing. Whether we adopt a top-down or more conventional treatment strategy there is now an imperative to monitor patients using a combination of endoscopic and biochemical markers to assess the degree of continuing inflammation and establish early  control. TDM has facilitated huge improvement in the ability to personalize delivery of biologics. This has allowed for early detection and prevention of loss of response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of .</a></h2><p> (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's . Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of . Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles.

The intrinsic innervation is provided by the enteric nervous system (ENS), whereas the extrinsic innervation includes sympathetic/parasympathetic nerve fibers and extrinsic sensory nerve fibers. In the present study, we used immunofluorescent staining of neurofilament-heavy (NF-H) to reveal the distribution of nerve fibers and their associations with immune cells inside mouse Peyer's patches (PP), an essential part of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Our results demonstrate (1) the presence of an extensive meshwork of NF-H-immunoreactive presumptive nerve fibers in all PP compartments including the lymphoid nodules, interfollicular region, follicle-associated epithelium, and subepithelial dome; (2) close associations/contacts of nerve fibers with blood vessels including high endothelial venules, indicating neural control of blood flow and immune cell dynamics inside the PP; (3) close contacts between nerve fibers/endings and /T cells and various subsets of dendritic cells ( e.g., B220-, B220+, CD4-, CD4+, CD8-, and CD8+). Our novel findings concerning PP innervation and nerve-immune-cell contacts in situ should facilitate our understanding of bi-directional communications between the PNS and GALT. Since the innervation of the gut, including PP, might be important in the pathogenesis and progression of some neurological, infectious, and autoimmune , e.g., prion  and , better knowledge of PNS-immune system interactions in the GALT (including PP) should benefit the development of potential treatments for these  via neuroimmune manipulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461996>Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased  Activity in Patients with .</a></h2><p>Vitamin D has an inhibitory role in the  signaling pathways and supports the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Due to its immunomodulatory effect, vitamin D plays a role in chronic  (IBD) and a deficiency is associated with an increased risk for a flare. We aimed to investigate to what extent the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) level correlates with  activity and whether a cut-off value can be defined that discriminates between active  and remission.Patients with IBD, treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt were analyzed retrospectively. The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with IBD were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's  (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.2%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27.5 ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients and appears to be associated with increased  activity. In our study, vitamin D levels were inversely associated with  activity.

Since most of the  medications in current use have several undesirable side-effects, stevioside, a naturally occurring, high-intensity sweetener was assessed in our study for its anti- properties by in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Stevioside was observed to significantly inhibit the levels of LPS induced elevation of cytokines, TNF-α (P < 0.05) and IL-6 (P < 0.001) as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (P < 0.01) and nitrites (P < 0.001) in RAW264.7 cells. Stevioside has also been evaluated for its anti- effect by using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model in mice. Stevioside significantly reduced the  activity index (DAI) score, ameliorated the  symptoms induced by DSS in mice and exhibited intact colon histo-architecture. Stevioside treatment significantly inhibited the levels of pro- cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, and the protein expressions of pro- mediators, COX-2 (P < 0.01) and iNOS (P < 0.01) and restored the levels of endogenous anti-oxidants such as superoxide dismutase (P < 0.01), catalase (P < 0.001), glutathione s-transferase (P < 0.001) and reduced glutathione (P < 0.001) level in colon tissues. It was also observed that stevioside significantly suppressed NF-κ (p65) activation by abrogating Iκ phosphorylation and attenuated the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK proteins in colon tissues. The findings of the present study suggest that stevioside exhibits anti- property by inhibiting NF-κ (p65) and MAPK pathways and can be employed as an adjunct in nutraceuticals to treat IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the usefulness of diagnostic tests in such patients.We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, from 1978 until April 2017. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies reporting on the use of fecal and blood tests for the evaluation of adult patients with functional diarrhea, including irritable  syndrome. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II, and the certainty in the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity, and the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative results. We evaluated the following tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fecal lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin, serologic tests for celiac , tests for bile acid diarrhea, the commercially available version of anti-cytolethal distending toxin  and anti-vinculin antibodies, and tests for Giardia infection. We did not evaluate breath tests for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as they are not part of a standard diarrhea workup.Thirty-eight studies proved eligible to evaluate 1 or more of these tests. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were similar at discriminating organic from functional , with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 0.54-0.78 and 0.46-0.95 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 0.73 and 0.78 for C-reactive protein. Among fecal tests, fecal calprotectin in a range of 50-60 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.86; pooled specificity 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) and fecal lactoferrin in a range of 4.0-7.25 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; pooled specificity 0.93; 95%CI 0.63-0.99) presented the lowest proportion of false-negative results (low certainty in the evidence). Among tests for celiac , IgA tissue transglutaminase presented the best diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity range, 0.79-0.99; specificity range, 0.90-0.99) with moderate certainty in the evidence. Among tests for bile acid diarrhea, the selenium homotaurocholic acid test performed better than serum fibroblast growth factor 19 and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, but is not available in the United States. There was insufficient evidence to recommend serologic tests for irritable  syndrome at this time. There are several good diagnostic tests for Giardia infection.Moderate to low certainty in the evidence indicates that available fecal and blood tests may play a role in the diagnostic workup of adult patients with functional diarrhea. At the moment, no tests are available to reliably rule in irritable  syndrome.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Five cases of indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from 2016 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical and pathological parameters were analyzed by combining clinical data and reviewing the available literature of 35 cases (34 cases abroad and 1 case in China).  There were 4 males and 1 female with a median age of 47 years (18-66 years). All patients had abdominal pain and constitutional symptoms including diarrhea, emaciation, intermittent mucous stool or oral and epiglottic ulcers. Endoscopic manifestations included multiple punctate congestion, erosion and ulcer at the terminal ileum and colorectum. Two cases had congestion and erosion of antrum and angle of stomach, and the lesions did not fuse and form tumors. Histologically, the lamina propria was expanded by a dense, medium to small lymphocyte infiltration, which was monomorphic, with slightly irregular nuclei without prominent nucleolus or lymphoepithelial lesions. There were admixed small amount of plasma cells and eosinophils. In 4 cases, immunohistochemistry showed the lesional cells were positive for CD3, CD8, TIA1, and negative for CD4, CD56, granzyme  and Ki-67 index was ≤10%. In situ hybridization showed that EBER was negative and clonal TCR gene rearrangement was detected.

In this study, a total of 230 patients with abdominal discomfort were prospectively enrolled and fecal samples were collected within 24 h before the endoscopic examinations. We show that fecal BAFF levels were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (median = 1549 pg/g, P < 0·0001), Crohn's  (median = 735 pg/g, P < 0·0001), gastric cancer (median = 267 pg/g, P < 0·0001) and colorectal cancer (median = 533 pg/g, P < 0·0001) than those in healthy groups (median = 61 pg/g), while the values of which in patients with gastric polyps, colorectal polyps, esophagitis/gastritis/duodenitis and peptic ulcer were in the range of healthy individuals (P > 0·05). An optimal cut-off value at 219·5 pg/g of fecal BAFF produced sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of 85, 91, 84 and 92%, respectively, for IBD or carcinoma.

Detection of clonal rearrangements of the T-cell-receptor gamma (TCRG) chain and IG heavy chain (IGH) V-J genes offer a useful solution. In this retrospective study, histopathology samples of 35 CCE patients and 7 healthy Beagle dogs underwent clonality testing. Patients suffered either from  (IBD), food responsive diarrhea (FRD) or protein loosing enteropathy secondary to IBD (PLE/IBD). Healthy Beagles served as controls (CO). Canine IBD activity index (CIBDAI) and histopathological WSAVA-grading differed significantly (p<0.001) between groups. CIBDAI improved significantly after appropriate therapy (p < 0.0001). Intestinal biopsies of all CO showed polyclonal patterns for - and T-cell primers. All samples from CCE patients showed polyclonal patterns for the -cell primers. Targeting TCRG, 4 patients showed a monoclonal or oligoclonal pattern of the lymphocytic infiltrates in the duodenum and/or colon. Clinical improvement was observed in all dogs. Although a small cell lymphoma cannot be excluded in view of the short follow up duration, a false positive result, in the sense of a canonical rearrangement or unspecific amplification due to a antigenic stimulation in a non-neoplastic  process is possible.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Vitamin D is essential for the growth and development of bones and helps in reducing inflammation by strengthening muscles and the immune system. Despite the endless supply of sunlight in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries which includes United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, Vitamin D deficiency in the (GCC) general population at various age groups remains alarmingly high. In parallel runs the increasing prevalence of acute and chronic illnesses including, autoimmune , cancer, type 1 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular  and  in the adult as well as the pediatric population of these countries. The exact association between Vitamin D deficiency and chronic  conditions remains unclear; however, studies have focused on the mechanism of Vitamin D regulation by assessing the role of the Vitamin D associated genes/proteins such as VDR (Vitamin D receptor), VDBP (Vitamin D Binding protein), CYP27B1 as these are integral parts of the Vitamin D signaling pathway. VDR is known to regulate the expression of more than 200 genes across a wide array of tissues in the human body and may play a role in controlling the Vitamin D levels. Moreover, reduced Vitamin D level and downregulation of VDR have been linked to gut dysbiosis, highlighting an intriguing role for the gut microbiome in the Vitamin D metabolism. However, this role is not fully described yet. In this review, we aim to expand our understanding of the causes of Vitamin D deficiency in the GCC countries and explore the potential relationship between the genetic predisposition, Vitamin D levels, immune system and the gut microbiome composition. Trying to unravel this complex interaction may aid in understanding the mechanism by which Vitamin D contributes to various  conditions and will pave the way toward new therapeutics treatments for Vitamin D deficiency and its associated outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446181>Expression Levels of 4 Genes in Colon Tissue Might Be Used to Predict Which Patients Will Enter Endoscopic Remission After Vedolizumab Therapy for .</a></h2><p>We aimed to identify biomarkers that might be used to predict responses of patients with  (IBD) to vedolizumab therapy.We obtained biopsies from inflamed colon of patients with IBD who began treatment with vedolizumab (n = 31) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (n = 20) and performed RNA-sequencing analyses. We compared gene expression patterns between patients who did and did not enter endoscopic remission (absence of ulcerations at month 6 for patients with Crohn's  or Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 at week 14 for patients with ulcerative colitis) and performed pathway analysis and cell deconvolution for training (n = 20) and validation (n = 11) datasets. Colon biopsies were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We validated a baseline gene expression pattern associated with endoscopic remission after vedolizumab therapy using 3 independent datasets (n = 66).We identified significant differences in expression levels of 44 genes between patients who entered remission after vedolizumab and those who did not; we found significant increases in leukocyte migration in colon tissues from patients who did not enter remission (P < .006). Deconvolution methods identified a significant enrichment of monocytes (P = .005), M1-macrophages (P = .05), and CD4+ T cells (P = .008) in colon tissues from patients who did not enter remission, whereas colon tissues from patients in remission had higher numbers of naïve  cells before treatment (P = .05). Baseline expression levels of PIWIL1, MAATS1, RGS13, and DCHS2 identified patients who did vs did not enter remission with 80% accuracy in the training set and 100% accuracy in validation dataset 1. We validated these findings in the 3 independent datasets by microarray, RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis (P = .003). Expression levels of these 4 genes did not associate with response to anti-TNF agents. We confirmed the presence of proteins encoded by mRNAs using immunohistochemistry.We identified 4 genes whose baseline expression levels in colon tissues of patients with IBD associate with endoscopic remission after vedolizumab, but not anti-TNF, treatment. We validated this signature in 4 independent datasets and also at the protein level. Studies of these genes might provide insights into the mechanisms of vedolizumab.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Probiotics are able to reduce  responses in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, entire signaling pathways and the interaction between different probiotics have not been well-documented. This study was designed to investigate the anti- effects and mechanisms of single and combined probiotics. HT-29 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, treated with ,  subsp.  or their combination and analyzed for inflammation-related molecules. Both  and  subsp.  reduced interleukin (IL)-8 secretion and the expressions of phosphorylated p65 nuclear factor-kappa  (-p65 NF-κ), phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (-p38 MAPK), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), while they increased toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression.  did not decrease intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) but enhanced the inhibitory efficacy of  subsp. . Combined probiotics showed the best anti- activity. These results suggest that  and  subsp.  may exert a potent anti- effect through modulating TLR2-mediated NF-κ and MAPK signaling pathways in  IECs. Both strains, especially their combination, may be novel adjuvants for IBD therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347993>Unexplained fever in a young man with Crohn's : a case report and review of literature.</a></h2><p>A 23-year-old man with a known history of Crohn's  (CD), who underwent an ileocaecal resection for localized  activity three months ago, suffered from persistent fever with chills since 10 days.

We investigated which markers are most relevant to assess intestinal permeability in UC patients and whether probiotics had an effect on these markers.In this twelve-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study, twenty-five subjects with UC in remission received either placebo or a multispecies probiotics. Samples of blood, urine, and faeces were taken at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to assess intestinal permeability and inflammation. Diaries and Bristol stool scale were kept to record stool frequency and consistency. Quality of life was scored from 32-224 with the  questionnaire (IBD-Q).This group of UC patients, in clinical remission, did not show increased intestinal permeability at baseline of this study. During the study, no significant group or time effects were found for intestinal permeability measured by the 5-sugar absorption test, serum zonulin, and faecal zonulin. Likewise, the  markers C-reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, and the cytokines IFN, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 were not significantly affected. Stool frequency and consistency were not significantly affected either. The IBD-Q score, 194 for the probiotics group and 195 for the placebo group, remained unaffected. Correlations were tested between all outcomes; urinary sucrose excretion was significantly correlated with serum zonulin ( = 0.62) and faecal calprotectin ( = 0.55). Faecal zonulin was not significantly correlated with any of the other markers.Serum zonulin may be a more relevant biomarker of intestinal permeability than faecal zonulin, due to its correlation with other biomarkers of intestinal permeability. UC patients in remission did not show an effect of the probiotic treatment or a change in gut permeability. This should not discourage further studies because effects might be present during active  or shortly after a flare up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145641>Daphnetin ameliorates experimental colitis by modulating microbiota composition and T/T17 balance.</a></h2><p> (IBDs) are characterized by chronic pathologies associated with extensive gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Hence, endeavors to improve the  pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti- and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating  disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, ., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

To study the mechanism mediated by TREM-1 on macrophages, we generated an independent TREM-1 deficient mouse.Acute colitis was induced in C57BL/6 and TREM-1-deficient mice by the administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Colonic lamina propria immune cell composition and cytokines were analyzed. An innate lymphoid cell (ILC) co-culture experiment with macrophages was used to analyze IL-22 levels. Exogenous IL-22 and TREM-1-expressing macrophages were supplied to TREM-1-deficient mice for examining their effects on intestinal barrier integrity.In inflamed colons, TREM-1 loss compromised the activation of ILC3 and their production of IL-22, which is required for intestinal barrier integrity. ILC3-mediated IL-22 production depends on IL-1β secreted by M1-polarized macrophages, and we found that TREM-1 deficiency results in a decreased number of IL-1β producing-M1 macrophages in colons exposed to DSS. Accordingly, DSS-mediated damage was ameliorated by supplying exogenous IL-22 and TREM-1-expressing macrophages to TREM-1-deficient mice.TREM-1 plays a crucial role in regulating IL-22 production by ILC3 through modulating M1-macrophage polarization during DSS-induced acute colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019062>IL-21 Enhances the Development of Colitis-Associated Colon Cancer: Possible Involvement of Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase Expression.</a></h2><p> are known to be the origin of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). We previously reported that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis is exacerbated in mouse-IL-21-isoform transgenic (Tg) mice. In this study, we assessed the CAC development induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and DSS in our Tg mice. AOM-DSS-induced tumor development was dramatically increased in the Tg mice compared with wild-type mice. IL-21 is known to enhance activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression in  cells and induce Ab class switching. In contrast, the AID expression in cells other than  cells initiates tumor development in many tissues. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-21 induces the AID expression in the large intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) during CAC development. AID gene and protein expression was increased in the IECs of AOM-DSS- or DSS-treated Tg mice compared with those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, we confirmed IL-21 induced AID gene expression in the purified IECs ex vivo. The present study also showed IL-21R gene expression in unstimulated wild-type mouse IECs, and this gene expression was augmented by TNF-α stimulation. The IL-21R expression and IL-21-induced AID gene activation were further confirmed in the Colon-38 cell line. Taken together, IL-21 may be involved in increasing the risk of CAC by enhancing the AID expression in IECs.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657630>Intestinal epithelial deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 alters expression of  mediators and barrier function.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are important hormones involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic functions. GCs are also widely used in anti-/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of , but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/ changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented  signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term. Future studies are required to assess the impact of  deletion in other conditions such as experimental colitis.-Aranda, C. J., Arredondo-Amador, M., Ocón, ., Lavín, J. L., Aransay, A.

Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with  are lacking.In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe ] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52.A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.5%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 15.0; P = 0.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3 to 18.5; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and 2.2 events per 100 patient-years.In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

While the genotoxic function of PMNs and its implications in carcinogenesis have been primarily associated with oxidative stress, recent work by Butin-Israeli and colleagues has defined a novel mechanism where PMN-derived microparticles through the delivery and activity of specific miRNAs promoted formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), and in parallel, suppressed DSB repair through the downregulation of lamin B1 and Rad51. Respective downregulation of these two proteins compromised the nuclear envelope and high-fidelity repair by homologous recombination, increasing DSB accumulation and aneuploidy.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial barrier was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and  factors in Caco-2 cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco-2 cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable. Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 upregulated NF-κ and pro- factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and downregulated ZO-1, occludin and anti- factor IL-10.Hsa-miR-375 is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD by upregulating TLR4 and inducing NF-κ activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203691>Endoscopic follow-up and therapeutic attitude after ileocolonic resection in a nationwide Spanish cohort of Crohn's  patients: the Practicrohn study.</a></h2><p>: In patients with Crohn's  (CD), endoscopic recurrence precedes clinical recurrence after ileocolonic resection.

The most implicated gene is HLA-DRB1, with HLA-DRB1*03:01 the most associated risk allele in both Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. Elucidating precise  associations is challenging due to high linkage disequilibrium between HLA genotypes.

This study sought to investigate the effect of corticosteroid use on hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among Taiwanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or  (IBD).  This was a retrospective cohort study using adults in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research database receiving a new diagnosis of AS ( = 40,747) or IBD ( = 4290) between January 2002 and June 2013. Our main outcome measure was odds of preventable hospitalization for eight ambulatory care-sensitive conditions defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  In the first quarter (three months) following diagnosis, corticosteroid usage was common among patients with AS and IBD (18.5% and 30%, respectively). For every 100 mg increase in corticosteroid dose per quarter, adjusted odds of preventable hospitalization in the following quarter increased by 5.5% for patients with AS (aOR = 1.055, 95% CI 1.037-1.074) and 6.4% for those with IBD (aOR = 1.064, 95% CI 1.046-1.082).  Relatively low doses of corticosteroids significantly increase AS and IBD patients' short-term odds of hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. As recommended by current clinical guidelines, physicians should use corticosteroids sparingly in these populations, and prioritize initiation/escalation of -modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for long-term management. If corticosteroids cannot be avoided, patients may require monitoring and/or prophylaxis for corticosteroid-associated comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) which can result in preventable hospitalizations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294728>Rate of Corticosteroid-Induced Mood Changes in Patients with : A Prospective Study.</a></h2><p>Corticosteroid is an effective therapeutic option for  flares, but its adverse effects may compromise treatment adherence and reduce patients' quality of life. There is lack of data on the incidence of corticosteroid-induced mood changes in this patient population, which may be underappreciated by healthcare providers in clinical practice and interfere with optimal care. This study aimed to determine the rate of mood changes in this patient population.In this prospective observational study, adult outpatients treated with prednisone for  flares were considered for inclusion. Participants completed validated questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory-II and Activation Subscale of Internal State Scale version two) before starting prednisone, after two weeks of prednisone, and at the end of prednisone taper to assess for mood changes. Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index were used to monitor clinical  activity.Fifty-three subjects were included in the analyses. The rate of mood change after two weeks of prednisone was 49.1%, primarily driven by increase in mood towards (hypo)mania. Younger age was an independent risk factor. Mood state returned to pretreatment level at the end of treatment. There was no correlation between clinical  activity change and mood change.Oral prednisone for  flare is associated with high rate of mood change. As prednisone is a critical part of induction therapy, ways to minimize this adverse event must be studied. For now, healthcare providers should inform patients and monitor closely for this adverse event.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665283>Deficient Resident Memory T-Cell and Cd8 T-Cell Response to Commensals in .</a></h2><p>Aims: The intestinal microbiota is closely associated with resident memory lymphocytes in mucosal tissue. We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus  (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent -cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated  and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165225>Oral delivery of a Lactococcus lactis strain secreting bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin alleviates the development of acute colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing . Treatment of UC would benefit from specific targeting of therapeutics to the intestine. Previous studies have demonstrated that bovine lactoferricin and lactoferrampin have bactericidal, anti-, and immunomodulatory effects. Here, we investigated whether oral administration of a bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin (LFCA)-encoding Lactococcus lactis (LL-LFCA) strain could alleviate experimental colitis. LFCA derived from LL-LFCA inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. In mice, administration of LL-LFCA decreased the  activity index and attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss and colon shortening. LL-LFCA treatment also ameliorated DSS-induced colon damage, inhibited  cell infiltration, significantly decreased myeloperoxidase activity, and ameliorated DSS-induced disruption of intestinal permeability and tight junctions. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that LL-LFCA reversed DSS-induced gut dysbiosis. The production of proinflammatory mediators in serum and the colon was also reduced by administration of LL-LFCA. In vitro, LFCA derived from LL-LFCA decreased the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory factors. The underlying mechanisms may involve inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) pathway. The results demonstrate that LL-LFCA ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal injury in mice, suggesting that LL-LFCA might be an effective drug for the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638351>Biotin: overview of the treatment of  of cutaneous appendages and of hyperseborrhea.</a></h2><p>One of the most common micronutrient deficiencies with cutaneous findings is the vitamin , also known as biotin, deficiency. Biotin deficiency may be due to congenital lack of biotinidase, or acquired following some conditions that interfere with its absorption, such as   disorders, a diet too rich in avidin, magnesium deficiency, smoking habit and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticonvulsants and sulfonamides. This review highlights the role of biotin in the most common skin disorders such associated with biotin deficiency and an approach to their treatment. Biotin administration may improve the treatment of hair loss when deficiency is detected on the basis of a careful patient history, clinical examination and the determination of serum biotin levels. The use of biotin is rationale in seborrheic dermatitis as the vitamin intercepts the main metabolic pathways underlying the pathogenesis of the . Treatment with biotin could also be useful in comedonal acne characterized by a high rate of seborrhea, and may be helpful for acne treated with topical retinoids, contributing to the control of flaking and irritation. The tolerability of biotin is excellent and there is no risk of hypervitaminosis even in the case of high doses. It is important that administration is controlled by physicians and follows a medical diagnosis and prescription.

Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti- effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro- mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent  gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing  cell infiltration, restoring tight junction (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κ, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced  responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κ, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203722>Dynamic immunoglobulin responses to gut bacteria during .</a></h2><p>Aberrant immune responses against gut microbiota are thought to be key drivers of  (IBD) pathogenesis. However, the extent and targets of immunoglobulin (Ig) A versus IgG responses to gut bacteria in IBD and its association with IBD severity is not well understood. Here, we address this by analyzing fecal samples from Crohn's  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Non-IBD patients by flow cytometry for the frequency of bacteria that were endogenously bound with IgA and/or IgG. Assessment of IBD patients from two geographically distinct cohorts revealed increased percentages of IgA- and IgG-bound fecal bacteria compared to non-IBD controls. Notably, the two major subsets of IBD showed distinct patterns of Ig-bound bacteria, with CD activity associated with increases in both IgA and IgG-bound bacteria, whereas UC activity correlated only with increases in IgG-bound bacteria. Analysis of the flow sorted Ig-bound bacterial repertoire by 16S rDNA sequencing revealed taxa that were Ig-bound specifically in IBD. Notably, this included bacteria that are also thought to reside in the oral pharynx, including , and  species. These data show that the pattern of IgA and IgG binding to fecal bacteria is distinct in UC and CD. In addition, the frequency of Ig-bound fecal bacteria may have potential as a non-invasive biomarker for  activity. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that immune responses to oral pharyngeal bacteria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481750>Small heat shock protein CRYAB inhibits intestinal mucosal  responses and protects barrier integrity through suppressing IKKβ activity.</a></h2><p>Alpha -crystallin (CRYAB) is an important member of the small heat shock protein family, and plays a protective and therapeutic role in neurological inflammation. CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with  (IBD) and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti- effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal barrier integrity.

The group of glyprolines includes Gly-Pro (GP), Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP), cyclic Gly-Pro (cGP), as well as PGP derivatives, for example, N-acetylated PGP (N-a-PGP) and N-methylated PGP (N-m-PGP). PCPs are engaged in various biological processes including the proinflammatory neutrophil chemoattraction in lung ,  or ischemic stroke. Glyprolines have been also postulated to play an important role as atheroprotective and anticoagulant agents, exhibit neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's , as well as regulate insulin-like growth factor (IGF) homeostasis. It was also noticed that PCPs inhibit proliferation and migration of keratinocytes in wound healing, protection of the gastric mucosa and stimulation of its regeneration. The regulatory glyprolines are derived from endogenous and exogenous sources. Most PCPs are derived from collagen or diet protein degradation. Recently, great interest is concentrated on short proline-rich oligopeptides derived from IGF-1 degradation. The mechanism of PCPs biological activity is not fully explained. It involves receptor-mediated mechanisms, for example, N-a-PGP acts as CXCR1/2 receptor ligand, whereas cGP regulates IGF-1 bioavailability by modifying the IGF-1 binding to the IGF-1 binding protein-3. PGP has been observed to interact with collagen-specific receptors. The data suggest a promising role of PGP as a target of various  therapy.

Conventional ligand-binding ATI-assays detect only free-form of ATI, potentially increasing the proportion of patients with undetectable ATI, but with adequate trough infliximab (TRI) level who experience loss of response (LOR) to infliximab. We investigated this assertion using a novel ATI-Cim assay.An ATI-Cim assay was developed by utilizing a C1q-immobilized plate, detecting free-form and ATI-infliximab complexes. Plasma ATI in 137 consecutive IBD patients, 56 with sustained clinical response (SCR), 76 with LOR and 5 with infusion reactions was measured.ATI levels reached a plateau following addition of up to 25 μg/mL infliximab to different concentrations of free-form ATI. ATI concentration did not significantly change during infliximab infusion (P = 0.4316). ATI concentration > 0.153 μg/mL was associated with LOR (odds ratio 3.0: 95%, confidence interval 1.5 to 6.1, P = 0.0029). The number of patients with undetectable ATI was higher in SCR than in LOR, 53.6% vs 22.4% (P = 0.0004). Patients with SCR and LOR were divided into 4 subgroups by combined cut-off ATI and TRI values.

We retrospectively analyzed patients with IBD diagnosed at our hospital between January 2000 and September 2018. The diagnostic criteria were based on endoscopic and pathologic findings. Clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. A total of 190 patients with IBD were enrolled (80 with Crohn's  (CD) and 110 with ulcerative colitis (UC)). The mean age at diagnosis was 38.4 years (CD: 36 years, UC: 40 years). Male patients accounted for the majority of patients (71.1%). The male-to-female ratio was 3 : 1 for CD and 2.1 : 1 for UC. Current and ever smokers accounted for 30.5% of all patients. Only 4.2% of patients had a family history of IBD. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) were reported in 7.9%, and colorectal cancers (CRCs) were reported in 2.1% of all patients.

It may confer a worse prognosis in colorectal cancer, but its importance in pT2N0 colorectal cancer is unknown. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of tumour budding in pT2N0 colorectal cancer.This was a retrospective cohort study with prospective assessment of tumour budding by 2 pathologists. We included all patients who underwent elective curative resection for pT2N0 colorectal cancer except those with hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes,  or positive resection margins, those who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and those who died within 90 days of operation. Patients were classified as having high-grade tumour budding (≥ 10 budding foci per high-power field) or low-grade tumour budding (< 9 budding foci per high-power field). The main outcome measure was locoregional or distant recurrence.Of 85 patients, 36 had high-grade tumour budding and 49 had low-grade tumour budding. The overall recurrence rate was 11% (9/85) and median follow-up was 41.0 months (interquartile range 22.0–68.0). Interrater reliability for tumour budding assessment was excellent (κ = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.96). There were more recurrences in patients with high-grade tumour budding (7/36, 19.4% v. 2/49, 4.1%; p = 0.020). On multivariate analysis, after we adjusted for confounders, the presence of high-grade tumour budding was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 5.11, 95% CI 1.01–25.9).Tumour budding was independently associated with increased recurrence after pT2N0 colorectal cancer resection.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an  (IBD) associated with an increased baseline risk for colon cancer compared with the general population, and this risk is mostly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This risk increases along with the duration of the , as demonstrated by many studies. There are no UTR expression data related to UC, and we therefore evaluated UTR expression in ill colon biopsies and in healthy colon ones of patients with UC and colon biopsies of healthy patients.We enrolled, prior to informed consent, 11 patients (5 males and 6 females, age range 29-75 years, median age 52 years) with first UC diagnosis compared to 11 healthy controls (6 males and 5 females, age range 30-78 years, median age 55 years). We have therefore sampled  and healthy tissue in UC patients. We have also taken colic tissue samples in healthy subjects. Evaluation of receptor expression was performed by RT-PCR, Western Blot analysis. The ANOVA test (p <0.05) was used for statistical analysis.We found a) increased expression of UTR in 11/11 UC patients with ill mucosa biopsies compared to healthy controls in RT-PCR and in Western Blot analysis; ) increased UTR expression in 11/11 UC patients with ill colon biopsies compared to the results obtained from healthy colon biopsies of the same patients both in RT-PCR and in Western Blot analysis; c) increased UTR expression in 9/11 UC patients healthy colon biopsy specimens compared to healthy controls.UTR could be considered as an  UC  marker because its expression is greater in the mucosa of ill colon than in the healthy colon of the same patients and compared to healthy controls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249629>Differential genetic and functional background in  phenotypes of a Greek population: a systems bioinformatics approach.</a></h2><p>Crohn's  (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two main entities of  (IBD). Previous works have identified more than 200 risk factors (including loci and signaling pathways) in populations of predominantly European ancestry. Our study was conducted on an extended population-specific cohort of 573 Greek IBD patients (364 CD and 209 UC) and 445 controls.To highlight the different genetic and functional background of IBD and its phenotypes, utilizing contemporary systems bioinformatics methodologies.-associated SNPs, obtained via our own 89 loci IBD risk GWAS panel, were detected with the whole genome association analysis toolset PLINK. These SNPs were used as input for 2 novel and different pathway analysis methods to detect functional interactions. Specifically, PathwayConnector was used to create complementary networks of interacting pathways whereas; the online database of protein interactions STRING provided protein-protein association networks and their derived pathways. Network analyses metrics were employed to identify proteins with high significance and subsequently to rank the signaling pathways those participate in.The reported complementary pathway and enriched protein-protein association networks reveal several novel and well-known key players, in the functional background of IBD like Toll-like receptor, TNF, Jak-STAT, PI3K-Akt, T cell receptor, Apoptosis, MAPK and  cell receptor signaling pathways. IBD subphenotypes are found to have distinct genetic and functional profiles which can contribute to their accurate identification and classification. As a secondary result we identify an extended network of  with common molecular background to IBD.IBD's burden on the quality of life of patients and intricate functional background presents us constantly with new challenges. Our data and methodology provide researchers with new insights to a specific population, but also, to possible differentiation markers of  classification and progression. This work, not only provides new insights into the interplay among IBD risk variants and their related signaling pathways, elucidates the mechanisms underlying IBD and its clinical sequelae, but also, introduces a generalized bioinformatics-based methodology which can be applied to studies of different disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435787>Anti- Substances in Wheat Malt Inducing Antisecretory Factor.</a></h2><p>Extensively malted cereals counteract enterotoxic diarrhea and . This effect depends on a protein called antisecretory factor (AF), which is secreted into the blood as a larger complex known as the compleasome. In this study, we identified anti- substances in malt and assayed their capacity to induce AF. Guaiacol and quercetin inhibited inflammation in a mouse footpad model, while catechin, sinapic acid, ferulic acid, and quercetin inhibited nitric oxide formation in RAW 264.7 cells. The proteasome activity in these cells was inhibited by vanillic acid and quercetin but not by the other tested phenols. As the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) might be involved in AF induction, the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine was tested and shown to inhibit inflammation in mouse paw and nitric oxide formation. Catechin, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid induced AF in rat blood, and these substances were all increased in malt compared to control wheat. These phenols might therefore be of particular importance for the beneficial effect of malted cereals on  . Our results further suggest that TRPV1 might play a role in the anti- activity of phenols via the induction of AF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084224>Autoinflammatory  with focus on NOD2-associated  in the era of genomic medicine.</a></h2><p>Systemic autoinflammatory  (SAIDs) represent a spectrum of genetically heterogeneous  disorders.

These cells are possible therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders, since they present remarkable immunomodulatory ability.The increase of immune-mediated  in veterinary medicine has led to a growing interest in the research of these disorders and their medical treatment. Conventional immunomodulatory drug therapy such as glucocorticoids or other novel therapies such as cyclosporine or monoclonal antibodies are associated with numerous side effects that limit its long-term use, leading to the need for developing new therapeutic strategies that can be more effective and safe.The aim of this review is to provide a critical overview about the therapeutic potential of these cells in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders (canine atopic dermatitis, feline chronic gingivostomatitis,  and feline asthma) compared with their conventional treatment.Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy in autoimmune  has been showing that this approach can ameliorate clinical signs or even cause remission in most animals, with the exception of canine atopic dermatitis in which little to no improvement was observed.Although mesenchymal stem cells present a promising future in the treatment of most of these disorders, the variability in the outcomes of some clinical trials has led to the current controversy among authors regarding their efficacy.

Nevertheless, some patients exhibit primary nonresponse (PNR) or secondary loss of response (SLR) to biologics. : This collaborative review provides data on the role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in IMID for optimizing biologic therapy including infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol etanercept and golimumab vedolizumab, secukinumab and ustekinumab. : Most exposure-response relationship studies show a positive correlation between biologic drug concentrations and favorable therapeutic outcomes in IMID with higher drug concentrations typically associated with more objective outcomes. Clinically, reactive TDM rationalizes the management of PNR and SLR to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and is emerging as the new standard of care in IBD as it is also more cost-effective than empiric dose escalation. Preliminary data suggest that proactive TDM with the goal to achieve a threshold drug concentration is associated with better therapeutic outcomes when compared to empiric drug optimization and/or reactive TDM of infliximab and adalimumab in IBD. However, more data from well-designed prospective studies are needed to prove the benefit of TDM-based algorithms in real life clinical practice in IMID.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131860>Expression Profiling of  and Immunological Genes in Collagenous Colitis.</a></h2><p>Collagenous colitis [CC] is a common idiopathic cause of chronic watery diarrhoea.

PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder for which there is no established medical therapy. Preclinical data suggest curcumin may have a beneficial effect in PSC.  Subjects with PSC and a serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) received curcumin 750 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks in an open-label pilot study. The primary composite endpoint was proportion of subjects who had a reduction of SAP to less than 1.5 times ULN or a 40% reduction in SAP between baseline and week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, Mayo PSC risk score and self-reported health questionnaires.  Two-hundred and fifty-eight patients with PSC were screened and 15 subjects were enrolled and all completed 12 weeks of therapy. The most common reason for subject exclusion was SAP less than 1.5 times the ULN ( = 98). Curcumin did not result in a significant median (interquartile range) change in SAP times the ULN [3.43 (2.10-4.32) to 2.46 (1.89-4.41),  = .36], and only 20% (3/15) subjects achieved the primary endpoint. Similarly, there was no significant change in the secondary endpoints. There were no serious adverse events reported.  While curcumin was well tolerated, it was not associated with significant improvements in cholestasis or symptoms. Moreover, this study also illustrates that a low SAP is common among those with PSC.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of Sb on intestinal mucosal barrier and intestinal flora in a colitis mouse model.Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control group (A), pathologic control group (), Sb treatment group (C), mesalazine treatment group (D), and Sb combined with mesalazine treatment group (E). Colitis was induced by the addition of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water ad libitum for 7 days. The general condition, weight change, stool property, and bloody stool level of mice were observed to evaluate the  activity index. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in intestinal tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The feces and intestinal contents were collected sterilely, and intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Compared with group , Sb reduced the  activity index and histological score of group C ( activity index: group  2.708 ± 0.628, group C 1.542 ± 0.616, PBC = 0.005; histological score: group  9.875 ± 3.271, group C 4.750 ± 1.832, PBC = 0.005) in DSS-induced colitis in mice. Sb exerted a protect effect on the expression of ZO-1 (group  2.075 ± 1.176, group C 4.225 ± 1.316, PBC = 0.019) and occludin (group  2.200 ± 0.968, group C 3.525 ± 1.047, PBC = 0.023).

Treatment with Sb preserved the tight junctions and ameliorated microvilli and inter-cellular space. Treatment with Sb also showed its own characteristics: a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes and a lower percentage of Firmicutes, with significant differences or a significant trend. The proportion of the S24-7 family was increased significantly in the Sb treatment group.Sb shows an anti- effect and has a protective effect on the intestinal mucosal mechanical barrier.

CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death.  (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, and flavonoids, and it has shown anti- property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice ( = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea,  activity index (DAI), spleen weight ( < 0.001), and the number of tumors ( < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length ( < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-к/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κ/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063937>Regulation of CD11b by HIF-1α and the STAT3 signaling pathway contributes to the immunosuppressive function of  cells in .</a></h2><p> cells have been reported to have a suppressive function in autoimmune , which appears to require an increase of CD11b expression on  cells. However, little is known how CD11b is induced in  cells to play the function. In this study, we found that the high expression of CD11b in  cells occurred not only in the mucosal immune organs, but also in systemically immune organs such as the spleen during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Since the  lesions in mouse models of  (IBD) were revealed to be significantly hypoxic or even anoxic, the  cells from colitic mice Peyer's patches (PP) were investigated to express higher levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) than naïve  cells from wildtype (WT) mice. HIF-1α siRNA transfection or HIF-1α protein inhibition led to decreased CD11b expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in vitro.  cells with HIF-1α specific knockdown were then adoptively transferred to Rag-1 mice. The result displayed that CD11b expression was decreased in  cells and an exacerbated colitis occurred. The bio-informatics promoter analysis and ChIP assay showed that HIF-1α was the critical transcription factor for CD11b and cooperatively formed a complex with the p-STAT3 homodimers to bind onto hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) regions, which was guaranteed by MEK/ERK pathway activation and IL-10 secretion. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the key function of the hypoxia-associated transcription factor HIF-1α together with p-STAT3 in driving CD11b transcription in  cells and controlling  cell's protective activity in experimental  (IBD).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, intestinal inflammation increases the risk of enteric cancer, which is a common malignancy globally. Native anti- peptides are a class of anti- agents that could be used in the treatment of several intestinal inflammation conditions. However, potential cytotoxicity, and poor anti- activity have prevented their development as anti- agents. Therefore, in this study, we designed and developed a novel hybrid peptide for the treatment of intestinal inflammation. Eight hybrid peptides were designed by combining the active centers of antimicrobial peptides, including LL-37 (13-36), YW12D, innate defense regulator 1, and cathelicidin 2 (1-13) with thymopentin or the active center of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) (17-24). The hybrid peptide, LL-37-Tα1 (LTA), had improved anti- activity with minimal cytotoxicity. LTA was screened by molecule docking and  experiments. Likewise, its anti- effects and mechanisms were also evaluated using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal inflammation murine model. The results showed that LTA prevented LPS-induced impairment in the jejunum epithelium tissues and infiltration of leukocytes, which are both histological markers of inflammation. Additionally, LTA decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. LTA increased the expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin, and reduced permeability and apoptosis in the jejunum of LPS-treated mice. Additionally, its anti- effect is associated with neutralizing LPS, binding to the Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor 2 (TLR4/MD-2) complex, and modulating the nuclear factor-kappa  signal transduction pathway. The findings of this study suggest that LTA may be an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460574>IMMUNIZATION STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH .</a></h2><p>Treatment for  (IBD) includes a variety of immunosuppressants and biological agents, which increase the risk of infections due to altered cellular and humoral immunity.

The vaccines with the largest rates of patients declaring to have taken it are inactivated influenza vaccine (72.4%), BCG (55.3%), hepatitis  (48.3%), measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (43.8%) and DTaP (43%). The vaccines with the lowest rates of patients declaring to have taken it are Haemophilus influenza type  (0.8%), herpes zoster (2.1%) and HPV (3.4%). Patients that are being treated or have been treated with biological therapy have the largest immunization coverage for inactivated influenza vaccine (81%) and PPSV23 (25.9%), also they have the largest awareness rates for those vaccines.Although being a specialized service linked to a university hospital, vaccination coverage and patients' awareness rates proved to be below the desirable level. Vaccination and recovery of the immunization history is recommended immediately after the diagnosis of IBD, regardless of the use of biological agents.

Three main histological subtypes of LP have been recognized: type A (histiocytic), type  (mycosis fungoides-like), and type C (anaplastic large cell lymphoma-like). Recently, new histologic LP variants classified as type D (CD8-positive, cytotoxic form) and type E (angioinvasive form) have also been described. The etiology of LP has not been determined to date (2-4). Herein we report a case of LP type  evolving in a patient with Crohn's  after treatment with infliximab and adalimumab. A 38-year-old man suffering from terminal ileitis form of luminar Crohn's  for 10 years presented at our department. During the last 10 years, the patient had been treated with a number of conventional -modifying anti- drugs including non-steroid anti- drugs, mesalazine, and immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids and azathioprine. As the  was not sufficiently controlled, TNF-α inhibitor therapy was initiated. Infliximab was administered in standard dosage (5 mg/kg body weight every 8 weeks after the induction period) for one year. Concomitant therapy with azathioprine was established to reduce the risk of adverse immunological reactions. Since the patient showed only partial clinical response, infliximab was switched to adalimumab (40 mg biweekly), resulting in notable improvement. 18 months after the initiation of adalimumab treatment, asymptomatic, small, red to brown papules developed on the extremities. Multiple lesions were observed, initially on the legs, but the symptoms rapidly progressed to the arms and trunk (Figure 1). An acquired ichthyosis further complicated the  course by extended, extremely xerotic, scaling skin lesions. Neither systemic symptoms nor significant lymphadenopathy was observed. The clinical picture suggested either ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides or a coincidence of LP and acquired ichthyosis. The histology of a typical papule showed perivascular and periadnexal lymphoid infiltration with massive hemorrhage in the dermis. The infiltration was dense, composed of small-to-medium-sized lymphoid cells showing focal significant epidermotropism (Figure 2). Most observed epidermal lymphocytes were CD3+, CD4+, and CD30+, while the dermal infiltration had higher CD4 and lower CD30 expression (10-15%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of skin and peripheral blood samples did not show clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor gamma (TcRgamma) genes. Normal phenotypes of lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides was excluded since histology of ichthyosiform skin lesions showed only hyperkeratosis with a reduced granular layer. While the cutaneous CD4+ epidermotropic infiltrate was suspicious of either mycosis fungoides or LP type , the complexity of clinicopathological data confirmed the diagnosis of LP type . The peripheral blood counts, serum biochemical tests, and urinalysis were within normal range, while the elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of IgG and IgA subclasses indicated the activity of Crohn's . Adalimumab and azathioprine were discontinued, and oral budesonide therapy was started in combination with topical corticosteroids and PUVA phototherapy. The skin lesions resolved with hyperpigmentation, and there was no relapse during the twelve-month follow-up. Recent data suggest that LP occurs more commonly in immunocompromised patients, especially in those with solid organ or bone marrow transplants (3). Though TNF-α inhibitors have dramatically advanced the treatment of various , the risk of lymphoma associated with their use remains controversial (5). Several cases of cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders associated with TNF-α inhibitor treatment have been reported, including two patients with LP (6). One of the two patients with LP received infliximab for Crohn's  (7), while the other one had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and received adalimumab (8). Our case is the third report on LP developing under TNF-α inhibitor therapy and the first LP type  in a patient with Crohn's  treated with infliximab and later with adalimumab. A further interesting aspect of our case is that it also represents an example of the known association of acquired ichthyosis with  (9). Multidisciplinary management was needed to provide optimal care and  outcome for our patient. Since it is usually difficult to prove causality in most of such cases, it is important to collect similar clinical observations.

Typically, emerging adults are subsumed into the category of adults even though emerging adults have unique developmental needs. In this descriptive study of IBD in emerging adults, the aims were to (a) determine the prevalence of symptoms; () describe the severity of symptoms and their interference with daily activities; and (c) examine the association between individual symptom severity and presence of fatigue. Emerging adults with IBD were recruited using web-based convenience sampling. Sixty-one individuals met the inclusion criteria. They had a mean age of 24.7 and a  duration of 6.4 years. The most prevalent symptoms reported were: fatigue (n = 44, 72.1%), abdominal cramps (n = 39, 63.9%), abdominal pain (n = 39, 63.9%), and diarrhea (n = 38, 62.3%). The symptom with the greatest severity and interference with daily activities was fatigue. Abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, diarrhea, passing gas, and abdominal tenderness were associated with fatigue when controlling for age, emerging adulthood, gender, time since diagnosis, and current steroid use. Among emerging adults with IBD, fatigue is the most prevalent symptom and is the symptom with the greatest severity and interference with daily activities. These results suggest a need for interventions aimed at reducing both fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms among emerging adults with IBD.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179826>Dietary iron variably modulates assembly of the intestinal microbiota in colitis-resistant and colitis-susceptible mice.</a></h2><p>Iron deficiency, a common comorbidity of gastrointestinal  disorders such as  (IBD), is often treated with oral iron supplementation. However, the safety of oral iron supplementation remains controversial because of its association with exacerbated  activity in a subset of IBD patients. Because iron modulates bacterial growth and function, one possible mechanism by which iron may exacerbate inflammation in susceptible hosts is by modulating the intestinal microbiota. We, therefore, investigated the impact of dietary iron on the intestinal microbiota, utilizing the conventionalization of germ-free mice as a model of a microbial community in compositional flux to recapitulate the instability of the IBD-associated intestinal microbiota. Our findings demonstrate that altering intestinal iron availability during community assembly modulated the microbiota in non-inflamed wild type (WT) and colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient () mice. Depletion of luminal iron availability promoted luminal compositional changes associated with dysbiotic states irrespective of host genotype, including an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae such as . Mechanistic  growth competitions confirmed that high-affinity iron acquisition systems in  enhance its abundance over other bacteria in iron-restricted conditions, thereby enabling pathobiont iron scavenging during dietary iron restriction. In contrast, distinct luminal community assembly was observed with dietary iron supplementation in WT versus  mice, suggesting that the effects of increased iron on the microbiota differ with host inflammation status. Taken together, shifts in dietary iron intake during community assembly modulate the ecological structure of the intestinal microbiota and is dependent on host genotype and inflammation status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322440>Anti-TNF biosimilars in Crohn's : a patient-centric interdisciplinary approach.</a></h2><p>: The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of biosimilars in early treatment in IBD and introduce ways to facilitate a patient-centric switching process through multidisciplinary approach. : We summarize existing scientific literature related to the role of biosimilars in  in terms of early treatment and cost-saving and implementing switching process. : Use of anti-TNF biosimilars in patients has the potential for large drug-acquisition cost-saving, which can be reinvested into early treatment.

Development of anti-fibrotic agents will require testing in randomized controlled trials. Computed tomography enterography- and magnetic resonance enterography-based technologies might be used to measure outcomes in these trials. These approaches have been validated in studies of patients with symptomatic strictures who underwent imaging evaluations, followed by resection with histopathologic grading of the intestinal tissue for inflammation and/or fibrosis (the reference standard). Imaging findings have correlated with findings from quantitative or semi-quantitative histologic evaluation of the degree of fibromuscular stenosis and/or inflammation on the resection specimen. However, it is not clear whether histologic findings are an accurate reference standard. We performed a systematic review of all published histologic scoring systems used to assess stenosing CD.We performed a comprehensive search of the Embase and Medline of studies through March 13, 2019 that used a histologic scoring system to characterize small  CD and assessed  and fibrotic alterations within the same adult subject. All scores fitting the criteria were included in our analysis, independently of the presence of stricturing , as long as inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated separately but in the same scoring system.We observed substantial heterogeneity among scoring systems, which were not derived using modern principles for evaluative index development. None had undergone formal validity or reliability testing. None of the existing indices had been constructed according to accepted methods for development of evaluative indices. Basic knowledge regarding their operating properties were lacking. Specific indices to evaluate the important pathological component of myofibroblast hypertrophy or hyperplasia have not been proposed.In a systematic review of publications, we found a lack of validated histopathologic scoring systems for assessment of fibromuscular stenosis. Data that describe the operating properties of existing cross-sectional imaging techniques for stenosing CD should be questioned.

In this review, we focus on methanogenic Archaea, which rely on hydrogen for their metabolism and growth. On one hand, methanogenic Archaea in the gut are functional associates of the fermentative digestion of dietary fibers, favoring the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids and likely contributing to the weaning reaction during the neonatal window of opportunity. On the other hand, methanogenic Archaea trigger the activation of innate and adaptive responses and the generation of specific T and  cells in animals and humans. In mouse models, lung hypersensitivity reactions can be induced by inhaled methanogenic Archaea mimicking human professional exposure to organic dust. Changes in methanogenic Archaea of the microbiota are detected in an array of dysimmune conditions comprising , obesity, malnutrition, anorexia, colorectal cancer, and diverticulosis. At the subcellular level, methanogenic Archaea are activators of the TLR8-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome, modulate the release of antimicrobial peptides and drive the production of proinflammatory, Th-1, Th-2, and Th-17 cytokines. Our objective was to introduce the most recent and major pieces of evidence supporting the involvement of Archaea in the balance between health and dysimmune , with a particular focus on atopic and allergic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367246>Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Treated Regulatory CD23CD43  Cells Alleviate Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to ameliorate  by their actions on multiple immune cells, especially on regulatory  cells (Breg cells). However, the phenotypes and functions of human MSCs (hMSCs)-treated Breg cell subsets are not yet clear.  Purified  cells were cocultured with MSCs and the phenotypes and immunomodulatory functions of the  cells were analyzed by FACS and proliferation assays . Also, a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced mouse colitis model was employed to detect the function of MSC-treated Breg cells .  We demonstrated that coculturing with hMSCs significantly enhanced the immunomodulatory activity of  cells by up-regulating IL-10 expression. We then identified that a novel regulatory  cell population characterized by CD23 and CD43 phenotypic markers could be induced by hMSCs. The CD23CD43 Breg cells substantially inhibited the  cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells through an IL-10-dependent pathway. More significantly, intraperitoneal injection of hMSCs ameliorated the clinical and histopathological severity in the mouse experimental colitis model, accompanied by an increase in the number of CD23CD43 Breg cells. The adoptive transfer of CD23CD43  cells effectively alleviated murine colitis, as compared with the CD23CD43  cells. Treatment with CD23CD43  cells, and not hMSCs, substantially improved the symptoms of colitis in  cell-depleted mice.  the novel CD23CD43 Breg cell subset appears to be involved in the immunomodulatory function of hMSCs and sheds new light on elucidating the therapeutic mechanism of hMSCs for the treatment of inflammation-related .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294641>Number needed to treat and cost per remitter for biologic treatments of Crohn's  in Japan.</a></h2><p> Adalimumab, infliximab, and ustekinumab have been approved for patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's  in Japan. This study compared the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab, infliximab, and ustekinumab in patients with Crohn's  based on data from randomized controlled trials.  Data were extracted from four phase 3 clinical trials: CHARM, , ACCENT I, and IM-UNITI. A network meta-analysis (NMA) compared 1-year clinical remission rates in patients who responded to treatment during an induction phase. Remission was defined as a Crohn's  Activity Index score <150. The number needed to treat (NNT) was defined as the inverse of the risk reduction (compared with placebo) estimated from the NMA among initial responders. Cost per incremental remitter was calculated based on the projected per patient drug cost (2018 Japanese Yen [¥]) and the NNT.  Among initial responders, the remission rates were 45.2%, 31.9%, 27.4%, 24.1%, and 15.6% for adalimumab 40 mg every other week (EOW), infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, ustekinumab 90 mg every 8 weeks, ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 weeks, and placebo, respectively. The NNT was the lowest for adalimumab 40 mg EOW. Compared with adalimumab, the incremental cost per remitter was numerically higher for infliximab (¥5,375,470) and statistically higher for ustekinumab 90 mg every 8 weeks and ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 weeks (¥42,788,597 and ¥41,495,543, respectively).  Indirect comparisons are limited by the availability of suitable clinical evidence and there may be residual heterogeneity that could not be adjusted for.

Both , exhibit heterogeneity underscored by the variable clinical responses to therapeutic interventions. We aimed to identify -driving pathways and classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their pathobiology and response to treatment. We applied hierarchical clustering of enrichment scores derived from gene set variation analysis of signatures representative of various immunological processes and activated cell types, to a colonic biopsy dataset that included healthy volunteers, Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis patients. Patient stratification at baseline or after anti-TNF treatment in clinical responders and non-responders was queried. Signatures with significantly different enrichment scores were identified using a general linear model. Comparisons to healthy controls were made at baseline in all participants and then separately in responders and non-responders. Fifty-nine percent of the signatures were commonly enriched in both conditions at baseline, supporting the notion of a  continuum within ulcerative colitis and Crohn's . Signatures included T cells, macrophages, neutrophil activation and poly:IC signatures, representing acute inflammation and a complex mix of potential -driving biology. Collectively, identification of significantly enriched signatures allowed establishment of an  molecular activity score which uses biopsy transcriptomics as a surrogate marker to accurately track  severity. This score separated diseased from healthy samples, enabled discrimination of clinical responders and non-responders at baseline with 100% specificity and 78.8% sensitivity, and was validated in an independent data set that showed comparable classification. Comparing responders and non-responders separately at baseline to controls, 43% and 70% of signatures were enriched, respectively, suggesting greater molecular dysregulation in TNF non-responders at baseline. This methodological approach could facilitate better targeted design of clinical studies to test therapeutics, concentrating on patient subsets sharing similar underlying pathobiology, therefore increasing the likelihood of clinical response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31012338>Evaluation of fatigue in  - a useful tool in daily practice.</a></h2><p> Fatigue is a common symptom reported in  (IBD) patients.

In addition, PKC-β also phosphorylates p38 to inactivate NFAT1 and reduce NFAT1-NF-κ synergy to promote the Fasinduced T9 transcription program. Fas ligation exacerbates  by increasing T9 cell differentiation, and promotes antitumor activity in p38 inhibitor-treated T9 cells. Furthermore, low-dose p38 inhibitor suppresses tumor growth without inducing systemic adverse effects. In patients with tumor, relatively high T9 cell numbers are associated with good prognosis. Our study thus implicates Fas in CD4 T cells as a target for  therapy. Furthermore, simultaneous Fas ligation and low-dose p38 inhibition may be an effective approach for T9 cell induction and cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478909>Targeting innate immunity for tuberculosis vaccination.</a></h2><p>Vaccine development against tuberculosis (TB) is based on the induction of adaptive immune responses endowed with long-term memory against mycobacterial antigens. Memory  and T cells initiate a rapid and robust immune response upon encounter with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, thus achieving long-lasting protection against infection. Recent studies have shown, however, that innate immune cell populations such as myeloid cells and NK cells also undergo functional adaptation after infection or vaccination, a de facto innate immune memory that is also termed trained immunity. Experimental and epidemiological data have shown that induction of trained immunity contributes to the beneficial heterologous effects of vaccines such as bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the licensed TB vaccine. Moreover, increasing evidence argues that trained immunity also contributes to the anti-TB effects of BCG vaccination. An interaction among immunological signals, metabolic rewiring, and epigenetic reprogramming underlies the molecular mechanisms mediating trained immunity in myeloid cells and their bone marrow progenitors. Future studies are warranted to explore the untapped potential of trained immunity to develop a future generation of TB vaccines that would combine innate and adaptive immune memory induction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244924>Vasoactive intestinal peptide stabilizes intestinal immune homeostasis through maintaining interleukin-10 expression in regulatory  cells.</a></h2><p>: Immune dysfunction is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of  (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD). However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has immune regulatory functions, but its role in immune regulatory activities in the intestinal mucosa is not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the role of VIP in the regulation of regulatory  cell (Breg) function in the intestine. : Peripheral blood samples were collected from UC patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. Bregs were isolated from these samples and their immune regulatory function was analyzed. A murine colitis model was established to test the role of VIP in inhibiting inflammation in the intestine. : Serum IL-10 and VIP levels were lower in IgE (≥0.35 IU/mL) UC patients than that in HC subjects. The immune suppressive function of Bregs isolated from IgE UC patients was impaired. IL-10 mRNA decayed spontaneously in Bregs, which was reversed by VIP added to the culture. Tristetraprolin (TTP) bound IL-10 mRNA to speed its decay, which was blocked by VIP in the culture. Administration of VIP efficiently inhibited experimental colitis. : Insufficient VIP levels in the microenvironment speeds IL-10 mRNA decay to cause Breg dysfunction. Administration of VIP can inhibit experimental colitis, suggesting the translational potential of VIP in the treatment of IgE UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330916>The Influence of  Preparation on ADC Measurements: Comparison between Conventional DWI and DWIBS Sequences.</a></h2><p> The aim of the study was to assess whether there were differences between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) sequences in non-prepared and prepared bowels before and after preparation with an enteric hyperosmolar agent, to assess whether ADC measurements have the potential to avoid  preparation and whether ADC-DWIBS has advantages over ADC-DWI.  106 adult patients without evidence of  (IBD) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) enterography before and after  preparation. ADC-DWI and ADC-DWIBS values were measured in the intestinal and colonic walls demonstrating high signal intensity (SI) at DWI tracking images of  = 800 s/mm before and after preparation.  There were significant difference ( < 0.0001) in both ADC-DWI and ADC-DWIBS results between non-prepared and prepared jejunum for DWI being 1.09 × 10 mm/s and 1.76 × 10 mm/s, respectively, and for DWIBS being 0.91 × 10 mm/s and 1.75 × 10 mm/s, respectively. Both ADC-DWI and DWIBS also showed significant difference between non-prepared and prepared colon ( < 0.0001), with DWI values 1.41 × 10 mm/s and 2.13 × 10 mm/s, and DWIBS-1.01 × 10 mm/s and 2.04 × 10 mm/s, respectively. No significant difference between ADC-DWI and ADC-DWIBS was found in prepared jejunum ( = 0.84) and prepared colon ( = 0.58), whereas a significant difference was found in non-prepared jejunum and non-prepared colon ( = 0.0001 in both samples).  ADC between DWI and DWIBS does not differ in prepared  walls but demonstrates a difference in non-prepared . ADC in non-prepared  is lower than in prepared  and possible overlap with the ADC range of IBD is possible in non-prepared . ADC-DWIBS has no advantage over ADC-DWI in regard to IBD assessment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211700>Microbiota maintain colonic homeostasis by activating TLR2/MyD88/PI3K signaling in IL-10-producing regulatory  cells.</a></h2><p>Resident microbiota activate regulatory cells that modulate intestinal inflammation and promote and maintain intestinal homeostasis. IL-10 is a key mediator of immune regulatory function. Our studies described the functional importance and mechanisms by which gut microbiota and specific microbial components influenced the development of intestinal IL-10-producing  cells. We used fecal transplant to germ-free (GF) Il10+/EGFP reporter and Il10-/- mice to demonstrate that microbiota from specific pathogen-free mice primarily stimulated IL-10-producing colon-specific  cells and T regulatory-1 cells in ex-GF mice. IL-10 in turn down-regulated microbiota-activated mucosal  cytokines. TLR2/9 ligands and enteric bacterial lysates preferentially induced IL-10 production and regulatory capacity of intestinal  cells. Analysis of Il10+/EGFP mice crossed with additional gene-deficient strains and  cell co-transfer studies demonstrated that microbiota-induced IL-10-producing intestinal  cells ameliorated chronic T cell-mediated colitis in a TLR2, MyD88 and PI3K-dependent fashion. In vitro studies implicated PI3Kp110δ and AKT downstream signaling. These studies demonstrated that resident enteric bacteria activated intestinal IL-10-producing  cells through TLR2, MyD88 and PI3K pathways. These  cells reduced colonic T cell activation and maintained mucosal homeostasis in response to intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023087>Recent advances in the management of perianal fistulizing Crohn's : lessons for the clinic.</a></h2><p>Managing fistulizing perianal  is among the most challenging aspects of treating patients with Crohn's . Perianal fistulas are indicative of poor long-term prognosis. They are commonly associated with significant morbidities and can have detrimental effects on quality of life. While durable fistula closure is ideal, it is uncommon. In optimal circumstances, reported long-term fistula healing rates are only slightly higher than 50% and recurrence is common. Achieving these results requires a combined medical and surgical approach, highlighting the importance of a highly skilled and collaborative multidisciplinary team. In recent years, advances in imaging, biologic therapies and surgical techniques have lent to growing enthusiasm amongst treatment teams, however the most advantageous approach is yet to be determined. Areas covered: Here we review current management approaches, incorporating recent guidelines and novel therapies. Additionally, we discuss recently published and ongoing studies that will likely impact practice in the coming years. Expert opinion: Investing in concerted collaborative multi-institutional efforts will be necessary to better define optimal timing and dosing of medical therapy, as well as to identify ideal timing and approach of surgical interventions. Standardizing outcome measures can facilitate these efforts.

However, little is known regarding the role of PI3Kδ on IL-10-producing  cells that help regulate mucosal inflammation in IBD. We investigated the role of PI3Kδ signaling in  cell production of IL-10, following stimulation by resident bacteria and  cell regulatory function against colitis. In vitro,  cells from PI3Kδ mice or wild-type  cells treated with PI3K specific inhibitors secreted significantly less IL-10 with greater IL-12p40 following bacterial stimulation. These  cells failed to suppress  cytokines by co-cultured microbiota-activated macrophages or CD4 T cells. In vivo, co-transferred wild-type  cells ameliorated T cell-mediated colitis, while PI3Kδ  cells did not confer protection from mucosal inflammation. These results indicate that PI3Kδ-signaling mediates regulatory  cell immune differentiation when stimulated with resident microbiota or their components, and is critical for induction and regulatory function of IL-10-producing  cells in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106617>Short Health Scale: a valid and reliable measure of quality of life in Dutch speaking patients with .</a></h2><p> Patient reported outcomes are widely used in today's clinical practice. The Short Health Scale has been proven to be an easy-to-use and reliable measure to evaluate quality of life in patients with . We aimed to validate this Short Health Scale in Dutch speaking patients.  A total of 157 Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis patients (46% male, median age 39 years) completed the Short Health Scale on a tablet during the outpatient clinic. Validity was assessed by correlating both individual and total Short Health Scale scores with short  Questionnaire dimensions and clinical  activity. Test-retest reliability was assessed in eight patients in stable remission who completed the Short Health Scale a second time after 4-8 weeks.  All Short Health Scale items correlated with corresponding short  Questionnaire dimensions (correlation coefficients ranging from -0.403 to -0.833, all  < .01).

In the Western world, the stomach is the most commonly involved site followed by the small . Several chronic  and immune-mediated disorders which predispose to accelerated cell turnover may lead to the malignant transformation of gut lymphocytes and ultimately manifest as GI lymphoma. The challenge for the clinical gastroenterologist is that these tumors may have varied presentations, ranging from nonspecific symptoms such as dyspepsia or bloating to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, GI bleeding, diarrhea, weight loss or  obstruction.We illustrate the range of presentations of GI lymphoma with examples based on consecutive cases evaluated at our institution over a 6-month period. These cases demonstrate how appropriately directed endoscopic evaluation with biopsies has the potential to provide a definitive diagnosis and allow the patient to proceed to definitive therapy.The GI tract is the most commonly involved site for extranodal lymphoma with the stomach being most frequently involved organ.

A total of 56 Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control group(double distilled water), model group(double distilled water), mesalazine group(10 mL·kg~(-1)), high dose, middle dose and low dose Shaoyao Tang groups(2.4, 1.2, and 0.6 g·mL~(-1)). After UC rat models were established by 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene(DNCB)/ethanol enema, the rats received double distilled water or corresponding drugs twice a day for 7 days. After the treatment cycle, the general performance and  activity index(DAI) of rats were observed on the next day. Then the rats were sacrificed. The length of colon was measured. Macroscopic and histological score of colon were evaluated. Histopathological changes of colon were observed by HE staining. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry detection was used to detect the content of myeloperoxidase(MPO) in blood and colon tissues. The levels of P-selectin, macrophage migration inhibitory factor(MIF) and thromboxane _2(TXB_2) in blood and colon tissues were determined by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the protein expressions of TLR4 and NF-κ in colon tissues. The results showed that as compared with the model group, Shaoyao Tang of different doses improved the general performance of UC rats. Moreover, high-dose Shaoyao Tang group showed the most obvious effect in scoring of  activity index(P<0.001); both medium and high doses of Shaoyao Tang significantly inhibited the colon shortening and pathological injury, with significantly decreased expression levels of MPO, P-selectin, MIF and TXB_(2 )in serum and colon tissues of UC rats(P<0.001). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assay showed that the levels of TLR4 and NF-κ protein expression in the colon tissues of Shaoyao Tang high-dose group were remarkably lower than that in the model group(P<0.001). This study shows that Shaoyao Tang has protective and repairing effects on UC, and its possible mechanism is achieved probably by regulating the TLR4/NF-κ pathway and inhibiting the expressions of MPO, P-selectin, MIF and TXB_2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115454>CARMIL2 Deficiency Presenting as Very Early Onset .</a></h2><p>Children with very early onset  (VEO-IBD) often have a refractory and severe  course.

We aimed to determine in human IBD transcriptomes the link between a transcriptional signature unique to intestinal cells (ICs) with reduced mitochondrial ATP production (Mito-0) and bacteria triggered signaling using a bioinformatics approach. We generated an IC Mito-0 panel comprised of 199 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts mediated by reduced mitochondrial ATP function (DEGseq, log fold-change > |2|, p < .001). Transcripts from this panel were involved in diverse biological functions including regulation of mitochondrial energy (lower ATP), extracellular matrix, cell-cell contact, cytoskeleton, growth, metabolism, and inflammation. Next, unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that the Mito-0 panel distinctly separated inflamed IBD from non-inflamed transcriptomes, which was also supported by principal component analysis (PCA) revealing distinct variation between sample types based on presence of the Mito-0 signature (PCA, p = 8.77e). Utilizing three independent IBD cohorts, we validated that 60 novel transcripts from the Mito-0 panel were significantly increased in inflamed tissue. Subsequently, KEGG generated bacterial TLR4 and NOD2 transcriptional signatures strongly associated with inflamed IBD transcriptomes and with the Mito-0 signature as determined by Spearman's analysis (coefficient of correlation, r = 0.92, p < .05). Herein, using a comprehensive analysis we demonstrated existence of an axis between bacteria triggered signaling and reduced mitochondrial energy function.

Consistent with this function, a common variant of the autophagy gene  is associated with susceptibility to  (IBD), a disorder characterized by a chronic immune reaction directed against the gut microbiota. We recently contributed to our understanding of the link between autophagy and  signaling in the intestine by demonstrating that autophagy proteins including ATG16L1 are necessary in the epithelium to prevent a spontaneous type I interferon response to the gut microbiota. Enhanced innate immunity that occurs upon autophagy inhibition is protective in mouse models of infection by an enteric bacterial pathogen and acute epithelial injury. Although avoiding excess immune reactions towards the microbiota is necessary to prevent IBD, these observations indicate that autophagy hampers productive immunity at the intestinal epithelial barrier in certain contexts. Here, we discuss how this counterintuitive consequence of autophagy inhibition can be reconciled with the established beneficial role of the pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635181>Geographic Distribution, Phenotype and Epidemiological Tendency in  Patients in Romania.</a></h2><p> The incidence of  (IBD) over the past years in Romania has been on the rise, but epidemiologic data are lacking.

All patients diagnosed with IBD on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features were included. We divided the country into eight regions: west (W), north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE), south-west (SW), south (S), central (C) and Bucharest-Ilfov (), and data were analyzed accordingly.  A total of 2724 patients were included in this database, but only 2248 were included in the final analysis, with all data available. Of the 2248 patients, 935 were Crohn's  (CD), 1263 were ulcerative colitis (UC) and 50 were IBD-undetermined. In UC phenotypes we observed more frequent left-sided colitis (50.5%,  < 0.0001), and in CD phenotype we observed more frequent colonic and ileo-colonic localization (37.8% and 37.6%,  < 0.0001). The region with the most IBD cases was NE (25.1%) and with the least IBD cases was SW (4.9%). UC was found more frequently in NE (32%), while CD was found more frequently in Bucharest (28.6%).  In Romania, ulcerative colitis is more frequent than CD. UC is predominant in the northern part of Romania, while CD has become predominant in the southern part of the country. IBD occurs more in the male population, and in urban and industrialized areas.

Patients with early symptoms of IBD are typically evaluated first by primary healthcare (PHC) physicians, who in turn refer patients with suspected IBD to specialists. Therefore, we aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of PHC physicians toward IBD.We conducted a comparative cross-sectional survey of PHC physicians practicing at the Ministry of Health PHC centers in Jeddah, KSA. Demographics and data on the knowledge and practices of physicians were collected through a predefined and tested questionnaire that included three domains (Eaden, Leong, and Sign/Symptom Awareness). A subgroup of the cohort was educated about IBD referral criteria (group A, n = 65) prior to study initiation and their responses were compared with those from the remaining group (group , n = 135). Regression analysis was used to test associations with the significance threshold set at 5%.A total of 211 PHC physicians were surveyed with a response rate of 95%. Female physicians comprised 66.5% of the cohort and the mean age was 32.26 ± 6.6 years. About 91% of physicians were Saudi nationals, and 75.5% were MBBS degree holders. The majority of the respondents (93%) reported seeing zero to five patients with IBD per month, and almost half of the physicians preferred to always refer patients to specialists (49.5%). Most of the respondents were uncomfortable (3.27 ± 1.4 to 4.35 ± 1.2) with initiating or managing specific medical therapies (maintenance therapy, therapy for acute flare, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics) for patients with IBD. With regard to knowledge, group A had higher scores in all three domains especially in the Sign/Symptom Awareness domain (mean score 6.17 ± 1.1 vs. 3.5 ± 1.01, P < 0.001). According to multivariate analyses, both groups' knowledge showed no significant relationship with any of the medical therapies, except for the Sign/Symptom Awareness domain which was shown to be significantly affecting the comfort of doctors in managing maintenance therapy among patients with IBD [odds ratio (OR) =1.61, P = 0.008]. Gender, nationality, and qualifications were found to have a significant influence on the comfort in initiating specific medical therapies. Group A was identified as a significant factor in predicting comfort with managing corticosteroids (OR = 8.25, P = 0.006) and immunomodulators (OR = 6.03, P = 0.02) on patients with IBD.The knowledge and comfort of PHC physicians with IBD medication prescription appears to be higher when education is provided. This observation is important, since PHC physicians are responsible for early identification and referral of patients suspected of having IBD, to specialists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005743>Superoxide dismutase in nanoarchaeosomes for targeted delivery to  macrophages.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and progression of .

In this work, SOD was loaded into nanoarchaeosomes (ARC-SOD), nanovesicles fully made of sn 2,3 ether linked phytanyl saturated archaeolipids to protect and target SOD to  macrophages upon oral administration. Antioxidant and anti- activities of ARC-SOD, non-digested and digested in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, on macrophages stimulated with HO and lipopolysaccharide were determined and compared with those of free SOD and SOD encapsulated into highly stable liposomes (LIPO-SOD). Compared to SOD and LIPO-SOD, ARC-SOD (170 ± 14 nm, -30 ± 4 mV zeta potential, 122 mg protein/g phospholipids) showed the highest antioxidant and anti- activity: it reversed the cytotoxic effect of HO, decreased intracellular ROS and completely suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-α on stimulated J774 A.1 cells. Moreover, while the activity of LIPO-SOD was lost upon preparation, gastrointestinal digestion and storage, ARC-SOD was easy to prepare and retained its antioxidant capacity upon digestion in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and after 5 months of storage. Because of their structural and pharmacodynamic features, ARC-SOD may be suitable for oral targeted delivery of SOD to inflamed mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

There are, however, concerns about the safety and adverse events associated with these medications. The authors review the safety profile of immunosuppressive medications used in Crohn's  in adult patients.The authors performed a literature search until October 2018 to examine safety data on thiopurines, methotrexate, anti-TNFα agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. The authors focused on 'trial' and 'real-world' data for the biologic agents. Safety in pregnancy and the elderly are also presented.Available data in CD suggest that immunosuppressive medications are relatively safe, although there are concerns about an elevated risk of serious infections, skin cancer and lymphoma particularly with thiopurines and anti-TNFα agents. Data on vedolizumab and ustekinumab suggest these newer biologic agents are well tolerated; however, longer term data in CD are required to identify risks with extended use. Apart from methotrexate, there appear to be no adverse congenital outcomes with exposure of drugs during pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450748>Towards the Oral Treatment of Ileo-Colonic  with Infliximab Tablets: Development and Validation of the Production Process.</a></h2><p>Infliximab (IFX) is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody antagonizing the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) systemically and is efficacious in the treatment of  (IBD). However, studies suggest that the anti- effects result from local immunomodulation in the inflamed regions. Furthermore, topical inhibition of TNF in IBD ameliorates inflammation. We therefore hypothesized that orally administered IFX targeted to the ileo-colonic region in IBD may be an efficacious new treatment option. This study describes the development and validation of the production process of ileo-colonic-targeted 5 mg IFX tablets (ColoPulse-IFX) intended for the oral treatment of IBD by means of producing three consecutive validation batches (VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3, respectively). UV-VIS spectroscopy, HPLC-SEC analysis (content, fragments, aggregates), fluorescence spectroscopy (tertiary protein structure), and ELISA (potency) showed no noticeable deviations of IFX compounded to ColoPulse-IFX compared to fresh IFX stock. The average ± SD ( = 10) IFX content of VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3 was 96 ± 2%, 97 ± 3%, and 96 ± 2%, respectively, and complied with the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements for Content Uniformity. The average ± SD ( = 3) ColoPulse-IFX potency was 105 ± 4%, 96 ± 4%, and 97 ± 5%, respectively, compared to fresh IFX stock. The IFX release profile from the tablet core was complete (≥85%) after 10 min in simulated ileum medium. The in vitro coating performance of ColoPulse-IFX showed that the formulation was targeted to the simulated ileo-colonic region. Stability data showed that ColoPulse-IFX was stable for up to 6 months stored at 25 °C/60% RH. Based on these results, the production process can be considered validated and its application is discussed in light of the rationale and available evidence for the topical treatment of IBD with IFX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112773>Comparative transcriptional analysis for Toll-like receptors,  cytokines, and apoptotic genes in response to different cytolethal-encoding and noncoding isolates of Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni from food and human stool.</a></h2><p>Diversity of Campylobacter and Salmonella strains in interaction with epithelial cells may explain distinct modes of the pathogenesis, varying from mild watery to severe  diarrhea. We analyzed impact of this diversity, in relation to carriage and expression of cytholethal distending toxin  (cdtB), on alteration of IL-8, TNF-α, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, CASP3 mRNA and cytokine levels in HT-29 cell line. A diversity was observed for induction of genes among different strains. Great diversity in IL-8 induction was detected between cdtB and cdtB strains. Early analysis showed down-regulation of TNF-α, mostly among cdtB strains. Any increase or decrease in expression of TLR2 in the cdtBC. jejuni strains was orderly correlated with increase or decrease of TLR4 and TNF-α. Up-regulation of CASP3 was followed by upregulation of TLR2, -4 and/or TNF-α, regardless to the cdtB status. In conclusion, induction of  response could mediate by distinct C. jejuni and S. enterica strains by several ways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, epidemiological surveys have suggested that colorectal cancers are increasing in incidence among patients aged 20 to 39 years in the United States. Colorectal adenocarcinoma is often not considered in the differential diagnosis in this demographic because of age. Here, we present the case of an incidental finding of anemia during a preliminary evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis leading to the diagnosis of stage IV- rectal adenocarcinoma in a 34-year-old male patient. A 34-year-old Caucasian male presented with the incidental finding of anemia during a preliminary evaluation for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was asymptomatic with the exception of a three-month history of wrist and ankle joint pain. Past medical history was positive for only a three-year history of occasional spotty, painless rectal bleeding attributed to internal hemorrhoids. Physical exam findings were positive for mild extremity pallor and positive fecal occult blood test. Hematologic studies revealed a significant microcytic, hypochromic anemia with severe iron deficiency. Laboratory studies revealed no evidence of vitamin deficiency, hemolytic activity, hematuria, hypothyroidism, or clotting factor disorder. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor, and cyclic citrullinated peptide 3 (CCP3) were elevated supporting the diagnosis of underlying rheumatoid arthritis. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been utilizing an average of 2000 mg of ibuprofen daily during the previous several months in an attempt to control his joint pain. The patient was evaluated for a potential upper gastrointestinal bleed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which found no evidence of active bleeding. As the patient continued to have decreasing hemoglobin levels, he was evaluated for a lower gastrointestinal source of bleeding by colonoscopy, which revealed an 8 cm circumferential mass at the anal verge. Pathological evaluation of biopsy samples revealed a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient had no family history of colorectal cancer or major associated risk factors, such as obesity, smoking history, heavy alcohol use, diabetes mellitus type 2, or a history of . Following discharge, positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed extensive metastatic  to multiple regional lymph nodes as well as multiple suspicious hepatic lesions and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Due to the poor prognosis, recommended treatment consisted of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) along with palliative radiation. The cause of the increase in the incidence rate of colorectal cancer in young adults remains unknown. Among this demographic, colorectal cancers appear to be more aggressive and present at later stages with more advanced . In young adults, the most common clinical sign at presentation is rectal bleeding. In young adults presenting with seemingly common gastrointestinal complaints, a high degree of suspicion for colorectal cancer may be warranted by clinicians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663272>Pyoderma gangrenosum at multiple sites in a post-colostomy ulcerative colitis patient with chronic hepatitis  virus: A case report.</a></h2><p>Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon ulcerative cutaneous lesion manifesting as rapidly progressing single or multiple skin ulcers. Permanent stoma in  patients remains an independent risk of pyoderma gangrenosum. In the current report, we describe a case of pyoderma gangrenosum in a post-colostomy ulcerative colitis patient with chronic hepatitis . Pyoderma gangrenosum began seemingly as peristomal dermatitis that rapidly developed into painful ulcerations with subsequent appearance of sterile pustules and ulcerations in the left lower leg. The patient significantly improved after active management with prednisolone, antiviral therapy with entecavir, and wound dressings. Our case suggests that physicians and surgeons should have a high index of suspicion of pyoderma gangrenosum in post-colostomy ulcerative colitis patients who develop peristomal dermatitis.© 2019 Medicalhelplines.com Inc and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560728>Regulatory interaction between the ZPBP2-ORMDL3/Zpbp2-Ormdl3 region and the circadian clock.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci for several immunity-mediated  (early onset asthma,  (IBD), primary biliary cholangitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) map to chromosomal region 17q12-q21. The predominant view is that association between 17q12-q21 alleles and increased risk of developing asthma or IBD is due to regulatory variants. ORM sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising gene candidate for explaining association with . However, the relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and  is complex suggesting contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of several common chronic  . However, their role in the regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin  (GSDMB), and ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first evidence that -associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock gene Nr1d1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062653>Oral vitamin  supplement is delivered to the distal gut, altering the corrinoid profile and selectively depleting Bacteroides in C57BL/6 mice.</a></h2><p>Vitamin  is a critical nutrient for humans as well as microbes. Due to saturable uptake, high dose oral  supplements are largely unabsorbed and reach the distal gut where they are available to interact with the microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine if oral  supplementation in mice alters 1) the concentration of  and related corrinoids in the distal gut, 2) the fecal microbiome, 3) short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and 4) susceptibility to experimental colitis. C57BL/6 mice (up to 24 animals/group) were supplemented with oral 3.94 µg/ml cyanocobalamin (), a dose selected to approximate a single 5 mg supplement for a human. Active vitamin  (cobalamin), and four -analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba, CN-Cbi) were analyzed in cecal and fecal contents using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in parallel with evaluation of fecal microbiota, cecal SCFA, and susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis. At baseline, active  was a minor constituent of overall cecal (0.86%) and fecal (0.44%) corrinoid. Oral  supplementation increased active  at distal sites by >130-fold (cecal  increased from 0.08 to 10.60 ng/mg, fecal  increased from 0.06 to 7.81 ng/ml) and reduced microbe-derived fecal corrinoid analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba). Oral  had no effect on cecal SCFA. Microbial diversity was unaffected by this intervention, however a selective decrease in Bacteroides was observed with  treatment.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage , cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous  history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of , 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable  syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic  such as constipation, irritable  syndrome, , etc., no autoimmune , not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant ; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious  (hepatitis  virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube transplantation (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule transplantation (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group).

No serious adverse events occurred during treatment and follow-up period. The adverse event of nasointestinal tube group presented higher ratio of discomfort in respiratorytract accounting for 13.1% (196/1497); the oral capsule group had a higher proportion of nausea and vomiting when swallowing capsules accounting for 7.1% (32/452); the colonoscopy group was mainly diarrhea, accounting for 37.7% (23/61). The above symptoms disappeared after the nasointestinal tube was removed, or after treatment ended, or within 1 to 3 days after hospitalization.

Gluten consumption, duration of breast-feeding, various infections, especially frequent intestine infections, vaccinations and use of antibiotics can be linked to celiac . It is predicted that it affects 1% of the global population and its incidence rate is increasing. Celiac  is closely related to Turner's syndrome, type I diabetes mellitus, Down's syndrome, and other autoimmune conditions and most people with the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 are at a higher risk of developing this . The link between infections and autoimmune  has been very much considered in recent years. In several studies, we explained that pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms probably have multiple roles in initiation, exacerbation, and development of irritable  syndrome (IBS) and  (IBD). In various studies, the relationship between infections caused by viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Rotavirus, Hepatitis C (HCV) and Hepatitis  virus (HBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Influenza virus, and parasites including Giardia spp and Toxoplasma gondii with celiac  has been raised. However, increasing evidence proposes that some of these microorganisms, especially helminths, can also have protective and even treatment roles in the celiac  process.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) enterography with ultra-high -value facilitates the identification of neoplastic lesions in the ileocecal region. A total of 76 patients (22 patients with neoplasms, 26  lesions and 28 normal subjects) from 292 cases of suspected  disorders were included in the present study. All patients were examined with conventional MR enterography and DW imaging (DWI) with seven different -values (400, 600, 800, 1,000, 1,200, 1,500 and 3,000 sec/mm) in a 3T MR scanner. DWI scans with different -values were analyzed independently by two radiologists for the presence of ileocecal lesions. The signal intensity of the majority of  lesions and normal  segments gradually decreased to the background intensity with increasing -values; however, neoplastic lesions demonstrated relative hyperintensity compared with the background. In addition, ~76% of the positive findings from =3,000 sec/mm DWI were neoplasms. In conclusion, a lesion with consistently high signal intensity from DWI images with -values increasing to 3,000 sec/mm indicated the presence of neoplasms. The results suggested that ultra-high -value (3,000 sec/mm) imaging may aid the clinical differentiation of neoplasms from benign conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158441>Onion bulb extract reduces colitis severity in mice via modulation of colonic  pathways and the apoptotic machinery.</a></h2><p>The use of nutraceutical-based products has increased in recent years due to their demonstrated efficacy and their good safety profile.

Animals were sacrificed, colons were removed and the severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of various cytokines and chemokines were measured using proteome profiling-based assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques.DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by the daily OBE treatment and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, positive control), particularly at 100-200 mg/kg doses, at both the gross and histological levels. OBE was also shown to reduce colonic expression and activity of several pro- molecules and signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinase family, mammalian target of rapamycin, cyclooxygenase-2, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. In addition, OBE reduced the expression of interferon-γ, various C-C and C-X-C chemokines, and molecules involved in the apoptotic machinery such as cytochrome c, caspase-3 and -8, -cell lymphoma-extra-large and -2.OBE showed anti- actions in IBD mouse model, which is attributed, in part, to the modulation of the expression and the activity of important pro- molecules and signaling pathways involved in the  response.

With biologic agents and biosimilars becoming more established, it is necessary to conduct a review on existing literature and establish a consensus on when and how to introduce biologic agents and biosimilars in the conjunction with conventional treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) in Asia. These statements also address how pharmacogenetics influence the treatments of UC and CD and provide guidance on response monitoring and strategies to restore loss of response. Finally, the review includes statements on how to manage treatment alongside possible hepatitis  and tuberculosis infections, both common in Asia. These statements have been prepared and voted upon by members of IBD workgroup employing the modified Delphi process. These statements do not intend to be all-encompassing and future revisions are likely as new data continue to emerge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644151>Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated  such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, , multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204543>A patenting perspective on human neutrophil elastase (HNE) inhibitors (2014-2018) and their therapeutic applications.</a></h2><p>Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is involved in a variety of serious chronic , especially cardiopulmonary pathologies. For this reason, the regulation of HNE activity represents a promising therapeutic approach, which is evident by the development of a number of new and selective HNE inhibitors, both in the academic and pharmaceutical environments.The present review analyzes and summarizes the patent literature regarding human neutrophil elastase inhibitors for the treatment of cardiopulmonary  over 2014-2018.HNE is an interesting and defined target to treat various  , including a number of cardiopulmonary pathologies. The research in this field is quite active, and a number of HNE inhibitors are currently in various stages of clinical development. In addition, new opportunities for HNE inhibitor development stem from recent studies demonstrating the involvement of HNE in many other  pathologies, including rheumatoid arthritis, , skin , and cancer. Furthermore, the development of dual HNE/proteinase 3 inhibitors is being pursued as an innovative approach for the treatment of neutrophilic  . Thus, these new developments will likely stimulate new and increased interest in this important therapeutic target and for the development of novel and selective HNE inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079262>Third Time's a Charm: Immunization Strategies for Hepatitis  in Immunosuppressed Patients with .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019554>Switching from infliximab to biosimilar in : overview of the literature and perspective.</a></h2><p>Biological therapy has revolutionized the treatment of  (IBD). After the expiration of patents for biological innovator products, development of biosimilars increased. CT-P13 was the first biosimilar approved for the same indications as the reference product; however, the approval was based on extrapolated data from rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Our aim was to review clinical studies about switching from originator infliximab (IFX-O) to biosimilar infliximab (IXF-) in IBD, focusing on recently published data and the future of biosimilars.The PubMed database was searched for original articles published up to 1 December 2018 reporting data on IFX- in IBD.A total of 29 studies assessing switching from IFX-O to IFX-, 14 assessing induction therapy with IFX- were found. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were discussed. Studies confirm that CT-P13 is safe and equally efficient as the reference product for both induction and maintenance therapy; and that switching from the reference product to biosimilar is non-inferior to continuous biosimilar use. However, efficacy and safety data on Flixabi (SB2) in IBD patients is lacking.Switching from the originator to a biosimilar in patients with IBD is acceptable, although scientific and clinical evidence is lacking regarding reverse switching, multiple switching and cross-switching among biosimilars in IBD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160097>Re: Jacob A.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this  better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase  (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614203>Patchouli alcohol activates PXR and suppresses the NF-κ-mediated intestinal .</a></h2><p>Pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) is involved in  (IBD). Patchouli alcohol (PA) has anti- effects; however, the mechanisms of PA on IBD remain largely unknown.The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti- effect of PA that primarily focused on crosstalk between PA-mediated PXR activation and NF-κ inhibition.We evaluated the anti- effect of PA with respect to PXR/NF-κ signalling using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, the identified PA as PXR agonist was evaluated by hPXR transactivation assays and assessing CYP3A4 expression and activity. NF-κ inhibition were analysed based on NF-κ Luciferase assays, NF-κ-mediated pro- genes expression and NF-κ nuclear translocation after activating PXR by PA. In vivo, colonic mPXR and NF-κ signalling were analysed to assess PA-mediated the protective effect against dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PXR was further evaluated the protection of PA against DSS-induced colitis.PA induced CYP3A4 expression and activity via an hPXR-dependent mechanism. PA-mediated PXR activation attenuated inflammation by inhibiting NF-κ activity and nuclear translocation. The anti- effect of PA on NF-κ was abolished by PXR knockdown. PA prevented DSS-induced inflammation by regulating PXR/NF-κ signalling, whereas pharmacological PXR inhibition abated PA-mediated suppressive effects on NF-κ inflammation signalling.PA activates PXR signalling and suppresses NF-κ signalling, consequently causing ameliorating inflammation. Results highlight the importance of PXR-NF-κ crosstalk in colitis and suggest a novel therapeutic reagent.Copyright © 2019.

During the last decade, the role of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the treatment of paediatric-onset IBD has gained more ground. The number of biologicals presently available for children and adolescents with IBD has increased, biosimilars have become available, and practices in adult gastroenterology with regards to anti-TNF have changed. The aim of this study is to review the current evidence on the indications, judicious use, effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF agents in paediatric IBD. A PubMed literature search was performed and included articles published after 2000 using the following terms: child or paediatric, Crohn, ulcerative colitis, , anti-TNF, TNF alpha inhibitor, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and biological. Anti-TNF agents, specifically infliximab and adalimumab, have proven to be effective in moderate and severe paediatric IBD. Therapeutic drug monitoring increases therapy effectiveness and safety. Clinical predictors for anti-TNF response are currently of limited value because of the variation in outcome definitions and follow-ups. Future research should comprise large cohorts and clinical trials comparing groups according to their risk profile in order to provide personalized therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639187>Can we Improve the Prognostic Value of Phenotype at  Diagnosis?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286804>New insights into the interplay between autophagy, gut microbiota and  responses in IBD.</a></h2><p>One of the most significant challenges of  (IBD) research is to understand how alterations in the symbiotic relationship between the genetic composition of the host and the intestinal microbiota, under impact of specific environmental factors, lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn . Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for  management.

The purpose of this study was to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns and to identify resistance genes of quinolones and colistin in Escherichia coli. There are very few patents on E. coli isolated from colorectal cancer. So, this study demonstrated that some bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin are not present resistance genes. As well as, new patterns for E. coli are presented for samples of patients with colorectal cancer.Of the three healthy,  (IBD) and colorectal cancer groups, 40 E. coli strains isolated after confirmation by biochemical and molecular methods. The susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics was investigated using disk diffusion test. After deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnr A, qnr ) and colistin (mcr-1).The results showed that E. coli isolates from colorectal cancer patients had the highest resistance to piperacillin (67.5%), ceftazidime (47.5%), and cefepime (42.5%). Also, E. coli strains isolated from IBD patients showed resistance to antibiotic ceftazidime 13%. More than 95% of E. coli strains isolated from healthy people were susceptible to antibiotics. Based on the results, 18 (15%) E. coli strains were showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The qnr A gene was detected in 61.11% isolate; however qnr  was detected in 9 (50%). Isolates resistant to colistin were not observed.These findings indicate increased resistance of E. coli to ciprofloxacin in comparison with prior studies. Further research in this field will increase our knowledge and more effective exposure to the antibiotic resistance of the pathogenic microorganisms.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191873>TNF-α inhibitors in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.</a></h2><p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a complex  with a dramatic impact on the quality of life of patients that it afflicts. Despite this, there are few treatment options offering long-term relief. The exact pathophysiology of HS is unclear, although the current theory involves follicular obstruction, rupture, and subsequent inflammation leading to fistula and abscess development in intertriginous skin. Several  modulators have been implicated in the development of HS, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α as well as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and IL-17. Initial evidence for the use of TNF-α inhibitors in HS stemmed from recognition that  patients treated with these medications saw a concurrent improvement in their HS symptoms. Early case reports and case series illustrated TNF-α inhibitors' value in the treatment of HS. Later, two phase III clinical trials, PIONEER I and PIONEER II, demonstrated that adalimumab is an efficacious treatment for HS. Infliximab represents another effective HS treatment option with its main advantage being dosing flexibility. In contrast, clinical trials have failed to show evidence for application of etanercept in HS. There is limited data on other TNF-α inhibitors such as certolizumab-pegol and golimumab. This review outlines the history, dosing, response, and adverse effects of TNF-α inhibitors in the treatment of HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097594>Enhanced susceptibility to chemically induced colitis caused by excessive endosomal TLR signaling in LRBA-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>LPS-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein deficiency in humans causes immune dysregulation resulting in autoimmunity,  (IBD), hypogammaglobulinemia, regulatory T (T) cell defects, and  cell functional defects, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood. In an ongoing forward genetic screen for -ethyl--nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations that increase susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, we identified two nonsense mutations in  Although T cells have been a main focus in LRBA research to date, we found that dendritic cells (DCs) contribute significantly to DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in LRBA-deficient mice.   DCs exhibited excessive IRF3/7- and PI3K/mTORC1-dependent signaling and type I IFN production in response to the stimulation of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, TLR7, and TLR9. Substantial reductions in cytokine expression and sensitivity to DSS in LRBA-deficient mice were caused by knockout of , a chaperone necessary for trafficking of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 to endosomes.

Hence, it is important to develop radiation signatures that can distinguish between IR-induced  responses and pre-existing . In this study, we compared the gene expression response of a genetically modified mouse model of  (Il10) with that of a normal wild-type mouse to potentially develop transcriptomics-based biodosimetry markers that can predict radiation exposure in individuals regardless of pre-existing  condition.Wild-type (WT) and Il10 mice were exposed to whole body irradiation of 7 Gy X-rays. Gene expression responses were studied using high throughput whole genome microarrays in peripheral blood 24 h post-irradiation. Analysis resulted in identification of 1962 and 1844 genes differentially expressed (p < 0.001, FDR < 10%) after radiation exposure in Il10 and WT mice respectively. A set of 155 genes was also identified as differentially expressed between WT and Il10 mice at the baseline pre-irradiation level. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the 155 baseline differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in  response, glutathione metabolism and collagen deposition. Analysis of radiation responsive genes revealed that innate immune response and p53 signaling processes were strongly associated with up-regulated genes, whereas -cell development process was found to be significant amongst downregulated genes in the two genotypes. However, specific immune response pathways like MHC based antigen presentation, interferon signaling and hepatic fibrosis were associated with radiation responsive genes in Il10 mice but not WT mice. Further analysis using the IPA prediction tool revealed significant differences in the predicted activation status of T-cell mediated signaling as well as regulators of inflammation between WT and Il10 after irradiation.Using a mouse model we established that an   condition could affect the expression of many radiation responsive genes. Nevertheless, we identified a panel of genes that, regardless of  condition, could predict radiation exposure. Our results highlight the need for consideration of pre-existing conditions in the population in the process of development of reliable biodosimetry markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123972>Extracellular Matrix Fragments of the Basement Membrane and the Interstitial Matrix Are Serological Markers of Intestinal Tissue Remodeling and  Activity in Dextran Sulfate Sodium Colitis.</a></h2><p>Chronic intestinal inflammation results in tissue damage partly caused by an increase in matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity causing degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We studied intestinal tissue remodeling by quantifying ECM protein fragments in serum in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, to investigate ECM protein fragments as serological biomarkers of intestinal tissue remodeling and  activity.Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 5% DSS in drinking water for 5 days followed by 11 days with regular water.  activity index (DAI) was scored daily. Serum was collected on day 0, 6, 7, and 16. ELISAs were used to quantify MMP-derived remodeling fragments of basement membrane type IV collagen (C4M and PRO-C4) and interstitial matrix type III collagen (C3M and rPRO-C3).In DSS rats, serum levels relative to baseline of C4M, PRO-C4, and C3M were elevated (P < 0.01; P < 0.001; P < 0.001) at day 7, which declined at day 16. Levels of rPRO-C3 were lower in DSS rats at day 7 and increased to normal levels at day 16. The ratio between C3M and rPRO-C3 showed an overall degradation (P < 0.0001) of collagen type III in DSS rats at day 7, which correlated to the DAI (r = 0.5588, P < 0.0001).Our data suggest that remodeling of the basement membrane (C4M and PRO-C4) and the interstitial matrix (C3M and rPRO-C3) increased during DSS-induced colitis and declined with reversal of the . Thus, serological biochemical biomarkers of the ECM reflect tissue remodeling and could be studied as markers of  activity in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31046481>A safety review of recent advancements in the treatment of psoriasis: analysis of clinical trial safety data.</a></h2><p>The management of psoriasis can include oral medications and injectable biologics. Safety data of these various treatment options are important to consider when choosing the right treatment for the patient.This review evaluates the safety of newer treatments approved for psoriasis, including interleukin-(IL)-17 inhibitors, IL-23/p19 inhibitors, ustekinumab, certolizumab pegol and apremilast, using phases III and IV clinical trial data.Even as treatment of psoriasis becomes safer, it is important to recognize both common and uncommon adverse effects of treatment. Common adverse effects are similar across treatment options, including upper respiratory infection and injection-site reaction. Serious adverse effects occur less frequently and specific to the psoriasis treatment option, such as  and candida infections with IL-17 inhibitors, tuberculosis with certolizumab pegol, and psychiatric events with apremilast. While IL-23/p19 inhibitors may have a slightly better safety profile than other biologics, long-term data are limited. The conclusions that can be drawn from clinical trial safety data are limited given that many clinical trials are not large enough to detect rare safety events. Data from registries provide important complementary information on long-term safety but there are limitations including a lack of randomized assignment between drug treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154873>Prevalence of iron deficiency in first trimester, nonanemic pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Despite a high frequency of iron deficiency in pregnancy, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated: "there is inconclusive evidence routine supplementation for iron deficiency anemia improves maternal or infant clinical health outcomes." In contradistinction, high-quality epidemiologic studies report long lasting deficits in infants diagnosed with iron deficiency in the first 6 months of life compared with infants who were not, with specific deficits in cognition, memory, executive function and electrophysiology documented up to 19 years of age. Infants are not routinely screened for iron deficiency. United Kingdom guidelines differ and recommend screening high-risk infants who are preterm, of diabetic, underweight, obese, or vegetarian mothers, those born to anemic or iron deficient mothers, of smokers, those with  or abnormal uterine bleeding, and from pregnancies in which the intergravid period is <6 months. Iron parameters are not routinely drawn unless anemia is present and in some cases only if microcytic. In that iron deficiency precedes the development of anemia, and waiting for its development misses a large number of overtly iron deficient gravidas. Iron parameters were measured in 102 consecutive, nonselected, nonanemic, first trimester women presenting to their obstetricians. Using standard cutoffs of percent transferrin saturation and/or serum ferritin, 42% were observed to be iron deficient. Given the lack of harm of testing for iron deficiency, it appears prudent to err on the side of caution and screen all presenting pregnant mothers until properly powered outcome data become available. The current recommendations of the USPSTF may need to be revisited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377948>H.pylori Infection Alleviates Acute and Chronic Colitis with the Expansion of Regulatory  Cells in Mice.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies showed that there was an inverse relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and the incidence of  (IBD). Our previous research indicated that the regulatory immune responses induced by H. pylori infection were not limited to gastric mucosa, and the balance of intestinal mucosal immunity was influenced. In this study, mice were infected with H. pylori SS1, and then colitis was induced by 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), to investigate the role of the regulatory  cells in the effects of H. pylori infection on acute and chronic colitis. In acute and chronic colitis groups, DAI and colonic histological scores reduced significantly and colon length shorted less, the proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression downregulated in colonic mucosa, and the percentages of CD19IL-10Breg cells were higher in the H. pylori/DSS co-treated groups compared with the DSS-treated groups. Our study suggests that H. pylori infection can alleviate the acute and chronic colitis induced by DSS, and CD19IL-10Breg cells may play a critical role in the alleviation of acute and chronic colitis following H. pylori infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107556>Attenuation of NF-κ in Intestinal Epithelial Cells Is Sufficient to Mitigate the Bone Loss Comorbidity of Experimental Mouse Colitis.</a></h2><p>Skeletal abnormalities are common comorbidities of  (IBD). Patients suffering from IBD, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's , present with skeletal complications. However, the mechanism underpinning IBD-associated bone loss remains vague. Intestinal inflammation generates an  milieu at the intestinal epithelium that leads to dysregulation of mucosal immunity through gut-residing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and other cell types. ILCs are recently identified mucosal cells considered as the gatekeeper of gut immunity and their function is regulated by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-secreted cytokines in response to the  microenvironment. We first demonstrate that serum as well as IECs collected from the intestine of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice contain high levels of  and osteoclastogenic cytokines. Mechanistically, heightened  response of IECs was associated with significant intrinsic activation of NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells) in IECs and increased frequency of ILC1, ILC3, and myeloid osteoclast progenitors. Validating the central role of IEC-specific NF-κ activation in this phenomenon, conditional expression of constitutively active inhibitor kappa  kinase 2 (IKK2) in IECs in mice recapitulates the majority of the cellular, , and osteolytic phenotypes observed in the chemically induced colitis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of IKK2 from IECs significantly attenuated inflammation and bone loss in DSS-induced colitis. Finally, using the DSS-induced colitis model, pharmacologic inhibition of IKK2 was effective in reducing frequency of ILC1 and ILC3 cells, attenuated circulating levels of  cytokines, and halted colitis-associated bone loss. Our findings identify IKK2 in IECs as viable therapeutic target for colitis-associated osteopenia.© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h2><p>Patients with  (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's , have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa  (NFκ) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκ p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκ p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal  cytokines and facilitated the NFκ p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266461>Structured physical activity interventions as a complementary therapy for patients with  - a scoping review and practical implications.</a></h2><p>Patients with  (IBD) also suffer from a wide range of additional disorders, which may be caused by the , the side effect of the medication, or a lack of physical activity (PA). This results in reduced physical and psychological wellbeing. However, as known from other chronic  exercise could be utilized as supportive therapy for IBD patients. Main goals of this article are (a) collecting data of the effects structured physical activity interventions have on validated clinical parameters of IBD and health related symptoms, () developing activity recommendations for this clientele.A scoping review was conducted, searching for relevant articles published until May 2018, which investigated the effects of structured exercise interventions in IBD patients. The heterogeneity of the outcomes and the interventions did not support a quantitative synthesis thus, a qualitative discussion of the studies is provided.After reviewing 353 records, 13 eligible articles were identified. Five studies investigated aerobic exercise, three studies resistance exercise, three studies mind-body therapies and two studies yoga. The quality of the studies is mixed, and the duration is rather short for exercise interventions. Only few studies assessed validated IBD activity markers or  biomarkers. Nevertheless, the patients showed an increase in fitness, bone mineral density (BMD), quality of life and a decrease of IBD induced stress and anxiety. No severe adversial events were reported.Even though the evidence is limited the application of exercise interventions in IBD patients can be assumed to be safe and beneficial for the patients' overall-health, and IBD specific physical and psychosocial symptoms. But there is still a high demand for more thoroughly conducted studies, focussing on important clinical outcome parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169073>Comparative genomics and genome biology of .</a></h2><p> a bacterium historically linked to gingivitis and periodontitis, has recently been associated with  and colorectal cancer. Our aim was to generate genome sequences for new clinical  strains and identify functional properties explaining their pathogenic potential. Eight  genomes were assessed, four strains isolated from inflamed gut tissues from paediatric Crohn's  patients, three strains from colonic adenomas, and one from a gastroenteritis patient stool. Genome assemblies were analyzed alongside the only 3 deposited  genomes. The pangenome from these 11 strains consisted of 4686 unique protein families, and the core genome size was estimated at 1050 ± 15 genes with each new genome contributing an additional 206 ± 16 genes. Functional assays indicated that colonic strains segregated into 2 groups: adherent/invasive vs. non-adherent/non-invasive strains. The former possessed Type IV secretion machinery and S-layer proteins, while the latter contained Cas genes and other CRISPR associated proteins. Comparison of gene profiles with strains in Human Microbiome Project metagenomes showed that gut-derived isolates share genes specific to tongue dorsum and supragingival plaque counterparts. Our findings indicate that  strains are phenotypically and genetically diverse and suggest that secretion systems may play an important role in virulence potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164027>Formulation strategies for achieving high delivery efficiency of thymoquinone-containing  extract to the colon based on oral alginate microcapsules for treatment of .</a></h2><p> extract (NSE) was incorporated in alginate microcapsules using aerosolisation and homogenisation methods, respectively, with the aim of delivering high concentrations of the active species, thymoquinone (TQ), directly to sites of inflammation in the colon following oral administration. Encapsulation of NSE was accomplished either by direct loading or diffusion into blank microparticles. Microcapsules in the size range 40-60 µm exhibited significantly higher NSE loading up to 42% w/w and encapsulation efficiency (EE) up to 63% when the extract was entrapped by direct encapsulation compared with 4.1 w/w loading, 6.2% EE when NSE was incorporated by diffusion loading. Sequential exposure of samples to simulated intestinal fluids (SIFs) revealed that the microcapsules suppressed NSE release in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) for 2 h and SIF for 4 h and liberated most of the NSE content (80%) in simulated colonic fluid (SCF) over 18 h. NSE released in SCF at 12 h exhibited antioxidant activity, when measured using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay at levels comparable with the activity of unencapsulated extract. These findings demonstrate the potential of oral alginate microcapsules as highly efficient, targeted carriers for colonic delivery of NSE in the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586453>Effects of Low-FODMAP Diet on Symptoms, Fecal Microbiome, and Markers of Inflammation in Patients With Quiescent  in a Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>There is limited evidence that a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) reduces gut symptoms in quiescent  (IBD). We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD.We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's  or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable  syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1.2, P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis,  longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable  syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no: ISRCTN17061468.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Retrospective data were collected on consecutive children (age 2-18 years) referred to our pediatric gastroenterology clinic, for recurrent abdominal pain and/or altered  habit from 2007 to 2013. Subjects who had diagnostic workup: laboratory tests (FC, BII, white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and IUS as initial assessment were eligible. Subjects with known gastrointestinal (GI) , or signs or symptoms highly suggestive for organic  necessitating prompt endoscopy (e.g., perianal  or rectal bleeding), or who had recently performed endoscopy were excluded. The accuracy of noninvasive tests for detecting IBD was assessed using endoscopic and/or radiological investigations, performed in subsequent clinical follow up, as reference gold standard.  Seventy-seven patients (mean age 11.3, 44 males) were included, 23 (29.9%) with a final diagnosis of IBD. As single tests, FC gave the highest sensitivity (96%) but lower specificity (72%) and IUS highest specificity (96%) with lower sensitivity (70%). The combination of FC + IUS showed excellent accuracy for detecting children with IBD with positive predictive value: 100%; negative predictive value: 88.5%. The probability of IBD in children with normal FC, BII and IUS was 0.09%.  FC and increased BWT at IUS are accurate to guide reassurance or proceeding with further invasive procedures for detecting IBD in children with mild GI symptoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175506>Functional polymorphisms of the receptor for the advanced glycation end product promoter gene in : a case-control study.</a></h2><p>The receptor for the advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand transmembrane receptor involved in chronic inflammation whose specific polymorphisms of the promoter gene were found to increase its transcriptional activity. We investigated the association of both allelic and genotypic -374T/A and -429T/C polymorphisms with . The STREGA guidelines were applied for planning and reporting. We enrolled 133 patients with Crohn's  (CD), 149 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 128 blood donors. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes collected from each patient and control. RAGE polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was first assessed, and then, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Fisher exact test were used for etiologic group comparisons. Distribution of patients' characteristics across genotypes was evaluated by the Fisher exact test, while that across alleles was analyzed with a probit model. A 2-sided value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Following the evidence of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we found a higher prevalence of the allele A of the -374T/A haplotype in UC (p = 0.043), and of the allele C of the -429T/C haplotype in CD (p < 0.001) with respect to the other groups. Moreover, the homozygous AA genotype of the -374T/A polymorphism resulted associated with late onset of CD, while its TT genotype with early onset (p = 0.049). The allele C of the 429T/C haplotype was associated with early onset of UC (p = 0.03), while a higher frequency of the heterozygous TC haplotype was found in those with pancolitis (p = 0.026). The differing distribution of these polymorphisms in healthy donors and CD/UC patients suggests a role in the development and outcome of these pathological conditions.</p></html>
