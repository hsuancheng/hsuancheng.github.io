Although previous  and  studies demonstrated the therapeutic role of gintonin against Alzheimer's disease, the neuroprotective effects of gintonin in Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown. We investigated whether gintonin (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, p.o., daily for 12 days) had neuroprotective activities against neurotoxicity in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Pre-administration of 100 mg/kg gintonin displayed significantly ameliorating effects in neurological disorders (motor and welfare) as measuring using pole, rotarod, and nest building tests, and in the survival rate. These effects were associated to the reduction of the loss of  hydroxylase-positive neurons, microglial activation, activation of inflammatory mediators (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and cyclooxygenase-2), and alteration of blood-brain  (BBB) integrity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or striatum following MPTP injection. The benefits of gintonin treatment against MPTP also included the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways and the inhibition of phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. Interestingly, these neuroprotective effects of gintonin were blocked by LPAR1/3 antagonist, Ki16425. Overall, the present study shows that gintonin attenuates MPTP-induced neurotoxicity via multiple targets. Gintonin combats neuronal death, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and an anti-oxidant agent. It maintains BBB integrity. LPA receptors play a key role in gintonin-mediated anti-PD mechanisms. Finally, gintonin is a key agent for prevention and/or treatment of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788497>A study of the focal adhesion kinase inhibitor GSK2256098 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma with evaluation of tumor penetration of [11C]GSK2256098.</a></h1><p>GSK2256098 is a novel oral focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor. Preclinical studies demonstrate growth inhibition in glioblastoma cell lines. However, rodent studies indicate limited blood-brain  (BBB) penetration. In this expansion cohort within a phase I study, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of GSK2256098 were evaluated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Biodistribution and kinetics of [11C]GSK2256098 were assessed in a substudy using positron-emission tomography (PET).Patients were treated with GSK2256098 until disease progression or withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs). Serial PK samples were collected on day 1. On a single day between days 9 and 20, patients received a microdose of intravenous [11C]GSK2256098 and were scanned with PET over 90 minutes with parallel PK sample collection. Response was assessed by MRI every 6 weeks.Thirteen patients were treated in 3 dose cohorts (1000 mg, 750 mg, 500 mg; all dosed twice daily). The maximum tolerated dose was 1000 mg twice daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were related to cerebral edema. Treatment-related AEs (>25%) were diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. Eight patients participated in the PET substudy, with [11C]GSK2256098 VT (volume of distribution) estimates of 0.9 in tumor tissue, 0.5 in surrounding T2 enhancing areas, and 0.4 in normal brain. Best response of stable disease was observed in 3 patients, including 1 patient on treatment for 11.3 months.GSK2256098 was tolerable in patients with relapsed glioblastoma. GSK2256098 crossed the BBB at low levels into normal brain, but at markedly higher levels into tumor, consistent with tumor-associated BBB disruption. Additional clinical trials of GSK2256098 are ongoing.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29021890>Zebrafish knockout of Down syndrome gene, , shows social impairments relevant to autism.</a></h1><p> maps to the Down syndrome critical region at 21q22. Mutations in this kinase-encoding gene have been reported to cause microcephaly associated with either intellectual disability or autism in humans. Intellectual disability accompanied by microcephaly was recapitulated in a murine model by overexpressing  which mimicked Down syndrome phenotypes. However, given embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout (KO) mice, no murine model studies could present sufficient evidence to link  dysfunction with autism. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying microcephaly and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we established an in vivo  KO model using zebrafish.We identified a patient with a mutation in the  gene using microarray analysis. Circumventing the  of murine model studies, we generated a  KO zebrafish using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome editing. For social behavioral tests, we have established a social interaction test, shoaling assay, and group behavior assay. For molecular analysis, we examined the neuronal activity in specific brain regions of  KO zebrafish through in situ hybridization with various probes including  and  which are the molecular markers for stress response.Microarray detected an intragenic microdeletion of  in an individual with microcephaly and autism. From behavioral tests of social interaction and group behavior,  KO zebrafish exhibited social impairments that reproduce human phenotypes of autism in a vertebrate animal model. Social impairment in  KO zebrafish was further confirmed by molecular analysis of  and  expression. Transcriptional expression of  and  was lower than that of wild type fish in specific hypothalamic regions, suggesting that KO fish brains are less activated by social context.In this study, we established a zebrafish model to validate a candidate gene for autism in a vertebrate animal. These results illustrate the functional deficiency of  as an underlying disease mechanism for autism. We also propose simple social behavioral assays as a tool for the broader study of autism candidate genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958145>Large Amino Acid Transporter 1 Selective Liposomes of l-DOPA Functionalized Amphiphile for Combating Glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>Despite significant progress in neurosurgery and radiation therapy during the past decade, overall survivability (OS) of glioblastoma patients continues to be less than 2 years. The scope of systemic chemotherapy is greatly limited by poor drug transport across the blood brain  (BBB) and, thereby, suboptimal drug accumulation in glioma tissue. To this end, use of large amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1) overexpressed both on brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and glioma cells has begun. Prior reports on the use of LAT1 mediated delivery of model drugs showed their brain accumulations. However, in depth in vivo glioblastoma regression studies aimed at examining the therapeutic potential of LAT1 mediated delivery of potent chemotherapeutics to brain tumor tissues have not yet been undertaken. Herein, we report on the development of a nanometric (100-135 nm) promising LAT1 selective liposomal drug carrier prepared from a novel l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) functionalized amphiphile (Amphi-DOPA). In vitro studies using Rh-PE labeled liposomes of Amphi-DOPA both in untreated glioma (GL261) cells and in GL261cells preincubated with LAT1 antibody revealed LAT1 mediated cellular uptake. Intravenously administered NIR-dye labeled liposomes of Amphi-DOPA in glioblastoma-bearing mice showed preferential accumulation of the dye in brain tissue. Notably iv administration of WP1066-loaded liposomes of Amphi-DOPA enhanced the overall survivability of C57BL/6J mice bearing orthotopically established mouse glioblastoma by ∼60% compared to that for the untreated mouse group. Furthermore, we show that the OS of established glioblastoma-bearing mice can be significantly enhanced (by >300% compared to that for the untreated mouse group) when the presently described LAT1 mediated targeted chemotherapy with WP1066-loaded liposomes of Amphi-DOPA is combined with in vivo DC-targeted DNA vaccination using a survivin (a glioblastoma antigen) encoded DNA vaccine. The present findings open a new door for LAT1 mediated systemic chemotherapy of glioblastoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360121>Why does the Y326I mutant of monoamine oxidase B decompose an endogenous amphetamine at a slower rate than the wild type enzyme? Reaction step elucidated by multiscale molecular simulations.</a></h1><p>This work investigates the Y326I point mutation effect on the kinetics of oxidative deamination of phenylethylamine (PEA) catalyzed by the monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) enzyme. PEA is a neuromodulator capable of affecting the plasticity of the brain and is responsible for the mood enhancing effect caused by physical exercise. Due to a similar functionality, PEA is often regarded as an endogenous amphetamine. The rate limiting step of the deamination was simulated at the multiscale level, employing the Empirical Valence Bond approach for the quantum treatment of the involved valence states, whereas the environment (solvated protein) was represented with a classical force field. A comparison of the reaction free energy profiles delivered by simulation of the reaction in the wild type MAO B and its Y326I mutant yields an increase in the  by 1.06 kcal mol upon mutation, corresponding to a roughly 6-fold decrease in the reaction rate. This is in excellent agreement with the experimental kinetic studies. Inspection of simulation trajectories reveals possible sources of the point mutation effect, namely vanishing favorable electrostatic interactions between PEA and a Tyr326 side chain and an increased amount of water molecules at the active site due to the replacement of  by a less spacious isoleucine residue, thereby increasing the dielectric shielding of the catalytic environment provided by the enzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902997>iRGD synergizes with PD-1 knockout immunotherapy by enhancing lymphocyte infiltration in gastric cancer.</a></h1><p>Poor infiltration of activated lymphocytes into tumors represents a fundamental factor limiting the therapeutic effect of adoptive cell immunotherapy. A tumor-penetrating peptide, iRGD, has been widely used to deliver drugs into tumor tissues. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that iRGD could also facilitate the infiltration of lymphocytes in both 3D tumor spheroids and several xenograft mouse models. In addition, combining iRGD modification with PD-1 knockout lymphocytes reveals a superior anti-tumor efficiency. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the binding of iRGD to neuropilin-1 results in  phosphorylation of the endothelial  regulator VE-cadherin, which plays a role in the opening of endothelial cell contacts and the promotion of transendothelial lymphocyte migration. In summary, these results demonstrate that iRGD modification could promote tumor-specific lymphocyte infiltration, and thereby overcome the bottleneck associated with adoptive immune cell therapy in solid tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553002>P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2) limit brain accumulation of the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in mice.</a></h1><p>Quizartinib, a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor, is in clinical development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. We studied its pharmacokinetic interactions with the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 and the multidrug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, using in vitro transport assays and knockout and transgenic mouse models. Quizartinib was transported by human ABCB1 in vitro, and by mouse (m)Abcb1 and mAbcg2 in vivo. Upon oral administration, the brain accumulation of quizartinib was 6-fold decreased by mAbcb1 and 2-fold by mAbcg2 (together: 12-fold). Unexpectedly, the absence of mAbcb1 resulted in a ∼2-fold lower plasma exposure in Abcb1a/1b and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 mice, suggesting that loss of mAbcb1 causes compensatory alterations in alternative quizartinib elimination or uptake systems. mAbcb1 and mAbcg2 themselves did not appear to restrict quizartinib oral availability. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of quizartinib were not substantially altered between wild-type, Cyp3a knockout and CYP3A4-humanized mice. All three strains showed relatively high (33-51%) oral bioavailability. If this also applies in humans, this would suggest a limited risk of CYP3A-related inter-individual variation in exposure for this drug. Our results provide a possible rationale for using pharmacological ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitors together with quizartinib when treating malignant lesions situated in part or in whole behind the blood-brain .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is recognized that the overexpression of the endosomal Na /H exchanger NHE9 is a potent driver of GBM progression. Patients with NHE9 overexpression have a threefold lower median survival relative to GBM patients with normal NHE9 expression, using available treatment options. New treatment strategies tailored for this GBM subset are much needed. According to the prevailing model, NHE9 overexpression leads to an increase in plasma membrane density of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) which consequently enhances GBM cell proliferation and migration. However, this increase is not specific to EGFRs. In fact, the hallmark of NHE9 overexpression is a pan-specific increase in plasma membrane receptors. Paradoxically, we report that this gain of  in NHE9 can be exploited to effectively target GBM cells for destruction. When exposed to gold nanoparticles, NHE9 overexpressing GBM cells accumulated drastically high amounts of gold via receptor-mediated endocytosis, relative to control. Irradiation of these cells with near-infrared light led to apoptotic tumour cell death. A major limitation for delivering therapeutics to GBM cells is the blood-brain  (BBB). Here, we demonstrate that macrophages loaded with gold nanoparticles can cross the BBB, deliver the gold nanoparticles and effect the demise of GBM cells. In combination with receptor  kinase inhibition, we show this approach holds great promise for a new GBM-targeted therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Polymorphisms in the gene encoding SHP-2 are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis. We recently reported that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Shp-2 in mice (Shp-2 ) leads to chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer. This suggests that SHP-2-dependent signaling protects the colonic epithelium against inflammation and colitis-associated cancer development. To verify this hypothesis, we generated mice expressing the Shp-2 E76K activated form specifically in IEC. Our results showed that sustained Shp-2 activation in IEC increased intestine and crypt length, correlating with increased cell proliferation and migration. Crypt regeneration capacity was also markedly enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo organoid culture. Shp-2 activation alters the secretory cell lineage, as evidenced by increased goblet cell numbers and mucus secretion. Notably, these mice also demonstrated elevated ERK signaling in IEC and exhibited resistance against both chemical- and Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis. In contrast, mice with IEC-specific Shp-2 deletion displayed reduced ERK signaling and rapidly developed chronic colitis. Remarkably, expression of an activated form of Braf in Shp-2-deficient mice restored ERK activation, goblet cell production and prevented colitis. Altogether, our results indicate that chronic activation of Shp-2/ERK signaling in the colonic epithelium confers resistance to mucosal erosion and colitis. © 2018 The Authors.

Using a rat model of severe preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, which displays both hypertension and inflammation during pregnancy, we evaluated whether rats were prone to develop depression or anxiety in the postpartum period. On gestational day 12, miniosmotic pumps infusing sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like  kinase-1) and sEng (soluble endoglin) were placed into rats, a subset of these rats was infused with 2 mg/kg of Orencia (abatacept) the following day to determine whether immune suppression via T-cell depletion prevented any changes in maternal depression or anxiety-like behavior. All rats, including normal pregnant (NP) controls, delivered between gestational days 21 and 22. Postpartum severe preeclamptic rats buried significantly more marbles compared with NP rats ( P=0.002) and Orencia-treated rats ( P=0.05). Severe preeclamptic rats spent significantly more time in closed arms of the elevated plus maze compared with NP rats ( P=0.009) and Orencia-treated rats ( P=0.05). Severe preeclamptic rats were hypertensive compared with NP ( P=0.03) and Orencia-treated rats ( P=0.01). Finally, severe preeclamptic rats had increased blood-brain  permeability compared with NP rats ( P=0.03), which was reversed in Orencia-treated rats ( P=0.008). These results suggest that severe preeclampsia/hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome during pregnancy contributes to an increase in anxiety-like behavior, blood-brain  permeability, and hypertension in the postpartum. The current results suggest that T-cell suppression during pregnancy can also help prevent chronic hypertension and increased anxiety in the postpartum period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321587>Distribution analysis of epertinib in brain metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer by imaging mass spectrometry and prospect for antitumor activity.</a></h1><p>Epertinib (S-222611) is a potent, reversible, and selective  kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human EGFR2 (HER2), and human EGFR4. We developed experimental brain metastasis models by intraventricular injection (intraventricular injection mouse model; IVM) of HER2-positive breast cancer (MDA-MB-361-luc-BR2/BR3) or T790M-EGFR-positive lung cancer (NCI-H1975-luc) cells. After a single oral administration, epertinib and lapatinib concentrations in brain metastatic regions were analyzed by quantitative imaging mass spectrometry. In the NCI-H1975 lung cancer IVM, the concentration of epertinib in brain metastasis was comparable to that of lapatinib. However, in the MDA-MB-361 breast cancer IVM, the concentration of epertinib in brain metastasis was >10 times higher than that of lapatinib. Furthermore, the epertinib tumor-to-normal brain ratio was ~4 times higher than that of lapatinib. Blood-tumor  (BTB) permeability was assessed in each brain metastatic region. In the lung cancer model, fluorescently labeled dextran was more highly detected in brain metastatic regions than in brain parenchyma. However, in breast cancer models, dextran fluorescence intensity in brain metastatic regions and brain parenchyma were comparable, suggesting that the BTB remained largely intact. Epertinib would be promised as a therapeutic agent for HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311902>Skin Tolerance of Three Types of Dead Sea Mud on Healthy Skin: A Short-Term Study.</a></h1><p>Dead Sea mud (DSM) is commonly used by patients with various skin conditions because of its contents of healing elements.

Nilotinib, a c-Abl inhibitor, has shown improved motor and cognitive symptoms in PD patients. However, issues concerning blood-brain  (BBB) penetration, lack of selectivity and safety still remain. Radotinib HCl is a selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor that not only effectively access the brain, but also exhibits greater pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles compared to Nilotinib and other c-Abl inhibitors. Here, we show the neuroprotective efficacy of Radotinib HCl, a brain penetrant c-Abl inhibitor, in a pre-clinical model of PD. Importantly, in vitro studies demonstrate that the treatment of Radotinib HCl protects the α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF)-induced neuronal toxicity, reduces the α-synuclein PFF-induced Lewy bodies (LB)/Lewy neurites (LN)-like pathology and inhibits the α-synuclein PFF-induced c-Abl activation in primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, administration of Radotinib HCl inhibits c-Abl activation and prevents dopaminergic neuron loss, neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits following α-synuclein PFF-induced toxicity in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicate that Radotinib HCl has beneficial neuroprotective effects in PD and provides an evidence that selective and brain permeable c-Abl inhibitors can be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333180>Oral Administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis Alters the Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome.</a></h1><p>Periodontal disease induced by periodontopathic bacteria like  is demonstrated to increase the risk of metabolic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Although precise mechanisms for this connection have not been elucidated, we have proposed mechanisms by which orally administered periodontopathic bacteria might induce changes in gut microbiota composition,  , and immune system, resulting in an increased risk of diseases characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests a profound effect of altered gut metabolite profiles on overall host health. Therefore, it is possible that  can affect these metabolites. To test this, C57BL/6 mice were administered with  W83 orally twice a week for 5 weeks and compared with sham-inoculated mice. The gut microbial communities were analyzed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA genes. Inferred metagenomic analysis was used to determine the relative abundance of KEGG pathways encoded in the gut microbiota. Serum metabolites were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics coupled with multivariate statistical analyses. Oral administration of  induced a change in gut microbiota composition. The distributions of metabolic pathways differed between the two groups, including those related to amino acid metabolism and, in particular, the genes for phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis. Also, alanine, glutamine, histidine, , and phenylalanine were significantly increased in the serum of -administered mice. In addition to altering immune modulation and gut  , oral administration of  affects the host's metabolic profile. This supports our hypothesis regarding a gut-mediated systemic pathology resulting from periodontal disease. Increasing evidence suggest that alterations of the gut microbiome underlie metabolic disease pathology by modulating gut metabolite profiles. We have shown that orally administered , a representative periodontopathic bacterium, alters the gut microbiome; that may be a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of various diseases. Given the association between periodontal disease and metabolic diseases, it is possible that  can affect the metabolites. Metabolite profiling analysis demonstrated that several amino acids related to a risk of developing diabetes and obesity were elevated in -administered mice. Our results revealed that the increased risk of various diseases by  might be mediated at least in part by alteration of metabolic profiles. The findings should add new insights into potential links between periodontal disease and systemic disease for investigators in periodontal disease and also for investigators in the field of other diseases, such as metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018 Kato et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968998>The role of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in podocyte functioning.</a></h1><p>Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a 39-kDa protein belonging to the Ena/VASP protein family, which is involved in adhesion, migration, cell-cell interaction, and regulation of pathways connected with actin cytoskeleton remodeling. VASP is phosphorylated at Tyr39, Ser157, Ser239, Thr278, and Ser322 mainly by  kinase Abl, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase G, AMP-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase D1, respectively. VASP phosphorylation, as a regulator of actin dynamics, may lead to impaired reorganization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton not only by indirect interaction of VASP with actin but also by regulation of other signaling pathways. A few studies have shown that VASP participates in the development of renal diseases and mediates podocyte movement through its interaction with proteins of the slit diaphragm. VASP phosphorylation may cause reduced actin filament assembly in podocytes and mediate disturbances in regulation of filtration  permeability as a consequence of podocyte foot process effacement. In this paper, we describe the role of VASP in podocyte , mainly in the context of actin dynamics and glomerular filtration  permeability. In addition, we discuss the involvement of VASP and its phosphorylated forms in the development of kidney diseases.© 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578870>17β-Estradiol protects the esophageal epithelium from IL-13-induced  dysfunction and remodeling.</a></h1><p>The incidence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is greater in male than female subjects, and the underlying molecular basis for this sex bias remains unclear.We sought to delineate the contribution of the sex hormone estrogen to the EoE phenotype and esophageal epithelial   and remodeling.We performed demographic and incidence analyses of EoE in male and female subjects from a single-center pediatric cohort. Estrogen-responsive gene expression analyses and estrogen receptor (ESR) immunofluorescence staining of esophageal biopsy specimens from patients with EoE and control subjects were performed. The effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on IL-13-induced signaling pathways, gene expression, and esophageal epithelial architecture and   in a primary human esophageal keratinocyte cell (EPC2) culture system (EPC2-air-liquid interface) was examined.We observed a male predominance in patients with EoE. Analyses of RNA sequencing data sets revealed a significant dysregulation of the estrogen-responsive gene network and expression of ESR1 and ESR2 in esophageal biopsy specimens from patients with EoE compared with control subjects. IL-13 stimulation of EPC2-air-liquid interface cells led to altered cellular architecture with induced dilation of intercellular spaces and  dysfunction. Pretreatment of EPC2s with E2 prior to IL-13 exposure abrogated IL-13-induced architectural changes and esophageal  dysfunction. Mechanistically, E2-protective effects were dependent on ESR2 and associated with diminishing of IL-13-induced  kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 phosphorylation and EoE-dysregulated gene expression.Estrogen-responsive genes are modified in patients with EoE compared with control subjects. E2 attenuated IL-13-induced architectural changes and esophageal epithelial  dysfunction through inhibition of the IL-13/ kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 pathway via ESR2-dependent process.

Administration of E.Coli endotoxin (LPS) produces systemic inflammatory effects of sepsis including disruption of endothelial , and if severe enough death. Whole body periodic acceleration (pGz) is the headward-footward motion of the body. pGz has been shown to induce pulsatile shear stress to the endothelium, thereby releasing vascular and cardio protective mediators. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not pGz performed as a pre-treatment or post-treatment strategy improves survival in a lethal murine endotoxin model.This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study in mice. pGz was performed in mice as pre-treatment (pGz-LPS, 3 days prior to LPS), post-treatment (LPS- pGz, 30 min after LPS) strategies or Control (LPS-CONT), in a lethal murine model of endotoxemia. Endotoxemia was induced with intraperitoneal injection of E.Coli LPS (40mg/kg). In a separate group of mice, a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) was provided in their drinking water and pGz-LPS and LPS-pGz performed to determine the effect of nitric oxide (NO) inhibition on survival. In another subset of mice, micro vascular leakage was determined. Behavioral scoring around the clock was performed in all mice at 30 min intervals after LPS administration, until 48 hrs. survival or death. LPS induced 100% mortality in LPS-CONT animals by 30 hrs. In contrast, survival to 48 hrs. occurred in 60% of pGz-LPS and 80% of LPS-pGz. L-NAME abolished the survival effects of pGz. Microvascular leakage was markedly reduced in both pre and post pGz treated animals and was associated with increased  kinase endothelial-enriched tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 (TIE2) receptor and its phosphorylation (p-TIE2). In a murine model of lethal endotoxemia, pGz performed as a pre or post treatment strategy significantly improved survival, and markedly reduced microvascular leakage. The effect was modulated, in part, by NO since a non-selective inhibitor of NO abolished the pGz survival effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536048>JAK Inhibitors for Atopic Dermatitis: An Update.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases. AD is driven by  dysfunction and abnormal immune activation of T helper (Th) 2, Th22, and varying degrees of Th1 and Th17 among various subtypes. The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and spleen  kinase (SYK) pathways are involved in signaling of several AD-related cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-33, IL-23, IL-22, and IL-17, mediating downstream inflammation and  alterations. While AD is primarily Th2-driven, the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of AD endotypes highlights the unmet need for effective therapeutic options that target more than one immune axis and are safe for long-term use.

The PSII crystal structures show that Nδ of D1-His190 donates an H-bond to the carbonyl O of D1-Asn298. However, at a level of ∼2 Å resolution, a clear discrimination between the -NH and -C═O groups of the asparagine side chain may not be possible based on the electron density map. Using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations, we investigated the energetics of the D1-Asn298 conformations. In the D1-Asn298-rotated conformation, where the amide N group donates an H-bond to deprotonated Nδ of D1-His190, oxidation of S resulted in formation of a neutral radical, either TyrZ or D1-His190. This suggests that in the D1-Asn298-rotated conformation, the redox potential ( E) values of TyrZ/D1-His190 are lower than the E of the MnCaO cluster due to deprotonated D1-His190. The large disorder of a water molecule (water 1117A) at D1-Asn298 in the crystal structure as well as the absence of water 1117A in the Sr-substituted crystal structure may be associated with coexistence of the two D1-Asn298 conformations in the crystals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969688>Attenuation of murine acute lung injury by PF-573,228, an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase.</a></h1><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by endothelial  disruption resulting in increased vascular permeability. As focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor protein  kinase, is involved in endothelial cell (EC)  regulation, we hypothesized that FAK inhibition could attenuate agonist-induced EC  disruption relevant to ALI. Human lung EC were pretreated with one of three pharmacologic FAK inhibitors, PF-573,228 (PF-228, 10 μM), PF-562,271 (PF-271, 5 μM) or NVP-TAE226 (TAE226, 5 μM) for 30 min prior to treatment with thrombin (1 U/ml, 30 min). Western blotting confirmed attenuated thrombin-induced FAK phosphorylation associated with all three inhibitors. Subsequently, EC were pretreated with either PF-228 (10 μM), TAE226 (5 μM) or PF-271 (5 μM) for 30 min prior to thrombin stimulation (1 U/ml) followed by measurements of  integrity by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER). Separately, EC grown in transwell inserts prior to thrombin (1 U/ml) with measurements of FITC-dextran flux after 30 min confirmed a significant attenuation of thrombin-induced EC  disruption by PF-228 alone. Finally, in a murine ALI model induced by LPS (1.25 mg/ml, IT), rescue treatment with PF-228 was associated with significantly reduced lung injury. Our findings PF-228, currently being studied in clinical trials, may serve as a novel and effective therapeutic agent for ALI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Akt phosphorylation mediates a neuroprotective effect against ischemic injury. Recently, a protein- phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) inhibitor (KY-226) was developed to elicit anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects via enhancement of insulin signaling. Previously, we reported that the nonselective PTP1B inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, rescued neurons from delayed neuronal death during brain ischemia. In this study, we confirmed the ameliorative effects of KY-226 on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury using a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ICR mice were subjected to MCAO for 2 h followed by reperfusion. Although KY-226 permeability was poor through the blood-brain  (BBB) of normal mice, it could penetrate through the BBB of mice after I/R insult. Intraperitoneal KY-226 administration elicited dose-dependent reductions in infarcted brain areas and improved neurological deficits. The neuroprotective effects of KY-266 were obtained when administered within 0.5 h after reperfusion. KY-226 (10 mg/kg) also restored reduced Akt phosphorylation and eNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1177) levels following I/R insult. Moreover, 10 mg/kg of KY-226 improved I/R-induced decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, KY-226 attenuated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse cortex. These results suggest that KY-226 may act as a novel therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke. Activation of Akt and ERK possibly underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of KY-226.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibodies and VEGF Trap have significant clinical benefits, the complications of intravitreal injection, drug resistance and patient compliance still need to be concerned. In this study, the effects of an orally administered multi-targeted  kinase inhibitor (Lenvatinib, E7080) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo on neovascular AMD mouse model. The results showed that E7080 effectively inhibited the proliferation, migration and tubule formation of human choroidal microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), and suppressed the angiogenesis of zebrafish subintestinal vessels without causing malformation. The anti-angiogenic effect of E7080 on the laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mouse model by oral administration of 10 mg/kg/day was observed. The fluorescein angiography showed CNV leakage area in treatment group vs control group was 3.407 ± 0.2939 vs 5.202 ± 0.9001 (P = .0133) at day 7th post laser-induced CNV, 1.138 ± 0.4334 vs 3.122 ± 0.3466 (P = .0064) at day 14th, 1.401 ± 0.6577 vs 2.781 ± 0.9815 (P = .00262) at day 21th respectively. Moreover, pharmacokinetics analysis in rat retina showed that E7080 rapidly penetrated the blood-retina  to retina through oral administration. The T in retina was 3.81 ± 0.77 h, the T was 4.60 ± 0.73 h, the AUC was 110448.51 ± 18532.51 h*ng/g after a single dose administration analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). In conclusion, our study suggested that orally administered E7080 can be a novel therapeutic strategy for neovascular AMD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting prodrug, dopa-CBT, inhibited the uptake of the LAT1 substrate [C]-l-leucine in LAT1-expressing MCF-7 cells with an IC value of 28 µM, which was 3.5-times lower than that of the gold standard for dopamine replacement therapy, l-dopa (IC ca. 100 µM). Despite its high affinity for LAT1, dopa-CBT was transported via LAT1 into MCF-7 cells 850-times more slowly (V < 3 pmol/min/mg) than l-dopa (V 2.6 nmol/min/mg), most likely due to its large size compared to l-dopa. However, dopa-CBT was significantly more stable in 10% rat liver homogenate than l-dopa, releasing dopamine and , an endogenous dopamine precursor, slowly, which indicates that it may serve as a dual carrier of dopamine across the blood-brain  selectively expressing LAT1.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

KY-226 restores Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reduction in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of KY-226 are unclear. To address this, the effects of KY-226 on blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction were examined in tMCAO mice. KY-226 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to ICR mice 30 min after 2 h of tMCAO. To assess Akt or ERK involvement, wortmannin (i.c.v.) or U0126 (i.v.), selective inhibitors of PI3K and ERK, respectively, were administered to mice 30 min before ischemia. BBB integrity was assessed by Evans blue leakage 24 h post-reperfusion. The levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were measured by western blotting; ZO-1 mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. Compared to vehicle, KY-226 treatment prevented BBB breakdown and reduction in TJ protein levels. KY-226 treatment restored ZO-1 mRNA levels post-reperfusion. Pre-administration of wortmannin or U0126 blocked the protective effects of KY-226 on ZO-1 protein and mRNA reduction in tMCAO mice. In bEnd.3 cells, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced mRNA and protein levels of ZO-1, an effect rescued by KY-226 treatment. Further, KY-226 treatment restored phosphorylation of pAkt (T308) and its downstream target forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) (S256) in bEnd.3 cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that KY-226 protects BBB integrity by restoration of TJ proteins, an effect partly mediated by Akt/FoxO1 pathway activation. Thus, protection of BBB integrity likely underlies KY-226-induced neuroprotection in tMCAO mice.Copyright © 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Breakdown of acetaldehyde by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in the mitochondria consumes NAD and generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which represents a fundamental mechanism in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). A mitochondria-targeted lipophilic ubiquinone (MitoQ) has been shown to confer greater protection against oxidative damage in the mitochondria compared to untargeted antioxidants. The present study aimed to investigate if MitoQ could preserve mitochondrial ALDH2 activity and speed up acetaldehyde clearance, thereby protects against ALD. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to alcohol for 8 weeks with MitoQ supplementation (5mg/kg/d) for the last 4 weeks. MitoQ ameliorated alcohol-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and glutathione deficiency. It also reversed alcohol-reduced hepatic ALDH activity and accelerated acetaldehyde clearance through modulating ALDH2 cysteine S-nitrosylation,  nitration and 4-hydroxynonenol adducts formation. MitoQ ameliorated nitric oxide (NO) donor-mediated ADLH2 S-nitrosylation and nitration in Hepa-1c1c7 cells under glutathion depletion condition. In addition, alcohol-increased circulating acetaldehyde levels were accompanied by reduced intestinal ALDH activity and impaired intestinal . In accordance, MitoQ reversed alcohol-increased plasma endotoxin levels and hepatic toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NF-κB signaling along with subsequent inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration. MitoQ also reversed alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation through enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation. Alcohol-induced ER stress and apoptotic cell death signaling were reversed by MitoQ. This study demonstrated that speeding up acetaldehyde clearance by preserving ALDH2 activity critically mediates the beneficial effect of MitoQ on alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The present study was aimed to understand the neuroprotective effect of acteoside and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neural damage in zebrafish model was used to study the protective effect of acteoside on Parkinson's disease (PD). Locomotion behavioral test showed that acteoside could prevent 6-OHDA-stimulated movement disorders. Anti- hydroxylase (TH) whole-mount immunostaining analysis showed that acteoside could prevent 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron death. In addition, pretreatment with acteoside could upregulate antioxidative enzymes by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in zebrafish. Meanwhile, acteoside was found to be distributed in the brain after intraperitoneal injection into the adult zebrafish, indicating that this compound could penetrate the blood-brain- (BBB). This study demonstrated that acteoside could penetrate BBB and have potential therapeutic value for PD by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and attenuating the oxidative stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

There are several reasons for this high rate of mortality, including metastasis to several organs, especially the brain. In fact, lung cancer is responsible for approximately 50% of all brain metastases, which are very difficult to manage. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer-associated brain metastasis brings up novel therapeutic promises with the hope to ameliorate the severity of the disease. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of lung cancer dissemination and metastasis to the brain, as well as promising horizons for impeding lung cancer brain metastasis, including the role of cancer stem cells, the blood-brain , interactions of lung cancer cells with the brain microenvironment and lung cancer-driven systemic processes, as well as the role of growth factor/receptor  kinases, cell adhesion molecules and non-coding RNAs. In addition, we provide an overview of current and novel therapeutic approaches, including radiotherapy, surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery, chemotherapy, as also targeted cancer stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-based therapies, micro-RNA-based therapies and other small molecule or antibody-based therapies. We will also discuss the daunting potential of some combined therapies.The identification of molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer metastasis has opened up new avenues towards their eradication and provides interesting opportunities for future research aimed at the development of novel targeted therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343896>Mutational Landscape of Secondary Glioblastoma Guides MET-Targeted Trial in Brain Tumor.</a></h1><p>Low-grade gliomas almost invariably progress into secondary glioblastoma (sGBM) with limited therapeutic option and poorly understood mechanism. By studying the mutational landscape of 188 sGBMs, we find significant enrichment of TP53 mutations, somatic hypermutation, MET-exon-14-skipping (METex14), PTPRZ1-MET (ZM) fusions, and MET amplification. Strikingly, METex14 frequently co-occurs with ZM fusion and is present in ∼14% of cases with significantly worse prognosis. Subsequent studies show that METex14 promotes glioma progression by prolonging MET activity. Furthermore, we describe a MET kinase inhibitor, PLB-1001, that demonstrates remarkable potency in selectively inhibiting MET-altered tumor cells in preclinical models. Importantly, this compound also shows blood-brain  permeability and is subsequently applied in a phase I clinical trial that enrolls MET-altered chemo-resistant glioma patients. Encouragingly, PLB-1001 achieves partial response in at least two advanced sGBM patients with rarely significant side effects, underscoring the clinical potential for precisely treating gliomas using this therapy.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the three most common causes of brain metastases. Although the exact incidence of brain metastases is unclear, there appears to be an increasing incidence which has been attributed to longer survival, better control of systemic disease, and better imaging modalities. Until recently surgical resection of solitary or symptomatic brain metastases, and radiation therapy (either whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiation) were the mainstay of treatment for patients with brain metastases. The majority of traditional chemotherapies have shown limited activity in the central nervous system, which has been attributed to the blood-brain  and the molecular structure of the used agents. The discovery of driver mutations and drugs targeting these mutations has changed the treatment landscape. Several of these targeted small-molecule  kinase inhibitors do cross the blood-brain  and/or have shown activity in the central nervous system. Another major advance in the care of brain metastases has been the advent of new immunotherapeutic agents, for which initial studies have shown intracranial activity. In this chapter, we will review the unique challenges in the treatment of brain metastases. The pertinent clinical studies of chemotherapy in brain metastases will be discussed. The currently reported clinical trials and evidence for use of targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic agents will be emphasized.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TREM2 transmits the signals involved in microglial survival, proliferation, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. A recent study indicated that a loss of TREM2  causes greater amounts of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to a dysfunctional response of microglia to amyloid plaques, suggesting that TREM2 facilitates Aβ clearance by microglia. TREM2/DAP12-mediated microglial response limits diffusion and toxicity of amyloid plaques by forming a protective . However, the levels of Aβ deposition in postmortem brains of NHD, where the biological  of the TREM2/DAP12 signaling pathway is completely lost, remain to be investigated. By immunohistochemistry, we studied the expression of Aβ and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of five NHD cases. Although we identified several small Aβ-immunoreactive spheroids, amyloid plaques were almost undetectable in NHD brains. We found a small number of p-tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing neurons in NHD brains. Because AD pathology is less evident in NHD than the full-brown AD, it does not play an active role in the development of NHD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986830>Studies of Lassa Virus Cell Entry.</a></h1><p>Host cell entry is the first and most fundamental step of every virus infection and represents a major  for zoonotic transmission and viral emergence.

We discovered that the immediate effect of SRC activation was to transiently enhance endothelial   as the result of accumulation of VE cadherin at AJs and formation of morphologically distinct reticular AJs. Endothelial  enhancement via SRC required phosphorylation of VE cadherin at Y731. In contrast, prolonged SRC activation induced VE cadherin phosphorylation at Y685, resulting in increased endothelial permeability. Thus, time-variant SRC activation differentially phosphorylates VE cadherin and shapes AJs to fine-tune endothelial  .

The tight temporal and spatial control of the  phosphorylation status of proteins by protein  kinases (PTKs) and protein  phosphatases (PTPs) is critical to cellular homeostasis as well as to adaptations to the external environment.

The roles of various PTKs and PTPs in acute lung injury and repair, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary vascular disease, and inflammatory airway disease are discussed in this review. It is important to note that although there is overlap among many of these proteins in various disease states, the mechanisms by which they influence the pathogenesis of these conditions differ, suggesting wide-ranging roles for these enzymes and their potential as therapeutic targets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562971>Galangin Inhibits Thrombin-Induced MMP-9 Expression in SK-N-SH Cells via Protein Kinase-Dependent NF-κB Phosphorylation.</a></h1><p>Galangin, a member of the flavonol compounds of the flavonoids, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types. It has been used for the treatment of arthritis, airway inflammation, stroke, and cognitive impairment. Thrombin, one of the regulators of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), has been known as a vital factor of physiological and pathological processes, including cell migration, the blood⁻brain  breakdown, brain edema formation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. MMP-9 especially may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effect of galangin in combating thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression is not well understood in neurons. Therefore, we attempted to explore the molecular mechanisms by which galangin inhibited MMP-9 expression and cell migration induced by thrombin in SK-N-SH cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line). Gelatin zymography, western blot, real-time PCR, and cell migration assay were used to elucidate the inhibitory effects of galangin on the thrmbin-mediated responses. The results showed that galangin markedly attenuated the thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of proto-oncogene -protein kinase (c-Src), proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2), protein kinase C (PKC)α/β/δ, protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK)1/2, p38 MAPK, forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), p65, and c-Jun and suppressed MMP-9 expression and cell migration in SK-N-SH cells. Our results concluded that galangin blocked the thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting c-Src, Pyk2, PKCα/βII/δ, Akt, mTOR, p42/p44 MAPK, JNK1/2, p38 MAPK, FoxO1, c-Jun, and p65 phosphorylation and ultimately attenuated cell migration.

Cholesterol crystals increased endothelial  permeability in a dose and time dependent manner. In addition, cholesterol crystals induced  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and α-catenin, disrupting endothelial AJ and its   and these effects required xanthine oxidase-mediated HO production, SHP2 inactivation and Frk activation. Similarly, feeding C57BL/6 mice with cholesterol-rich diet increased xanthine oxidase expression, HO production, SHP2 inactivation and Frk activation leading to enhanced  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and α-catenin, thereby disrupting endothelial AJ and increasing vascular permeability. Resolvin D1, a specialized proresolving mediator, prevented all these adverse effects of cholesterol crystals and cholesterol-rich diet in endothelial cells and mice, respectively. Based on these observations, it is likely that cholesterol crystals via disrupting AJ increase vascular permeability, a critical event of endothelial dysfunction and specialized proresolving mediators such as Resolvin D1 exert protection against these effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AZD3759 is a novel EGFR  kinase inhibitor with high capability to penetrate the blood-brain . We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of AZD3759 in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with brain and leptomeningeal metastases.This open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study was undertaken at 11 centres and hospitals in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the USA. Eligible patients included those with histologically confirmed, advanced-stage, EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The study was done in two parts, with dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases. In the dose-escalation phase, patients who had progressed after treatment with an EGFR  kinase inhibitor received AZD3759 at 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 500 mg twice a day. In the dose-expansion phase, AZD3759 at 200 mg or 300 mg twice a day was administered to patients with either brain or leptomeningeal metastases who had never received an EGFR  kinase inhibitor and patients with leptomeningeal metastases who had been pretreated with an EGFR  kinase inhibitor. The primary objective was safety and tolerability, with severity of adverse events assessed with the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between Nov 18, 2014, and Sept 7, 2016, 67 patients with NSCLC were enrolled into the study, 29 to the dose-escalation phase and 38 to the dose-expansion phase. At data cutoff (Dec 12, 2016), three (10%) patients in the dose-escalation phase and 20 (53%) in the dose-expansion phase were still receiving treatment. Dose-limiting toxic effects occurred in two (67%) of three patients who received 500 mg twice a day in the dose-escalation phase (grade 3 acne [n=1] and intolerable grade 2 mucosal inflammation [n=1]); hence, doses of 200 mg and 300 mg twice a day were selected for further assessment in the dose-expansion phase. Drug-related skin and gastrointestinal disorders of any grade occurred in 35 (92%) and 29 (76%) patients in the dose-expansion phase, respectively, and led to treatment discontinuation in one (4%) patient treated with 200 mg twice a day (grade 3 increase of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and two (13%) patients given 300 mg twice a day (grade 3 diarrhoea [n=1] and grade 3 skin rash [n=1]). Grade 3 skin and gastrointestinal disorders occurred in four (17%) and two (9%) patients, respectively, at a dose of 200 mg twice a day, and in six (40%) and four (27%) patients, respectively, at a dose of 300 mg twice a day. No grade 4 disorders arose. Other grade 3 disorders included hepatobiliary and renal disorders (three [13%] at 200 mg twice a day), asthenia (one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day), infections and infestations (one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (one [4%] at 200 mg twice a day and one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day).AZD3759 at a dose of 200 mg twice daily showed a tolerable safety profile in patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases who had either never received a  kinase inhibitor or who had been pretreated with a  kinase inhibitor. The good penetration of the blood-brain  by AZD3759, and its promising clinical activity, support further assessment of this compound in studies.AstraZeneca.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous BioID proximity labeling of tight and adherens junction proteins suggested that SORBS2 is a component of the apical junction complex of epithelial cells. We asked whether SORBS2 plays a previously unappreciated role in controlling perijunctional actin and tight junction  . Using super resolution imaging we confirmed that SORBS2 is localized at the apical junction complex but farther from the membrane than ZO-1 and located partially overlapping both the tight- and adherens junctions with a periodic concentration that alternates with myosin IIB in polarized epithelial cells. Overexpression of GFP-SORBS2 recruited alpha-actinin, vinculin and N-WASP, and possibly CIP4 to cellular junctions. However, CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out of SORBS2 did not alter the localization- or immunofluorescent staining intensity of these or several other junctional- and cytoskeletal proteins. SORBS2 knock-out also did not affect the   as measured by TER and dextran flux; nor did it change actin-dependent junction re-assembly as measured by Ca2+-switch and Latrunculin-B wash-out assays. The kinetics of HGF-induced cell scattering and wound healing, and dextran flux increase induced by PDGF also were unaffected by SORBS2 knock-out. SORBS2 concentrates with apical junctional actin that accumulates in response to knock-down of ZO-1 and ZO-2. In spite of our finding that SORBS2 is clearly a component of the apical junction complex, it does not appear to be required for either normal tight- or adherens junction assembly, structure or  or for growth factor-mediated changes in tight junction dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167383>C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) regulates the tricellular junction protein Gliotactin independent of Src.</a></h1><p>Tricellular junctions (TCJs) are uniquely placed permeability barriers formed at the corners of polarized epithelia where tight junctions in vertebrates or septate junctions (SJ) in invertebrates from three cells converge. Gliotactin is a  TCJ protein, and loss of Gliotactin results in SJ and TCJ breakdown and permeability  loss. When overexpressed, Gliotactin spreads away from the TCJs, resulting in disrupted epithelial architecture, including overproliferation, cell delamination, and migration. Gliotactin levels are tightly controlled at the mRNA level and at the protein level through endocytosis and degradation triggered by  phosphorylation. We identified C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) as a  kinase responsible for regulating Gliotactin endocytosis. Increased Csk suppresses the Gliotactin overexpression phenotypes by increasing endocytosis. Loss of Csk causes Gliotactin to spread away from the TCJ. Although Csk is known as a negative regulator of Src kinases, the effects of Csk on Gliotactin are independent of Src and likely occur through an adherens junction associated complex. Overall, we identified a new Src-independent role for Csk in the control of Gliotactin, a key tricellular junction protein.© 2018 Samarasekera and Auld.

A peptide, termed PIP 640, with the capacity to regulate the transient opening of intestinal TJ structures through an endogenous mechanism involving the induction of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation at serine 19 (MLC-pS) has provided a promising new method to enhance the in vivo oral bioavailability of peptide therapeutics. PIP 640 is a decapeptide composed of all D-amino acids (rrdykvevrr-NH) that contains a central sequence designed to emulates a specific domain of C-kinase potentiated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor-17 kDa (CPI-17) surrounded by positively-charged amino acids that provide a cell penetrating peptide (CPP)-like character. Here, we examine compositional requirements of PIP 640 with regard to its actions on MLC phosphorylation, its intracellular localization to TJ structures, and its interactions with MLC phosphatase (MLCP) elements that correlate with enhanced solute uptake. These studies showed that a glutamic acid and  within this peptide are critical for PIP 640 to retain its ability to increase MLC-pS levels and enhance the permeability of macromolecular solutes of the size range of therapeutic peptides without detectable cytotoxicity. On the other hand, exchange of the aspartic acid for alanine and then arginine resulted in an increasingly greater bias toward protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) relative to MLCP inhibition, an outcome that resulted in increased paracellular permeability for solutes in the size range of therapeutic peptides, but with a significant increase in cytotoxicity. Together, these data further our understanding of the composition requirements of PIP 640 with respect to the desired goal of transiently altering the intestinal epithelial cell paracellular  properties through an endogenous mechanism, providing a novel approach to enhance the oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed therapeutic agents of < ~ 5 kDa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A population of CD301b-expressing DCs has recently been identified in non-lymphoid  tissues such as skin. However, whether CD301b DCs in the skin represent an ontogenetically unique subpopulation of migratory cDCs has not been fully addressed. Here, we demonstrated that CD301b dermal DCs were distinct subpopulation of FMS-like  kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L)-dependent CD11b cDC2 lineage, which required an additional GM-CSF cue for the adequate development. Although the majority of lymphoid-resident cDC2 lacked CD301b expression, dermal migratory cDC2 contained a substantial fraction of CD301b subset. Similar to CD301b population, CD301b dermal DC development was closely regulated by FLT3 signaling, suggesting their common origin from FLT3L-responsive cDC progenitors. However, FLT3L-driven cDC progenitor culture was not sufficient, but additional GM-CSF treatment was required to produce CD301b cDC2. In vivo development of CD301b cDC2 was significantly augmented by exogenous GM-CSF, while the repopulation of CD301b dermal cDC2 was abrogated by GM-CSF neutralization. Functionally, CD301b cDC2 was capable of producing a high level of IL-23, and the depletion of CD301b cDC2 effectively prevented IL-17-mediated psoriasiform dermatitis. Therefore, our findings highlight the differentiation program of a distinct CD301b dermal cDC2 subset in the skin and its involvement in psoriatic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Treatment of EGFR-mutant GBM cell lines with the EGFR/HER2  kinase inhibitor lapatinib can effectively induce cell death in these models. However, EGFR inhibitors have shown little efficacy in the clinic, partly because of inappropriate dosing. Here, we developed a computational approach to model the in vitro cellular dynamics of the EGFR-mutant cell line SF268 in response to different lapatinib concentrations and dosing schedules. We then used this approach to identify an effective treatment strategy within the clinical toxicity limits of lapatinib, and developed a partial differential equation modeling approach to study the in vivo GBM treatment response by taking into account the heterogeneous and diffusive nature of the disease. Despite the inability of lapatinib to induce tumor regressions with a continuous daily schedule, our modeling approach consistently predicts that continuous dosing remains the best clinically feasible strategy for slowing down tumor growth and lowering overall tumor burden, compared to pulsatile schedules currently known to be tolerated, even when considering drug resistance, reduced lapatinib tumor concentrations due to the blood brain , and the phenotypic switch from proliferative to migratory cell phenotypes that occurs in hypoxic microenvironments. Our mathematical modeling and statistical analysis platform provides a rational method for comparing treatment schedules in search for optimal dosing strategies for glioblastoma and other cancer types.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29063053>Management of breast cancer brain metastases: Focus on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer.</a></h1><p>After the introduction of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the overall survival (OS) among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has been substantially improved. However, among these patients, the incidence of brain metastases (BM) has been increasing and an increased proportion of them have died of intracranial progression, which makes HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) a critical issue of concern. For local control of limited BM, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical resection are available modalities with different clinical indications. Postoperative or preoperative radiation is usually delivered in conjunction with surgical resection to boost local control. Adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) should be deferred for limited BM because of its impairment of neurocognitive  while having no benefit for OS. Although WBRT is still the standard treatment for local control of diffuse BM, SRS is a promising treatment for diffuse BM as the technique continues to improve. Although large molecules have difficulty crossing the blood brain , trastuzumab-containing regimens are critical for treating HER2-positive BCBM patients because they significantly prolong OS.  kinase inhibitors are more capable of crossing into the brain and they have been shown to be beneficial for treating BM in HER2-positive patients, especially lapatinib combined with capecitabine. The antiangiogenic agent, bevacizumab, can be applied in the HER2-positive BCBM scenario as well. In this review, we also discuss several strategies for delivering drugs into the central nervous system and several microRNAs that have the potential to become biomarkers of BCBM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032814>Penetration of the blood-brain  by avitinib and its control of intra/extra-cranial disease in non-small cell lung cancer harboring the T790M mutation.</a></h1><p>Avitinib is an oral, potent, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitor selective for the EGFR T790 M mutation. We report the safety, intra-/extracranial efficacy, and the blood-brain  (BBB) penetration rate of avitinib ().Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the EGFR T790 M mutation were orally administered avitinib (150-300 mg) twice daily for cycles of 28 continuous days. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples (2 ml each) were collected on day 29 in available patients with brain metastases, and the tumor response was assessed.Sixteen NSCLC patients were included, of whom nine (60.0%) achieved a partial response, and five (33.3%) achieved stable disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 247 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 154.8-339.2) and 536 days (95%CI: 363.6-708.4), respectively. The median intracranial PFS of seven brain metastases patients was 142 days (95% CI 31.1-252.9). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of five brain metastases patients showed the BBB penetration rate to be 0.046%-0.146%. The most frequent adverse events were mild and reversible hepatic transaminases elevating (10/16, 62.5%) and diarrhea (4/16, 25.0%).Avitinib is well tolerated and efficacious in T790M-positive patients. Its penetrability to the BBB is weak, but it showed good control of asymptomatic brain metastases. Further studies are proceeding.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nearly all other unicellular eukaryotes lack intact phosphotyrosine signaling pathways. However, many of these organisms have primitive phosphotyrosine-binding proteins and  phosphatases, leading to the assumption that the major  for emergence of phosphotyrosine signaling was the negative consequences of promiscuous  kinase activity. In this work, we reveal that the classic oncogene v-Src, which phosphorylates many dozens of proteins in yeast, is toxic because it disrupts a specific spore wall remodeling pathway. Using genetic selections, we find that expression of a specific cyclic peptide, or overexpression of SMK1, a MAP kinase that controls spore wall assembly, both lead to robust growth despite a continuous high level of phosphotyrosine in the yeast proteome. Thus, minimal genetic manipulations allow yeast to tolerate high levels of phosphotyrosine. These results indicate that the introduction of  kinases within single-celled organisms may not have been a major obstacle to the evolution of phosphotyrosine signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888824>Structure and  of Tryptophan- Dyads in Biomimetic β Hairpins.</a></h1><p>-tryptophan (YW) dyads are ubiquitous structural motifs in enzymes and play roles in proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and, possibly, protection from oxidative stress. Here, we describe the  of YW dyads in de novo designed 18-mer, β hairpins. In Peptide M, a YW dyad is formed between W14 and Y5. A UV hypochromic effect and an excitonic Cotton signal are observed, in addition to singlet, excited state (W*) and fluorescence emission spectral shifts. In a second Peptide, Peptide MW, a Y5-W13 dyad is formed diagonally across the strand and distorts the backbone. On a picosecond timescale, the W* excited-state decay kinetics are similar in all peptides but are accelerated relative to amino acids in solution. In Peptide MW, the W* spectrum is consistent with increased conformational flexibility. In Peptide M and MW, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra obtained after UV photolysis are characteristic of  and tryptophan radicals at 160 K. Notably, at pH 9, the radical photolysis yield is decreased in Peptide M and MW, compared to that in a  and tryptophan mixture. This protective effect is not observed at pH 11 and is not observed in peptides containing a tryptophan-histidine dyad or tryptophan alone. The YW dyad protective effect is attributed to an increase in the radical recombination rate. This increase in rate can be facilitated by hydrogen-bonding interactions, which lower the  for the PCET reaction at pH 9. These results suggest that the YW dyad structural motif promotes radical quenching under conditions of reactive oxygen stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29160307>A non-canonical Notch complex regulates adherens junctions and vascular  .</a></h1><p>The vascular  that separates blood from tissues is actively regulated by the endothelium and is essential for transport, inflammation, and haemostasis. Haemodynamic shear stress plays a critical role in maintaining endothelial  , but how this occurs remains unknown. Here we use an engineered organotypic model of perfused microvessels to show that activation of the transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 directly regulates vascular   through a non-canonical, transcription-independent signalling mechanism that drives assembly of adherens junctions, and confirm these findings in mouse models. Shear stress triggers DLL4-dependent proteolytic activation of NOTCH1 to expose the transmembrane domain of NOTCH1. This domain mediates establishment of the endothelial ; expression of the transmembrane domain of NOTCH1 is sufficient to rescue defects in   induced by knockout of NOTCH1. The transmembrane domain restores   by catalysing the formation of a receptor complex in the plasma membrane consisting of vascular endothelial cadherin, the transmembrane protein  phosphatase LAR, and the RAC1 guanidine-exchange factor TRIO. This complex activates RAC1 to drive assembly of adherens junctions and establish  . Canonical transcriptional signalling via Notch is highly conserved in metazoans and is required for many processes in vascular development, including arterial-venous differentiation, angiogenesis and remodelling. We establish the existence of a non-canonical cortical NOTCH1 signalling pathway that regulates vascular  , and thus provide a mechanism by which a single receptor might link transcriptional programs with adhesive and cytoskeletal remodelling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440220>Variant cell cycles regulated by Notch signaling control cell size and ensure a functional blood-brain .</a></h1><p>Regulation of cell size is crucial in development. In plants and animals two cell cycle variants are employed to generate large cells by increased ploidy: the endocycle and endomitosis. The rationale behind the choice of which of these cycles is implemented is unknown. We show that in the  nervous system the subperineurial glia (SPG) are unique in using both the endocycle and endomitosis to grow. In the brain, the majority of SPG initially endocycle, then switch to endomitosis during larval development. The Notch signaling pathway and the String Cdc25 phosphatase are crucial for the endocycle versus endomitosis choice, providing the means experimentally to change cells from one to the other. This revealed fundamental insights into the control of cell size and the properties of endomitotic cells. Endomitotic cells attain a higher ploidy and larger size than endocycling cells, and endomitotic SPG are necessary for the blood-brain . Decreased Notch signaling promotes endomitosis even in the ventral nerve cord SPG that normally are mononucleate, but not in the endocycling salivary gland cells, revealing tissue-specific cell cycle responses.© 2018.

Leukocytes can change in response to environmental changes in anurans, making them an important biomarker of stressful situations. The initial  against UV in ectothermic animals is melanin-containing cells in skin and in their internal organs. Here, we tested the effects of UV exposure on immune cells and DNA integrity in pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles of Lithobates catesbeianus. We used an inflammation model with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli to test synergic effects of UV and LPS. We tested the following hypotheses: 1) DNA damage caused by UV will be more pronounced in non-pigmented than in pigmented animals; 2) LPS increases leukocytes in both pigmented and non-pigmented animals by systemic inflammation; 3) The combined LPS and UV exposure will decrease the number of leukocytes. We found that the frequency of immune cells differed between pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles. UV exposure increased mast cells and DNA damage in erythrocytes in both pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles, while leukocytes decreased after UV exposure. Non-pigmented tadpoles experienced DNA damage and a lower lymphocyte count earlier than pigmented tadpoles. UV altered immune cells likely as a consequence of local and systemic inflammation. These alterations were less severe in pigmented than in non-pigmented animals. UV and LPS increased internal melanin in pigmented tadpoles, which were correlated with DNA damage and leukocytes. Here, we described for the first time the effects of UV and LPS in immune cells of pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles. In addition, we demonstrated that internal melanin in tadpoles help in these defenses, since leukocyte responses were faster in non-pigmented animals, supporting the hypothesis that melanin is involved in the initial innate immune response.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These diseases are increasing in prevalence, and there are currently no cures. Previous work from our group and others has shown that  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can stimulate autophagy, decrease pathological proteins, and improve symptoms in models of neurodegeneration. Here we examined the role of pazopanib in mouse models that express either human mutant P301L tau (TauP301L) or triple mutant amyloid precursor protein (3x-AβPP). The TauP301L mouse expresses P301L tau under the control of a prion promoter in both neurons and astrocytes, reminiscent of some human tauopathies. Pazopanib crosses the blood-brain  with no detectable peripheral off-side effects, and decreases p-tau in TauP301L mice. Pazopanib reaches a brain concentration sufficient for inhibition of several  kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs). Further, pazopanib does not affect microglia but reduces astrocyte levels toward nontransgenic controls in TauP301L mice. Pazopanib does not alter amyloid beta levels or astrocytes in 3x-AβPP mice but modulates a number of inflammatory markers (IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES). These data suggest that pazopanib may be involved in p-tau clearance and modulation of astrocytic activity in models of tauopathies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30484856>Effects of Tyr555 and Trp678 on the processivity of cellobiohydrolase A from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum: A simulation study.</a></h1><p>Cellobiohydrolase A from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum (Cbh9A) is a processive exoglucanase from family 9 and is an important cellobiohydrolase that hydrolyzes cello-oligosaccharide into cellobiose. Residues Tyr555 and Trp678 considerably affect catalytic activity, but their mechanisms are still unknown. To investigate how the Tyr555 and Trp678 affect the processivity of Cbh9A, conventional molecular dynamics, steered molecular dynamics, and free energy calculation were performed to simulate the processive process of wild type (WT)-Cbh9A, Y555S mutant, and W678G mutant. Analysis of simulation results suggests that the binding free energies between the substrate and WT-Cbh9A are lower than those of Y555S and W678G mutants. The pull forces and energy  in Y555S and W678G mutants also reduced significantly during the steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation compared with that of the WT-Cbh9A.

Preclinical evidence indicates that Nilotinib reduces the level of brain alpha-synuclein and attenuates inflammation in models of Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously showed that Nilotinib penetrates the blood-brain  (BBB) and potentially improves clinical outcomes in individuals with PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We performed a physiologically based population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (popPK/PD) study to determine the effects of Nilotinib in a cohort of 75 PD participants. Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) into five groups (n = 15) and received open-label random single dose (RSD) 150:200:300:400 mg Nilotinib vs placebo. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after Nilotinib administration. The results show that Nilotinib enters the brain in a dose-independent manner and 200 mg Nilotinib increases the level of 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), suggesting alteration to dopamine metabolism. Nilotinib significantly reduces plasma total alpha-synuclein and appears to reduce CSF oligomeric: total alpha-synuclein ratio. Furthermore, Nilotinib significantly increases the CSF level of triggering receptors on myeloid cells (TREM)-2, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. Taken together, 200 mg Nilotinib appears to be an optimal single dose that concurrently reduces inflammation and engages surrogate disease biomarkers, including dopamine metabolism and alpha-synuclein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706999>Intranasal Administration of Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Human Teeth Stem Cells Improves Motor Symptoms and Normalizes  Hydroxylase Expression in the Substantia Nigra and Striatum of the 6-Hydroxydopamine-Treated Rats.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. At present, there is no effective cure for PD; treatments are symptomatic and do not halt progression of neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can cross the blood-brain  and represent promising alternative to the classical treatment strategies. In the present study, we examined therapeutic effects of intranasal administration of EVs derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth stem cells (SHEDs) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) medial forebrain bundle (MFB) rat model of PD. CatWalk gait tests revealed that EVs effectively suppressed 6-OHDA-induced gait impairments. All tested gait parameters (stand, stride length, step cycle, and duty cycle) were significantly improved in EV-treated animals when compared with 6-OHDA-lesion group rats. Furthermore, EVs slowed down numbers of 6-OHDA-induced contralateral rotations in apomorphine test. Improvements in motor  correlated with normalization of  hydroxylase expression in the striatum and substantia nigra. In conclusion, we demonstrated, for the first time, the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal administration of EVs derived from SHEDs in a rat model of PD induced by 6-OHDA intra-MFB lesion.

Pentamidine, an old-developed antiprotozoal drug, currently used for pneumocystis carinii is one of the most potent inhibitors of S100B activity, but despite this effect, is limited by its low capability to cross blood brain  (BBB). To overcome this problem, we developed a non-invasive intranasal delivery system, chitosan coated niosomes with entrapped pentamidine (inPentasomes), in the attempt to provide a novel pharmacological approach to ameliorate parkinsonism induced by subchronic MPTP administration in C57BL-6 J mice. inPentasomes, prepared by evaporation method was administered daily by intranasal route in subchronic MPTP-intoxicated rodents and resulted in a dose-dependent manner (0.001-0.004 mg/kg) capable for a significant  Hydroxylase (TH) positive neuronal density rescue in both striatum and substantia nigra of parkinsonian mice. In parallel, inPentasomes significantly decreased the extent of glial-related neuroinflammation through the reduction of specific gliotic markers (Iba-1, GFAP, COX-2, iNOS) with consequent PGE and NO release reduction, in nigrostriatal system. inPentasomes-mediated S100B inhibition resulted in a RAGE/NF-κB pathway downstream inhibition in the nigrostriatal circuit, causing a marked amelioration of motor performances in intoxicated mice. On the basis of our results, chitosan coated niosomes loaded with pentamidine, the inPentasome system, self-candidates as a promising new intranasal approach to mitigate parkinsonism in humans and possibly paves the way for a possible clinical repositioning of pentamidine as anti-PD drug.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental results indicated that SY can quench the fluorescence of pepsin with static quenching. The apparent binding constant K and binding site number n were evaluated at different temperatures. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that SY interact with pepsin spontaneously by van der Waal's forces and hydrogen bond formation. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectra showed that pepsin undergoes a slightly conformation change when it interacts with SY. The molecular dynamics simulation (MD) revealed that the binding site is located mainly on the  residues at the entrance of the active site of pepsin and the main interactions occurred between SY and pepsin are hydrogen bond and stacking interactions, according to experimental results. Furthermore, the binding between SY and pepsin can inhibit pepsin activity.

Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) is a context-dependent regulator of vascular leakage that signals via both endothelial TEK receptor  kinase (TIE2) and integrins. Here, we show that antibodies against β1-integrin decrease LPS-induced vascular leakage in murine endotoxemia, as either a preventative or an intervention therapy. β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo improved the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions and protected mice from endotoxemia-associated cardiac failure, without affecting endothelial inflammation, serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, or TIE receptor signaling. Moreover, conditional deletion of a single allele of endothelial β1-integrin protected mice from LPS-induced vascular leakage. In endothelial monolayers, the inflammatory agents thrombin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IL-1β decreased junctional vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and induced actin stress fibers via β1- and α5-integrins and ANGPT2. Additionally, β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies prevented inflammation-induced endothelial cell contractility and monolayer permeability. Mechanistically, the inflammatory agents stimulated ANGPT2-dependent translocation of α5β1-integrin into tensin-1-positive fibrillar adhesions, which destabilized the endothelial monolayer. Thus, β1-integrin promotes endothelial  disruption during inflammation, and targeting β1-integrin signaling could serve as a novel means of blocking pathological vascular leak.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Brain is the most affected part of CNS where blood-brain  (BBB) presents a challenge to currently available chemotherapeutic agents as well as first- (erlotinib and gefitinib) and second (afatinib)-generation EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) due to their poor penetrability. A rapid development of EGFR T790M secondary mutation is another cause of treatment failure, and patients tend to progress despite initial response to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs. Moreover, conventional treatments with heavy dose of radiation have a number of side effects compared to benefits attained. Recently, third-generation EGFR TKIs have been developed with proven efficacy in various clinical setups against EGFR mutation-positive cases of brain metastases in NSCLC. One such agent, osimertinib, is available in India. It has not only better penetration ability to BBB compared to other EGFR TKIs but also has significantly increased potency for most prevalent EGFR T790M mutations. Furthermore, it is active in patients who progress upon first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs. The purpose of this review article is to present an updated clinical preview of EGFR TKIs over conventional treatment, mainly radiation therapy to consider them as "use first" agents against EGFR T790M mutation in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523753>GDNF enhances human blood-nerve   in vitro via MAPK signaling pathways.</a></h1><p>The human blood-nerve  (BNB) formed by endoneurial microvascular endothelial cells, serves to maintain the internal microenvironment in peripheral nerves required for normal axonal signal transduction to and from the central nervous system. The mechanisms of human BNB formation in health and disease are not fully elucidated. Prior work established a sufficient role for glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in enhancing human BNB biophysical properties following serum withdrawal in vitro via RET- kinase-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling. The objective of the study was to ascertain the downstream signaling pathway involved in this process and more comprehensively determine the molecular changes that may occur at human BNB intercellular junctions under the influence of GDNF. Proteomic studies suggested expression of several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in confluent GDNF-treated endoneurial endothelial cells following serum withdrawal. Using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing to continuously measure transendothelial electrical resistance and static transwell solute permeability assays with fluoresceinated small and large molecules to evaluate BNB biophysical , we determined MAPK signaling was essential for GDNF-mediated BNB TEER increase following serum withdrawal downstream of RET- kinase signaling that persisted for up to 48 hours in vitro. This increase was associated with reduced solute permeability to fluoresceinated sodium and high molecular weight dextran. Specific GDNF-mediated alterations were detected in cytoskeletal and intercellular junctional complex molecular transcripts and proteins relative to basal conditions without exogenous GDNF.

In addition to protecting against microbial invasion, physical trauma and environmental damage, skin participates in maintaining homeostasis. Skin is also capable of spontaneous self-repair following injury. These functions are mediated by numerous pleiotrophic growth factors, including members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) families. Although growth factor expression has been well documented in mammals, particularly during wound healing, for groups such as reptiles less is known. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of expression of multiple growth factors in normal skin and following a full-thickness cutaneous injury in the representative lizard Eublepharis macularius, the leopard gecko. Unlike mammals, leopard geckos can heal cutaneous wounds without scarring. We demonstrate that before, during and after injury, keratinocytes of the epidermis express a diverse panel of growth factor ligands and receptors, including: VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and phosphorylated VEGFR2; FGF-2 and FGFR1; and phosphorylated SMAD2, TGFβ1, and activin βA. Unexpectedly, only the  kinase receptors VEGFR1 and FGFR1 were dynamically expressed, and only during the earliest phases of re-epithelization; otherwise all the proteins of interest were constitutively present. We propose that the ubiquitous pattern of growth factor expression by keratinocytes is associated with various roles during tissue homeostasis, including protection against ultraviolet photodamage and coordinated body-wide skin shedding.© 2018 Anatomical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247919>P-Glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) Restricts Brain Penetration of the Bruton's  Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib, While Cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) Limits Its Oral Bioavailability.</a></h1><p>Ibrutinib (Imbruvica), an oral  kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for treatment of B-cell malignancies, irreversibly inhibits the Bruton's  kinase (BTK). Its abundant metabolite, dihydrodiol-ibrutinib (ibrutinib-DiOH), which is primarily formed by CYP3A, has a 10-fold reduced BTK inhibitory activity. Using in vitro transport assays and genetically modified mouse models, we investigated whether the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 and the multidrug-metabolizing CYP3A enzyme family can affect the oral bioavailability and tissue disposition of ibrutinib and ibrutinib-DiOH. In vitro, ibrutinib was transported moderately by human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 but not detectably by human ABCG2. In mice, Abcb1 markedly restricted the brain penetration of ibrutinib and ibrutinib-DiOH, either alone or in combination with Abcg2, resulting in 4.5- and 5.9-fold increases in ibrutinib brain-to-plasma ratios in Abcb1a/1b and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 mice relative to wild-type mice. Abcb1 and/or Abcg2 did not obviously restrict ibrutinib oral bioavailability, but Cyp3a deficiency increased the ibrutinib plasma AUC by 9.7-fold compared to wild-type mice. This increase was mostly reversed (5.1-fold reduction) by transgenic human CYP3A4 overexpression, with roughly equal contributions of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 metabolism. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 during ibrutinib therapy might benefit patients with malignancies or (micro)metastases positioned behind an intact blood-brain , or with substantial expression of this transporter in the malignant cells. Moreover, given the strong in vivo impact of CYP3A, inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme family will likely strongly affect ibrutinib oral bioavailability and, thus, its therapeutic efficacy, as well as its toxicity risks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250157>Localization of amyloid beta peptides to locus coeruleus and medial prefrontal cortex in corticotropin releasing factor overexpressing male and female mice.</a></h1><p>A culmination of evidence from the literature points to the Locus Coeruleus (LC)-Norepinephrine system as an underappreciated and understudied area of research in the context of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Stress is a risk factor for developing AD, and is supported by multiple clinical and preclinical studies demonstrating that amplification of the stress system disrupts cellular and molecular processes at the synapse, promoting the production and accumulation of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. Stress-induced activation of the LC is mediated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and CRF receptors exhibit sex-biased stress signaling. Sex differences are evident in the neurochemical, morphological and molecular regulation of LC neurons by CRF, providing a compelling basis for the higher prevalence of stress-related disorders such as AD in females. In the present study, we examined the cellular substrates for interactions between Aβ and  hydroxylase a marker of noradrenergic somatodendritic processes in the LC, and Dopamine-β-Hydroxylase (DβH) in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (ILmPFC) in mice conditionally overexpressing CRF in the forebrain (CRFOE) under a Doxycycline (DOX) regulated tetO promoter. CRFOE was sufficient to elicit a redistribution of Aβ peptides in the somatodendritic processes of the LC of male and female transgenic mice, without altering total Aβ protein expression levels. DOX treated groups exhibited lysosomal compartments with apparent lipofuscin and abnormal morphology, indicating potential dysfunction of these Aβ-clearing compartments. In female DOX treated groups, swollen microvessels with lipid-laden vacuoles were also observed, a sign of blood-brain- dysfunction. Finally, sex differences were observed in the prefrontal cortex, as females responded to DOX treatment with increased frequency of co-localization of Aβ and DβH in noradrenergic axon terminals compared to vehicle treated controls, while male groups showed no significant changes. We hypothesize that the observed sex differences in Aβ distribution in this model of CRF hypersignaling is based on increased responsivity of female rodent CRF in the LC. Aβ production is enhanced during increased neuronal activation, therefore, the excitation of DOX treated female CRFOE LC neurons projecting to the mPFC may exhibit more frequent co-localization with Aβ due to increased neuronal activity of noradrenergic neurons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29147815>ATP-binding cassette transporters limit the brain penetration of Wee1 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Introduction Wee1 is an important kinase involved in the G2 cell cycle checkpoint and frequently upregulated in intracranial neoplasms such as glioblastoma (GBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Two small molecules are available that target Wee1, AZD1775 and PD0166285, and clinical trials with AZD1775 have already been started. Since GBM and DIPG are highly invasive brain tumors, they are at least to some extent protected by the blood-brain  (BBB) and its ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters. Methods We have here conducted a comprehensive set of in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine to what extent two dominant efflux transporters in the BBB, P-gp (ABCB1) and BCRP (ABCG2), exhibit affinity towards AZD1775 and PD0166285 and restrict their brain penetration. Results Using these studies, we demonstrate that AZD1775 is efficiently transported by both P-gp and BCRP, whereas PD0166285 is only a substrate of P-gp. Nonetheless, the brain penetration of both compounds was severely restricted in vivo, as indicated by a 5-fold (PD0166285) and 25-fold (AZD1775) lower brain-plasma ratio in wild type mice compared to Abcb1a/b;Abcg2 mice. Conclusion The brain penetration of these Wee1 inhibitors is severely limited by ABC transporters, which may compromise their clinical efficacy against intracranial neoplasms such as DIPG and GBM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30464169>Integrated mapping of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in a patient-derived xenograft model of glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>Therapeutic options for the treatment of glioblastoma remain inadequate despite concerted research efforts in drug development. Therapeutic failure can result from poor permeability of the blood-brain , heterogeneous drug distribution, and development of resistance. Elucidation of relationships among such parameters could enable the development of predictive models of drug response in patients and inform drug development. Complementary analyses were applied to a glioblastoma patient-derived xenograft model in order to quantitatively map distribution and resulting cellular response to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Mass spectrometry images of erlotinib were registered to histology and magnetic resonance images in order to correlate drug distribution with tumor characteristics. Phosphoproteomics and immunohistochemistry were used to assess protein signaling in response to drug, and integrated with transcriptional response using mRNA sequencing. This comprehensive dataset provides simultaneous insight into pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and indicates that erlotinib delivery to intracranial tumors is insufficient to inhibit EGFR  kinase signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326713>Comparison of the histology of the skin of the Windsnyer, Kolbroek and Large White pigs.</a></h1><p>The skin is a protective , and an endocrine, sensory and thermoregulatory organ. We investigated whether the skin of local pigs had beneficial anatomical traits compared to exotic pigs to withstand the increased heat loads predicted under future climate change scenarios. Full-thickness skin specimens were obtained from the dorsal interscapular, lateral thoraco-abdominal and ventral abdominal regions of intact boars (age 6-8 months) of two local breeds of pigs (Windsnyer [n = 5] and Kolbroek [n = 4]) and an exotic pig breed (Large White [n = 7]). The skin sections were stained with a one-step Mallory-Heidenhain stain and Fontana stain (melanin). Sweat gland perimeter was measured using Image J software. The Windsnyer breed had the thinnest dermis layer while the Large White had the thickest dermis layer across all the three body regions (analysis of variance [ANOVA]; p < 0.001). The Windsnyers had widely spaced dermal pegs compared to the other breeds. The Windsnyers had significantly more superficial and larger (~1 mm depth; 4.4 mm perimeter) sweat glands than the Kolbroek (~3 mm depth; 2.2 mm perimeter) and Large White (~4 mm depth; 2.0 mm perimeter) pigs (ANOVA; p < 0.001). The Windsnyers had visibly more melanin in the basal layer, the Kolbroek pigs had very little and the Large Whites had none. The functionality of the sweat glands of the Windsnyer breed needs to be established. The skin from the Windsnyer breed possesses traits that may confer a protective advantage for the increased solar radiation and ambient temperatures predicted with climate change.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388588>Stereo-preference of camphor for H-bonding with phenol, methanol and chloroform: A combined matrix isolation IR spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigation.</a></h1><p>Camphor is known to be held in the substrate pocket of cytochrome P450cam enzyme via H-bond with a  residue of the enzyme in a unique orientation. This structural exclusivity results in regio- and stereo-specific hydroxylation of camphor by the enzyme. We have carried out a combined IR spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigation to shed light on the factors influencing the conformational exclusivity of 1R-(+)-camphor in the substrate pocket of Cytochrome P450cam, and to determine whether the selectivity is an inherent property of the substrate itself, or is imposed by the enzyme. For this purpose, complexes of camphor have been studied with three H-bond donors namely phenol, methanol and chloroform. Each of the three donors was found to form stable complexes with two distinct conformers; the one mimicking the conformation in enzyme substrate pocket was found to be more stable of the two, for all three donors. Experimentally, both conformers of the H-bonded complexes were identified separately for phenol and methanol in an argon matrix at 8 K, but not for chloroform due to very small energy  for interconversion of the two conformers. In room temperature solution phase spectra of camphor with all three donors, the differences in spectral attributes between the two isomeric H-bonded complexes were lost due to thermal motions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has efficacy against CNS metastases, further treatment modalities are still needed as some of these lesions do not respond to osimertinib, or undergo progression after an initial response to this drug if radiotherapy has already been conducted. Here, we investigated the efficacy of water-soluble erlotinib (NUFS-sErt) against these metastases. This agent was synthesized using a nano-particulation platform technology utilizing fat and supercritical fluid (NUFS™) to resolve the low solubility problem that typically prevents the creation of injectable forms of EGFR-TKIs. The average NUFS-sErt particle size was 236.4 nm, and it showed time-dependent dissolution in culture media. The effects of NUFS-sErt were similar to those of conventional erlotinib in terms of inhibiting the proliferation of EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells and suppressing EGFR signaling. In an intraperitoneal xenograft model of HCC827 cells, intraperitoneal administration of NUFS-sErt produced a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced survival rate. Notably, the injection of NUFS-sErt into the brain ventricle caused significant tumor growth inhibition in an intracranial xenograft model. Hence, our current findings indicate that NUFS-sErt is a novel, water-soluble form of erlotinib that can be administered using intraventricular or intrathecal injections. The target cases would be patients with a progressive CNS metastasis and no other therapeutic options. This drug could also be given intravenously to patients with swallowing difficulties or an inability to ingest due to a medical condition.© 2018 The Authors.

There is increasing evidence that the endothelium plays a crucial and pathogenic role in sepsis. Profound alterations of the endothelium associated with sepsis include increased leucocytes adhesions, shift to a procoagulant state, vasodilatation, altered   with more permeable capillaries and tissue edema. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is involved in the control of microvascular permeability and has been involved in the pathogenesis of conditions associated with endothelial  disruption such as sepsis. sFlt-1 is a soluble variant of the VEGF receptor (Fms-like  kinase-1, Flt-1 or VEGFR-1) able to down-regulate the effects of VEGF by decreasing its signaling. We investigated the possible involvement of sFlt-1 as biomarker of endothelial alteration during sepsis, organ dysfunction and death.Serum levels of s-Flt1 were measured in 170 hospitalized patients (77 with sepsis, confirmed by positive blood culture), and in 18 healthy volunteers. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was determined by using biochemical and clinical parameters. In a small number of patients (9 individuals), s-Flt1 concentration was evaluated after negativization of the blood culture.Serum level of s-Flt1 was significantly higher in septic patients than blood culture-negative patients (277.7 ± 52.7 and 133.4 ± 12.4 pg/mL, respectively, P = 0.0088), both groups of patients had significantly higher concentration of sFlt-1 than healthy individuals (78.9 ± 2.5 pg/mL). Among sepsis cases, 68% was caused by Gram-negative bacteria, 27% by Gram-positive bacteria and 8% by Candida species. Serum level of s-Flt1 showed a significant difference between Gram-negative (274.1 pg/mL) and Gram-positive (145.7 pg/mL) sepsis. SOFA score (evaluated in 20 patients with sFlt-1 >190 pg/mL) showed a positive trend of correlation with the increasing sFlt-1 level. After blood culture negativization, serum level of sFlt-1 decreased (37%).Our findings confirm, in a larger population of patients with sepsis, recent evidences that sFlt-1 levels are higher in patients with complicated-sepsis that evolve to septic shock and suggest that sFlt-1 could be a useful biomarker for sepsis severity. An anti-VEGF effect mediated by sFlt-1 could be hypothesized as salvage compensatory mechanism activated in response to sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30419037>Role of truncated oxidized phospholipids in acute endothelial barrier dysfunction caused by particulate matter.</a></h1><p>Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is a global environmental health problem contributing to more severe lung inflammation and injury. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of PM-induced exacerbation of lung barrier dysfunction and injury are not well understood. In the current study, we tested a hypothesis that PM exacerbates vascular barrier dysfunction via ROS-induced generation of truncated oxidized phospholipids (Tr-OxPLs). Treatment of human pulmonary endothelial cells with PM caused endothelial cell barrier disruption in a dose-dependent fashion. Biochemical analysis showed destabilization of cell junctions by PM via  phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin. These events were accompanied by PM-induced generation of Tr-OxPLs, detected by mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, purified Tr-OxPLs: POVPC, PGPC and lyso-PC alone, caused a rapid increase in endothelial permeability and augmented pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by submaximal doses of PM. In support of a role of TR-OxPLs-dependent mechanism in mediation of PM effects, ectopic expression of intracellular type 2 platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH2), which specifically hydrolyzes Tr-OxPLs, significantly attenuated PM-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. In summary, this study uncovered a novel mechanism of PM-induced sustained dysfunction of pulmonary endothelial cell barrier which is driven by PM-induced generation of truncated products of phospholipid oxidation causing destabilization of cell junctions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29476222>Ibrutinib brain distribution: a preclinical study.</a></h1><p>Central nervous system (CNS) dissemination occurs in 4.1% of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients and clinically significant CNS involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients reaches 4%. Ibrutinib, an orally administered Bruton's  kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has shown substantial activity in CLL or MCL patients with CNS localization, and in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The drug efficacy to treat primary or secondary CNS impairments relies on its brain distribution through the blood-brain  (BBB), the aim of the present work was to study the brain distribution of ibrutinib using an in vivo mice model.Brain and plasma pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib were assessed in a healthy Swiss mice model. Brain accumulation of ibrutinib was evaluated through an escalation single-dose study and a multiple-dose study in whole brain and in its specific anatomic structures. Ibrutinib plasma and brain quantification was performed using a validated liquid-chromatography mass tandem spectrometry method.Maximal concentration of ibrutinib in plasma and brain were close thus showing that ibrutinib rapidly crosses the BBB in 0.29 h (0.2-0.32 h) [median (min-max)]. Ibrutinib brain exposure was also correlated to the dose, and correlated to plasma exposure. AUC brain to AUC plasma ratio average for ibrutinib was found to reach 0.7 and ibrutinib accumulates in the ventricle area.The high level of ibrutinib brain distribution supports the clinical efficacy of this drug in CNS localization of MCL, CLL or PCNSL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29703765>Role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Inhibitors and Radiation in the Management of Brain Metastases from EGFR Mutant Lung Cancers.</a></h1><p>The growth of genotype-directed targeted therapies, such as inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has revolutionized treatment for some patients with oncogene-addicted lung cancer. However, as systemic control for these patients has improved, brain metastases remain an important source of morbidity and mortality. Traditional treatment for brain metastases has been radiotherapy, either whole-brain radiation or stereotactic radiosurgery. The growing availability of drugs that can cross the blood-brain  and have activity in the central nervous system (CNS) has led to many studies investigating whether targeted therapy can be used in combination with or in lieu of radiation. In this review, we summarize the key literature about the incidence and nature of EGFR-mutant brain metastases (EGFR BMs), the data about the activity of EGFR inhibitors in the CNS, and whether they can be used as front-line therapy for brain metastases. Although initial use of  kinase inhibitors for EGFR BMs can often be an effective treatment strategy, multidisciplinary evaluation is critical, and prospective studies are needed to clarify which patients may benefit from early radiotherapy.Management of brain metastases in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancer is a common clinical problem. The question of whether to start initial therapy with an EGFR inhibitor or radiotherapy (either whole-brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) is controversial. The development of novel EGFR inhibitors with enhanced central nervous system (CNS) penetration is an important advance in the treatment of CNS disease. Multidisciplinary evaluation and evaluation of extracranial disease status are critical to choosing the best treatment option for each patient.© AlphaMed Press 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514048>Endothelial cells cope with hypoxia-induced depletion of ATP via activation of cellular purine turnover and phosphotransfer networks.</a></h1><p>Intravascular ATP and adenosine have emerged as important regulators of endothelial  , vascular remodeling and neovascularization at various pathological states, including hypoxia, inflammation and oxidative stress. By using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bovine vasa vasorum endothelial cells (VVEC) as representatives of macro- and microvessel phenotypes, this study was undertaken to evaluate cellular mechanisms contributing to physiological adaptation of vascular endothelium to hypoxia, with a particular emphasis on ectoenzymatic purine-converting activities and their link to intracellular ATP homeostasis and signaling pathways. Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1/CD39), ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73 and ecto-adenylate kinase activities were determined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with H-labelled nucleotide substrates. Exposure of HUVEC and VVEC to 1% O for 4-24 h triggered rather moderate activation of ATP breakdown into adenosine via the CD39-CD73 axis. Additional TLC analysis of salvage pathways revealed the enhanced ability of hypoxic HUVEC to convert cell-incorporated [H]adenosine into [H]ADP/ATP. Furthermore, following a period of hypoxia, HUVEC underwent concurrent changes in intracellular signaling manifested in the depletion of putative ATP stores and targeted up-regulation of phospho-p53, p70S6K/mTOR and other  kinases. The revealed complex implication of both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms into a tuned hypoxia-induced control of purine homeostasis and signaling may open up further research for the development of pharmacological treatments to improve endothelial cell  under disease conditions associated with a loss of cellular ATP during oxygen deprivation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Activation of the receptor  kinase ErbB4 can cause intramembrane proteolysis and release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that modulates transcription in the nucleus. This study was carried out to investigate the potential roles of ErbB4 in preserving BBB integrity after experimental SAH, as well as the underlying mechanisms of its protective effects. Endovascular perforation was used to prepare a rat SAH model. The SAH grade, neurological score, brain edema and BBB permeability were evaluated after surgery. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the localization of ErbB4 and yes-associated protein (YAP). ErbB4 activator Nrg1 isoform β1 (Nrg1β1), Specific ErbB4 siRNA, YAP siRNA and PIK3CB specific inhibitor TGX 221 were used to manipulate the proposed pathway. The expression levels of ErbB4 ICD and YAP were markly increased after SAH. Double immunohistochemistry labeling showed that ErbB4 and YAP were expressed in endothelial cells and neurons. Activation of ErbB4 by Nrg1β1 (dosage 150 ng/kg) treatment promoted the neurobehavioral deficit, alleviated the brain water content and reduced albumin leakage 24 and 72 h after SAH. ErbB4 activation significantly promoted YAP and PIK3CB activity and increased the expression of tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5. Depletion of ErbB4 aggravated neurological impairment and BBB disruption after SAH. The beneficial effects of ErbB4 activation were abolished by YAP small-interfering RNA and specific PIK3CB inhibitor. Activation of ErbB4 improved neurological performance after SAH through the YAP/PIK3CB signaling pathway, this neuroprotective effects may associated with BBB maintenance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102569>Matrix stiffness regulates vascular integrity through focal adhesion kinase activity.</a></h1><p>Tumor vasculature is known to be more permeable than the vasculature found in healthy tissue, which in turn can lead to a more aggressive tumor phenotype and impair drug delivery into tumors. While the stiffening of the stroma surrounding solid tumors has been reported to increase vascular permeability, the mechanism of this process remains unclear. Here, we utilize an in vitro model of tumor stiffening, ex ovo culture, and a mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanism by which matrix stiffening alters endothelial  . Our data indicate that the increased endothelial permeability caused by heightened matrix stiffness can be prevented by pharmaceutical inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) both in vitro and ex ovo. Matrix stiffness-mediated FAK activation determines Src localization to cell-cell junctions, which then induces increased vascular endothelial cadherin phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial cells in stiff tumors have more activated Src and higher levels of phosphorylated vascular endothelial cadherin at adherens junctions compared to endothelial cells in more compliant tumors. Altogether, our data indicate that matrix stiffness regulates endothelial  integrity through FAK activity, providing one mechanism by which extracellular matrix stiffness regulates endothelial  . Additionally, our work also provides further evidence that FAK is a promising potential target for cancer therapy because FAK plays a critical role in the regulation of endothelial  integrity.-Wang, W., Lollis, E.

For most patients, treatment consists primarily of surgery and/or radiotherapy. In recent years, systemic therapies have become available or are under investigation for patients whose tumors are driven by specific genetic alterations, and some of these targeted treatments have been associated with dramatic improvements in extracranial and intracranial disease control and survival. However, the success of other systemic therapies has been hindered by inadequate penetration of the drug into the brain parenchyma. Advances in molecular characterization of oncogenic drivers have led to the identification of new gene fusions driving oncogenesis in some of the most common sources of intracranial tumors. Systemic therapies targeting many of these alterations have been approved recently or are in clinical development, and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain  is now widely recognized as an important property of such drugs. We review this rapidly advancing field with a focus on recently uncovered gene fusions and brain-penetrant systemic therapies targeting them.Driver gene fusions involving receptor  kinases have been identified across a wide range of tumor types, including primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors and extracranial solid tumors that are associated with high rates of metastasis to the CNS (e.g., lung, breast, melanoma).

Our previous study showed that LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1)-Hx (hemopexin) facilitates removal of heme. The TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7)-BTK (Bruton  kinase)-CRT (calreticulin) pathway regulates the expression of LRP1-Hx. This study is designed to clarify whether TLR7 activation facilitates heme scavenging and to establish the potential role of the BTK-CRT-LRP1-Hx signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of ICH. Methods- ICH was induced by stereotactic, intrastriatal injection of type VII collagenase. Mice received TLR7 agonist (imiquimod) via intraperitoneal injection after ICH induction. TLR7 inhibitor (ODN2088), BTK inhibitor (LFM-A13), and CRT agonist (thapsigargin) were given in different groups to further evaluate the underlying pathway. Mice were randomly divided into sham, ICH+vehicle (normal saline), ICH+Imiquimod (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/g), ICH+ODN2088, ICH+LFM-A13, ICH+thapsigargin, and ICH+ODN2088+thapsigargin. Imiquimod was administered twice daily starting at 6 hours after ICH; ODN2088 was administered by intracerebroventricular injection at 30 minutes, and LFM-A13 or thapsigargin was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 3 hours after ICH induction. Neurological scores, cognitive abilities, as well as brain edema, blood-brain  permeability, hemoglobin level, brain expression of TLR7/BTK/CRT/LRP1/Hx were analyzed. Results- Low dosage imiquimod significantly attenuated hematoma volume, brain edema, BBB permeability, and neurological deficits after ICH. Imiquimod also increased protein expressions of TLR7, BTK, CRT, LRP1, and Hx; ODN2088 reduced TLR7, BTK, CRT, LRP1, and Hx expressions. Conclusions- TLR7 plays an important role in heme scavenging after ICH by modulating the BTK-CRT-LRP1-Hx pathway.

However, the nonselective distribution of ZD6474 in vivo and the low penetrating ability of hydroxychloroquine when crossing the blood-brain  restrict their clinical use in glioma therapy. Here we coencapsulated ZD6474 and hydroxychloroquine into R6dGR peptide-modified liposomes (R6dGR-Lip) which can specifically recognize both integrin αvβ3 and neuropilin-1 receptors that are highly expressed on the endothelial cells and glioma cells. R6dGR significantly enhanced the brain targeting and overcame the blood-brain . Our results confirmed that loading hydroxychloroquine into R6dGR-Lip blocked autophagic flux more efficiently than free hydroxychloroquine in glioma cells and significantly sensitized glioma cells to ZD6474-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo. The coencapsulated R6dGR-modified liposomes (ZD6474/HCQ-R6dGR-Lip) prolonged the medium survival time of intracranial C6 glioma bearing mice by 1.2-fold compared with ZD6474-R6dGR-Lip, 1.5-fold compared with free ZD6474/HCQ, and 1.8-fold compared with free ZD6474, exhibiting a synergistic therapeutic effect. Therefore, ZD6474/HCQ-R6dGR-Lip is presented as a potential strategy which could be further used for efficient anti-glioma therapy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This event leads to increased susceptibility of several encephalic structures to potential neurotoxicants present in the bloodstream. In this study, we investigated the effects of alternate intraperitoneal injections of LPS on BBB permeability, social recognition memory and biochemical parameters in the striatum 24 h and 60 days after treatments. In addition, we investigated whether the exposure to a moderate neurotoxic dose of the herbicide paraquat could potentiate LPS-induced neurotoxicity. LPS administration caused a transient disruption of BBB integrity, evidenced by increased levels of exogenously administered sodium fluorescein in the striatum. Also, LPS exposure caused delayed impairment in social recognition memory (evaluated at day 38 after treatments) and increase in the striatal levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. These events were observed in the absence of significant changes in motor coordination and in the levels of  hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum and substantia nigra. PQ exposure, which caused a long-lasting decrease of striatal mitochondrial complex I activity, did not modify LPS-induced behavioral and striatal biochemical changes. The results indicate that systemic administration of LPS causes delayed social recognition memory deficit and striatal nitrosative stress in adult mice and that the coexposure to a moderately toxic dose of PQ did not magnify these events. In addition, PQ-induced inhibition of striatal mitochondrial complex I was also not magnified by LPS exposure, indicating the absence of synergic neurotoxic effects of LPS and PQ in this experimental model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928160>Quantitative and Mechanistic Understanding of AZD1775 Penetration across Human Blood-Brain  in Glioblastoma Patients Using an IVIVE-PBPK Modeling Approach.</a></h1><p> AZD1775, a first-in-class, small-molecule inhibitor of the Wee1  kinase, is under evaluation as a potential chemo- and radiosensitizer for treating glioblastoma. This study was to prospectively, quantitatively, and mechanistically investigate the penetration of AZD1775 across the human blood-brain  (BBB). AZD1775 plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 20 patients with glioblastoma. The drug metabolism, transcellular passive permeability, and interactions with efflux and uptake transporters were determined using human derived  systems. A whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model integrated with a four-compartment permeability-limited brain model was developed for predicting the kinetics of AZD1775 BBB penetration and assessing the factors modulating this process. AZD1775 exhibited good tumor penetration in patients with glioblastoma, with the unbound tumor-to-plasma concentration ratio ranging from 1.3 to 24.4 (median, 3.2). It was a substrate for ABCB1, ABCG2, and OATP1A2, but not for OATP2B1 or OAT3. AZD1775 transcellular passive permeability and active efflux clearance across MDCKII-ABCB1 or MDCKII-ABCG2 cell monolayers were dependent on the basolateral pH. The PBPK model well predicted observed drug plasma and tumor concentrations in patients. The extent and rate of drug BBB penetration were influenced by BBB integrity, efflux and uptake active transporter activity, and drug binding to brain tissue. In the relatively acidic tumor microenvironment where ABCB1/ABCG2 transporter-mediated efflux clearance is reduced, OATP1A2-mediated active uptake becomes dominant, driving AZD1775 penetration into brain tumor. Variations in the brain tumor regional pH, transporter expression/activity, and BBB integrity collectively contribute to the heterogeneity of AZD1775 penetration into brain tumors. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29562865>Regulatable Lentiviral Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exhibits potent neuroprotective properties in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease (PD), but challenges in GDNF delivery have been reported from clinical trials. To address this , we developed a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-based macrophage-mediated GDNF therapy platform. Here, we introduced a regulatable lentiviral vector (LV-MSP-Tet-Off-hGDNF) to allow the expression of human GDNF (hGDNF) to be adjusted or stopped by oral administration of doxycycline (Dox). C57BL/6J mice were lethally irradiated with head protection and then transplanted with syngeneic bone marrow cells transduced with either the hGDNF-expressing vector or a corresponding GFP-expressing vector, LV-MSP-Tet-Off-GFP. Suppression of vector gene expression was achieved through administration of Dox in drinking water. To create a toxin-induced Parkinsonian model, mice were injected in two cycles with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) to yield nigral cell/striatal dopamine loss and behavioral deficits. During the presence of Dox in the drinking water, plasma GDNF was at a basal level, whereas during the absence of Dox, plasma GDNF was significantly elevated, indicating reliable regulation of therapeutic gene expression. Midbrain GDNF levels were altered in parallel, although these did not return completely to basal levels during the periods of Dox withdrawal. Motor activities of the MPTP-Tet-off-hGDNF group were comparable to those of the Tet-off-GFP (subject to no MPTP treatment) group, but substantially better than those of the MPTP-Tet-off-GFP group. Interestingly, the improvement in motor activities was sustained during the Dox-withdrawn periods in MPTP-Tet-off-hGDNF animals. Neuroprotection by therapeutic GDNF expression was further evidenced by significant amelioration of nigral  hydroxylase loss after both the first and second MPTP treatment cycles. These data suggest that neurotrophic factor expression can be upregulated to achieve efficacy or downregulated in case of off-target effects or adverse events, a feature that may eventually increase the acceptance of this potentially neuroprotective/disease-modifying PD therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448579>H O -induced microvessel  dysfunction: the interplay between reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite.</a></h1><p>Elevated H O is implicated in many cardiovascular diseases. We previously demonstrated that H O -induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and excessive NO production contribute to vascular cell injury and increases in microvessel permeability. However, the mechanisms of excessive NO-mediated vascular injury and hyperpermeability remain unknown. This study aims to examine the functional role of NO-derived peroxynitrite (ONOO ) in H O -induced vascular  dysfunction by elucidating the interrelationships between H O -induced NO, superoxide, ONOO , and changes in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel permeability. Experiments were conducted on intact rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca ] , NO, and O  were assessed with fluorescence imaging. Perfusion of vessels with H O (10 µmol/L) induced marked productions of NO and O  , resulting in extensive protein  nitration, a biomarker of ONOO . The formation of ONOO was abolished by inhibition of NOS with N -Methyl-L-arginine. Blocking NO production or scavenging ONOO by uric acid prevented H O -induced increases in endothelial [Ca ] and Lp. Additionally, the application of exogenous ONOO to microvessels induced delayed and progressive increases in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel Lp, a pattern similar to that observed in H O -perfused vessels. Importantly, ONOO caused further activation of eNOS with amplified NO production. We conclude that the augmentation of NO-derived ONOO is essential for H O -induced endothelial Ca overload and progressively increased microvessel permeability, which is achieved by self-promoted amplifications of NO-dependent signaling cascades. This novel mechanism provides new insight into the reactive oxygen and/or reactive nitrogen species-mediated vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

It is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis, all three of which vary significantly in their anatomy and . The skin's structure is made up of an intricate network which serves as the body’s initial  against pathogens, UV light, and chemicals, and mechanical injury. It also regulates temperature and the amount of water released into the environment. This article discusses the relevant anatomical structures of the skin’s epidermal layer, its structure, , embryology, vascular supply, innervation, surgical considerations, and clinical relevance.  The thickness of each layer of the skin varies depending on body region and categorized based on the thickness of the epidermal and dermal layers. Hairless skin found in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet is thickest because the epidermis contains an extra layer, the stratum lucidum. The upper back is considered thickest based on the thickness of the dermis, but it is considered “thin skin” histologically because the epidermal thickness lacks the stratum lucidum layer and is thinner than hairless skin.  The layers of the epidermis include the stratum basale (the deepest portion of the epidermis), stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum (the most superficial portion of the epidermis). also known as stratum germinativum, is the deepest layer, separated from the dermis by the basement membrane (basal lamina) and attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. The cells found in this layer are cuboidal to columnar mitotically active stem cells that are constantly producing keratinocytes. This layer also contains melanocytes. 8-10 cell layers,also known as the prickle cell layer contains irregular, polyhedral cells with cytoplasmic processes, sometimes called “spines”, that extend outward and contact neighboring cells by desmosomes. Dendritic cells can be found in this layer. 3-5 cell layers, contains diamond shaped cells with keratohyalin granules and lamellar granules. Keratohyalin granules contain keratin precursors that eventually aggregate, crosslink, and form bundles. The lamellar granules contain the glycolipids that get secreted to the surface of the cells and  as a glue, keeping the cells stuck together.  2-3 cell layers,present in thicker skin found in the palms and soles, is a thin clear layer consisting of eleidin which is a transformation product of keratohyalin.  20-30 cell layers,is the uppermost layer, made up of keratin and horny scales made up of dead keratinocytes, known as anucleate squamous cells. This is the layer which varies most in thickness, especially in callused skin. Within this layer, the dead keratinocytes secrete defensins which are part of our first immune defense. : Keratinocytes. Melanocytes. Langerhans’ cells. Merkel’s cell.  Keratinocytes are the predominant cell type of epidermis and originate in the basal layer, produce keratin, and are responsible for the formation of the epidermal water  by making and secreting lipids. Keratinocytes also regulate calcium absorption by the activation of cholesterol precursors by UVB light to form vitamin D.  Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells and primarily produce melanin, which is responsible for the pigment of the skin. They are found between cells of stratum basale and produce melanin. UVB light stimulates melanin secretion which is protective against UV radiation, acting as a built-in sunscreen. Melanin is produced during the conversion of  to DOPA by the enzyme tyrosinase. Melanin then travels from cell to cell by a process that relies on the long processes extending from the melanocytes to the neighboring epidermal cells. Melanin granules from melanocytes are transferred via the long processes to the cytoplasm of basal keratinocyte. Melanin transferred to neighboring keratinocytes by “pigment donation”; involves phagocytosis of tips of melanocyte processes by keratinocytes.  Langerhans cells, dendritic cells, are the skins first line defenders and play a significant role in antigen presentation. These cells need special stains to visualize, primarily found in the stratum spinosum. These cells are the mesenchymal origin, derived from CD34 positive stem cells of bone marrow and are part of the mononuclear phagocytic system. They contain Birbeck granules, tennis racket shaped cytoplasmic organelles. These cells express both MHC I and MHC II molecules, uptake antigens in skin and transport to the lymph node.  Merkel cells are oval-shaped modified epidermal cells found in stratum basale, directly above the basement membrane. These cells serve a sensory  as mechanoreceptors for light touch, and are most populous in fingertips, though also found in the palms, soles, oral, and genital mucosa. They are bound to adjoining keratinocytes by desmosomes and contain intermediate keratin filaments and their membranes interact with free nerve endings in the skin.  The dermis is connected to the epidermis at the level of the basement membrane and consists of two layers, of connective tissue, the papillary and reticular layers which merge together without clear demarcation. The  is the upper layer, thinner, composed of loose connective tissue and contacts epidermis. The  is the deeper layer, thicker, less cellular, and consists of dense connective tissue/ bundles of collagen fibers. The dermis houses the sweat glands, hair, hair follicles, muscles, sensory neurons, and blood vessels.  The hypodermis is deep to the dermis and is also called subcutaneous fascia. It is the deepest layer of skin and contains adipose lobules along with some skin appendages like the hair follicles, sensory neurons, and blood vessels.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109835>Calcium-sensing receptor in nutrient sensing: an insight into the modulation of intestinal homoeostasis.</a></h1><p>The animal gut effectively prevents the entry of hazardous substances and microbes while permitting the transfer of nutrients, such as water, electrolytes, vitamins, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals and microbial metabolites, which are intimately associated with intestinal homoeostasis. The gut maintains biological functions through its nutrient-sensing receptors, including the Ca-sensing receptor (CaSR), which activates a variety of signalling pathways, depending on cellular context. CaSR coordinates food digestion and nutrient absorption, promotes cell proliferation and differentiation, regulates energy metabolism and immune response, stimulates hormone secretion, mitigates secretory diarrhoea and enhances intestinal  . Thus, CaSR is crucial to the maintenance of gut homoeostasis and protection of intestinal health. In this review, we focused on the emerging roles of CaSR in the modulation of intestinal homoeostasis including related underlying mechanisms. By elucidating the relationship between CaSR and animal gut homoeostasis, effective and inexpensive methods for treating intestinal health imbalance through nutritional manipulation can be developed. This article is expected to provide experimental data of the effects of CaSR on animal or human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678476>Cabazitaxel Plus Lapatinib as Therapy for HER2 Metastatic Breast Cancer With Intracranial Metastases: Results of a Dose-finding Study.</a></h1><p>Lapatinib is an oral small molecule  kinase epidermal growth factor receptor-1/HER2 inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain  and is active against central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Cabazitaxel is a taxoid that is effective against taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and has distinguished itself by its ability to cross the blood-brain . The present phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, ) evaluated the combination of these agents to treat HER2 MBC patients with CNS metastases.Patients with HER2 MBC and ≥ 1 untreated or progressive, measurable CNS metastasis were eligible. Using a 3+3 dose escalation design, patients were treated with escalating doses of intravenous cabazitaxel every 21 days and oral lapatinib daily in 21-day treatment cycles. Intracranial disease restaging was performed every 2 cycles for the first 8 cycles and then every 3 cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity.Eleven patients were treated at 2 dose levels. Six patients were treated at dose level 1 (intravenous cabazitaxel 20 mg/m plus oral lapatinib 1000 mg daily), and five were treated at dose level 2 (intravenous cabazitaxel 25 mg/m plus oral lapatinib 1000 mg daily). The most common treatment-related adverse events were myelosuppression, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin toxicity. A total of 5 dose-limiting toxicity events occurred. No intra- or extracranial objective responses were observed.The combination of cabazitaxel plus lapatinib was not feasible because of toxicity and because no objective CNS activity was seen in the 5 evaluable patients.

However, CNS delivery of GDNF is restricted by the blood-brain  (BBB). Using total body irradiation as transplant preconditioning, we previously reported that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT)-based macrophage-mediated gene therapy could deliver GDNF to the brain to prevent degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons in an acute murine neurotoxicity model. Here, we validate this therapeutic approach in a chronic progressive PD model - the MitoPark mouse, with head shielding to avoid inducing neuroinflammation and compromising BBB integrity. Bone marrow HSCs were transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector expressing macrophage promoter-driven GDNF and transplanted into MitoPark mice exhibiting well developed PD-like impairments. Transgene-expressing macrophages infiltrated the midbrains of MitoPark mice, but not normal littermates, and delivered GDNF locally. Macrophage GDNF delivery markedly improved both motor and non-motor symptoms, and dramatically mitigated the loss of both DA neurons in the substantia nigra and  hydroxylase-positive axonal terminals in the striatum. Our data support further development of this HSCT-based macrophage-mediated GDNF delivery approach in order to address the unmet need for a disease-modifying therapy for PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628816>Hyperglycemia-induced Ubiquitination and Degradation of β-catenin with the Loss of Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in Retinal Endothelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Increased retinal vascular permeability is one of the earliest manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hyperglycemia-induced platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule -1 (PECAM-1) loss on retinal vascular permeability via the β-catenin pathway.Type I diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats using streptozotocin (STZ) injections, with age-matched non-diabetic rats as controls.

Small interfering Ribonucleic Acid (siRNA) was used to knock down PECAM-1 in RRMECs for loss-of- studies. Retinas and RRMECs were subjected to western blot, immunofluorescence labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses to assess protein levels and interactions.

Similar results were observed with PECAM-1 partial knockdown, where β-catenin and active SHP2 levels were decreased, while phospho-β-catenin and retinal endothelial cell permeability were increased.PECAM-1 loss may contribute to increased retinal endothelial cell permeability by attenuating β-catenin levels under hyperglycemic conditions.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320600>Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 mediates trauma-induced intestinal injury and multi-organ failure.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis initiates gut injury, alters the intestinal , and can facilitate bacterial translocation leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, have been linked to intestinal apoptosis. Similarly, intestinal hyperpermeability and gut failure occur in critically ill patients, putting the gut at the center of SIRS pathology. Regulation of apoptosis and immune-modulatory functions have been ascribed to Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1), whose activity is regulated merely by expression. We investigated the effect of TNK1 on intestinal integrity and its role in MODS. TNK1 expression induced crypt-specific apoptosis, leading to bacterial translocation, subsequent septic shock, and early death. Mechanistically, TNK1 expression in vivo resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of p65, and release of IL-6 and TNF-α. A TNF-α neutralizing antibody partially blocked development of intestinal damage. Conversely, gut-specific deletion of TNK1 protected the intestinal mucosa from experimental colitis and prevented cytokine release in the gut. Finally, TNK1 was found to be deregulated in the gut in murine and porcine trauma models and human inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, TNK1 might be a target during MODS to prevent damage in several organs, notably the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604436>Investigational chemotherapy and novel pharmacokinetic mechanisms for the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases.</a></h1><p>In women, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis and second most common cause of cancer death. More than half of breast cancer patients will develop metastases to the bone, liver, lung, or brain. Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) confers a poor prognosis, as current therapeutic options of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy rarely significantly extend life and are considered palliative. Within the realm of chemotherapy, the last decade has seen an explosion of novel chemotherapeutics involving targeting agents and unique dosage forms. We provide a historical overview of BCBM chemotherapy, review the mechanisms of new agents such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinaseinhibitors, estrogen pathway antagonists for hormone-receptor positive BCBM;  kinase inhibitors, antibodies, and conjugates for HER2 BCBM; repurposed cytotoxic chemotherapy for triple negative BCBM; and the utilization of these new agents and formulations in ongoing clinical trials. The mechanisms of novel dosage formulations such as nanoparticles, liposomes, pegylation, the concepts of enhanced permeation and retention, and drugs utilizing these concepts involved in clinical trials are also discussed.

In this article, the ability of an engineered angiopoietin-1 variant (COMP-Ang1) to ameliorate the injurious effects of hyperglycemia on  integrity in a human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMvEC) model is comprehensively investigated.Confluent HRMvECs were treated (0-72 hours) with d-glucose (5 or 30 mM) in the absence and presence of COMP-Ang1 (10-200 ng/mL). l-glucose (30 mM) was used as osmotic control. Posttreatment, intact cell monolayers were monitored for permeability to FITC-dextran 40 kDa. Cells were also harvested for analysis of interendothelial junction targets by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The impact of receptor  kinase Tie2 gene silencing on COMP-Ang1 efficacy was also evaluated.Treatment with 30 mM d-glucose (but not l-glucose) demonstrated a time-dependent elevation in the mean rate of FITC-dextran diffusion across intact HRMvEC monolayers, in parallel with significant reductions in mRNA/protein levels of occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE-Cadherin. These effects were all attenuated by COMP-Ang1 in a concentration-dependent fashion, with 200 ng/mL recovering   by ∼88%, and recovering reduced interendothelial junction protein levels by more than 50%. Finally, Tie2 knockdown by small interfering RNA silencing blocked the ability of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate against hyperglycemia-induced permeabilization of HRMvECs and depletion of junctional expression levels.In summary, this article presents a reproducible in vitro cell study that quantifies the concentration-dependent efficacy of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate the injurious effects of hyperglycemic challenge on HRMvEC  properties via Tie2-mediated signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700687>Medical Treatment Options for Patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Suffering from Brain Metastases and/or Leptomeningeal Disease.</a></h1><p>Brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal disease (LMD) with associated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are known complications of advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is important, therefore, to assess the activity of EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) versus such CNS complications. This review explores the literature reporting the intracranial activity of EGFR TKIs, and finds that there is evidence for varying efficacy of the approved agents, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib in patients with CNS metastases. Other EGFR TKIs in development, such as AZD3759, may have a future role as therapeutic options in this setting. Emerging evidence indicates that the second- and third-generation EGFR TKIs, afatinib and osimertinib, effectively penetrate the blood-brain , and therefore represent viable treatment options for CNS lesions, and can reduce the risk of CNS progression. These agents should therefore be considered as first-line treatment options in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who have brain metastases and/or LMD. While there are currently no prospective data comparing the intracranial efficacy of second- and third-generation EGFR TKIs in this setting, CNS activity and protection offered by different EGFR TKIs should be an additional consideration when making decisions about the optimal sequence of treatment with EGFR TKIs in order to maximize survival benefit in individual patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171422>Intestinal Pathology and Gut Microbiota Alterations in a Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often have non-motor symptoms related to gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, such as constipation and delayed gastric emptying, which manifest prior to the motor symptoms of PD. Increasing evidence indicates that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota may be related to the pathogenesis of PD. However, it is unclear how GI dysfunction occurs and how gut microbial dysbiosis is caused. We investigated whether a neurotoxin model of PD induced by chronic low doses of MPTP is capable of reproducing the clinical intestinal pathology of PD, as well as whether gut microbial dysbiosis accompanies this pathology. C57BL/6 male mice were administered 18 mg/kg MPTP twice per week for 5 weeks via intraperitoneal injection. GI  was assessed by measuring the 1-h stool frequency and fecal water content; motor  was assessed by pole tests; and  hydroxylase and alpha-synuclein expression were analyzed. Furthermore, the inflammation, intestinal  and composition of the gut microbiota were measured. We found that MPTP caused GI dysfunction and intestinal pathology prior to motor dysfunction. The composition of the gut microbiota was changed; in particular, the change in the abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, Clostridiales, Erysipelotrichales and Proteobacteria was significant. These results indicate that a chronic low-dose MPTP model can be used to evaluate the progression of intestinal pathology and gut microbiota dysbiosis in the early stage of PD, which may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29684234>Systemic Treatment Options for Brain Metastases from Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.</a></h1><p>Brain metastases are common in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Vision loss associated with retinal capillary hemangioblastomas remains one of the earliest complications of VHL disease. The mortality of Vhl mice in utero restricted modelling of VHL disease in this mammalian model. Zebrafish harbouring a recessive germline mutation in the vhl gene represent a viable, alternative vertebrate model to investigate associated ocular loss-of- phenotypes. Previous studies reported neovascularisation of the brain, eye and trunk together with oedema in the vhl zebrafish eye. In this study, we demonstrate vhl zebrafish almost entirely lack visual . Furthermore, hyaloid vasculature networks in the vhl eye are improperly formed and this phenotype is concomitant with development of an ectopic intraretinal vasculature. Sunitinib malate, a multi  kinase inhibitor, market authorised for cancer, reversed the ocular behavioural and morphological phenotypes observed in vhl zebrafish. We conclude that the zebrafish vhl gene contributes to an endogenous molecular  that prevents development of intraretinal vasculature, and that pharmacological intervention with sunitinib can improve visual  and hyaloid vessel patterning while reducing abnormally formed ectopic intraretinal vessels in vhl zebrafish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Overwhelming pulmonary inflammation and endothelium disruption are commonly observed. Endothelial cells (ECs) are well recognized as key regulators in leukocyte adhesion and migration in response to bacterial infection. Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-2 protein, a major PHD in ECs, plays a critical role in intracellular oxygen homeostasis, angiogenesis, and pulmonary hypertension. However, its role in endothelial inflammatory response is unclear. We investigated the role of PHD2 in ECs during endotoxin-induced lung inflammatory responses with EC-specific PHD2 inducible knockout mice. On lipopolysaccharide challenge, PHD2 depletion in ECs attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced increases of lung vascular permeability, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, EC-specific PHD2 inducible knockout mice exhibit improved adherens junction integrity and endothelial  . Mechanistically, PHD2 knockdown induces vascular endothelial cadherin in mouse lung microvascular primary endothelial cells. Moreover, PHD2 knockdown can increase hypoxia-inducible factor/vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase signaling and reactive oxygen species-dependent p38 activation, leading to the induction of vascular endothelial cadherin.

We developed an in vitro mechanical scratch injury model in air-liquid interface differentiated primary human small airway epithelial cells that recapitulates many of the characteristics observed during epithelial wound injury in both human tissue and small animal models. Wound closure was initially associated with de-differentiation of the differentiated apical cells and rapid migration into the wound site, followed by proliferation of apical cells behind the wound edge, together with increases in FAK expression, fibronectin and reduction in PAI-1 which collectively facilitate cell motility and extracellular matrix deposition. Macrophages are intimately involved in wound repair so we sought to investigate the role of macrophage sub-types on this process in a novel primary human co-culture model. M1 macrophages promoted FAK expression and both M1 and M2 macrophages promoted epithelial de-differentiation. Interestingly, M2a macrophages inhibited both proliferation and fibronectin expression, possibly via the retinoic acid pathway, whereas M2b and M2c macrophages prevented fibronectin deposition, possibly via MMP expression. Collectively these data highlight the complex nature of epithelial wound closure, the differential impact of macrophage sub-types on this process, and the heterogenic and non-delineated  of these macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29080751>MicroRNA-195 desensitizes HCT116 human colon cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil.</a></h1><p>Multidrug resistance is one major  to successful chemotherapy. Although several studies have attempted to overcome resistance of cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs, key determinants of resistance remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate whether microRNAs might play a role in the acquisition of resistance. Human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cell lines were transduced with a lentivirus library containing 578 precursor microRNAs (miRNAs) to establish cell lines resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Specific miRNAs were identified from four different resistant clones and a miR-195-expressing resistant clone (HCT-116_lenti-miR-195) was further investigated. The HCT-116_lenti-miR-195 cells showed resistant phenotype. These cells grew faster after 5-FU treatment compared to control cells (HCT-116_lenti-control). Check point kinase 1 (CHK1) and G2 check point kinase WEE1 were found to be direct targets of miR-195. Downregulation of miR-195 sensitized HCT-116 cells after 5-FU treatment. Our results demonstrate that miR-195 can promote acquisition of drug resistance to 5-FU.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a photothermally triggered system by using the near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to achieve "on-demand" endosomal escape and subsequent siRNA release into cytoplasm.Herein, the poly-L-lysine (PLL) was successfully conjugated with melanin to obtain melanin-poly-L-lysine (M-PLL) polymer as a siRNA vehicle. The melanin was an efficient photothermal sensitizer, and the positive pendant amino groups of PLL could condense siRNAs to form stable complexes by electrostatic interactions.Inspired by its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, the melanin was first involved in the siRNA delivery system. Confocal laser scanning microscopic observation revealed that after cellular uptake the photothermally induced endosomal escape could facilitate siRNAs to overcome endosomal  and be delivered into cytoplasm, which resulted in significant silence in the luciferase expression over the NIR- and melanin-free controls. Moreover, the anti-survivin siRNA-loaded M-PLL nanoparticles displayed great inhibitory effect on 4T1 tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.These findings suggest that the M-PLL-mediated siRNA delivery is a promising candidate for therapeutic siRNA delivery and shows improved effect for cancer therapy via enhanced endosomal escape.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498075>Steered molecular dynamics simulations for uncovering the molecular mechanisms of drug dissociation and for drug screening: A test on the focal adhesion kinase.</a></h1><p>Drug-binding kinetics could play important roles in determining the efficacy of drugs and has caught the attention of more drug designers. Using the dissociation of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines from the focal adhesion kinase as an example, this work finds that steered molecular dynamics simulations could help screen compounds with long-residence times. It also reveals a two-step mechanism of ligand dissociation resembling the release of ADP from protein kinase A reported earlier. A phenyl group attaching to the pyrrole prolongs residence time by creating a large activation  for transition from the bound to the intermediate state when it becomes exposed to the solvent. Principal component analysis shows that ligand dissociation does not couple with large-scale collective motions of the protein involving many of its amino acids. Rather, a small subset of amino acids dominates. Some of these amino acids do not contact the ligands directly along the dissociation pathways and could exert long-range allosteric effects.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216992>Anti-Inflammatory and Skin-Moisturizing Effects of a Flavonoid Glycoside Extracted from the Aquatic Plant  in Human Keratinocytes.</a></h1><p>, an aquatic plant, is used as folk medicine in some countries.

They have extensively been studied for their beneficial value in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the multitarget effects of Korean Red Ginseng extract (KRGE) with various components are unclear.We investigated the multitarget activities of KRGE on neurological dysfunction and neurotoxicity in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. KRGE (37.5 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day, or 150 mg/kg/day, per os (p.o.)) was given daily before or after MPTP intoxication.Pretreatment with 150 mg/kg/day KRGE produced the greatest positive effect on motor dysfunction as assessed using rotarod, pole, and nesting tests, and on the survival rate. KRGE displayed a wide therapeutic time window. These effects were related to reductions in the loss of  hydroxylase-immunoreactive dopaminergic neurons, apoptosis, microglial activation, and activation of inflammatory factors in the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or striatum after MPTP intoxication. In addition, pretreatment with KRGE activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways and inhibited phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, as well as blocked the alteration of blood-brain  integrity.These results suggest that KRGE may effectively reduce MPTP-induced neurotoxicity with a wide therapeutic time window through multitarget effects including antiapoptosis, antiinflammation, antioxidant, and maintenance of blood-brain  integrity.

Ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton protein, maintains cellular morphology and intercellular adhesion and protects the   of epithelial cells.To study the role of ezrin in bronchial epithelial cells injury and correlate its expression with asthma severity.Levels of ezrin were measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and serum in patients with asthma and BAL fluid (BALF) from a mouse model of asthma by ELISA. The regulation of IL-13 on ezrin protein levels was studied in primary bronchial epithelial cells. Ezrin knockdown using shRNA was studied in human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells.Ezrin levels were decreased in asthmatic EBC (92.7 ± 34.99 vs. 150.5 ± 10.22 pg/ml, P < 0.0001) and serum (700.7 ± 55.59 vs. 279.2 ± 25.83 pg/ml, P < 0.0001) compared with normal subjects. Levels were much lower in uncontrolled (P < 0.001) and partly controlled patients (P < 0.01) compared with well-controlled subjects. EBC and serum ezrin levels correlated with lung  in patients with asthma and serum ezrin levels were negatively correlated with serum IL-13 and periostin. IL-13-induced downregulation of ezrin expression in primary bronchial epithelial cells was significantly attenuated by the Janus  kinase 2 inhibitor, TG101348. Ezrin knockdown changed 16HBE cell morphology, enlarged intercellular spaces, and increased their permeability. Ezrin expression was decreased in the lung tissue and BALF of "asthmatic" mice and negatively correlated with BALF IL-13 level.Ezrin downregulation is associated with IL-13-induced epithelial damage and might be a potential biomarker of asthma control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575440>Effect of melatonin on EGF- and VEGF-induced monolayer permeability of HUVECs.</a></h1><p>Melatonin is a natural hormone involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm, immunity, and cardiovascular . In the present study, we focused on the mechanism of melatonin in the regulation of vascular permeability. We found that melatonin could inhibit both VEGF- and EGF-induced monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and change the  phosphorylation of vascular-endothelial (VE-)cadherin, which was related to endothelial  . In addition, phospho-AKT (Ser) and phospho-ERK(1/2) played significant roles in the regulation of VE-cadherin phosphorylation. Both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT inhibitor LY49002 and MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 could inhibit the permeability of HUVECs, but with different effects on  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin. Melatonin can influence the two growth factor-induced phosphorylation of AKT (Ser) but not ERK(1/2). Our results show that melatonin can inhibit growth factor-induced monolayer permeability of HUVECs by influencing the phosphorylation of AKT and VE-cadherin. Melatonin can be a potential treatment for diseases associated with abnormal vascular permeability.  We found that melatonin could inhibit both EGF- and VEGF-induced monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which is related to phosphorylation of vascular-endothelial cadherin. Blockade of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways could inhibit the permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser) might be a critical event in the changing of monolayer permeability and likely has cross-talk with the MEK/ERK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29067878>Brain Penetration of the ROS1/ALK Inhibitor Lorlatinib Confirmed by PET.</a></h1><p>The Massachusetts General Hospital Radiochemistry Program, in collaboration with Pfizer, has developed unique C and F-labeling strategies to synthesize isotopologs of lorlatinib (PF-06463922) which is undergoing phase III clinical trial investigations for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers with specific molecular alterations.

Mathematical modeling and simulation are essential tools for the deeper understanding of transport processes in the blood, across the blood-brain  and within the tissue. Here we present a mathematical model for drug delivery through capillary networks with increasingly complex topologies with the goal to understand the scaling behavior of model predictions on a coarse-to-fine sequence of grids. We apply our model to the delivery of L-Dopa, the primary drug used in the therapy of Parkinson's Disease. Our model replicates observed blood flow rates and ratios between plasma and tissue concentrations.

Inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the mouse BBB improved the BBB permeation of erlotinib but could not be achieved in humans. BBB disruption induced by focused ultrasound (FUS) was investigated as a strategy to overcome the efflux transport of erlotinib in vivo. In rats, FUS combined with microbubbles allowed for a large and spatially controlled disruption of the BBB in the left hemisphere. ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibition was performed using elacridar (10 mg/kg i.v). The brain kinetics of erlotinib was studied using C-erlotinib Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging in 5 groups (n = 4-5 rats per group) including a baseline group, immediately after sonication (FUS), 48 h after FUS (FUS + 48 h), elacridar (ELA) and their combination (FUS + ELA). BBB integrity was assessed using the Evan's Blue (EB) extravasation test. Brain exposure to C-erlotinib was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of the brain kinetics (% injected dose (%ID) versus time (min)) in volumes corresponding to the disrupted (left) and the intact (right) hemispheres, respectively. EB extravasation highlighted BBB disruption in the left hemisphere of animals of the FUS and FUS + ELA groups but not in the control and ELA groups. EB extravasation was not observed 48 h after FUS suggesting recovery of BBB integrity. Compared with the control group (AUC = 1.4 ± 0.5%ID.min), physical BBB disruption did not impact the brain kinetics of C-erlotinib in the left hemisphere (p > .05) either immediately (AUC = 1.2 ± 0.1%ID.min) or 48 h after FUS (AUC = 1.1 ± 0.3%ID.min). Elacridar similarly increased C-erlotinib brain exposure to the left hemisphere in the absence (AUC = 2.2 ± 0.5%ID.min, p < .001) and in the presence of BBB disruption (AUC = 2.1 ± 0.5%ID.min, p < .001). AUC was never significantly different from AUC (p > .05), in any of the tested conditions. BBB integrity is not the rate limiting step for erlotinib delivery to the brain which is mainly governed by ABC-mediated efflux. Efflux transport of erlotinib persisted despite BBB disruption.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The brain-derived neurotrophic factor is well known for its neuroprotective role but has limited clinical applications. A selective agonist of  kinase receptor B, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), is a powerful therapeutic tool, when administered systemically. However, it remains unclear whether DHF treatment can protect the immature retinas against HI injury.Postnatal (P) day 7 rat pups were intraperitoneally injected with DHF or vehicle 2 hours before and 18 hours after being subjected to HI injury. The outcomes were assessed at various timepoints after injury by electroretinography and histologic examinations. Neurogenesis was assessed by double-labeling of retinal sections with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and different neuronal markers.At P8, 24-hours postinjury, brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels in the retina decreased significantly. DHF treatment partially protected immature retinas at both histologic and functional levels between P14 and P30 but did not prevent apoptosis, inflammation, or damage of the blood-retinal  (BRB) at P8. On the other hand, DHF treatment promoted the survival of proliferating inner retinal cells, including Müller glia, and enhanced their transdifferentiation to bipolar cells at P17. Moreover, DHF treatment rescued the levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which were significantly decreased after injury. The neuroprotective effects of DHF were markedly eliminated by inhibition of ERK phosphorylation.Early systemic DHF treatment has neuroprotective effects against HI injury in immature retinas, possibly via promoting neurogenesis through the  kinase receptor B/ERK signaling pathway.Chinese Abstract.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195783>Platelet glycoprotein receptor Ib blockade ameliorates experimental cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by strengthening the blood-brain   and anti-thrombo-inflammatory property.</a></h1><p>Blood-brain  (BBB) disruption, thrombus formation and immune-mediated inflammation are important steps in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury but are still inaccessible to therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that blocking of platelet glycoprotein (GP) receptor Ib might represent a novel target in treating acute ischemic stroke. This research was conducted to explore the therapeutic efficacy and potential mechanisms of GPIbα inhibitor (anfibatide) in a model of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Male mice underwent 90 min of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Anfibatide (1, 2, 4 ug/kg) or tirofiban were administered intravenously 1 h after reperfusion. The results showed that anfibatide could significantly reduce infarct volumes, increase the number of intact neuronal cells and improve neurobehavioral . Moreover, anfibatide could reduce post ischemic BBB damage by attenuating increased paracellular permeability in the ischemia hemisphere significantly. Stroke-induced increases in activity and protein expression of macrophage-1 antigen (MAC-1) and P-selectin were also reduced by anfibatide intervention. Finally, anfibatide exerted antithrombotic effects upon stroke by decreased the number of microthrombi formation. This is the first demonstration of anfibatide's efficacy in protecting the BBB integrity and decreasing neutrophil inflammation response mediated by MAC-1 besides microthrombus formation inhibition in the brain during reperfusion. Anfibatide, as a promising anti-thrombo-inflammation agent, could be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the widespread use of gefitinib in targeted therapy for patients with lung cancer is hampered by its common skin toxicities. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the skin toxicities of gefitinib. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) treated with gefitinib were used for a series of in vitro assays, including MTT, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular permeability detection. In the present study, it was determined that the skin toxicities of gefitinib may be due to claudin (CLDN)1 and CLDN4 downregulation and CLDN2 upregulation in NHEKs. Additionally, Src and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways were involved in gefitinib‑induced   disruption in NHEKs. In conclusion, the present study may provide novel insights for improving skin toxicity of gefitinib in patients with lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342922>Can EGCG Alleviate Symptoms of Down Syndrome by Altering Proteolytic Activity?</a></h1><p>Down syndrome (DS), also known as "trisomy 21", is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. Silencing these extra genes is beyond existing technology and seems to be impractical. A number of pharmacologic options have been proposed to change the quality of life and lifespan of individuals with DS. It was reported that treatment with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) improves cognitive performance in animal models and in humans, suggesting that EGCG may alleviate symptoms of DS. Traditionally, EGCG has been associated with the ability to reduce dual specificity  phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A activity, which is overexpressed in trisomy 21. Based on the data available in the literature, we propose an additional way in which EGCG might affect trisomy 21-namely by modifying the proteolytic activity of the enzymes involved. It is known that, in Down syndrome, the nerve growth factor (NGF) metabolic pathway is altered: first by downregulating tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that activates plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme converting proNGF to mature NGF; secondly, overexpression of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) further degrades NGF, lowering the amount of mature NGF. EGCG inhibits MMP-9, thus protecting NGF. Urokinase (uPA) and tPA are activators of plasminogen, and uPA is inhibited by EGCG, but regardless of their structural similarity tPA is not inhibited. In this review, we describe mechanisms of proteolytic enzymes (MMP-9 and plasminogen activation system), their role in Down syndrome, their inhibition by EGCG, possible degradation of this polyphenol and the ability of EGCG and its degradation products to cross the blood-brain . We conclude that known data accumulated so far provide promising evidence of MMP-9 inhibition by EGCG in the brain, which could slow down the abnormal degradation of NGF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29598904>Lipopolysaccharide Induces Subacute Cerebral Microhemorrhages with Involvement of Nitric Oxide Synthase in Rats.</a></h1><p>Cerebral microhemorrhage (CMH) is a neuropathological term that could be easily found in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, intracerebral hemorrhages, etc. CMHs could be detected clearly in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-susceptibility-weighted imaging or MRI T2* scan. This terminology is now accepted in the area of neuroimaging. CMHs are quite common in elderly patients and are associated with several other neuropsychiatric disorders. The causes of CMHs are complicated, and neuroinflammation is considered as one of the well-accepted mechanical factors. This study investigated whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CMHs occur through the regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and reveals the exact underlying mechanism of LPS-induced CMHs.Our work successfully developed a subacute model of CMHs in rats. LPS was intraperitoneally injected into rats at 0, 6, and 24 hours, which induced typical CMH features 7 days after the injection. These could be detected on the brain surface or parenchyma by hematoxylin and eosin staining and MRI.LPS-treated rats showed significant activation of astrocytes and microglia, as well as loss of pericytes and disruption of blood-brain . Meanwhile, both astrocytes and microglia were positively correlated with CMH numbers. Furthermore, the expressions of NOS isoforms were also examined, and the levels of neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS were found to be elevated.These results implied that the NOS isoforms might be involved in the subacute model of CMHs in rats induced by LPS.Copyright © 2018 National Stroke Association.

Nf (neurofilaments) are specific scaffolding proteins of neurons, and their quantification in serum has been proposed as a biomarker for neuroaxonal injury. We performed a prospective, longitudinal, single-center study at the University Hospital of Basel to determine serum Nf concentrations in pregnant women with singleton pregnancies and with high risk of preeclampsia or with early signs of preeclampsia. Enrollment started at 21 weeks of gestation, followed up with multiple visits until delivery. Sixty out of 197 women developed preeclampsia (30.5%). NfL (Nf light chain) was measured with a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) assay, in addition to the established preeclampsia markers sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like  kinase-1) and PlGF (placental growth factor). The most important independent predictors of NfL were maternal age, number of pregnancies, and proteinuria. NfL levels increased during pregnancy and were significantly higher in women developing preeclampsia. The discriminatory accuracy of NfL, PlGF, and sFlt-1 in receiver operating characteristic curves analysis (area under the curve) of the overall group was 0.68, 0.81, and 0.84, respectively, and in women older than 36 years 0.7, 0.62, and 0.79, respectively. We conclude that increased axonal injury serum marker NfL predicts preeclampsia particularly in older women, with an accuracy similar to the established angiogenic factors. NfL may serve as an early indicator of preeclampsia-induced changes in cerebral structure and may help to stratify disease management.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355657>Pressure-dependent NOS activation contributes to endothelial hyperpermeability in a model of acute heart failure.</a></h1><p> Acute increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) can induce pulmonary edema (PE). The mechanism(s) for this rapid onset edema may involve more than just increased fluid filtration. Lung endothelial cell permeability is regulated by pressure-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Herein, we demonstrate that pressure-dependent NOS activation contributes to vascular failure and PE in a model of acute heart failure (AHF) caused by hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Acute hypertension was induced by norepinephrine (NE) infusion and resulted in an increase in LVEDP and pulmonary artery pressure (P) that were associated with a rapid fall in PO, and increases in lung wet/dry ratio and injury scores. Heart failure (HF) lungs showed increased nitrotyrosine content and ROS levels. L-NAME pretreatment mitigated the development of PE and reduced lung ROS concentrations to sham levels. Apocynin (Apo) pretreatment inhibited PE. Addition of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to AHF rats lung lysates and pretreatment of AHF rats with folic acid (FA) prevented ROS production indicating endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling. Pressure-dependent NOS activation leads to acute endothelial hyperpermeability and rapid PE by an increase in NO and ROS in a model of AHF. Acute increases in pulmonary vascular pressure, without NOS activation, was insufficient to cause significant PE. These results suggest a clinically relevant role of endothelial mechanotransduction in the pathogenesis of AHF and further highlights the concept of active  failure in AHF. Therapies targetting the prevention or reversal of endothelial hyperpermeability may be a novel therapeutic strategy in AHF.© 2018 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625033>Role of JAM-A  phosphorylation in epithelial  dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), an epithelial tight junction protein, plays an important role in regulating intestinal permeability through association with a scaffold signaling complex containing ZO-2, Afadin, and the small GTPase Rap2. Under inflammatory conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is  phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of  . While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised   in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial  defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative colitis and in mice with experimentally induced colitis.

Detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) was examined by histological analysis, and the nitric oxide synthase, endothelial (eNOS), and nitrotyrosine expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, as well as the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels in the culture supernatant through ELISA assays. Parasite load with qPCR using Taqman primers was quantified.The higher number of T. cruzi (10 ) increased placental infection, eNOS expression, nitrosative stress, and STB detachment, with the placental  being injured by oxidative stress.The higher number of parasites caused deleterious consequences to the placental , and the inhibitors (l-NAME and NAC) prevented the damage caused by trypomastigotes in placental villi but not that of the infection. Moreover, trophoblast eNOS played a key role in placental infection with the highest inoculum of Lucky, demonstrating the importance of the enzyme and nitrosative-oxidative stress in Chagas congenital transmission.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Neurovascular dysregulation in putaminal and pallidal regions is thought to be an underlying feature of this complication of treatment. We used microPET to study unilaterally lesioned 6-hydroxydopamine rats that developed levodopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) after three weeks of drug treatment. Animals were scanned with [O]-labeled water and [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose, to map regional cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism, and with [C]-isoaminobutyric acid (AIB), to assess blood-brain- (BBB) permeability, following separate injections of levodopa or saline. Multitracer scan data were acquired in each animal before initiating levodopa treatment, and again following the period of daily drug administration. Significant dissociation of vasomotor and metabolic levodopa responses was seen in the striatum/globus pallidus (GP) of the lesioned hemisphere. These changes were accompanied by nearby increases in [C]-AIB uptake in the ipsilateral GP, which correlated with AIMs scores. Histopathological analysis revealed high levels of microvascular nestin immunoreactivity in the same region. The findings demonstrate that regional flow-metabolism dissociation and increased BBB permeability are simultaneously induced by levodopa within areas of active microvascular remodeling, and that such changes correlate with the severity of dyskinesia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284245>A multi-spectroscopic study on the interaction of food polyphenols with a bioactive gluten peptide: From chemistry to biological implications.</a></h1><p>This study aims to exploit the molecular and cellular mechanisms concerning the functionality of dietary polyphenols (catechin, procyanidin B3, procyanidin C2, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate) in a nutritional context to prevent Celiac Disease (CD). In that sense, the interaction between the main CD bioactive peptide (32-mer peptide) and some polyphenols was fully characterized at the intestinal level under near physiological conditions by means of different spectroscopic techniques and dynamic simulations. Accordingly, it is proposed that the primarily polyphenol-binding sites on the 32-mer peptide correspond to leucine,  and phenylalanine containing domains being this interaction entropy-driven. Although procyanidin B3 and trimer C2 had a similar low-affinity constant at 310 K, both procyanidins were able to reduce the 32-mer peptide apical-to-basolateral translocation in in vitro simulated intestinal epithelial  thus prospecting the occurrence of additional and still unexplored regulatory mechanisms by which dietary polyphenols might modulate the transepithelial transport of CD bioactive peptides.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and brain endothelium. Thus, ABCG2 functions as a tissue  to drug transport that strongly influences the pharmacokinetics of substrate medications. Genetic polymorphisms of ABCG2 are closely related to inter-individual variations in therapeutic performance. The common single nucleotide polymorphism c.421C>A, p.Q141K reduces cell surface expression of ABCG2 protein, resulting in lower efflux of substrates. Consequently, a higher plasma concentration of substrate is observed in patients carrying an ABCG2 c.421C>A allele. Detailed pharmacokinetic analyses have revealed that altered intestinal absorption is responsible for the distinct pharmacokinetics of ABCG2 substrates in genetic carriers of the ABCG2 c.421C>A polymorphism. Recent studies have focused on the high-alert medications among ABCG2 substrates (defined as those with high risk of adverse events), such as  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs). For these high-alert medications, inter-individual variation may be closely related to the severity of side effects. In addition, ethnic differences in the frequency of ABCG2 c.421C>A have been reported, with markedly higher frequency in East Asian (∼30-60%) than Caucasian and African-American populations (∼5-10%). Therefore, ABCG2 polymorphisms must be considered not only in the drug development phase, but also in clinical practice.

We hypothesize that alterations in intestinal metabolite and microbiota profiles specific to each monosaccharide are involved. Two groups of six adult C57BL/6 mice were fed for 10-weeks with diets with glucose (G) or fructose (F) as sole carbohydrates, and a third group was fed with a normal chow carbohydrate mixture (N). Fecal metabolites were profiled by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and microbial composition by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Although N, G and F mice exhibited similar weight gains (with slight slower gains for F) and glucose tolerance, multivariate analysis of NMR data indicated that F mice were separated from N and G, with decreased butyrate and glutamate and increased fructose, succinate, taurine, , and xylose. The different sugar diets also resulted in distinct intestinal microbiota profiles. That associated with fructose seemed to hold more potential to induce host metabolic disturbances compared to glucose, mainly by promoting bile acid deconjugation and taurine release and compromising intestinal  integrity. This may reflect the noted nonquantitative intestinal fructose absorption hence increasing its availability for microbial metabolism, a subject for further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30442199>Anterior chamber fibrinoid syndrome after cataract extraction in a patient on ibrutinib for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a case report and review of the literature.</a></h1><p>Ibrutinib is a  kinase inhibitor commonly used in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Based on the published literature, it has a very sound ophthalmologic safety profile. In the following, we describe a case of anterior chamber fibrinoid syndrome in a patient on ibrutinib for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia after uncomplicated cataract extraction.A 75-year-old white man with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia on ibrutinib therapy and without significant past ocular history presented 1 day after uncomplicated phacoemulsification with in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation with multiple, discrete, pigmented cords in the anterior chamber. His vision was 20/100 and intraocular pressure was 43 mmHg. There was no hypopyon, hyphema, or cellular reaction. The dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. He was diagnosed as having fibrinoid syndrome and started on topical prednisolone, brimonidine, timolol-dorzolamide, and orally administered acetazolamide. Within 2 weeks, the fibrin cords disappeared completely, vision improved to 20/30, and the intraocular pressure normalized off all medications.The precise etiology of fibrinoid syndrome remains unclear. This is the first case of fibrinoid syndrome in a patient on ibrutinib, which is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and induce intraocular changes. It is important to differentiate this syndrome from toxic anterior segment syndrome and endophthalmitis, and to initiate appropriate treatment. The fibrin bands tend to be exquisitely sensitive to topical steroids and to resolve within a few weeks without sequelae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29197141>The blood-brain  internalises Cryptococcus neoformans via the EphA2- kinase receptor.</a></h1><p>Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningitis most commonly in populations with impaired immunity. Here, we resolved the transcriptome of the human brain endothelium challenged with C. neoformans to establish whether C. neoformans invades the CNS by co-opting particular signalling pathways as a means to promote its own entry. Among the 5 major pathways targeted by C. neoformans, the EPH-EphrinA1 (EphA2)  kinase receptor-signalling pathway was examined further. Silencing the EphA2 receptor transcript in a human brain endothelial cell line or blocking EphA2 activity with an antibody or chemical inhibitor prevented transmigration of C. neoformans in an in vitro model of the blood-brain  (BBB). In contrast, treating brain endothelial cells with an EphA2 chemical agonist or an EphA2 ligand promoted greater migration of fungal cells across the BBB. C. neoformans activated the EPH- kinase pathway through a CD44-dependent phosphorylation of EphA2, promoting clustering and internalisation of EphA2 receptors. Moreover, HEK293T cells expressing EphA2 revealed an association between EphA2 and C. neoformans that boosted internalisation of C. neoformans. Collectively, the results suggest that C. neoformans promotes EphA2 activity via CD44, and this in turn creates a permeable  that facilitates the migration of C. neoformans across the BBB.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30565916>Power of  Assembly in Microtubule Stabilization and Neuroprotection Fueled by Phenol Appendages.</a></h1><p>Microtubules play a crucial role in maintenance of structure, , axonal extensions, cargo transport, and polarity of neurons. During neurodegenerative diseases, microtubule structure and  get severely damaged due to destabilization of its major structural proteins. Therefore, design and development of molecules that stabilize these microtubule networks have always been an important strategy for development of potential neurotherapeutic candidates. Toward this venture, we designed and developed a  rich trisubstituted triazine molecule (TY3) that stabilizes microtubules through close interaction with the taxol binding site. Detailed structural investigations revealed that the phenolic protons are the key interacting partners of tubulin. Interestingly, we found that this molecule is noncytotoxic in PC12 derived neurons, stabilizes microtubules against nocodazole induced depolymerization, and increases expression of acetylated tubulin (Ac-K40), an important marker of tubulin stability. Further, results show that TY3 significantly induces neurite sprouting as compared to the untreated control as well as the two other analogues (TS3 and TF3). It also possesses anti-Aβ fibrillation properties as confirmed by ThT assay, which leads to its neuroprotective effect against amyloidogenic induced toxicity caused through nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation in PC12 derived neurons. Remarkably, our results reveal that it reduces the expression of TrkA (pY490) associated with NGF deprived amyloidogenesis, which further proves that it is a potent amyloid β inhibitor. Moreover, it promoted the health of the rat primary cortical neurons through higher expression of key neuronal markers such as MAP2 and Tuj1. Finally, we observed that it has good serum stability and has the ability to cross the blood-brain  (BBB). Overall, our work indicates the importance of phenolic -OH in promoting neuroprotection and its importance could be implemented in the development of future neurotherapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687323>Investigation of cis-4-[F]Fluoro-D-Proline Uptake in Human Brain Tumors After Multimodal Treatment.</a></h1><p>Cis-4-[F]fluoro-D-proline (D-cis-[F]FPro) has been shown to pass the intact blood-brain  and to accumulate in areas of secondary neurodegeneration and necrosis in the rat brain while uptake in experimental brain tumors is low. This pilot study explores the uptake behavior of D-cis-[F]FPro in human brain tumors after multimodal treatment.In a prospective study, 27 patients with suspected recurrent brain tumor after treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy (SRC) were investigated by dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) using D-cis-[F]FPro (22 high-grade gliomas, one unspecified glioma, and 4 metastases). Furthermore, two patients with untreated lesions were included (one glioblastoma, one reactive astrogliosis). Data were compared with the results of PET using O-(2-[F]fluoroethyl)- ([F]FET) which detects viable tumor tissue. Tracer distribution, mean and maximum lesion-to-brain ratios (LBR, LBR), and time-to-peak (TTP) of the time activity curve (TAC) of tracer uptake were evaluated. Final diagnosis was determined by histology (n = 9), clinical follow-up (n = 10), or by [F]FET PET (n = 10).D-cis-[F]FPro showed high uptake in both recurrent brain tumors (n = 11) and lesions classified as treatment-related changes (TRC) only (n = 16) (LBR 2.2 ± 0.7 and 2.1 ± 0.6, n.s.; LBR 3.4 ± 1.2 and 3.2 ± 1.3, n.s.). The untreated glioblastoma and the lesion showing reactive astrogliosis exhibited low D-cis-[F]FPro uptake. Distribution of [F]FET and D-cis-[F]FPro uptake was discordant in 21/29 cases indicating that the uptake mechanisms are different.The high accumulation of D-cis-[F]FPro in pretreated brain tumors and TRC supports the hypothesis that tracer uptake is related to cell death. Further studies before and after therapy are needed to assess the potential of D-cis-[F]FPro for treatment monitoring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492190>Targeting ovarian cancer and endothelium with an allosteric PTP4A3 phosphatase inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Overexpression of protein  phosphatase PTP4A oncoproteins is common in many human cancers and is associated with poor patient prognosis and survival. We observed elevated levels of PTP4A3 phosphatase in 79% of human ovarian tumor samples, with significant overexpression in tumor endothelium and pericytes. Furthermore, PTP4A phosphatases appear to regulate several key malignant processes, such as invasion, migration, and angiogenesis, suggesting a pivotal regulatory role in cancer and endothelial signaling pathways. While phosphatases are attractive therapeutic targets, they have been poorly investigated because of a lack of potent and selective chemical probes. In this study, we disclose that a potent, selective, reversible, and noncompetitive PTP4A inhibitor, JMS-053, markedly enhanced microvascular   after exposure of endothelial cells to vascular endothelial growth factor or lipopolysaccharide. JMS-053 also blocked the concomitant increase in RhoA activation and loss of Rac1. In human ovarian cancer cells, JMS-053 impeded migration, disrupted spheroid growth, and decreased RhoA activity. Importantly, JMS-053 displayed anticancer activity in a murine xenograft model of drug resistant human ovarian cancer. These data demonstrate that PTP4A phosphatases can be targeted in both endothelial and ovarian cancer cells, and confirm that RhoA signaling cascades are regulated by the PTP4A family.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28866799>Intranasal Administration of TAT-Conjugated Lipid Nanocarriers Loading GDNF for Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder (ND), characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation. Current available treatments in clinical practice cannot halt the progression of the disease. During the last few years, growth factors (GFs) have been raised as a promising therapeutic approach to address the underlying neurodegenerative process. Among others, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a widely studied GF for PD. However, its clinical use is limited due to its short half life, rapid degradation rate, and difficulties in crossing the blood-brain  (BBB). Lately, intranasal administration has appeared as an alternative non-invasive way to bypass the BBB and target drugs directly to the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, the aim of this work was to develop a novel nanoformulation to enhance brain targeting in PD through nasal administration. For that purpose, GDNF was encapsulated into chitosan (CS)-coated nanostructured lipid carriers, with the surface modified with transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide (CS-nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC)-TAT-GDNF). After the physiochemical characterization of nanoparticles, the in vivo study was performed by intranasal administration to a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. The CS-NLC-TAT-GDNF-treated group revealed motor recovery which was confirmed with immunohistochemistry studies, showing the highest number of  hydroxylase (TH) fibers in the striatum and TH neuron levels in the substantia nigra. Moreover, ionizing calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 immunohistochemistry was performed, revealing that CS-NLC-TAT-GDNF acts as a modulator on microglia activation, obtaining values similar to control. Therefore, it may be concluded that the intranasal administration of CS-NLC-TAT-GDNF may represent a promising therapy for PD treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621530>Oxidative stress-induced activation of Abl and Src kinases rapidly induces P-glycoprotein internalization via phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on -14, decreasing cortisol efflux at the blood-brain .</a></h1><p>Exposure of the brain to high levels of glucocorticoids during ischemia-reperfusion induces neuronal cell death. Oxidative stress alters blood-brain  (BBB)  during ischemia-reperfusion, and so we hypothesized that it might impair P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux transport of glucocorticoids at the BBB. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of this putative decrease of P-gp-mediated efflux . First, we established that HO treatment of a human in vitro BBB model (hCMEC/D3) reduced both P-gp efflux transport activity and protein expression on the plasma membrane within 20 min. These results suggested that the rapid decrease of efflux  might be due to internalization of P-gp. Furthermore, HO treatment markedly increased -14-phosphorylated caveolin-1, which is involved in P-gp internalization. A brain perfusion study in rats showed that cortisol efflux at the BBB was markedly decreased by HO administration, and inhibitors of Abl kinase and Src kinase, which phosphorylate -14 in caveolin-1, suppressed this decrease. Overall, these findings support the idea that oxidative stress-induced activation of Abl kinase and Src kinase induces internalization of P-gp via the phosphorylation of -14 in caveolin-1, leading to a rapid decrease of P-gp-mediated cortisol efflux at the BBB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30007960>Heat-Induced Epithelial  Dysfunction Occurs via C-Src Kinase and P120ctn Expression Regulation in the Lungs.</a></h1><p>Thermal injury causes pulmonary edema and can lead to death. Intercellular junctions are composed of adhesive (p120ctn, E-cadherin, α-catenin and β-catenin) and compact (occludin and ZO-1) junctions. Heat deteriorates intercellular junctions and increases cell gaps to ultimately induce pulmonary edema, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive.Mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells pre-treated with the c-Src inhibitor PP2, p120ctn catenin (p120ctn) small interfering RNA and p120ctn catenin (p120ctn) complementary DNA were subjected to heat treatment. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to evaluate junction protein expression changes after heat treatment, and co-immunoprecipitation was used to test the binding state of junction proteins. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate changes in junction protein expression and lung injury in a Wistar rat model of thermal inhalation injury.Heat increased cell permeability; induced ZO-1, occludin, α-catenin and β-catenin degradation; and decreased E-cadherin distribution in cell membranes. Heat also activated c-Src and decreased both p120ctn expression levels and occludin and ZO-1 association. c-Src inhibitor (PP2) treatment and p120ctn overexpression reversed these effects and attenuated lung injury in vivo.Heat induces junction protein degradation and dissociation to increase membrane permeability and cause lung edema via c-Src kinase activation and p120ctn expression downregulation.© 2018 The Author(s).

However, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has so far not been therapeutically successful due to adaptive resistance through a rapid rewiring of cancer cell signaling. Here we identified that WEE1 is activated after transient exposure to PI3K inhibition and confers resistance to PI3K inhibition in GBM.Patient-derived glioma-initiating cells and established GBM cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor or WEE1 inhibitor alone or in combination, and cell proliferation was evaluated by CellTiter-Blue assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL, annexin V staining, and blotting of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Both subcutaneous xenograft and orthotropic xenograft studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the combination on tumorigenesis; the tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging, and tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry to validate signaling changes.PI3K inhibition activates WEE1 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates cell division control protein 2 homolog (Cdc2) at Tyr15 and inhibits Cdc2 activity, leading to G2/M arrest in a p53-independent manner. WEE1 inhibition abrogated the G2/M arrest and propelled cells to prematurely enter into mitosis and consequent cell death through mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Additionally, combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth in a subcutaneous model but not in an intracranial model due to limited blood-brain  penetration.Our findings highlight WEE1 as an adaptive resistant gene activated after PI3K inhibition, and inhibition of WEE1 potentiated the effectiveness of PI3K targeted inhibition, suggesting that a combinational inhibition of WEE1 and PI3K might allow successful targeted therapy in GBM.© The Author(s) 2017.

Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanisms of NaB in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). A mouse was intraperitoneally treated with MPTP (30mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days to induce PD model and NaB (200mg/kg) was intragastrically treated for 3weeks. The behavioral tests were then conducted. Dopaminergic degeneration was evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry of  hydroxylase (TH) in the SN. Brain damage was assessed by histologic (Nissl staining for cell death), apoptosis-associated protein and tight junction (TJ) proteins studies. Meanwhile, the levels of colonic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cerebral GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression were assessed. Our results showed that NaB improved neurobehavioral impairment including cognitive behavior and coordination performance. Moreover, NaB treatment prevented the MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration and decreased expression level of TH in the striatum. NaB treatment attenuated the PD-associated disruption of BBB by upregulation of Occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. In addition, NaB resulted in increased level of Bcl-2 and decreased level of Bax. Particularly, NaB-treated mice with PD exhibited increased colonic GLP-1 level as well as upregulation of brain GLP-1R expression compared with PD group. Our findings suggest that NaB has potential as a novel therapeutic for treatment of PD, and its mechanism was associated with stimulating colonic GLP-1secretion.Copyright © 2017.

ROS1 gene fusions are potent oncogenic drivers, the presence of which results in the susceptibility of tumours to ROS1-targeted therapy. Crizotinib was the first  kinase inhibitor to demonstrate activity in ROS1-rearranged lung cancer, and remains the recommended first-line therapy for patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Despite excellent initial responses to crizotinib, the majority of patients develop disease progression, which may be intracranial or extracranial.

We reported previously that Janus kinase 3, a non-receptor  kinase, plays a crucial role in AJ formation through its interaction with β-catenin. In this report, we characterize the structural determinants responsible for Jak3 interactions with β-catenin and determine the functional implications of previously unknown  residues on β-catenin phosphorylated by Jak3. We demonstrate that Jak3 autophosphorylation was the rate-limiting step during Jak3 trans-phosphorylation of β-catenin, where Jak3 directly phosphorylated three  residues,  Tyr, Tyr, and Tyr in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of β-catenin. However, prior phosphorylation of β-catenin at Tyr was essential for further phosphorylation of β-catenin by Jak3. Interaction studies indicated that phosphorylated Jak3 bound to phosphorylated β-catenin with a dissociation constant of 0.28 μm, and although both the kinase and FERM (Band 1, zrin, adixin, and oesin) domains of Jak3 interacted with β-catenin, the NTD domain of β-catenin facilitated its interactions with Jak3. Physiologically, Jak3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin suppressed EGF-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and facilitated epithelial  functions by AJ localization of phosphorylated β-catenin through its interactions with α-catenin. Moreover, loss of Jak3-mediated phosphorylation sites in β-catenin abrogated its AJ localization and compromised epithelial  functions. Thus, we not only characterize Jak3 interaction with β-catenin but also demonstrate the mechanism of molecular interplay between AJ dynamics and EMT by Jak3-mediated NTD phosphorylation of β-catenin.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653704>Intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) requires Janus kinase 3 activity for drug efflux and  functions  in obesity.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins whose primary  is to efflux substrates bound to the plasma membrane. Impaired intestinal  functions play a major role in chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI)-associated obesity, but the regulation of BCRP during obesity and its role in maintaining the intestinal   during CLGI-associated obesity are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during obesity are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated  phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human obesity or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and  functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated obesity both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793583>Reduction of vascular leakage by imatinib is associated with preserved microcirculatory perfusion and reduced renal injury markers in a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass.</a></h1><p>Cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery leads to impaired microcirculatory perfusion. We hypothesized that vascular leakage is an important contributor to microcirculatory dysfunction. Imatinib, a  kinase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce vascular leakage in septic mice. We investigated whether prevention of vascular leakage using imatinib preserves microcirculatory perfusion and reduces organ injury markers in a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass.Male Wistar rats underwent cardiopulmonary bypass after treatment with imatinib or vehicle (n=8 per group). Cremaster muscle microcirculatory perfusion and quadriceps microvascular oxygen saturation were measured using intravital microscopy and reflectance spectroscopy. Evans Blue extravasation was determined in separate experiments. Organ injury markers were determined in plasma, intestine, kidney, and lungs.The onset of cardiopulmonary bypass decreased the number of perfused microvessels by 40% in the control group [9.4 (8.6-10.6) to 5.7 (4.8-6.2) per microscope field; P<0.001 vs baseline], whereas this reduction was not seen in the imatinib group. In the control group, the number of perfused capillaries remained low throughout the experiment, whilst perfusion remained normal after imatinib administration. Microvascular oxygen saturation was less impaired after imatinib treatment compared with controls. Imatinib reduced vascular leakage and decreased fluid resuscitation compared with control [3 (3-6) vs 12 ml (7-16); P=0.024]. Plasma neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipocalin concentrations were reduced by imatinib.Prevention of endothelial  dysfunction using imatinib preserved microcirculatory perfusion and oxygenation during and after cardiopulmonary bypass.

Here we investigated molecular mechanisms driving Tie2 suppression in settings of critical illness.Laboratory and animal research, postmortem kidney biopsies from acute kidney injury patients and serum from septic shock patients.Research laboratories and ICU of Hannover Medical School, Harvard Medical School, and University of Groningen.Deceased septic acute kidney injury patients (n = 16) and controls (n = 12) and septic shock patients (n = 57) and controls (n = 22).Molecular biology assays (Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction) + in vitro models of flow and transendothelial electrical resistance experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells; murine cecal ligation and puncture and lipopolysaccharide administration.We observed rapid reduction of both Tie2 messenger RNA and protein in mice following cecal ligation and puncture. In cultured endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α, suppression of Tie2 protein was more severe than Tie2 messenger RNA, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. Evidence of protein-level regulation was found in tumor necrosis factor-α-treated endothelial cells, septic mice, and septic humans, all three of which displayed elevation of the soluble N-terminal fragment of Tie2. The matrix metalloprotease 14 was both necessary and sufficient for N-terminal Tie2 shedding. Since clinical settings of Tie2 suppression are often characterized by shock, we next investigated the effects of laminar flow on Tie2 expression. Compared with absence of flow, laminar flow induced both Tie2 messenger RNA and the expression of GATA binding protein 3. Conversely, septic lungs exhibited reduced GATA binding protein 3, and knockdown of GATA binding protein 3 in flow-exposed endothelial cells reduced Tie2 messenger RNA. Postmortem tissue from septic patients showed a trend toward reduced GATA binding protein 3 expression that was associated with Tie2 messenger RNA levels (p < 0.005).Tie2 suppression is a pivotal event in sepsis that may be regulated both by matrix metalloprotease 14-driven Tie2 protein cleavage and GATA binding protein 3-driven flow regulation of Tie2 transcript.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611906>Exosomal Circular RNA as a Biomarker Platform for the Early Diagnosis of Immune-Mediated Demyelinating Disease.</a></h1><p>Exosomes can pass through the blood-brain  and are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The components in exosomes, such as DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids, change greatly and are closely related to disease progression. Circular RNA (circRNA) is stable in structure and has a long half-life in exosomes without degradation. Therefore, circRNA is considered an ideal biomarker and can be used to monitor a variety of central nervous system diseases. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of exosomal circRNA (exo-circRNA) in CSF from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases to identify suitable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. circRNA expression levels in exosomes obtained from five CSF samples from immune-mediated demyelinating disease patients and five paired CSF control samples were analyzed using a hybridization array. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that 5,095 exo-circRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases and paired control samples. Of these exo-circRNAs, 26 were identified as significantly differentially expressed in CSF exosomes from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases (FC ≥1.5 and p ≤ 0.05). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that the upregulation or activation of protein  phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and RAD23 homolog B, nucleotide excision repair protein (RAD23B) may be associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. Then, a competing endogenous RNA network was constructed and centered on the most upregulated/downregulated exo-circRNAs to predict their  in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction results stating that hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 were validated in an independent cohort of subjects. Canonical correlation analysis results indicated a potential connection between exosomal hsa_circ_0012077 expression level and immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that when hsa_circ_0087862 or hsa_circ_0012077 was employed alone for diagnosing immune-mediated demyelinating diseases, the diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In conclusion, based on this study, exosomal hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 in CSF could be used as suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating disease based on their expression levels. Moreover, the upregulation or activation of PTPRF and RAD23B was potentially associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases.Copyright © 2019 He, Ren, Li, Yang, Wang and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078020>Membrane-Bound CD40L Promotes Senescence and Initiates Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype via NF-κB Activation in Lung Adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>Cellular senescence acts as a  against tumorigenesis. The CD40L transgene, expressed in some tumor cells, not only becomes visible to antigen-presenting cells but also actively catalyzes its own termination. Here, we evaluated the effect of a membrane-bound mutant form of human CD40L (CD40L-M) on senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).CD40 expression levels in the NSCLC cell lines A549/TR, A549/DDP and H460 were examined by flow cytometry. Senescent cells and tissues were identified via SA-β-gal activity. Cell proliferation was visualized by EdU labeling. qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to assess mRNA and protein expression levels of CD40L, γ-H2A.X, p65, p-p65, IκBα, p53, p21 and p16. Cytokines secreted from transfected cells were tested by ELISA and cell migration assay. Capsid -modified rAAV5-CD40L-M was packaged and carried out in vivo.Overexpression of CD40L-M promoted senescence, inhibited proliferation, increased DNA damage-associated γ-H2A.X, and initiated the SASP in CD40-positive NSCLC cells. NF-κB signaling was activated by CD40L-M overexpression in these cells. Knockdown of NF-κB partially overcame senescence and failed to induce SASP. Furthermore, increased p53 and p21 protein levels induced by CD40L-M were also reduced following NF-κB suppression.These data showed that the membrane-bound CD40L mutant may promote cellular senescence and initiate the SASP of NSCLC cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Therefore, CD40L-M-induced senescence may be a potential approach to protect against lung adenocarcinoma.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

In these locations ILC respond to tissue perturbations by producing factors that promote tissue repair and improve  integrity. We show that mice lacking the Tec kinase ITK have impaired intestinal tissue integrity, and a reduced ability to restore homeostasis after tissue damage. This defect is associated with a substantial loss of Type 2 ILC (ILC2) in the intestinal lamina propria. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow ILC2 precursors confirms a cell-intrinsic role for ITK. Intestinal ILC2 numbers in Itk mice are restored by the administration of IL-2 complexes, also leading to improved intestinal tissue damage repair. Reduced Bcl-2 expression in intestinal Itk ILC2 is also restored to WT levels after IL-2 complex treatment, indicating a tissue-specific role for ITK in ILC2 survival in the intestine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347283>Transbronchoscopic patient biopsy-derived xenografts as a preclinical model to explore chemorefractory-associated pathways and biomarkers for small-cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Insufficient tumor tissue is a major  for cancer biology research in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and has driven the development of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from biopsy tumor tissues. Here, we utilized transbronchoscopic biopsy specimens from SCLC tumors to establish PDXs and evaluated the genomic profile using next-generation sequencing and an RNA sequencing platform. The PDX establishment rate was 54.1% (40/74). PDXs largely recapitulated the major characteristics of their corresponding primary tumors, such as histopathology, genetic profile, and chemo-responsiveness. Compared with chemosensitive (chemo-S) PDXs, chemorefractory (chemo-R) PDXs demonstrated significant gene aberrances in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and a higher frequency of receptor  kinase (RTK)-related genes. Phosphorylated ERK (pERK) was associated with chemo-R status. Patients with positive pERK expression demonstrated significantly inferior progression-free survival after first-line chemotherapy compared with that of patients who were negative for pERK (p < 0.001). Collectively, transbronchoscopic biopsy SCLC PDXs can serve as a model for genomic profiling and identifying biomarkers predictive of chemo-R status. Using PDXs, RTK-related gene aberrances and pERK expression were found to be associated with chemo-R SCLC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The sarcoma homology domain containing protein  phosphatase (SHP)2 has been shown to be involved in regulating endothelial  ; however, the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this work SHP2 knockdown in an HUVEC monolayer increased VE-cadherin internalization and endothelial  permeability. Loss of SHP2 specifically augmented the GTPase activity of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-1. ARF1 knockdown or inhibition of its guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) markedly attenuated VE-cadherin internalization and  hyperpermeability induced by SHP2 deficiency. SHP2 knockdown increased the total and phosphorylated levels of MET, whose activity was necessary for ARF1 activation and VE-cadherin internalization. Furthermore, constitutive endothelium-specific deletion of Shp2 in mice led to disrupted endothelial cell junctions, massive hemorrhage, and lethality in embryos. Induced and endothelium-specific deletion of Shp2 in adult mice resulted in lung hyperpermeability. Inhibitors for ARF1-GEF or MET used in pregnant mice prevented the vascular leakage in endothelial Shp2-deleted embryos. Together, our findings define a novel role of SHP2 in stabilizing junctional VE-cadherin in the resting endothelial  through suppressing MET and ARF1 activation.-Zhang, J., Huang, J., Qi, T., Huang, Y., Lu, Y., Zhan, T., Gong, H., Zhu, Z., Shi, Y., Zhou, J., Yu, L., Zhang, X., Cheng, H., Ke, Y.

However, whether these changes are an early event in the development of NAFLD or are primarily associated with later stages of the disease, has not yet been clarified. Using a pair-feeding model, we determined the effects of a short-term intake of a fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) on the development of early hepatic steatosis and markers of intestinal   in mice treated with and without non-resorbable antibiotics (AB). For four days, C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a control diet or a FFC diet ± AB (92 mg/kg body weight (BW) polymyxin B and 216 mg/kg BW neomycin). Hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation, lipidperoxidation and intestinal   were assessed. Lipid accumulation and early signs of inflammation found in the livers of FFC-fed mice were markedly attenuated in FFC + AB-fed animals. In FFC-fed mice the development of NAFLD was associated with a significant loss of tight junction proteins and an induction of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in the upper parts of the small intestine as well as significantly higher portal endotoxin levels and an induction of dependent signaling cascades in the liver. As expected, portal endotoxin levels and the expression of dependent signaling cascades in liver tissue were almost at the level of controls in FFC + AB-fed mice. However, FFC + AB-fed mice were also protected from the loss of zonula occludens-1 and partially of occludin protein in small intestine. Our data suggest that the development of early diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice at least in part results from alterations of intestinal  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914619>The Treatment of Gliomas in Adulthood.</a></h1><p>Gliomas are the most common intrinsic tumors of the brain, with an incidence of 6 per 100 000 persons per year. Recent years have seen marked changes in the diagnosis and treatment of gliomas, with molecular parameters now being an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation.This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, with special attention to the new WHO glioma classification.The classification of gliomas on the basis of additional molecular parameters enables more accurate prognostication and serves as a basis for therapeutic decision-making and treatment according to precisely specified algorithms. PET scanning with 18F-fluoroethyl  and 11C-methionine for the measurement of metabolic activity in gliomas has further refined the diagnostic evaluation. The median overall survival of patients with glioblastoma who have undergone resection of all tumor tissue with a disrupted blood-brain  (i.e., all contrast-enhancing tumor tissue) has been prolonged to up to 20 months. The 5-year survival of patients with WHO grade II gliomas is now as high as 97% after near-total resection. The surgical resection of all contrast-enhancing tumor tissue and subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the key elements of treatment. New surgical strategies and new methods of planning radiotherapy have made these techniques safer and more effective. The percutaneous application of tumor-treating fields is a new therapeutic option that has gained a degree of acceptance. Accompanying measures such as psycho-oncology and palliative care are very important for patients and should be considered mandatory.The consistent application of the existing multimodal treatment options for glioma has led in recent years to improved survival. Areas of important current and future scientific activity include immunotherapy and targeted and combined chemotherapy, as well as altered neurocognition, modern approaches to palliative care, and complementary therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100012>Targeting Glioma Stem Cell-Derived Pericytes Disrupts the Blood-Tumor  and Improves Chemotherapeutic Efficacy.</a></h1><p>The blood-tumor  (BTB) is a major obstacle for drug delivery to malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM). Disrupting the BTB is therefore highly desirable but complicated by the need to maintain the normal blood-brain  (BBB). Here we show that targeting glioma stem cell (GSC)-derived pericytes specifically disrupts the BTB and enhances drug effusion into brain tumors. We found that pericyte coverage of tumor vasculature is inversely correlated with GBM patient survival after chemotherapy. Eliminating GSC-derived pericytes in xenograft models disrupted BTB tight junctions and increased vascular permeability. We identified BMX as an essential factor for maintaining GSC-derived pericytes. Inhibiting BMX with ibrutinib selectively targeted neoplastic pericytes and disrupted the BTB, but not the BBB, thereby increasing drug effusion into established tumors and enhancing the chemotherapeutic efficacy of drugs with poor BTB penetration. These findings highlight the clinical potential of targeting neoplastic pericytes to significantly improve treatment of brain tumors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A critical  of the intestinal epithelium is formation of a selective  to luminal contents. The structural units of the epithelium that regulate   are the tight junctions (TJs), and the protein composition of the TJ determines the tightness of the . Claudin-2 is a TJ protein that increases permeability to cations and reduces transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). We previously showed that transient knockdown (KD) of TCPTP permits increased expression of claudin-2 by IFN-γ. Here, we demonstrate that the decreased TER in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells is alleviated by STAT1 KD. Moreover, increased claudin-2 in TCPTP-deficient cells requires enhanced STAT1 activation and STAT1 binding to the CLDN2 promoter. We also show that mutation of this STAT-binding site prevents elevated CLDN2 promoter activity in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells. In summary, we demonstrate that TCPTP protects the intestinal epithelial  by restricting STAT-induced claudin-2 expression. This is a potential mechanism by which loss-of- mutations in the gene encoding TCPTP may contribute to  defects in chronic intestinal inflammatory disease.© 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574128>Pyk2-dependent phosphorylation of LSR enhances localization of LSR and tricellulin at tricellular tight junctions.</a></h1><p>Tight junctions (TJs) are cellular junctions within the mammalian epithelial cell sheet that  as a physical  to molecular transport within the intercellular space. Dysregulation of TJs leads to various diseases. Tricellular TJs (tTJs), specialized structural variants of TJs, are formed by multiple transmembrane proteins (e.g., lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor [LSR] and tricellulin) within tricellular contacts in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet. However, the mechanism for recruiting LSR and tricellulin to tTJs is largely unknown. Previous studies have identified that tyrphostin 9, the dual inhibitor of Pyk2 (a nonreceptor  kinase) and receptor  kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suppresses LSR and tricellulin recruitment to tTJs in EpH4 (a mouse mammary epithelial cell line) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Pyk2 inhibition on LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs. Pyk2 inactivation by its specific inhibitor or repression by RNAi inhibited the localization of LSR and downstream tricellulin to tTJs without changing their expression level in EpH4 cells. Pyk2-dependent changes in subcellular LSR and tricellulin localization were independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and expression. Additionally, Pyk2-dependent LSR phosphorylation at Tyr-237 was required for LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs and decreased epithelial  .

Adjacent FP are connected by a specialized intercellular junction known as the slit diaphragm (SD), which serves as the ultimate  to regulate passage of macromolecules from the blood. While the link between SD dysfunction and reduced filtration selectivity has been recognized for nearly 50 years, our understanding of the underlying molecular circuitry began only 20 years ago, sparked by the identification of , encoding the transmembrane protein nephrin. Nephrin not only functions as the core component of the extracellular SD filtration network but also as a signaling scaffold  interactions at its short intracellular region. Phospho-regulation of several conserved  residues in this region influences signal transduction pathways which control podocyte cell adhesion, shape, and survival, and emerging studies highlight roles for nephrin phospho-dynamics in mechanotransduction and endocytosis.

Here, we investigated whether PTPN2 modulates the expression of related  phosphatases.PTPN2 knockdown in HT-29 cells was induced using siRNA constructs. Acute colitis in PTPN2xVilCre mice was induced by 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Colitis-associated tumors were induced by injection of azoxymethane prior to treatment with DSS for 3 consecutive cycles.In HT-29 cells,  depletion resulted in enhanced mRNA expression of  and  and in parallel to upregulation of  mRNA upon treatment with TNF for 24 h. DSS treatment of PTPN2-deficient mice resulted in a strong induction of  mRNA in colon tissue in vivo. In the tumor model,  mRNA was again clearly upregulated in nontumor tissue from PTPN2-deficient mice; however, this was not observed in tumor tissue.Our experiments show that PTPN23  might, at least partially, compensate lack of PTPN2 in epithelial cells. Upregulation of PTPN23 might therefore crucially contribute to the lack of a colitis phenotype in PTPN2-VilCre mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822427>Ropivacaine inhibits pressure-induced lung endothelial hyperpermeability in models of acute hypertension.</a></h1><p>Increases in hydrostatic pressure results in endothelial hyperpermeability via eNOS-dependent pathways. Ropivacaine is known to inhibit eNOS activation and to attenuate lung injury. Herein, we sought to determine if ropivacaine regulates pressure-induced lung endothelial hyperpermeability.The effects of ropivacaine on lung permeability were assessed in two models of acute hypertension (AH): the isolated perfused lung preparation where acute increases in left atrial pressure model the hemodynamic changes of severe hypertension, and an animal model of AH induced by norepinephrine. In the IPL model, whole lung filtration coefficient (K) was used as the index of lung permeability; pulmonary artery pressure (P), pulmonary capillary pressures (P), and zonal characteristics (ZC) were measured to assess the effects of ropivacaine on hemodynamics and their relationship to K/K. In vivo, ropivacaine effects were investigated on indices of pulmonary edema (changes in PO lung wet-to-dry ratio), changes in plasma volume and nitric oxide (NO) production.Ropivacaine provided robust protection from pressure-dependent  failure; it inhibited pressure-induced increases in K without affecting P, P or ZC. In vivo, ropivacaine prevented pressure-induced lung edema and associated hyperpermeability as evidence by maintaining PO, lung wet-to-dry ratio and plasma volume in levels similar to sham rats. Ropivacaine inhibited pressure-induced NO production as evidenced by decreased lung nitro- content when compared to hypertensive lungs.Collectively these data show that ropivacaine inhibits pressure-induced lung endothelial hyperpermeability and suggest that ropivacaine may be a clinically useful agent to prevent endothelial hyperpermeability when pulmonary pressure is acutely increased.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Maintenance of nephrin within this unique cell junction has been proposed to require dynamic phosphorylation events and endocytic recycling, although the molecular mechanisms that control this interplay are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the possibility that the phosphotyrosine adaptor protein ShcA regulates nephrin turnover. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis confirmed that ShcA is expressed in podocytes. In immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays, ShcA,  its SH2 domain, was associated with several phosphorylated  residues on nephrin. Overexpression of ShcA promoted nephrin  phosphorylation and reduced nephrin signaling and cell surface expression  In a rat model of reversible podocyte injury and proteinuria, phosphorylated nephrin temporally colocalized with endocytic structures coincident with upregulation of ShcA expression.  biotinylation assays confirmed that nephrin expression decreased at the cell surface and correspondingly increased in the cytosol during the injury time course. Finally, immunostaining in kidney biopsy specimens demonstrated overexpression of ShcA in several human proteinuric kidney diseases compared with normal conditions.

Silencing of the α-synuclein gene could provide long-lasting disease-modifying benefits by reducing the requisite substrate for the spreading aggregation.As a result of the poor penetration of viral vectors across the blood-brain , gene therapy for central nervous system disorders requires direct injections into the affected brain regions, and invasiveness is further increased by the need for bilateral delivery to multiple brain regions. Here we test a noninvasive approach by combining low-intensity magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound and intravenous microbubbles that can transiently increase the access of brain impermeant therapeutic macromolecules to targeted brain regions.Transgenic mice expressing human α-synuclein were subjected to magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound targeted to 4 brain regions (hippocampus, substantia nigra, olfactory bulb, and dorsal motor nucleus) in tandem with intravenous microbubbles and an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector bearing a short hairpin RNA sequence targeting the α-synuclein gene.One month following treatment, α-synuclein immunoreactivity was decreased in targeted brain regions, whereas other neuronal markers such as synaptophysin or  hydroxylase were unchanged, and cell death and glial activation remained at basal levels.These results demonstrate that magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound can effectively, noninvasively, and simultaneously deliver viral vectors targeting α-synuclein to multiple brain areas. Importantly, this approach may be useful to alter the progression of Lewy pathology along selected neuronal pathways, particularly as prodromal PD markers improve early diagnoses. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.© 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326721>Defenders and Challengers of Endothelial  .</a></h1><p>Regulated vascular permeability is an essential feature of normal  and its dysfunction is associated with major human diseases ranging from cancer to inflammation and ischemic heart diseases. Integrity of endothelial cells also play a prominent role in the outcome of surgical procedures and organ transplant. Endothelial   and integrity are regulated by a plethora of highly specialized transmembrane receptors, including claudin family proteins, occludin, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and the newly identified immunoglobulin (Ig) and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1) through various distinct mechanisms and signaling. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its  kinase receptor, VEGF receptor-2, play a central role in the destabilization of endothelial  .

Curcumin holds the potential for α-synuclein clearance to treat PD; however, its applications are still limited due to its low bioavailability and poor permeability through the BBB in a free form.  Herein, this paper fabricated curcumin-loaded polysorbate 80-modified cerasome (CPC) nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean diameter of ~110 nm for enhancing the localized curcumin delivery into the targeted brain nuclei via effective BBB opening in combination with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD).  The liposomal nanohybrid cerasome exhibited superior stability towards PS 80 surfactant solubilization and longer circulation lifetime (t = 6.22 h), much longer than free curcumin (t = 0.76 h). The permeation was found to be 1.7-fold higher than that of CPC treatment only at 6 h after the systemic administration of CPC NPs. Notably, motor behaviors, dopamine (DA) level and  hydroxylase (TH) expression all returned to normal, thanks to α-synuclein (AS) removal mediated by efficient curcumin delivery to the striatum. Most importantly, the animal experiment demonstrated that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice had notably improved behavior disorder and dopamine depletion during two-week post-observation after treatment with CPC NPs (15 mg curcumin/kg) coupled with UTMD.  This novel CPC-UTMD formulation approach could be an effective, safe and amenable choice with higher therapeutic relevance and fewer unwanted complications than conventional chemotherapeutics delivery systems for PD treatment in the near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29216437>Erythropoietin-Producing Hepatoma Receptor  Kinase A2 Modulation Associates with Protective Effect of Prone Position in Ventilator-induced Lung Injury.</a></h1><p>The erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (Eph) receptor  kinase A2 (EphA2) and its ligand, ephrinA1, play a pivotal role in inflammation and tissue injury by modulating the epithelial and endothelial  integrity.

Wild-type mice were ventilated with high (24 ml/kg; positive end-expiratory pressure, 0 cm; 5 h) tidal volume in a supine or prone position. Anti-EphA2 receptor antibody or IgG was administered to the supine position group. Injury was assessed by analyzing the BAL fluid, lung injury scoring, and transmission electron microscopy. Lung lysates were evaluated using cytokine/chemokine ELISA and Western blotting of EphA2, ephrinA1, PI3Kγ, Akt, NF-κB, and P70S6 kinase. EphA2/ephrinA1 expression was higher in the supine high tidal volume group than in the control group, but it did not increase upon prone positioning or anti-EphA2 receptor antibody treatment. EphA2 antagonism reduced the extent of VILI and downregulated the expression of PI3Kγ, Akt, NF-κB, and P70S6 kinase. These findings demonstrate that EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling is involved in the molecular mechanism of VILI and that modulation of EphA2/ehprinA1 signaling by prone position or EphA2 antagonism may be associated with the lung-protective effect. Our data provide evidence for EphA2/ehprinA1 as a promising therapeutic target for modulating VILI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29430654>Enhanced efficacy of AZD3759 and radiation on brain metastasis from EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>The prognosis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) is poor. In our study, we demonstrated that AZD3759, an EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with excellent blood-brain  (BBB) penetration, combined with radiation enhanced the antitumor efficacy in BM model from EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC. Besides, the antitumor activity displayed no difference between radiation concurrently with AZD3759 and radiation sequentially with AZD3759. Mechanistically, we found that two factors determined the enhanced efficacy: cells with EGFRm which were sensitive to AZD3759, and a relative high concentration of AZD3759. We have validated mechanisms underlying the radiosensitizing effect of AZD3759, which were involved in decreased cell proliferation and survival, and suppressed repair of DNA damage. Moreover, our study found that AZD3759 inhibited both the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway, and abrogated the G2/M checkpoint to suppress DNA damage repair. We also detected the BBB penetration of AZD3759 when combined with cranial radiation. The results showed the BBB penetration of AZD3759 was decreased within 24 hr after radiation, however, the free concentration of AZD3759 in brain kept at a high level in the context of radiation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that AZD3759 combined with radiation enhances the antitumor activity in BM from EGFRm NSCLC, this combination therapy may be an effective treatment option for BM from EGFRm NSCLC.© 2018 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678325>Kaempferol Attenuates LPS-Induced Striatum Injury in Mice Involving Anti-Neuroinflammation, Maintaining BBB Integrity, and Down-Regulating the HMGB1/TLR4 Pathway.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation has been demonstrated to be linked with Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral ischemia. Our previous investigation had identified that kaempferol (KAE) exerted protective effects on cortex neuron injured by LPS. In this study, the effects and possible mechanism of KAE on striatal dopaminergic neurons induced by LPS in mice were further investigated. The results showed that KAE improved striatal neuron injury, and increased the levels of  hydroxylase (TH) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the striatum of mice. In addition, KAE inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), reduced the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the striatum tissues. Furthermore, KAE protected blood-brain  (BBB) integrity and suppressed the activation of the HMGB1/TLR4 inflammatory pathway induced by LPS in striatum tissues of mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that KAE may have neuroprotective effects against striatum injury that is induced by LPS and the possible mechanisms are involved in anti-neuroinflammation, maintaining BBB integrity, and down-regulating the HMGB1/TLR4 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29308973>Current and emerging EGFR therapies for glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most lethal and hard to treat malignancies in clinical practice. The standard of care for treating GBM involving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) has remained virtually unchanged in the past decade. Molecular targeted therapies against cancer-specific structures have reported mediocre results in the treatment of GBM, due to multiple factors such as the presence of the blood brain  or a vast array of molecular alterations which greatly hinder the action of the most therapeutic agents. One such therapy is directed against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its' receptor (EGFR) using either monoclonal antibodies or  kinase inhibitors. Even though anti-EGF/EGFR treatment produced encouraging results in other forms of cancer it failed to present any clinical benefit for patients with GBM. Lately, immunotherapies that focus on using the host's own immune system against cancer cells have gained popularity, with approaches like peptide vaccination being successfully used in clinical trials for different types of malignancies. These immune-based therapies could hold the key to improving both the prognosis and quality of life for patients suffering for cancers previously considered incurable, such as GBM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504252>Endothelial microvesicles carrying Src-rich cargo impair adherens junction integrity and cytoskeleton homeostasis.</a></h1><p>Microvesicles (MVs) conduct intercellular communication and impact diverse biological processes by transferring bioactive cargos to other cells. We investigated whether and how endothelial production of MVs contribute to vascular dysfunction during inflammation.We measured the levels and molecular properties of endothelial-derived MVs (EC-MVs) from mouse plasma following a septic injury elicited by cecal ligation and puncture, as well as those from supernatants of cultured endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory agents including cytokines, thrombin, and complement 5a. The mouse studies showed that sepsis caused a significant increase in total plasma vesicles and VE-cadherin+ EC-MVs compared to sham control. In cultured ECs, different inflammatory agents caused diverse patterns of EC-MV production and cargo contents. When topically applied to endothelial cells, EC-MVs induced a cytoskeleton-junction response characterized by myosin light chain phosphorylation, contractile fiber reorganization, VE-cadherin phosphorylation and adherens junction dissociation, functionally measured as increased albumin transendothelial flux and decreased  resistance. The endothelial response was coupled with protein  phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo containing c-Src kinase, whereas MVs produced from c-Src deficient cells did not exert -disrupting effects. Additionally, EC-MVs contribute to endothelial inflammatory injury by promoting neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and release of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase, a response unaltered by c-Src knockdown.Endothelial-derived microparticles cause endothelial  dysfunction by impairing adherens junctions and activating neutrophils. The signaling mechanisms underlying the endothelial cytoskeleton-junction response to EC-MVs involve protein phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo carrying c-Src. However, EC-MV induced neutrophil activation was not dependent on c-Src.Circulating microvesicles derived from blood/vascular cells not only serve as serological markers of disease, but also play a pathogenic role in vascular inflammation. In this study, we characterized the production and molecular signature of microparticles produced by endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions. We discovered that these vesicles carry Src-bearing cargo which interact with endothelial cells inducing cytoskeleton contractile stress and impaired VE-cadherin junction integrity. Additionally, endothelial-derived MVs are capable of stimulating neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and production of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase. These novel findings have the potential to be translated into the development of diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Peroxynitrite (ONOO), a representative reactive nitrogen species, mediates excessive mitophagy activation and exacerbates cerebral I/R injury. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that naringin, a natural antioxidant, could inhibit ONOO-mediated mitophagy activation and attenuate cerebral I/R injury. Firstly, we demonstrated that naringin possessed strong ONOO scavenging capability and also inhibited the production of superoxide and nitric oxide in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 10 h oxygen-glucose-deprivation plus 14 h of reoxygenation or ONOO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine conditions. Naringin also inhibited the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and iNOS in rat brains subjected to 2 h ischemia plus 22 h reperfusion. Next, we found that naringin was able to cross the blood-brain , and naringin decreased neurological deficit score, reduced infarct size, and attenuated apoptotic cell death in the ischemia-reperfused rat brains. Furthermore, naringin reduced 3-nitrotyrosine formation, decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in mitochondrial fraction, and inhibited the translocation of Parkin to the mitochondria. Taken together, naringin could be a potential therapeutic agent to prevent the brain from I/R injury via attenuating ONOO-mediated excessive mitophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29629873>A Maternally Sequestered, Biopolymer-Stabilized Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Chimera for Treatment of Preeclampsia.</a></h1><p>Preeclampsia is a hypertensive syndrome that complicates 3% to 5% of pregnancies in the United States. Preeclampsia originates from an improperly vascularized and ischemic placenta that releases factors that drive systemic pathophysiology. One of these factors, soluble fms-like  kinase-1, is believed to sequester vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to systemic endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. With the goal of targeting soluble fms-like  kinase-1 while simultaneously preventing fetal exposure to VEGF, we fused VEGF to elastin-like polypeptide, a biopolymer carrier that does not cross the placental  (ELP-VEGF).ELP-VEGF restored in vitro endothelial cell tube formation in the presence of plasma from placental ischemic rats. Long-term administered ELP-VEGF in pregnant rats accumulated in maternal kidneys, aorta, liver, and placenta, but the protein was undetectable in the pups when administered at therapeutic doses in dams. Long-term administration of ELP-VEGF in a placental ischemia rat model achieved dose-dependent attenuation of hypertension, with blood pressure equal to sham controls at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day. ELP-VEGF infusion increased total plasma soluble fms-like  kinase-1 levels but dramatically reduced free plasma soluble fms-like  kinase-1 and induced urinary excretion of nitrate/nitrite, indicating enhanced renal nitric oxide signaling. ELP-VEGF at up to 5 mg/kg per day had no deleterious effect on maternal or fetal body weight. However, dose-dependent adverse events were observed, including ascites production and neovascular tissue encapsulation around the minipump.ELP-VEGF has the potential to treat the preeclampsia maternal syndrome, but careful dosing and optimization of the delivery route are necessary.© 2017 The Authors.

However, the absorption of light energy by the human scalp and skull may limit the utility of transcranial PBM in clinical contexts. We have previously shown that targeting light at peripheral tissues (i.e. "remote PBM") also provides protection of the brain in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, suggesting remote PBM might be a viable alternative strategy for overcoming penetration issues associated with transcranial PBM. This present study aimed to determine an effective pre-conditioning regimen of remote PBM for inducing neuroprotection and elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which remote PBM enhances the resilience of brain tissue. Balb/c mice were irradiated with 670-nm light (4 J/cm per day) targeting dorsum and hindlimbs for 2, 5 or 10 days, followed by injection of the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP (50 mg/kg) over two consecutive days. Despite no direct irradiation of the head, 10 days of pre-conditioning with remote PBM significantly attenuated MPTP-induced loss of midbrain  hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic cells and mitigated the increase in FOS-positive neurons in the caudate-putamen complex. Interrogation of the midbrain transcriptome by RNA microarray and pathway enrichment analysis suggested upregulation of cell signaling and migration (including CXCR4 stem cell and adipocytokine signaling), oxidative stress response pathways and modulation of the blood-brain  following remote PBM. These findings establish remote PBM preconditioning as a viable neuroprotective intervention and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

It is purified from Androctonus australis scorpion venom. The binding of KTX2 to its targets is able to alter the neuronal excitability leading to neurological disorders, accompanied by an inflammatory response. In brain, activation of insulin receptor signaling pathway by insulin induces current suppression and concomitant  phosphorylation of Kv1.3 channel. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of insulin injected by i.c.v. route on the neuro-pathophysiological and systemic disorders induced by KTX2.Tissue damage, inflammatory response and oxidative stress biomarkers were assessed in NMRI mice at 24 h after co-injection of KTX2 and insulin by intracerebroventricular route.Obtained results revealed that the central administration of insulin prevents cerebral cortex injury, brain edema and blood-brain  alteration induced by KTX2, these are accompanied by significant decrease of systemic disorders including serum cytokines, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and tissue damage.These results indicate that insulin is able to reduce neuro-immunological effects and systemic disorders induced by KTX2. The neuroprotective effect of insulin may be due to its crucial role in the regulation of inflammation response and its properties to modulate the activity of Kv1.3 channels in brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29289364>Imatinib Is Protective Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in an Ex Vivo Rabbit Model of Lung Injury.</a></h1><p>Ischemia-reperfusion injury is characterized by an increase in oxidative stress and leads to significant morbidity and death. The  kinase c-Abl is activated by oxidative stress and mediates processes that affect endothelial  . We hypothesized treatment with the c-Abl inhibitor imatinib would be protective against ischemia-reperfusion injury in our ex vivo rabbit model.Heart-lung blocs were harvested from rabbits and stored in cold in Perfadex (Vitrolife, Englewood, CO) for 18 hours. Blocs were reperfused for 2 hours in an ex vivo circuit with donor rabbit blood alone (untreated group, n = 7) or donor rabbit blood and 4 mg imatinib (treatment group, n = 10). Serial clinical variables measured every 15 minutes (arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension and mean pulmonary artery pressures) and biochemistry of tissue samples before and after reperfusion were assessed.Compared with untreated lungs, imatinib treatment improved physiologic parameters, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pulmonary artery pressures. Imatinib-treated lungs had less vascular  dysfunction as quantified by wet-to-dry weight ratios and bronchoalveolar lavage protein concentrations. Treated lungs showed less inflammation as measured by bronchoalveolar lavage myeloperoxidase assay, less mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and increased antioxidant catalase levels. Finally, imatinib protected lungs from DNA damage and p53 upregulation.Imatinib treatment significantly improved the physiologic performance of reperfused lungs and biochemical indicators associated with reperfusion injury in this ex vivo model.

In this study, we investigated eight patients affected with an overlapping genodermatosis after recessive inheritance. The patients presented with hypo- and hyperpigmented macules over the body, resembling dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria in addition to punctuate palmoplantar keratosis. By homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, a biallelic p.Cys120Arg mutation in ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) was identified in all patients. We found that this mutation, like those causing dominant Cole disease, impairs homodimerization of the ENPP1 enzyme that is mediated by its two somatomedin-B-like domains. Histological analysis revealed structural and molecular changes in affected skin that were likely to originate from defective melanocytes because keratinocytes do not express ENPP1. Consistently, RNA-sequencing analysis of patient-derived primary melanocytes revealed alterations in melanocyte development and in pigmentation signaling pathways. We therefore conclude that germline ENPP1 cysteine-specific mutations, primarily affecting the melanocyte lineage, cause a clinical spectrum of dyschromatosis, in which the p.Cys120Arg allele represents a recessive and more severe form of Cole disease.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of SurA renders bacteria more sensitive to toxins that compromise the integrity of the outer membrane. Inhibitors of SurA will perturb the folding of OMPs, leading to disruption of the outer membrane  and making the cell more vulnerable to toxic insults. The discovery of novel SurA inhibitors is therefore of great importance for developing alternative strategies to overcome antibiotic resistance. Our laboratory has screened over 10,000,000 compoundsin silicoby computationally docking these compounds onto the crystal structure of SurA. Through this screen and a screen of fragment compounds (molecular weight less than 250 g/mol), we found twelve commercially readily available candidate compounds that bind to the putative client binding site of SurA. We confirmed binding to SurA by developing and employing a competitive fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assay. Our results show that one of these compounds, Fmoc-β-(2-quinolyl)-d-alanine, binds the client binding site with high micromolar affinity. Using this compound as a lead, we also discovered that Fmoc-l-tryptophan and Fmoc-l-phenylalanine, but not Fmoc-, bind SurA with similar micromolar affinity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a competitive fluorescence anisotropy assay developed for the identification of inhibitors of the chaperone SurA, and the identification of three small molecules that bind SurA at its client binding site.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1àVEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2  phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC  integrity revealed that VEGF induces   disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification on the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593549>Functional Polarity of Microvascular Brain Endothelial Cells Supported by Neurovascular Unit Computational Model of Large Neutral Amino Acid Homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The homeostatic regulation of large neutral amino acid (LNAA) concentration in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) is essential for proper brain . LNAA passage into the brain is primarily mediated by the complex and dynamic interactions between various solute carrier (SLC) transporters expressed in the neurovascular unit (NVU), among which SLC7A5/LAT1 is considered to be the major contributor in microvascular brain endothelial cells (MBEC). The LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs, however, could not be characterized precisely by available  and  standard methods so far. To circumvent these limitations, we have incorporated published  data of rat brain into a robust computational model of NVU-LNAA homeostasis, allowing us to evaluate hypotheses concerning LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs across the blood brain  (BBB). We show that accounting for functional polarity of MBECs with either asymmetric LAT1 distribution between membranes and/or intrinsic LAT1 asymmetry with low intraendothelial binding affinity is required to reproduce the experimentally measured brain ISF response to intraperitoneal (IP)  and L-phenylalanine injection. On the basis of these findings, we have also investigated the effect of IP administrated  and L-phenylalanine on the dynamics of LNAAs in MBECs, astrocytes and neurons. Finally, the computational model was shown to explain the trans-stimulation of LNAA uptake across the BBB observed upon ISF perfusion with a competitive LAT1 inhibitor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173891>Role of Csk in intestinal epithelial   and protection against colitis.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the integrity and   of the intestinal epithelium. Dysfunctions of IECs are thought to participate in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial , resulting in gastrointestinal diseases, such as colitis and colorectal cancer. Here we show that IEC-specific COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-deficient mice (Csk CKO mice) manifested the increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model of inflammatory bowel disease. DSS-treated Csk CKO mice also exhibited the significantly elevated intestinal permeability. Following DSS treatment, Csk CKO mice exhibited the higher proliferative activity of colonic epithelial cells and the increased number of apoptotic cells in the colon compared with that apparent for control mice. Moreover, the abundance of the tight junction protein occludin, which regulates cell-cell adhesion as well as epithelial permeability, was markedly reduced in the colon of DSS-treated Csk CKO mice. These results thus suggest that Csk in IECs plays important roles in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial   and protection against colitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide   (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and inflammation-related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut . Early exposure accelerated the endocrine-disturbing effect and immune responses of chlorpyrifos, although these effects can be eased or recovered by a high-fat diet.

Herein, we maintained human Sertoli cells in a mitotically active state in vitro, thus enabling transfection experiments that altered gene expression to explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced cell injury. Human Sertoli cells obtained from men at ages 15, 23, 36 and 40 were cultured in vitro. These differentiated Sertoli cells remained mitotically active when cultured in the presence of 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), with a replication time of ~1-3 weeks.

PFOS was found to induce Sertoli cell injury through disruptive effects on actin microfilaments and microtubule (MT) organization across the cell cytosol. As a consequence, these cytoskeletal networks failed to support cell adhesion at the BTB.

Many components in the IL-22-pSTAT3 pathway have been identified as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and some of them are considered as promising therapeutic targets. However, new perspectives are still needed to understand IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling for effective clinical interventions in IBD patients. Here, we revealed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), recently identified to be upregulated in patients with active IBD, as a crucial player in the epithelial IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling cascade. We found ATF3 is central to intestinal homeostasis and provides protection during colitis. Loss of ATF3 led to decreased crypt numbers, more shortened colon length, impaired ileal fucosylation at the steady state, and lethal disease activity during DSS-induced colitis which can be effectively ameliorated by rectal transplantation of wild-type colonic organoids. Epithelial stem cells and Paneth cells form a niche to orchestrate epithelial regeneration and host-microbe interactions, and IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling is a key guardian for this niche. We found ATF3 is critical for niche maintenance as ATF3 deficiency caused compromised stem cell growth and regeneration, as well as Paneth cell degeneration and loss of anti-microbial peptide (AMP)-producing granules, indicative of malfunction of Paneth/stem cell network. Mechanistically, we found IL-22 upregulates ATF3, which is required to relay IL-22 signaling leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent AMP induction. Intriguingly, ATF3 itself does not act on STAT3 directly, instead ATF3 regulates pSTAT3 by negatively targeting protein  phosphatases (PTPs) including SHP2 and PTP-Meg2. Furthermore, we identified ATF3 is also involved in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in T cells and loss of ATF3 leads to reduced capacity of Th17 cells to produce their signature cytokine IL-22 and IL-17A. Collectively, our results suggest that via IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling in the  and IL-6-pSTAT3 signaling in Th17 cells, ATF3 mediates a cross-regulation in the barrier to maintain mucosal homeostasis and immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189294>L-DOPA functionalized, multi-branched gold nanoparticles as brain-targeted nano-vehicles.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is a protective endothelial  lining the brain microvasculature which prevents brain delivery of therapies against brain diseases. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop vehicles which efficiently penetrate the BBB to deliver therapies into the brain. The drug L-DOPA efficiently and specifically crosses the BBB via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT)-1 protein to enter the brain. Thus, we synthesized L-DOPA-functionalized multi-branched nanoflower-like gold nanoparticles (L-DOPA-AuNFs) using a seed-mediated method involving catechols as a direct reducing-cum-capping agent, and examined their ability to cross the BBB to act as brain-penetrating nanovehicles. We show that L-DOPA-AuNFs efficiently penetrate the BBB compared to similarly sized and shaped AuNFs functionalized with a non-targeting ligand. Furthermore, we show that L-DOPA-AuNFs are efficiently internalized by brain macrophages without inducing inflammation.

The peptide, SOCS1-KIR, is thus capable of downregulating overactive JAK/STAT or NF-kB signaling in somatic cells, including those in many compartments of the eye. Attachment of poly-arginine to this peptide (R9-SOCS1-KIR) allows it to penetrate the plasma membrane in aqueous media. R9-SOCS1-KIR was tested in ARPE-19 cells and was found to attenuate mediators of inflammation by blocking the inflammatory effects of IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-17A. R9-SOCS1-KIR and also protected against TNFα or IL-17A mediated damage to the  properties of ARPE-19 cells, as evidenced by immunostaining with the tight junction protein, zona occludin 1 (ZO-1), and measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was generated in B10. RIII mice using a peptide of interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP) as immunogen. Topical administration of R9-SOCS1-KIR, 2 days before (prophylactic), or 7 days after immunization (therapeutic) protected ocular structure and  as seen by fundoscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electroretinography (ERG). The ability R9-SOCS1-KIR to suppress ocular inflammation and preserve  properties of retinal pigment epithelium makes it a potential candidate for treatment of autoimmune uveitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides insufficient blood-brain  penetration, combinations are key to overcoming obstacles such as intratumoral heterogeneity, adaptive resistance, and the epistatic nature of tumor genomics that cause mutation-targeted therapies to fail. With now hundreds of potential drugs, exploring the combination space clinically and preclinically is daunting. We are building a simulation-based approach that integrates patient-specific data with a mechanistic computational model of pan-cancer driver pathways (receptor  kinases, RAS/RAF/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage) to prioritize drug combinations by their simulated effects on tumor cell proliferation and death. Here we illustrate a first step, tailoring the model to 14 GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas defined by an mRNA-seq transcriptome, and then simulating responses to three promiscuous FDA-approved kinase inhibitors (bosutinib, ibrutinib, and cabozantinib) with evidence for blood-brain  penetration. The model captures binding of the drug to primary targets and off-targets based on published affinity data and simulates responses of 100 heterogeneous tumor cells within a patient. Single drugs are marginally effective or even counterproductive. Common copy number alterations (PTEN loss, EGFR amplification, and NF1 loss) have a negligible correlation with single-drug or combination efficacy, reinforcing the importance of postgenetic approaches that account for kinase inhibitor promiscuity to match drugs to patients. Drug combinations tend to be either cytostatic or cytotoxic, but seldom both, highlighting the need for considering targeted and nontargeted therapy. Although we focus on GBM, the approach is generally applicable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797543>The serine/threonine protein kinase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 affects the ability of the pathogen to penetrate the blood-brain .</a></h1><p>Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic agent that causes meningitis in humans and pigs. However, the mechanism whereby SS2 crosses the microvasculature endothelium of the brain is not understood. In this study, transposon (TnYLB-1) mutagenesis was used to identify virulence factors potentially associated with invasive ability in pathogenic SS2. A poorly invasive mutant was identified and was found to contain a TnYLB-1 insertion in the serine/threonine kinase (stk) gene. Transwell chambers containing hBMECs were used to model the blood-brain  (BBB). We observed that the SS2 wild-type ZY05719 strain crossed the BBB model more readily than the mutant strain. Hence, we speculated that STK is associated with the ability of crossing blood-brain  in SS2. In vitro, compared with ZY05719, the ability of the stk-deficient strain (Δstk) to adhere to and invade both hBMECs and bEnd.3 cells, as well as to cross the BBB, was significantly attenuated. Immunocytochemistry using antibodies against claudin-5 in bEnd.3 cells showed that infection by ZY05719 disrupted BBB tight junction proteins to a greater extent than in infection by Δstk. The studies revealed that SS2 initially binds at or near intercellular junctions and crosses the BBB via paracellular traversal. Claudin-5 mRNA levels were indistinguishable in ZY05719- and Δstk-infected cells. This result indicated that the decrease of claudin-5 was maybe induced by protein degradation. Cells infected by ZY05719 exhibited higher ubiquitination levels than cells infected by Δstk. This result indicated that ubiquitination was involved in the degradation of claudin-5. Differential proteomic analysis showed that E3 ubiquitin protein ligase HECTD1 decreased by 1.5-fold in Δstk-infected bEnd.3 cells relative to ZY05719-infected cells. Together, the results suggested that STK may affect the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1 and subsequently increase the degradation of claudin-5, thus enabling SS2 to traverse the BBB.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189750>[The Involvement of Src in Airway Inflammation Induced by Repeated Exposure to Lipopolysaccharide in Mice].</a></h1><p>Corticosteroid insensitive airway inflammation is one of major  to effective managements of chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe asthma. The role of nonreceptor  kinase Src is important in airway inflammation in mice models of atopic asthma and COPD. Thus, in this study, we determined the effects of Src inhibitor, dasatinib, on airway inflammation induced by repeated intranasal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Male mice (A/J strain, 5 weeks old) were intranasally exposed to LPS twice daily for 3 d, and dasatinib was intranasally treated 2 h prior to each LPS exposure. A day after the last stimulation, lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected. Dasatinib attenuated the accumulation of inflammatory cells in lungs, and the increase in the numbers of inflammatory cells and the accumulation of cytokines/chemokines in BALF in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, this study suggested that targeting the Src can provide a new therapeutic approach for corticosteroid insensitive pulmonary diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30297172>Smartphone-based differential pulse amperometry system for real-time monitoring of levodopa with carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles modified screen-printing electrodes.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease caused by lack of dopamine in brain is a common neurodegenerative disorder. The traditional treatment is to replenish levodopa since it could pass through blood brain  and form dopamine. However, its accumulation can cause patients' movement disorders and uncontrollable emotion. Therefore, it is critical to control the levodopa dosage accuracy to improve the curative effect in clinical. In this study, a smartphone-based electrochemical detection system was developed for rapid monitoring of levodopa. The system involved a disposable sensor, a hand-held electrochemical detector, and a smartphone with designed application. Single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles modified screen-printed electrodes were used to convert and amplify the electrochemical current signals upon presence of levodopa molecules. The electrochemical detectors were used to generate electrochemical excitation signals and detect the resultant currents. Smartphone was connected to the detector, which was used to control the detector, calculate data, and plot graph in real-time. The smartphone-based differential pulse amperometry system was demonstrated to monitor levodopa at concentrations as low as 0.5 µM in human serum. Furthermore, it has also been verified to be able to distinguish levodopa from other representative substances in the body. Therefore, its performance was more sensitive and rapid than electrochemical workstation. With these advantages, the system can be used in the field of point-of-care testing (POCT) to detect levodopa and provide the possibility to solve clinical demand for levodopa detection.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Strong serial analyses of various body fluids suggest that ZIKV can be transmitted between sexual partners. Currently, there is limited information on the association of the virus with human semen cell types that may carry the virus.Analyses were carried out to localize ZIKV for subcellular localization of ZIKV on cell types. The Tyro3 receptor for ZIKV was colocalized by dual immunocytochemistry with specific monoclonal antibodies.Three semen specimens were purchased from a commercial sperm bank. Motile sperm was separated from nonmotile cells by the "swim-up" technique. Each of the semen fractions was infected with ZIKV at the multiplicity of infection of 0.1.0 and 1.0 and evaluated for the primary targets of ZIKV in the semen cells by RT-in situ PCR and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.ZIKV was present primarily at the mid-piece of mature spermatozoa in about 30% of the sperm. In addition, we determined that Tyro3 receptors, primarily expressed on mid-piece of human spermatozoa, play a role in ZIKV-binding and entry into spermatozoa. Our data strongly suggest a potential sexual/horizontal route of transmission for ZIKV primarily via infected sperms; most likely ZIKV enters the sperm via the Tyro3 receptor found at the mid-piece of the mature spermatozoa.We are uncertain as to what phase of spermatogenesis, that in human takes about 120 days, sperms are permissive to ZIKV. If permissiveness was very early during spermatogenesis males could be infectious for ∼120 days after the disappearance of viremia in an infected man.Our findings bring a new focus on the current affords to develop ZIKV vaccine. Why in the presence of anti-ZIKV antibodies infected men are still able to transmit the virus sexually? We suggest that only certain subclass of immunoglobulin (Ig)G (ie, IgG4) can cross the blood-Sertoli  therefore, a successful vaccine must provoke a subclass of IgG can quell ZIKV inside the seminiferous tubules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091437>Improvement of Cell Permeability of Human Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors Using Potent and Selective 2-Aminopyridine-Based Scaffolds with a Fluorobenzene Linker.</a></h1><p>Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a promising therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, we have achieved considerable progress in improving the potency and isoform selectivity of human nNOS inhibitors bearing a 2-aminopyridine scaffold. However, these inhibitors still suffered from too low cell membrane permeability to enter into CNS drug development. We report herein our studies to improve permeability of nNOS inhibitors as measured by both PAMPA-BBB and Caco-2 assays. The most permeable compound (12) in this study still preserves excellent potency with human nNOS (K = 30 nM) and very high selectivity over other NOS isoforms, especially human eNOS (hnNOS/heNOS = 2799, the highest hnNOS/heNOS ratio we have obtained to date).

MET causes adverse effects in male reproductive  in humans and experimental animals, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We explored the effect of MET on mice testes (5 mg/kg/day/4 days), finding that this pesticide opens the blood-testis  and perturbs spermatogenesis, generating the appearance of immature germ cells in the epididymis. In the seminiferous tubules, MET treatment changed the level of expression or modified the stage-specific localization of tight junction (TJ) proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, and claudin-3. In contrast, claudin-11 was barely altered. MET also modified the shape of claudin-11, and ZO-2 at the cell border, from a zigzag to a more linear pattern. In addition, MET diminished the expression of ZO-2 in spermatids present in seminiferous tubules, induced the phosphorylation of ZO-2 and occludin in testes and reduced the interaction between these proteins assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. MET formed covalent bonds with ZO-2 in serine,  and lysine residues. The covalent modifications formed on ZO-2 at putative phosphorylation sites might interfere with ZO-2 interaction with regulatory molecules and other TJ proteins. MET bonds formed at ZO-2 ubiquitination sites likely interfere with ZO-2 degradation and TJ sealing, based on results obtained in cultured epithelial cells transfected with ZO-2 mutated at a MET target lysine residue. Our results shed light on MET male reproductive toxicity and are important to improve regulations regarding the use of OP pesticides and to protect the health of agricultural workers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Among them, 1064 nm QS Nd:YAG laser therapy is an effective method, but the recurrence rate of laser treatment is still high. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of the high relapse rate of melasma after 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser treatment. Twenty-five female melasma patients were treated with 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser for 10 times. The lesional skin and non-lesional skin were evaluated by means of a reflectance confocal laser scanning microscope before and after laser treatment. Melanin content and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured by an MPA9 skin multifunction tester accordingly. The melanin index value was significantly decreased in the lesional skin after laser treatment, while the non-lesional skin had no difference. The dendritic cells were observed at the level of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) in the lesions of 8 patients before laser treatment, while after laser treatment, the dendritic cells were observed in all 25 subjects. Moreover, there was significant difference between the TEWL value of the lesions before and after laser treatment. Furthermore, the TEWL value was higher in lesions of the 8 subjects which had dendritic cells compared with other 17 subjects which had no dendritic cells, no matter before or after laser treatment. The relapse patients of melasma had higher TEWL value compared with the non-relapse patients. Melanocyte activation and skin  disruption may be related to the high relapse rate of melasma after laser treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30660696>Oral coadministration of elacridar and ritonavir enhances brain accumulation and oral availability of the novel ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib.</a></h1><p>Lorlatinib, a novel generation oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor with high membrane and blood-brain  permeability, recently received accelerated approval for treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its further clinical development is ongoing. We previously found that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) restricts lorlatinib brain accumulation and that the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) limits its oral availability. Using genetically modified mouse models, we investigated the impact of targeted pharmacological inhibitors on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Upon oral administration of lorlatinib, the plasma AUC in CYP3A4-humanized mice was ∼1.8-fold lower than in wild-type and Cyp3a mice. Oral coadministration of the CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir caused reversion to the AUC levels seen in wild-type and Cyp3a mice, without altering the relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib. Moreover, simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 with oral elacridar and ritonavir in CYP3A4-humanized mice profoundly increased lorlatinib brain concentrations, but not its oral availability or other relative tissue distribution. Oral lorlatinib pharmacokinetics was not significantly affected by absence of the multispecific Oatp1a/1b drug uptake transporters. The absolute oral bioavailability of lorlatinib over 8 h in wild-type, Cyp3a, and CYP3A4-humanized mice was 81.6%, 72.9%, and 58.5%, respectively. Lorlatinib thus has good oral bioavailability, which is markedly restricted by human CYP3A4 but not by mouse Cyp3a. Pharmacological inhibition of CYP3A4 reversed these effects, and simultaneous P-gp inhibition with elacridar boosted absolute brain levels of lorlatinib by 16-fold without obvious toxicity. These insights may help to optimize the clinical application of lorlatinib.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We have previously demonstrated the effect of cathepsin D (CD) on the mechanical disruption of retinal endothelial cell junctions and increased vasopermeability, as well as increased levels of CD in retinas of diabetic mice. Here, we have also examined the effect of CD on endothelial-pericyte interactions, as well as the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor on CD in endothelial-pericyte interactions in vitro and in vivo. Cocultured cells that were treated with pro-CD demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, a  kinase receptor that is required for pericyte cell survival; N-cadherin, the key adherens junction protein between endothelium and pericytes; and increases in the vessel destabilizing agent, angiopoietin-2. The effect was reversed in cells that were treated with DPP4 inhibitor along with pro-CD. With pro-CD treatment, there was a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein, PKC-α, and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in endothelial cells and pericytes, which disrupts adherens junction structure and , and this was significantly reduced with DPP4 inhibitor treatment. Increased CD levels, vasopermeability, and alteration in junctional-related proteins were observed in the retinas of diabetic rats, which were significantly changed with DPP4 inhibitor treatment. Thus, DPP4 inhibitors may be used as potential adjuvant therapeutic agents to treat increased vascular leakage observed in patients with diabetic macular edema.-Monickaraj, F., McGuire, P., Das, A.

Nephrin directly contributes to the structure of the filtration , and it also serves as a signaling scaffold in podocytes, undergoing  phosphorylation on its cytoplasmic tail to recruit intracellular effector proteins. Nephrin phosphorylation is lost in several human and experimental models of glomerular disease, and genetic studies have confirmed its importance in maintenance of the filtration . To date, however, the effect of CNS-associated NPHS1 variants on nephrin phosphorylation remains to be determined, which hampers genotype-phenotype correlations. Here, we have characterized a novel nephrin sequence variant, A419T, which is expressed along with C623F in a patient presenting with CNS. Nephrin localization is altered in kidney biopsies, and we further demonstrate reduced surface expression and ER retention of A419T and C623F in cultured cells. Moreover, we show that both mutations impair nephrin  phosphorylation, and they exert dominant negative effects on wildtype nephrin signaling. Our findings thus reveal that missense mutations in the nephrin extracellular region can impact nephrin signaling, and they uncover a potential pathomechanism to explain the spectrum of clinical severity seen with mild NPHS1 mutations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632515>Novel Insights into How Overnutrition Disrupts the Hypothalamic Actions of Leptin.</a></h1><p>Obesity has become a worldwide health problem, but we still do not understand the molecular mechanisms that contribute to overeating and low expenditure of energy. Leptin has emerged as a major regulator of energy balance through its actions in the hypothalamus. Importantly, obese people exhibit high circulating levels of leptin, yet the hypothalamus no longer responds normally to this hormone to suppress appetite or to increase energy expenditure. Several well-known hypotheses have been proposed to explain impaired central responsiveness to the effects of leptin in obesity, including defective transit across the blood-brain  at the arcuate nucleus, hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum stress, maladaptive sterile inflammation in the hypothalamus, and overexpression of molecules that may inhibit leptin signaling. We also discuss a new explanation that is based on our group's recent discovery of a signaling pathway that we named "NSAPP" after its five main protein components. The NSAPP pathway consists of an oxide transport chain that causes a transient, targeted burst in intracellular hydrogen peroxide (HO) to inactivate redox-sensitive members of the protein  phosphatase gene family. The NSAPP oxide transport chain is required for full activation of canonical leptin signaling in neurons but fails to  normally in states of overnutrition. Remarkably, leptin and insulin both require the NSAPP oxide transport chain, suggesting that a defect in this pathway could explain simultaneous resistance to the appetite-suppressing effects of both hormones in obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30399576>Preeclampsia: A close look at renal dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a unique pathophysiologic situation that physiologic interests of mother, fetus, and placenta diverge. PE is related to the increased circulating antiangiogenic factors originated from hypoxic placenta. It is simply defined by the new onset of hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (≥0.3 g/day) after 20 weeks of gestation. PE is associated with kidney dysfunction due to deficiency in podocyte specific vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Hypoxic placenta in PE patients produces increased levels of fms-like  kinase 1(sFlt-1), a soluble receptor of VEGF. sFlt-1 abrogates binding of VEGF to its receptor on endothelial cells and podocytes, and ultimately damages the filtration barrier. Glomerular endotheliosis and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) are the main features of kidney involvement in PE and can induce clotting and vessel occlusion. This complex pathophysiology is ameliorated after delivery; however, permanent kidney damages may remain and is intensified thereafter. This review aims to highlight the biochemical, genetic, and immunological-involved factors in the initiation of PE and explores the relationship between the kidney and PE. This work mainly discusses the pathologic mechanisms of kidney involvement in PE through the lens of the imbalanced VEGF-VEGF receptor signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018.

Benefit stems primarily from improved control of systemic disease, but up to 50% of patients progress to incurable brain metastases due to acquired resistance and/or limited permeability of inhibitors across the blood-brain . Neratinib, a potent irreversible pan- kinase inhibitor, prolongs disease-free survival in the extended adjuvant setting, and several trials evaluating its efficacy alone or combination with other inhibitors in early and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients are ongoing. However, its efficacy as a first-line therapy against HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis has not been fully explored, in part due to the lack of relevant pre-clinical models that faithfully recapitulate this disease. Here, we describe the development and characterisation of a novel syngeneic model of spontaneous HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis (TBCP-1) and its use to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of action of neratinib.TBCP-1 cells were derived from a spontaneous BALB/C mouse mammary tumour and characterised for hormone receptors and HER2 expression by flow cytometry, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Neratinib was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in the metastatic and neoadjuvant setting. Its mechanism of action was examined by transcriptomic profiling,  inhibition assays and immunoblotting.TBCP-1 cells naturally express high levels of HER2 but lack expression of hormone receptors. TBCP-1 tumours maintain a HER2-positive phenotype in vivo and give rise to a high incidence of spontaneous and experimental metastases in the brain and other organs. Cell proliferation/viability in vitro is inhibited by neratinib and by other HER2 inhibitors, but not by anti-oestrogens, indicating phenotypic and functional similarities to human HER2-positive breast cancer. Mechanistically, neratinib promotes a non-apoptotic form of cell death termed ferroptosis. Importantly, metastasis assays demonstrate that neratinib potently inhibits tumour growth and metastasis, including to the brain, and prolongs survival, particularly when used as a neoadjuvant therapy.The TBCP-1 model recapitulates the spontaneous spread of HER2-positive breast cancer to the brain seen in patients and provides a unique tool to identify novel therapeutics and biomarkers. Neratinib-induced ferroptosis provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Further evaluation of neratinib neoadjuvant therapy is warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342992>IL-1β promotes transendothelial migration of PBMCs by upregulation of the FN/αβ signalling pathway in immortalised human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation is often associated with pathological changes in the  of the blood-brain  (BBB) caused by disassembly of tight and adherens junctions that under physiological conditions are important for the maintenance of the BBB integrity. Consequently, in inflammation the BBB becomes dysfunctional, facilitating leukocyte traversal of the  and accumulation of immune cells within the brain. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also contributes to BBB integrity but the significance of the main ECM receptors, the β integrins also expressed on endothelial cells, is less well understood. To evaluate whether β integrin  is affected during inflammation and impacts  , we used a transformed human brain microvascular endothelial cell (THBMEC)-based Interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced inflammatory in vitro BBB model. We demonstrate that IL-1β increases cell-matrix adhesion and induces a redistribution of active β integrins to the basal surface. In particular, binding of αβ integrin to its ligand fibronectin is enhanced and αβ integrin-dependent signalling is upregulated. Additionally, localisation of the tight junction protein claudin-5 is altered. Blockade of the αβ integrin reduces the IL-1β-induced transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These data imply that IL-1β-induced inflammation not only destabilizes tight junctions but also increases αβ integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesion to fibronectin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In several cellular systems, ARF6 was shown to regulate actin dynamics in coordination with Rac1, a Rho small GTPase. We examined the  of ARF6 in the kidney podocyte because Rac1 was implicated in kidney diseases involving this cell. We found that ARF6 expression was enriched in human podocytes and that it modulated podocyte cytoskeletal dynamics through a functional interaction with nephrin, an intercellular junction protein necessary for podocyte injury-induced signaling requiring activation by  phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain. ARF6 was necessary for nephrin activation-induced ruffling and focal adhesion turnover, possibly by altering Rac1 activity. In podocyte-specific Arf6 (ARF6_PodKO) knockout mice, ARF6 deficiency did not result in a spontaneous kidney developmental phenotype or proteinuria after aging. However, ARF6_PodKO mice exhibited distinct phenotypes in two in vivo glomerular injury models. In the protamine sulfate perfusion model, which induced acute podocyte effacement, ARF6_PodKO mice were protected from podocyte effacement. In the nephrotoxic serum nephritis model, which induced immune-complex mediated injury, ARF6_PodKO mice exhibited aggravated proteinuria. Together, these observations suggest that while ARF6 is necessary for nephrin  phosphorylation-induced cytoskeletal dynamics in cultured podocytes, ARF6 has pleotropic podocyte roles in vivo, where glomerular injury-specific mechanisms might activate distinct signaling pathways that dictate whether ARF6 activity is beneficial or deleterious for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29774634>Study of hyperpigmentation in human skin disorder using different electron microscopy techniques.</a></h1><p>There is a global trend of increase in the demand for three-dimensional electron microscopy with high resolution.

We used cross-species rescue experiments in Cd2ap zebrafish and in  mutants to define the physiologic relevance of CD2AP phosphorylation of the  residues.We found that VEGF-A stimulation can induce a  phosphorylation response in CD2AP in podocytes, and that these phosphorylation events have an important effect on slit diaphragm protein localization and functionality . We demonstrated that  in position Y10 of the SH3-1 domain of CD2AP is indispensable for CD2AP  . We found that the binding affinity of nephrin to CD2AP is significantly enhanced in the absence of Y10; however, unexpectedly, this increased affinity leads not to stabilization but to functional impairment of the glomerular filtration .Our findings provide insight into CD2AP and its phosphorylation in the context of slit diaphragm functionality, and indicate a fine-tuned affinity balance of CD2AP and nephrin that is influenced by receptor  kinase stimulation.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380151>Macrophage stimulating protein preserves blood brain  integrity after intracerebral hemorrhage through recepteur d'origine nantais dependent GAB1/Src/β-catenin pathway activation in a mouse model.</a></h1><p>Blood brain  (BBB) disruption is an important contributor to brain edema and neurological deficits following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a hepatocyte growth factor-like protein that mediates its functions via activating receptor  kinase recepteur d'origine nantais (RON). Grb2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) is a docking protein that mediates downstream receptor signal transduction pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the role of MSP and RON activated signaling pathway in preserving BBB integrity after collagenase-induced ICH. ICH mice received recombinant human MSP (rhMSP) or rhMSP combined with siRNA knockdown of RON or GAB1. rhMSP was administered by intranasal route 1 h after ICH. Brain edema, neurobehavior, BBB tight junction protein expression, and BBB permeability were evaluated. The expression of endogenous MSP and p-RON was decreased after ICH. Exogenous rhMSP administration reduced brain edema, neurological deficits, BBB permeability, and increased the expression of tight junction proteins in ICH mice. rhMSP administration increased the expression of p-RON, p-GAB1, p-Src, nuclear β-catenin, and tight junction proteins after ICH. These effects were reversed with RON and GAB1 siRNA. We conclude that MSP activation of RON preserved BBB integrity via GAB-1/Src/β-catenin pathway, thereby reducing brain edema and neurological deficits after ICH in mice.© 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038942>Genetically Introducing Biochemically Reactive Amino Acids Dehydroalanine and Dehydrobutyrine in Proteins.</a></h1><p>Expansion of the genetic code with unnatural amino acids (Uaas) has significantly increased the chemical space available to proteins for exploitation. Due to the inherent limitation of translational machinery and the required compatibility with biological settings,  groups introduced via Uaas to date are restricted to chemically inert, bioorthogonal, or latent bioreactive groups. To break this , here we report a new strategy enabling the specific incorporation of biochemically reactive amino acids into proteins. A latent bioreactive amino acid is genetically encoded at a position proximal to the target natural amino acid; they react via proximity-enabled reactivity, selectively converting the latter into a reactive residue in situ. Using this Genetically Encoded Chemical COnversion (GECCO) strategy and harnessing the sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction between fluorosulfate- and serine or threonine, we site-specifically generated the reactive dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine into proteins. GECCO works both inter- and intramolecularly, and is compatible with various proteins. We further labeled the resultant dehydroalanine-containing protein with thiol-saccharide to generate glycoprotein mimetics. GECCO represents a new solution for selectively introducing biochemically reactive amino acids into proteins and is expected to open new avenues for exploiting chemistry in live systems for biological research and engineering.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29744867>P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) restricts brain accumulation and cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) limits oral availability of the novel ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib.</a></h1><p>Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a promising oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing an ALK rearrangement. With therapy-resistant brain metastases a major concern in NSCLC, lorlatinib was designed to have high membrane and blood-brain  permeability. We investigated the roles of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, and the multispecific drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A in plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of lorlatinib using genetically modified mouse strains. In vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported lorlatinib. Following oral lorlatinib administration (at 10 mg/kg), brain accumulation of lorlatinib, while relatively high in wild-type mice, was still fourfold increased in Abcb1a/1b and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 mice, but not in single Abcg2 mice. Lorlatinib plasma levels were not altered. Oral coadministration of the ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar increased the brain accumulation of lorlatinib in wild-type mice fourfold, that is, to the same level as in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 mice, without altering plasma exposure. Similar results were obtained for lorlatinib testis accumulation. In Cyp3a mice, the plasma exposure of lorlatinib was increased 1.3-fold, but was then twofold reduced upon transgenic overexpression of human CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, whereas relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib remained unaltered. Our data indicate that lorlatinib brain accumulation is substantially limited by P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 in the blood-brain , but this can be effectively reversed by elacridar coadministration. Moreover, oral availability of lorlatinib is markedly restricted by CYP3A4 activity. These insights may be used in optimizing the therapeutic application of lorlatinib.© 2018 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179148>Cerebrospinal Fluid, Brain Electrolytes Balance, and the Unsuspected Intrinsic Property of Melanin to Dissociate the Water Molecule.</a></h1><p>Regulation of composition, volume and turnover of fluids surrounding the brain and damp cells is vital. These fluids transport all substances required for cells and remove the unwanted materials. This regulation tends to act as  to prevent free exchange of materials between the brain and blood. There are specific mechanisms concerned with fluid secretion of the controlled composition of the brain, and others responsible for reabsorption eventually to blood and the extracellular fluid whatever their composition is. The current view assumes that choroidal plexuses secrete the major part of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), while the Blood-Brain  (BBB) has a much less contribution to fluid production, generating Interstitial Fluid (ISF) that drains to CSF. The skull is a rigid box; thereby the sum of volumes occupied by the parenchyma with its ISF, related connective tissue, the vasculature, the meninges and the CSF must be relatively constant according to the Monroe-Kellie dogma. This constitutes a formidable challenge that normal organisms surpass daily. The ISF and CSF provide water and solutes influx and efflux from cells to these targeted fluids in a quite precise way. Microvessels within the parenchyma are sufficiently close to every cell where diffusion areas for solutes are tiny. Despite this, CSF and ISF exhibit very similar compositions, but differ significantly from blood plasma. Many hydrophilic substances are effectively prevented from the entry into the brain via blood, while others like neurotransmitters are extremely hindered from getting out of the brain. Anatomical principle of the  and routes of fluid transfer cannot explain the extraordinary accuracy of fluids and substances needed to enter or leave the brain firmly. There is one aspect that has not been deeply analyzed, despite being prevalent in all the above processes, it is considered a part of the CSF and ISF dynamics. This aspect is the energy necessary to propel them properly in time, form, space, quantity and temporality.The recent hypothesis based on glucose and ATP as sources of energy presents numerous contradictions and controversies. The discovery of the unsuspected intrinsic ability of melanin to dissociate and reform water molecules, similar to the role of chlorophyll in plants, was confirmed in the study of ISF and CSF biology.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29017057>A p53 Super-tumor Suppressor Reveals a Tumor Suppressive p53-Ptpn14-Yap Axis in Pancreatic Cancer.</a></h1><p>The p53 transcription factor is a critical  to pancreatic cancer progression. To unravel mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression, which have remained elusive, we analyzed pancreatic cancer development in mice expressing p53 transcriptional activation domain (TAD) mutants. Surprisingly, the p53 TAD2 mutant behaves as a "super-tumor suppressor," with an enhanced capacity to both suppress pancreatic cancer and transactivate select p53 target genes, including Ptpn14. Ptpn14 encodes a negative regulator of the Yap oncoprotein and is necessary and sufficient for pancreatic cancer suppression, like p53. We show that p53 deficiency promotes Yap signaling and that PTPN14 and TP53 mutations are mutually exclusive in human cancers. These studies uncover a p53-Ptpn14-Yap pathway that is integral to p53-mediated tumor suppression.Crown Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

They play incredibly diverse and important roles ranging from radiation protection to immune defense, camouflage, and virulence. Fungi have evolved to use melanin to be able to persist in the environment and within organisms. Fungal melanins are often located within the cell well and are able to neutralize reactive oxygen species and other radicals, defend against UV radiation, bind and sequester non-specific peptides and compounds, and produce a physical  that defends the cell. For this reason, melanized fungi are often well-suited to be human pathogens-melanin allows fungi to neutralize the microbicidal oxidative bursts of our innate immune system, bind and inactivate to antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, sequester antifungal pharmaceuticals, and create a shield to block immune recognition of the fungus. Due to the importance and pervasiveness of melanin in fungal virulence, mammalian immune systems have evolved antifungal strategies that involve directly detecting and binding to fungal melanins. Such strategies include the use of melanin-specific antibody responses and C-type lectins like the newly discovered melanin-specific MelLec receptor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29766796>Biological and In silico Studies on Synthetic Analogues of  Betaine as Inhibitors of Neprilysin - A Drug Target for the Treatment of Heart Failure.</a></h1><p>Fungal secondary metabolites are important sources for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals, as exemplified by penicillin, lovastatin and cyclosporine. Searching for secondary metabolites of the fungi Metarhizium spp., we previously identified  betaine as a major constituent.Because of the structural similarity with other inhibitors of neprilysin (NEP), an enzyme explored for the treatment of heart failure, we devised the synthesis of  betaine and three analogues to be subjected to in vitro NEP inhibition assays and to molecular modeling studies.In spite of the similar binding modes with other NEP inhibitors, these compounds only displayed moderate inhibitory activities (IC50 ranging from 170.0 to 52.9 µM). However, they enclose structural features required to hinder passive blood brain  permeation (BBB). betaine remains as a starting point for the development of NEP inhibitors because of the low probability of BBB permeation and, consequently, of NEP inhibition at the Central Nervous System, which is associated to an increment in the Aβ levels and, accordingly, with a higher risk for the onset of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702562>Positive and Negative Regulation of Angiogenesis by Soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1.</a></h1><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 exists in different forms, derived from alternative splicing of the same gene. In addition to the transmembrane form, endothelial cells produce a soluble VEGFR-1 (sVEGFR-1) isoform, whereas non-endothelial cells produce both sVEGFR-1 and a different soluble molecule, known as soluble fms-like  kinase (sFlt)1-14. By binding members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, the soluble forms reduce the amounts of VEGFs available for the interaction with their transmembrane receptors, thereby negatively regulating VEGFR-mediated signaling. In agreement with this activity, high levels of circulating sVEGFR-1 or sFlt1-14 are associated with different pathological conditions involving vascular dysfunction. Moreover, sVEGFR-1 and sFlt1-14 have an additional role in angiogenesis: they are deposited in the endothelial cell and pericyte extracellular matrix, and interact with cell membrane components. Interaction of sVEGFR-1 with &alpha;5&beta;1 integrin on endothelial cell membranes regulates vessel growth, triggering a dynamic, pro-angiogenic phenotype. Interaction of sVEGFR-1/sFlt1-14 with cell membrane glycosphingolipids in lipid rafts controls kidney cell morphology and glomerular  functions. These cell⁻matrix contacts represent attractive novel targets for pharmacological intervention in addition to those addressing interactions between VEGFs and their receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325507>ROS Is Involved in Disruption of Tight Junctions of Human Nasal Epithelial Cells Induced by HRV16.</a></h1><p>Rhinoviruses (RV), which are responsible for the majority of common colds, induce mucus overproduction, increased vascular permeability, and secondary bacterial infection. These symptoms are primarily caused by   disruption, which is controlled by intercellular junctions. In this study, we investigated whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely involved in tight junction disruption of primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells induced by infection of RV .Incubation with RV resulted in disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, E-cadherin, claudin-1, and occludin) in HNE cells. Pretreatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI) decreased RV-induced disruption of tight junction in HNE cells. RV-induced generation of ROS was diminished by DPI. However, rotenone was not inhibited in HNE cells following incubation with RV. Rhinoviruses resulted in a marked decrease in protein phosphatases activity and an increase in protein  phosphorylation levels in HNE cells. Diphenylene iodonium inhibited the RV-induced inactivation of phosphatases and phosphorylation of protein . In addition, inhibition of protein  phosphatases with phenylarsine oxide resulted in a marked decrease in protein phosphatase activity and disruption of tight junction proteins in HNE cells.Our results suggest that ROS-mediated inhibition of phosphatases plays a crucial role in disruption of tight junctions in HNE cells by RV. The data suggest that RV infection may damage nasal epithelial  .NA Laryngoscope, 128:E393-E401, 2018.© 2018 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692210>Signals of the Neuropilin-1-MET Axis and Cues of Mechanical Force Exertion Converge to Elicit Inflammatory Activation in Coherent Endothelial Cells.</a></h1><p>The neuropilin-1 (NRP1)-MET signaling axis regulates the motility of individual endothelial cells (ECs). It is unknown how this signaling pathway affects the endothelial  in coherent ECs forming a tight monolayer. We hypothesized that it is involved both in modulation of the endothelial  and in EC activation. To investigate the role of NRP1-MET signaling in inflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] or snakebite-induced SIRS-like conditions), we employed the C-type lectin-related protein rhodocetin-αβ (RCαβ) as a specific trigger of this signal axis in ECs in vitro. In coherent HUVECs, RCαβ reinforced the actin cytoskeleton and increased cell stiffness, thus favoring vascular endothelial cadherin-mediated transmission of intercellular forces. Increased cell stiffness was associated with enhanced activation of RhoA and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Simultaneously, RCαβ-triggered signaling via the NRP1-MET axis increased EC monolayer permeability, induced transcription of proinflammatory genes such as ICAM-1 and, consequently, leukocyte tethering. The RCαβ-induced transcriptome differed from that induced by hepatocyte growth factor, although in both cases the same  kinase, MET, was involved. This was due to RCαβ-mediated recruitment of the MET coreceptor NRP1 and additional Rho-mediated activation of the actomyosin system. RCαβ induced similar transcriptional and cellular changes if external shear forces were applied. These data highlight the modulatory role of NRP1 as MET coreceptor, and they explain how some snake venoms induce SIRS-like conditions. Additionally, this study demonstrates that inflammatory activation of coherent ECs is triggered by converging signals that are induced by NRP1-MET signaling and influenced by intercellular forces.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p></html>
