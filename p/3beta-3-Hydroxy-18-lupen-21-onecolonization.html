We evaluated the effect of the maternal diet during pregnancy and during the first month of lactation on the human milk microbiota in a cross-sectional study including 94 healthy lactating women. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rDNA profiling and nutrient intake assessed through food questionnaires. Thirteen genera were present in at least 90% of all samples, with three genera present in all samples: , , and . Cluster analysis indicated two distinct compositions: one marked by a high abundance of  (cluster 1), and other by a high abundance of  (cluster 2). A global association with milk microbiota diversity was observed for vitamin C intake during pregnancy ( = 0.029), which was higher for cluster 2 individuals (cluster 2 median = 232 mg/d; cluster 1 = 175 mg/d;  = 0.02). Positive correlations were found between  in the milk and intake of polyunsaturated and linoleic fatty acids during the lactation period ( < 0.01). We show that maternal diet influences the human milk microbiota, especially during pregnancy, which may contribute in shaping the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675630>Metabolites in the root exudates of groundnut change during interaction with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in a strain-specific manner.</a></h1><p>Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are extensively used as biofertilizers to improve the soil nutrition for a variety of crop plants. The plant-PGPR interaction, with special reference to chemical signalling molecules is not understood clearly, unlike other beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Chemo-attraction of a PGPR from soil microbial pool towards a plant could be dependent on some of the molecules in the plant root exudates (REs), similar to the beneficial association of legume-rhizobia. In this study, a few functional properties of PGPR like growth, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation by two PGPR strains viz., Bacillus sonorensis RS4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa RP2 were assessed in the presence of groundnut REs. Functional properties of both the strains were significantly influenced by the REs in a strain-dependent manner. Metabolite profiling of the REs from PGPR-bacterized (RS4 or RP2) and non-bacterized seedlings was performed with GC-MS/MS after 12 and 24 days of growth. A total of 75 metabolites were detected in groundnut REs. Threonine and glyoxylic oxime acid were detected in RP2-bacterized REs, while serine, pentanoic acid, glucopyranoside, tartaric acid, and 2-pyrrolidinone were detected in REs of seedlings bacterized with RP2 and RS4. The results suggested that the PGPR induced distinct variations in the REs. Identification of the interaction-specific metabolites will be useful to develop effective PGPR based bio-formulations for better PGPR  and improving crop yields.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Combinatorial inactivation of these integrins on prostate cancer cells was assessed. Monospecific antibodies to α5β1 and αv integrins alone (MAbs) and in combination (cMAbs), and a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets α5β1and αv integrins (BsAbα5β1/αv) were compared in assays of chemotaxis, clonogenic survival and induction of endothelial migration. Cellular expression of integrins, their transcription, translation and degradation fate was compared. The BsAbα5β1/αv was superior to MAbs and cMAbs in abrogating adhesion, migration, clonogenic survival and induction of endothelial migration responses by prostate cancer cells. Integrin upregulation observed with MAbs or cMAbs was abrogated with the BsAbα5β1/αv. Loss of integrin expression was uniquely induced by the BsAbα5β1/αv and blocked by lysosomal inhibition. Implications: A novel and effective combinatorial strategy to target α5β1 and αv integrins is defined for translational studies.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646012>Evolving concepts in bone infection: redefining "biofilm", "acute vs. chronic osteomyelitis", "the immune proteome" and "local antibiotic therapy".</a></h1><p>Osteomyelitis is a devastating disease caused by microbial infection of bone. While the frequency of infection following elective orthopedic surgery is low, rates of reinfection are disturbingly high.  is responsible for the majority of chronic osteomyelitis cases and is often considered to be incurable due to bacterial persistence deep within bone. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on clinical classifications of osteomyelitis and the ensuing treatment algorithm. Given the high patient morbidity, mortality, and economic burden caused by osteomyelitis, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of bone infection to inform novel strategies for prevention and curative treatment. Recent discoveries in this field have identified three distinct reservoirs of bacterial biofilm including:  abscess communities in the local soft tissue and bone marrow, glycocalyx formation on implant hardware and necrotic tissue, and  of the osteocyte-lacuno canalicular network (OLCN) of cortical bone. In contrast,  intracellular persistence in bone cells has not been substantiated in vivo, which challenges this mode of chronic osteomyelitis. There have also been major advances in our understanding of the immune proteome against , from clinical studies of serum antibodies and media enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA), which may provide new opportunities for osteomyelitis diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccine development. Finally, novel therapies such as antimicrobial implant coatings and antibiotic impregnated 3D-printed scaffolds represent promising strategies for preventing and managing this devastating disease. Here, we review these recent advances and highlight translational opportunities towards a cure.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693613>Demonstration of 99mTc-MDP Uptake in a Mobile Urinary Bladder Calculus on SPECT/CT.</a></h1><p>We report a large mobile bladder calculus with intense Tc-MDP uptake demonstrated on both whole-body bone scintigraphy and SPECT/CT images in a patient with complicated chronic history of urolithiasis and urinary tract infection.

Although many studies have addressed this question in single species at a regional scale, only a few have attempted to decipher this enigma in groups of closely related species at a broad intercontinental geographical scale. Here, we consider ca. 20 species of a diploid-polyploid complex (Veronica subsect. Pentasepalae) of recent and rapid diversification represented in Europe and North Africa to study the frequency and distribution of cytotypes and its relationship with environmental variables.A total of 680 individuals (207 populations) were sampled. Ploidy levels were determined using flow cytometry. Ecological differentiation among cytotypes was tested using climatic and environmental variables related to temperature, precipitation, vegetation and biogeographical region, among others, and by performing univariate and multivariate (constrained PCoA) analyses.Four ploidy levels (2x, 4x, 6x, 8x) were found and genome downsizing was observed to occur within the group. Plants of different ploidy level are ecologically differentiated, with hexaploids and octoploids occurring in wetter and colder habitats with a higher seasonality than diploids. A south-to-north distribution pattern was found, with diploids occupying southern refugial areas and octoploids being more frequent in northern regions of Europe above the permafrost boundary.The distribution of cytotypes can be explained by ecological differentiation, the geographical position of refuge areas during the Quaternary climatic oscillations, as well as by ice and permafrost retreat patterns. The Balkan Peninsula constitutes the most important contact zone between cytotypes. This work provides the first comprehensive ploidy screening within V. subsect. Pentasepalae at a broad scale and indicates that polyploidy and genome downsizing might have contributed to the  of new habitats in a recently diverged polyploid complex.© The Author(s) 2019.

Overall, median age was 64 years and 252 (72%) were women. Multivariate model identified prior urinary infections or  with SXT-R Enterobacteriaceae (odds ratio [OR] 8.58, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 3.92-18.81, p < 0.001) and SXT use within past 12 months (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.13-5.89, p = 0.02) as predictors of SXT resistance among urinary isolates. Most patients with UTIs (285; 81%) had no risk factors for SXT resistance. SXT resistance rates increased from 13% in the absence of risk factors to 31% in patients with prior SXT use, 66% in those with prior urinary infections or  with SXT-R Enterobacteriaceae, and 73% in the presence of both risk factors.SXT resistance in Enterobacteriaceae urinary isolates may be predicted based on prior urine culture results and SXT use within the previous year. Utilization of patient-specific antibiogram may allow empirical SXT use in patients with community-onset UTIs in the absence of risk factors for resistance.Copyright © 2019.

This indicates that pine trees could be accessing a hidden nitrogen source to fulfill their nitrogen requirements-possibly via endophytic nitrogen-fixation. Endophytic bacteria originally isolated from native pine trees growing at gravel sites were selected (n = 14) for in vitro nitrogen-fixation assays and a yearlong greenhouse study to test the overall hypothesis that naturally-occurring endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria sustain pine tree growth under nitrogen-limited conditions. Each of the 14 bacteria colonized the internal tissues of pine trees in the greenhouse study and fixed significant amounts of nitrogen from atmosphere (23-53%) after one year as estimated through 15N isotope dilution assay. Bacterial inoculation also significantly enhanced the length (31-64%) and biomass (100-311%) of pine seedlings as compared to the non-inoculated control treatment. In addition, presence of the nifH gene was confirmed in all 14 bacteria. Our results support the possibility that pine trees associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, capable of endophytic , to survive at unreclaimed gravel mining pits and this association could potentially be utilized for effective reclamation of highly disturbed sites in a sustainable manner.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665178>Correction: Effect of early measles vaccine on pneumococcal : A randomized trial from Guinea-Bissau.</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177547.].</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681201>The Expression of Virulence Factors in  Is Dually Regulated by Iron Levels and Temperature.</a></h1><p> causes a hemorrhagic septicemia that affects cold- and warm-water adapted fish species. The main goal of this work was to determine the temperature-dependent changes in the virulence factors that could explain the virulence properties of  for fish cultivated at different temperatures. We have found that although the optimal growth temperature is around 25°C, the degree of virulence of  RV22 is higher at 15°C. To explain this result, an RNA-Seq analysis was performed to compare the whole transcriptome profile of  RV22 cultured under low-iron availability at either 25 or 15°C, which would mimic the conditions that  finds during  of fish cultivated at warm- or cold-water temperatures. The comparative analysis of transcriptomes at high- and low-iron conditions showed profound metabolic adaptations to grow under low iron. These changes were characterized by a down-regulation of the energetic metabolism and the induction of virulence-related factors like biosynthesis of LPS, production of hemolysins and lysozyme, membrane transport, heme uptake, or production of siderophores. However, the expression pattern of virulence factors under iron limitation showed interesting differences at warm and cold temperatures. Chemotaxis, motility, as well as the T6SS1 genes are expressed at higher levels at 25°C than at 15°C. By contrast, hemolysin RTX pore-forming toxin, T6SS2, and the genes associated with exopolysaccharides synthesis were preferentially expressed at 15°C. Notably, at this temperature, the siderophore piscibactin system was strongly up-regulated. In contrast, at 25°C, piscibactin genes were down-regulated and the vanchrobactin siderophore system seems to supply all the necessary iron to the cell. The results showed that  adjusts the expression of virulence factors responding to two environmental signals, iron levels and temperature. Thus, the relative relevance of each virulence factor for each fish species could vary depending on the water temperature. The results give clues about the physiological adaptations that allow  to cause infections in different fishes and could be relevant for vaccine development against fish vibriosis.Copyright © 2019 Lages, Balado and Lemos.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669781>Scophthalmus maximus interleukin-1β limits Edwardsiella piscicida  in vivo.</a></h1><p>Interleukine-1β (IL-1β) is the first identified pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is cleaved by caspase-1 following the inflammasomes activation, playing critical roles in innate immunity. However, few studies have been performed to characterize the IL-1β in lower vertebrates. Herein, we distinguished the Scophthalmus maximus IL-1β (SmIL-1β) from three IL-1β like sequences and found that SmIL-1β was cleaved by S. maximus caspase at a non-conserved Asp, then targeted to the plasma membrane. Moreover, during the immersion infection of Edwardsiella piscicida, we found that E. piscicida were mainly colonized in gills at early time points and invaded to systemic sites after 5 days post infection, which was consistent with the dynamic up-regulated transcription of SmIL-1β. Furthermore, knockdown of SmIL-1β promotes the bacterial  in gills at early time points and result into systemic , while overexpression of SmIL-1β hampers the bacterial  in both spleen and kidney. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of SmIL-1β and reveal its role in limiting bacterial infection in vivo, which will support the idea for better understanding the evolutionary of IL-1β functions in teleost.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Data analyzed included age, gender, cystic fibrosis genotype, meconium ileus at birth, hydration status, pulmonary exacerbation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , pancreatic insufficiency (PI), body mass index (BMI) at the episodes, clinical manifestations of DIOS, imaging studies performed, acute management of DIOS, maintenance therapy, and recurrence on follow-up.All patients had two positive sweat chloride tests, and nine of ten also had genotype study. The most common genotype identified was homozygosis for the delta F508 mutation. In seven cases, a previous history of meconium ileus was reported. All patients had pancreatic insufficiency. Diagnosis of DIOS was based on clinical and imaging findings. Of the total number of episodes, 85% were successfully managed with oral osmotic laxatives and/or rectal therapy (glycerin enema or saline irrigation). Recurrence was observed in five of ten patients.In this first report of pediatric DIOS in South America, the presence of two risk factors for DIOS occurrence was universal: pancreatic insufficiency and severe genotype. Medical history of meconium ileus at birth was present in most patients, as well as in the subgroup with DIOS recurrence.

Despite this, the pertinent mechanisms underlying  O157:H7  and internalization remain poorly documented. Herein we aimed to elucidate these mechanisms in cucumbers using an inverted fluorescence microscope and hyperspectral microscopy. We observed that  O157:H7 primarily colonized around the stomata on cucumber epidermis without invading the internal tissues of intact cucumbers. Once the bacterial cells had infiltrated into the internal tissues, they colonized the cucumber placenta and vascular bundles (xylem vessels, in particular), and also migrated along the xylem vessels. Moreover, the movement rate of  O157:H7 from the stalk to the flower bud was faster than that from the flower bud to the stalk. We then used hyperspectral microscope imaging to categorize the infiltrated and uninfiltrated areas with high accuracy using the spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification method, which confirmed the results obtained upon using the inverted fluorescence microscope. We believe that our results are pivotal for developing science-based food safety practices, interventions for controlling  O157:H7 internalization, and new methods for detecting  O157:H7-plant interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641232>Amphiphilic Triazine Polymer Derivatives as Antibacterial And Anti-atopic Agents in Mice Model.</a></h1><p>Considering the emergence of bacterial resistance and low proteolytic stability of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), herein we developed a series of ultra-short triazine based amphipathic polymers (TZP) that are connected with ethylene diamine linkers instead of protease sensitive amide bond.

Bacitracin is used widely as a growth promoter in animal feed and to control the spread of necrotic enteritis in most developing countries. This study aimed to characterize a novel membrane transporter module Sst comprising SstE, SstF, and SstG for bacitracin resistance.Comparative genomics and protein homology analysis found a potential efflux pump SstFEG encoded upstream of well-known bacitracin-resistance genes bceAB and bceRS. A four-fold decrease in bacitracin susceptibility was observed in sstFEG deletion mutant comparing with S. suis wildtype strain CZ130302. Further studies indicated that the bacitracin tolerance mediated by SstFEG is not only independent of the BceAB transporter, but also regulated by the two-component system BceSR.

Here in this study, we analyzed the production of the medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lingzhi and the associated soil microbial communities and soil chemical features over 24 months from April 2015 to April 2017. This Basidiomycete mushroom, known as Lingzhi in China, is commonly found on dead trees and wood logs in temperate and subtropical forests. Its economic and medicinal importance have propelled the development of a diversity of cultivation methods. The dominant method uses wood logs as the main substrate, which after  by Lingzhi mycelia, are buried in the soil to induce fruiting. The soil microbial communities over the 24 months were analyzed using the Illumina HiSeq platform targeting a portion of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). Overall, a significant reduction of Lingzhi yield was observed over our experimentation period. Interestingly, temporal changes in soil microbial compositions were detected during the 24 months, with the fungal community showing more changes than that of bacteria in terms of both species richness and the relative abundance of several dominant species after each fruiting. The soil chemical features also showed significant changes, with decreasing soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and increasing soil pH and iron content after each fruiting.

Pertussis Toxin (PTX) is a virulence factor found in , a human respiratory pathogen that causes whooping cough. PTX promotes  and disease promotion by triggering a heightened inflammatory response. The role of AhR in the regulation of PTX-mediated inflammation has not previously been studied. In the current study, we investigate if AhR activation by 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a well characterized ligand, can attenuate PTX-mediated systemic inflammation. To that end, C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with PTX twice and treated with TCDD or vehicle (VEH). The PTX+VEH group showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-6, and IFNγ) in serum and increased proportions of CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells in their spleens. In contrast, the PTX+TCDD group showed significantly lower levels of these inflammatory cytokines and decreased proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells, but increased proportions of Th2 and FoxP3+Tregs when compared to the PTX+VEH group. PTX+TCDD treated mice also showed elevated levels of IL-10, and TFG-b, potent anti-inflammatory cytokines. MicroRNAs (miRs) analysis of CD4+ T cells from the spleens of the PTX+TCDD treated mice revealed significant alterations in their expression and several of these miRs targeted cytokines and signaling molecules involved in inflammation. Specifically, the PTX+TCDD group had a significantly enhanced expression of miR-3082-5p that targeted IL-17, and a decreased expression of miR-1224-5p, which targeted FoxP3. Transfection studies with these miR mimics and inhibitors confirmed the specificity of the target genes. The current study suggests that AhR activation by TCDD suppresses PTX-induced inflammation through miR regulation that triggers reciprocal polarization of Tregs and Th17 cells and also suggests that AhR activation may serve as a treatment modality to suppress heightened inflammation induced during  infection.Copyright © 2019 Al-Ghezi, Singh, Mehrpouya-Bahrami, Busbee, Nagarkatti and Nagarkatti.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659938>Addressing multidrug resistant pathogens in pediatric palliative care patients-the nurses point of view: A qualitative study.</a></h1><p>Multidrug resistant pathogens are a large-scale healthcare issue.

Interviews were analyzed qualitatively by means of content analysis.The following four categories were identified: (1) safety, (2) effort, (3) quality of care, and (4) participation. All categories demonstrated ambivalence by nursing staff regarding PALLINI. Ambivalence arose from guaranteeing infection control versus noncompliance by the families, additional workload for patients with multidrug resistant pathogens versus lack of resources, impaired relationship with the parents versus enabling better care for the child, as well as enabling some limited contact versus the larger goal of genuine social participation. Despite this, nurses reported the importance of arranging everyday-life for the patients so that they experience as much social participation as possible.The implementation of a new hygiene concept is challenging. Despite positive reception of PALLINI from the nurses, ambivalence remained. Addressing these ambivalences may be critical to best implement the new hygiene concept.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666702>Immunity to commensal papillomaviruses protects against skin cancer.</a></h1><p>Immunosuppression increases the risk of cancers that are associated with viral infection. In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell immunity against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this immunity-rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural immunity against MmuPV1 after  and acquired immunity through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin. Our findings reveal a beneficial role for commensal viruses and establish a foundation for immune-based approaches that could block the development of skin cancer by boosting immunity against the commensal HPVs present in all of our skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671281>Combined effects of Rhizo-competitive Rhizosphere and Non-rhizosphere Bacillus in Plant Growth Promotion and Yield Improvement of Eleusine coracana (Ragi).</a></h1><p>This study emphasizes on the beneficial role of rhizo-competitive Bacillus spp. isolated from rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soil in plant growth promotion and yield improvement via nitrogen fixation and biocontrol of Sclerotium rolfsii causing foot rot disease in Eleusine coracana (Ragi). The selection of potent rhizobacteria was based on plant growth-promoting attributes using Venn Set Diagram (VSD) and Bonitur Scale (BS). Bacillus pumilus MSTA8 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MSTD26 were obtained as persuasive in root , rhizosphere competence and biofilm formation using root exudates of E. coracana L. rich with carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids. The relative chemotaxis index (RCI) of the isolates understood invasive behavior to the rhizosphere. During pot and field trials, the consortia of rhizobacteria in a vermiculite carrier increased the grain yield by 37.87% with a significant Harvest Index (HI) 16.45. Soil analysis of the post-field trial revealed the soil reclamation potentials so as to manage soil nutrition and fertility.

Preventing infections is becoming increasingly important, as frontline antibiotics become less effective and frequently induce recurrence by disrupting intestinal microbiota. The clinically most advanced vaccine approaches prevent symptoms once C. difficile infection is established by inducing immunity to secreted clostridial cytotoxins. However, they do not inhibit bacterial  and thereby favor asymptomatic carriage. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the C. difficile surface glycans PS-I, PS-II, and PS-III are immunogenic and serve as basis for -preventing vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that glycoconjugate vaccine candidates based on synthetic oligosaccharides protected mice from infections with two different C. difficile strains. Four synthetic antigens, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were conjugated to CRM197, a carrier protein used in commercial vaccines. The vaccine candidates induced glycan-specific antibodies in mice and substantially limited C. difficile  and colitis after experimental infection. The glycoconjugates ameliorated intestinal pathology more substantially than a toxin-targeting vaccine.  of the gut by C. difficile was selectively inhibited while intestinal microbiota remained preserved. Passive transfer experiments with anti-PS-I serum revealed that protection is mediated by specific anti-glycan antibodies, however, cell-mediated immunity likely also contributed to protection in vivo. Thus, glycoconjugate vaccines against C. difficile are a complementary approach to toxin-targeting strategies and are advancing through preclinical work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698033>Urban living predicts behavioural response in a Neotropical raptor.</a></h1><p>Behaviour is expected to be one of the most important factors driving urban living of bird species because it largely determines how animals interact with their environments. The contribution of different behavioural traits as facilitators of contemporary process of bird  of urban environments, however, is still unclear. Here we examined the differences in three behavioural traits: neophobia (avoidance of a new object) and solving success and solving latency of a problem solving test related to obtain food, in rural and urban living individuals of a common diurnal Neotropical raptor, the chimango caracara (Phalcoboenus chimango). Moreover, for solving success and solving latency behaviours, we tested the plasticity (i.e., habituation) in birds. Urban and rural chimangos showed similar neophobia of a new object. All chimangos showed an improvement in their output in problem-solving test as the five-day testing passed but urban chimangos showed higher solving capabilities than rural conspecifics as they were more successful in solving the problem test. More, urban birds shown lower solving latency than rural, as they were able to improve their test performance by opening doors in less time as the day passed; in rural birds this relation was not so abrupt. In addition, those individuals that opened more doors, opened these faster too. Lastly, both solving success and latency showed very low individual consistency (repeatability < 0.275). Our results provide evidence of plasticity in solving capabilities of chimango caracaras which reveal that a habituation process in these behavioural traits could be associated to establishment of birds in urban environments.Copyright © 2019.

Since then, a  process has been carried out, with captures of specimens in 24.30% of the surface of the whole Mallorca Island. For the first time, information has been provided on the invasive process of P. lotor in an insular ecosystem. 257 specimens of P. lotor were captured during the period 2007-2018, of them 104 were analysed to estimate population parameters. Demographic data showed that the population had a sex ratio of 1.00:1.21 (males:females), high BMI values and up to 40% of females were lactating when captured. Related to diet data, the composition was mainly the same as previous studies around its natural and introduced distribution area. Plant residues represented the 53.25 ± 38.66% followed by invertebrates with 12.22 ± 22.54%, inorganic remains with 11.9 ± 22.07% and finally the vertebrates with 4.94 ± 18.27%. Thus, it is shown how an opportunistic omnivorous species has adapted to the resources provided by the island. Cultivated plants' remains and plastic content in diet evidence that P. lotor is entering in contact with human settlements and agricultural areas. As occurred in other islands where P. lotor was introduced, it is expected that it could become a future problem for the conservation biodiversity in insular ecosystems, as well as for agriculture and human activity. Due to the potential impact on native biodiversity it is necessary to reinforce the implementation of control actions and prevent its expansion to the rest of the island.Copyright © 2019.

With limited antibiotic treatment options, there is an urgent need for development of a safe and effective vaccine against gonorrhea. Previously, we constructed a prototype vaccine candidate comprising a peptide mimic (mimitope) of a glycan epitope on gonococcal lipooligosaccharide (LOS), recognized by monoclonal antibody 2C7. The 2C7 epitope is (i) broadly expressed as a gonococcal antigenic target in human infection, (ii) a critical requirement for gonococcal  in the experimental setting, and (iii) a virulence determinant that is maintained and expressed by gonococci. Here, we have synthesized to >95% purity through a relatively facile and economical process a tetrapeptide derivative of the mimitope that was cyclized through a nonreducible thioether bond, thereby rendering the compound homogeneous and stable. This vaccine candidate, called TMCP2, when administered at 0, 3, and 6 weeks to BALB/c mice at either 50, 100 or 200 μg/dose in combination with glucopyranosyl lipid A-stable oil-in-water nanoemulsion (GLA-SE; a Toll-like receptor 4 and T1-promoting adjuvant), elicited bactericidal IgG and reduced  levels of gonococci in experimentally infected mice while accelerating clearance by each of two different gonococcal strains. Similarly, a 3-dose biweekly schedule (50 μg TMCP2/dose) was also effective in mice.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the microbiome. The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance. This chapter covers the current "omics"-derived knowledge on the microbiome, the host and their "interactome" with regard to periodontal diseases, and addresses challenges and opportunities ahead.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of  of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal  model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice.

We recorded hand hygiene adherence, glove use, activities, and time in room. HCP hands were cultured before and after patient care; patients and high-touch surfaces were cultured. HCP activities were categorized as high-versus low-risk for self-contamination. Multivariable regression was performed to identify predictors of hand hygiene adherence.We recorded 385 HCP observations and paired them with cultures performed before and after patient care. Hand hygiene adherence occurred in 96 of 352 observations (27.3%) before patient care and 165 of 358 observations (46.1%) after patient care. Gloves were worn in 169 of 376 observations (44.9%).

In total, vaccine serotypes accounted for 6.4% (n=8): 19F (n=2), 1 (n=2) and one strain for each of the following serotypes: 14, 23F, 6B, and 9V. Non-vaccine and nontypeable strains presented 63.2% and 23.2%, respectively, with dominance of serotypes 6A (6.4%), 15A/15F (5.6%), 20, 22F/22A, 23B, and 11A/11D with a prevalence of 3.2%. The rate of pneumococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin was 33.6%, of which 90.2% were non-vaccine serotypes and nontypeable strains. Serotype diversity increased in the postvaccination period and the effectiveness of PCV-10 against vaccine serotypes was estimated at 89.6%.An important change in the distribution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes was observed after the introduction of the PCVs. In fact, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes decreased significantly while non-vaccine serotypes emerged.

Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal microbiome, there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal microbiome and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida . In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida . 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida . In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The microbiome, race and Candida  co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic acid and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida  more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic acid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and 2 from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment.

We used ISR-positive and -negative mutants of both maize (Zea mays) and the beneficial fungus Trichoderma virens and identified 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) and α-ketol of octadecadienoic acid (KODA) as important ISR signals. We show that a 13-lipoxygenase mutant, lox10, colonized by wild type T. virens (TvWT) lacked ISR response against Colletotrichum graminicola, but instead displayed induced systemic susceptibility (ISS). Oxylipin profiling of xylem sap derived from combinations of T. virens-treated plants revealed that 12-OPDA and KODA levels correlated with ISR. Transfusing sap supplemented with 12-OPDA or KODA increased receiver plant resistance in a dose-dependent manner, with 12-OPDA being capable of restoring ISR of both TvWT-treated lox10 or T. virens Δsm1 strain, a mutant unable to induce ISR. Unexpectedly, JA was not involved, as the JA-deficient opr7opr8 mutant retained the capacity for T. virens-induced ISR. Transcriptome analysis of TvWT-treated B73 revealed upregulation of 12-OPDA biosynthesis and OPDA-responsive genes, but downregulation of subsequent JA biosynthesis and JA response genes.

Although Candida  is one of the risk factors for development of invasive candidiasis in recipients of HCT [1], its effect on the outcomes after CBT are lacking. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated whether Candida  is associated with the clinical outcomes after CBT for adult patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial  and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in . This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin  and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Among various factors, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway has been documented being able to target genes associated with tumor progression and up-regulate the expression of tumor-promoting cytokines and survival genes in several human solid tumors. Feline injection sites sarcomas (FISS) are malignant entities derived from the mesenchymal origin. The disease has been considered to be associated with vaccine adjuvant, aluminum, which serves as a stimulus continuously inducing overzealous inflammatory and immunologic reactions. To understand the contribution of NF-κB in FISS, detection of activated NF-κB in paraffin-embedded specimens, in vitro establishment of primary cells derived from FISS, and evaluation of the effects of the NF-κB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on primary tumor cells were conducted.In this study, nuclear expression of NF-κB p65 was detected in 83.3% of FISS cases and not correlated with tumor grading, sex, and age. Primary cells derived from FISS in three cats exhibiting same immunohistochemical characteristics as their original tumor were successfully established. The NF-κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, was able to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and  in dosage-dependent manners, and induce cell apoptosis in these primary FISS cells.High expression rate of nuclear NF-κB p65 in FISS cases and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the growth of FISS primary cells treated with NF-κB inhibitor suggested that NF-κB might be a potential molecular therapeutic target for FISS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669369>Type III effectors xopN and avrBS2 contribute to the virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola strain GX01.</a></h1><p>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) depends on its type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate type III secreted effectors (T3SEs), including transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and non-transcription activator-like effectors (non-TALEs), into host cells. T3SEs can promote the  of Xoc and contribute to virulence by manipulating host cell physiology. We annotated 25 genes encoding non-TALEs in Xoc strain GX01, an isolate from Guangxi in the South China's rice growing region. Through systematic mutagenesis of non-TALEs, we found that xopN, the virulence contribution of which was previously unknown for Xoc, significantly contributes to the virulence of Xoc GX01, as does avrBs2.Copyright © 2019 Institut Pasteur.

The predominant causative agents are uropathogenic Escherichia coli. These strains differ from commensal E. coli by the presence of additional horizontally acquired chromosomal material, so-called pathogenicity islands, which encode traits that promote efficient bacterial  of the urinary tract. Uropathogenic model strain E. coli 536 possesses six archetypal pathogenicity islands. Bacteriophage-like integrases encoded by each pathogenicity island contribute to island instability. To learn more about the stability of these six islands and factors controlling their stability we constructed two chromosomal reporter systems for the measurement of island loss, as well as for the measurement of the promoter activity of the six island-associated integrase genes at the population level. We used these reporter gene modules to analyze the role of SOS response in island instability. Tests with subinhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics, including many drugs commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infection, indicated that only SOS response-inducing antibiotics led to an increased loss of islands which was always associated with an increase in the bacterial subpopulations showing high integrase promoter activity. This suggests that island excision correlates with the expression of the cognate integrase. Our reporter modules are valuable tools to investigate the impact of various growth conditions on genome plasticity. Furthermore, a better understanding of the conditions, which affect bacterial integrase expression may open ways to specifically manipulate the genome content of bacterial pathogens by increasing pathogenicity island deletion rates in infecting or colonizing bacteria, thus leading to the attenuation of bacterial pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Studying cross-population differences has been stymied by the confounding effects of demographic history. To address this problem, we developed a demography-aware method to infer fine-scale recombination rates and applied it to 26 diverse human populations, inferring population-specific recombination maps. These maps recapitulate many aspects of the history of these populations including signatures of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Iberian  of the Americas. We also investigated modulators of the local recombination rate, finding further evidence that Polycomb group proteins and the trimethylation of H3K27 elevate recombination rates. Further differences in the recombination landscape across the genome and between populations are driven by variation in the gene that encodes the DNA binding protein PRDM9, and we quantify the weak effect of meiotic drive acting to remove its binding sites.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This study focused on the its effectiveness of ozone nano-bubble water (ONBW) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. Oral mucositis was induced in 14-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 21). The animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: 7 without treatment (control); 7 treated with physiological salt solution (saline); and 7 treated with ONBW. Animals were weighed on Days 7, 9, 11, and 16. Stomatitis grade evaluation and bacterial count measurements were performed before rinsing in all animals 3, 5, and 10 days after acetic acid irritation (Days 9, 11, and 17 respectively). Weight loss after stomatitis creation was observed in all groups, with significant differences between the control and ONBW groups and between the saline and ONBW groups on Day 16. The stomatitis grade did not worsen during the experimental period in any group, with the lowest grades in the ONBW group on Days 11 and 16. Significant differences were identified between the control and ONBW groups and between the saline and ONBW groups on Days 11 and 16. Oral bacterial counts tended to decrease over time in all three groups, with the greatest decrease in the ONBW group, followed by the saline group. The decrease in the bacterial count was steepest in the ONBW group. Rinsing out the oral cavity with ONBW decreased bacterial counts and encouraged the healing of oral chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. ONBW may be an effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced stomatitis.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690754>Demonstration of facilitation between microalgae to face environmental stress.</a></h1><p>Positive interactions such as facilitation play an important role during the biological  and species succession in harsh or changing environments. However, the direct evidence of such ecological interaction in microbial communities remains rare. Using common freshwater microalgae isolated from a High Rate Algal Pond HRAP treating wastewaters, we investigated with both experimental and modeling approaches the direct facilitation between two algal strains during the  phase. Our results demonstrate that the first  by microalgae under a severe chemical condition arose from the rapid growth of pioneer species such as Chlorella sorokiniana, which facilitated the subsequent  of low growth specialists such as Scenedesmus pectinatus. The pioneer species rapidly depleted the total available ammonia nitrogen favoring the specialist species initially inhibited by free ammonia toxicity. This latter species ultimately dominated the algal community through competitive exclusion under low nutrient conditions. We show that microbial successions are not only regulated by climatic conditions but also by interactions between species based on the ability to modify their growth conditions. We suggest that facilitation within the aquatic microbial communities is a widespread ecological interaction under a vast range of environmental stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665044>Role of mitochondria and cardiolipins in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells by retinoic acid.</a></h1><p>All-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA) is a promising agent in the prevention/treatment of breast-cancer. There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic  and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644908>Cutaneous Immune Cell-Microbiota Interactions Are Controlled by Epidermal JunB/AP-1.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multi-factorial skin disease with a complex inflammatory signature including type 2 and type 17 activation. Although  by S. aureus is common in AD, the mechanisms rendering an organism prone to dysbiosis, and the role of IL-17A in the control of S. aureus-induced skin inflammation, are not well understood. Here, we show several pathological aspects of AD, including type 2/type 17 immune responses, elevated IgE, barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and importantly, spontaneous S. aureus  in JunB mice, with a large transcriptomic overlap with AD. Additionally, using Rag1 mice, we demonstrate that adaptive immune cells are necessary for protection against S. aureus . Prophylactic antibiotics, but not antibiotics after established dysbiosis, reduce IL-17A expression and skin inflammation, examined using Il17a-eGFP reporter mice. Mechanistically, keratinocytes lacking JunB exhibit higher MyD88 levels in vitro and in vivo, previously shown to regulate S. aureus . In conclusion, our data identify JunB as an upstream regulator of microbiota-immune cell interactions and characterize the IL-17A response upon spontaneous dysbiosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

High levels of NO produced by NOS2/iNOS can protect against bacterial and parasitic infections, but the role of NOS in fungal innate immunity is less clear. Compared to wild type mice, Nos3-/- mice showed significantly higher survival of candidemia caused by Candida albicans SC5314. NOS3/eNOS is expressed by endothelial cells in the kidney, and  of this organ was decreased during the sub-acute stage of disseminated candidiasis. Nos3-/- mice more rapidly eliminated Candida from the renal cortex and exhibited more balanced local inflammatory reactions, with similar macrophage but less neutrophil infiltration than in infected wild type. Levels of the serum cytokines IL-9, IL-12, IL-17 and chemokines GM-CSF, MIP1α, and MIP1β were significantly elevated, and IL-15 was significantly lower in infected Nos3-/- mice. Spleens of infected Nos3-/- mice had significantly more Th2 and Th9 but not other CD4+ T cells compared with wild type. Inflammatory genes associated with leukocyte chemotaxis, IL-1 signaling, TLR signaling and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways were significantly overexpressed in infected Nos3-/- kidneys, with Nos2 being the most strongly induced. Conversely, the general NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased virulence in the mouse candidemia model, suggesting that iNOS contributes to the protective mechanism in infected Nos3-/- mice. By moderating neutrophil infiltration, the absence of eNOS may reduce the collateral damage to kidney cortex, and Th-9 CD4+ cells may enhance clearance of the infection. These data suggest that selective eNOS inhibition could mitigate candidemia by a combination of systemic and local responses that promote a more effective host immune response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690378>The infant and toddler with wheezing.</a></h1><p>Recurrent wheezing is common in young infants and toddlers, with 50% of all children having at least one wheezing episode in the first 6 years of life. Initial wheezing episodes in young children often are linked to respiratory infections due to viral pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus. Bacterial  of the neonatal airway also may be significant in the late development of recurrent wheeze and asthma. Wheezing in young children can be classified into specific phenotypes based on the onset and persistence of wheezing. Although some children will only wheeze transiently in early childhood, persistent wheezing is often classified as immunoglobulin E (IgE) associated and/or atopic or nonatopic. By using a modified asthma predictive index, future development of asthma can be interpreted, especially in high-risk populations. It is recommended to follow National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for initiation of treatment; however, asthma management of young children often requires tailored regimens. Inhaled corticosteroids used as a daily controller medication have been shown to aid symptoms and exacerbation control; however, these do not change the natural course of the disease or progression to asthma. Although randomized double-blind studies in preschoolers investigated a role of macrolide antibiotics in early infection as well as high-dose inhaled corticosteroids during severe lower respiratory tract infections, more research is needed in this field to understand mechanisms of asthma development and optimal treatment in this young age group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635539>Lethality of  in a murine model of infection depends on the  gene involved in O-polysaccharide synthesis.</a></h1><p> was isolated a decade ago from wildlife and soil in Europe.

Here we define the contributions of tumour-secreted exosomes to brain metastatic  and demonstrate that pre-conditioning the brain microenvironment with exosomes from brain metastatic cells enhances cancer cell outgrowth. Proteomic analysis identified cell migration-inducing and hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP) as elevated in exosomes from brain metastatic but not lung or bone metastatic cells. CEMIP depletion in tumour cells impaired brain metastasis, disrupting invasion and tumour cell association with the brain vasculature, phenotypes rescued by pre-conditioning the brain microenvironment with CEMIP exosomes. Moreover, uptake of CEMIP exosomes by brain endothelial and microglial cells induced endothelial cell branching and inflammation in the perivascular niche by upregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines encoded by Ptgs2, Tnf and Ccl/Cxcl, known to promote brain vascular remodelling and metastasis. CEMIP was elevated in tumour tissues and exosomes from patients with brain metastasis and predicted brain metastasis progression and patient survival. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting exosomal CEMIP could constitute a future avenue for the prevention and treatment of brain metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694679>Comparing cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis and outcomes of First Nations and all other Manitobans: a retrospective analysis.</a></h1><p>Globally, epidemiological evidence suggests cancer incidence and outcomes among Indigenous peoples are a growing concern. Although historically cancer among First Nations (FN) peoples in Canada was relatively unknown, recent epidemiological evidence reveals a widening of cancer related disparities. However evidence at the population level is limited. The aim of this study was to explore cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and outcomes among status FN peoples in comparison with all other Manitobans (AOM).All cancers diagnosed between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2011 were linked with the Indian Registry System and five provincial healthcare databases to compare differences in characteristics, cancer incidence, and stage at diagnosis and mortality of the FN and AOM cohorts. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine mortality.The FN cohort was significantly younger, with higher comorbidities than AOM. A higher proportion of FN people were diagnosed with cancer at stages III (18.7% vs. 15.4%) and IV (22.4% vs. 19.9%). Cancer incidence was significantly lower in the FN cohort, however, there were no significant differences between the two cohorts after adjusting for age, sex, income and area of residence. No significant trends in cancer incidence were identified in either cohort over time. Mortality was generally higher in the FN cohort.Despite similar cancer incidence, FN peoples in Manitoba experience poorer survival.

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the microbiome, in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and colon contents (feces, distal colon, and tumor) were collected. Colon tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures. Colon tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the colon microbiome.We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by colon cancer cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery. Strategies to prevent emergence of these microbe communities or their enzymatic activities might be used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients' clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin . The median age was 64 years (14-88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient's cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin B (33%) minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), but had low echinocandin and voriconazole MICs.

What has hardly been considered so far is that this concept is also relevant for future astrobiological research, since in artificial extraterrestrial habitats ( plants and insects in martian greenhouses) novel environmental conditions will also affect the survival and performance of organisms. The question therefore arises whether and how space-relevant organisms can be artificially adapted to the desired circumstances in advance. Based on several adaptation and acclimatization strategies in wild ecosystems of Earth, I discuss which methods can be considered for assisted evolution in the context of astrobiological research.

The intestinal microbiota has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or  by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal microbiota leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal microbiota of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host microbiota during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established  by resistant microorganisms. Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal microbiota in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human microbiota from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690999>Habitat filters mediate successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab.</a></h1><p>The relative importance of stochastic- and niche-based processes shifts during successional time and across different types of habitats. Microbial biofilms are known to undergo such successional shifts. However, little is known about the interaction between these successional trajectories and habitat filters. Harsh habitat filters could affect biofilm successional trajectories by strengthening niche-based processes and weakening stochastic processes. We used mesocosms to track successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab (Pachygrapsus transversus). We followed replicated microbial communities under strong and weak habitat filters associated with the crab's gut and carapace. For bacteria,  of the crab's gut is constrained by strong chemical and physical filtering, while the carapace remains relatively open for . Consistent with successional models of bacterial biofilms, carapace microbial communities initially converged in community composition at day 8 and diverged thereafter. We expected gut microbial communities to deviate from the trajectory in the carapace and converge towards a subset of tolerant species. Instead, bacterial communities in the gut exhibited low richness, unchanging similarity in composition and turnover in species identities throughout the duration of our study. These habitat filter effects were linked with weak species interactions and low influence from  in the gut.

The correlation between surface roughness (SR) and bacterial  was also evaluated.A total of 48 archwire segments (0.016 × 0.022-in) were equally divided into 4 groups: nickel-titanium coated, nickel-titanium partially coated, uncoated stainless steel, and uncoated nickel-titanium. The archwires were randomly inserted in a split-mouth study design. After 4 weeks of clinical use, the total number of microorganisms adhering to the archwire was quantified and transformed into colony-forming units. SR was evaluated using a profilometer. A one-way and two-way ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey test, paired-samples t test, and Pearson correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis.All the archwires presented microorganism adhesion, with the nickel-titanium-coated group demonstrating the highest value (P < 0.001). A statistically significant increase in SR was observed after clinical use for all groups (P < 0.05). No correlation between SR and bacterial adhesion was detected.Microorganism adhesion occurred on all of the archwires tested, especially on the esthetic fully coated. Because SR was not correlated with microorganism adhesion, future studies should evaluate the effect of surface free energy and superficial chemical changes on in-vivo microorganism adhesion.Copyright © 2019 American Association of Orthodontists.

The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can initially attach to surfaces via its single polar flagellum. Although many bacteria quickly detach, some become irreversibly attached and express surface-associated structures, such as Type IV pili, and behaviors, including twitching motility and biofilm initiation. P. aeruginosa that lack the GTPase FlhF assemble a randomly placed flagellum that is motile; however, we observed that these mutant bacteria show defects in biofilm formation comparable to those seen for non-motile, aflagellate bacteria. This phenotype was associated with altered behavior of ΔflhF bacteria immediately following surface-attachment. Forward and reverse genetic screens led to the discovery that FlhF interacts with FimV to control flagellar rotation at a surface, and implicated cAMP signaling in this pathway. Although cAMP controls many transcriptional programs in P. aeruginosa, known targets of this second messenger were not required to modulate flagellar rotation in surface-attached bacteria. Instead, alterations in switching behavior of the motor appeared to result from direct or indirect effects of cAMP on switch complex proteins and/or the stators associated with them.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684871>Transcriptome analysis of the differential effect of the NADPH oxidase gene RbohB in Phaseolus vulgaris roots following Rhizobium tropici and Rhizophagus irregularis inoculation.</a></h1><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by NADPH oxidases known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) in plants. ROS regulate various cellular processes, including the mutualistic interactions between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Rboh is a multigene family comprising nine members (RbohA-I) in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The RNA interference-mediated silencing of RbohB (PvRbohB-RNAi) in this species diminished its ROS production and greatly impaired nodulation. By contrast, the PvRbohB-RNAi transgenic roots showed early hyphal root  with enlarged fungal hypopodia; therefore, we proposed that PvRbohB positively regulates rhizobial infection (Rhizobium tropici) and inhibits AM  by Rhizophagus irregularis in P. vulgaris.To corroborate this hypothesis, an RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in the PvRbohB-RNAi roots inoculated with Rhizobium tropici or Rhizophagus irregularis. We found that, in the early stages, root nodule symbioses generated larger changes of the transcriptome than did AM symbioses in P. vulgaris. Genes related to ROS homeostasis and cell wall flexibility were markedly upregulated in the early stages of rhizobial , but not during AM . Compared with AM , the rhizobia induced the expression of a greater number of genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of auxins, cytokinins, and ethylene, which were typically repressed in the PvRbohB-RNAi roots.Our research provides substantial insights into the genetic interaction networks in the early stages of rhizobia and AM symbioses with P. vulgaris, as well as the differential roles that RbohB plays in processes related to ROS scavenging, cell wall remodeling, and phytohormone homeostasis during nodulation and mycorrhization in this legume.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649817>Infection control management and surveillance of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in hematopoietic stem cell recipients.</a></h1><p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment option for selected diseases of the hematopoietic system. In the context of HSCT, bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic treatment of bloodstream infections with carbapenem-resistant (CR) GNB presents a particular challenge. As a part of our infection control management, the admission of a patient who was known to be colonized with a CR  triggered an active weekly screening of all patients to determine the prevalence and potential transmission of CR GNB and CR  in particular. Over a 3 month period a total of 71 patients were regularly screened for  with CR GNB. Including the index patient, a total of three patients showed CR GNB  representing a prevalence of 4.2%. Nosocomial transmission of CR  or other CR GNB was not observed. However, the index patient developed a subsequent bloodstream infection with the CR , therefore empiric antibiotic therapy based on the known resistance profile was initiated. A weekly prevalence screening for CR GNB might be an effective monitoring tool for potential transmission, may enhance existing infection control management concepts and may support the decision making for empiric antibiotic therapy.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683878>Metagenomic Characterization Reveals Pronounced Seasonality in the Diversity and Structure of the Phyllosphere Bacterial Community in a Mediterranean Ecosystem.</a></h1><p>We explore how the phyllosphere microbial community responds to a very seasonal environment such as the Mediterranean. For this, we studied the epiphytic bacterial community of a Mediterranean ecosystem in summer and winter, expecting to detect seasonal differences at their maximum. With high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we detected the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in the phyllosphere and also in the surrounding air. The epiphytic community is approximately five orders of magnitude denser than the airborne one and is made almost exclusively by habitat specialists. The two communities differ considerably but Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria are dominant in both. Of the five most abundant phyllosphere OTUs, two were closely related to  strains, one to  and the other two to Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales. We found the epiphytic community to become much richer, more distinct, even and diverse, denser and more connected in summer. In contrast, there was no difference in the level of bacterial  of the phyllosphere between the two seasons, although there were seasonal differences for individual taxonomic groups: Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes and Chlroroflexi had a higher participation in summer, whereas the major Proteobacteria classes presented reverse patterns, with Betaproteobacteria increasing in summer at the expense of the prominent Alphaproteobacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648274>Relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining dynamic rates of boreal birds at the edge of their range.</a></h1><p>The Adirondack Park in New York State contains a unique and limited distribution of boreal ecosystem types, providing habitat for a number of birds at the southern edge of their range. Species are projected to shift poleward in a warming climate, and the limited boreal forest of the Adirondacks is expected to undergo significant change in response to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Here we expand upon a previous analysis to examine changes in occupancy patterns for eight species of boreal birds over a decade (2007-2016), and we assess the relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining  and extinction rates. Our analysis identifies patterns of declining occupancy for six of eight species, including some declines which appear to have become more pronounced since a prior analysis. Although non-climate drivers such as wetland area, connectivity, and human footprint continue to influence  and extinction rates, we find that for most species, occupancy patterns are best described by climate drivers. We modeled both average and annual temperature and precipitation characteristics and find stronger support for species' responses to average climate conditions, rather than interannual climate variability. In general, boreal birds appear most likely to colonize sites that have lower levels of precipitation and a high degree of connectivity, and they tend to persist in sites that are warmer in the breeding season and have low and less variable precipitation in the winter. It is likely that these responses reflect interactions between broader habitat conditions and temperature and precipitation variables. Indirect climate influences as mediated through altered species interactions may also be important in this context. Given climate change predictions for both temperature and precipitation, it is likely that habitat structural changes over the long term may alter these relationships in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644315>Association between  Complex Pulmonary Disease and Mycobacteria in Home Water and Soil: A Case-Control Study.</a></h1><p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), are emerging pathogens that can opportunistically cause debilitating pulmonary disease in susceptible human hosts. Potential sources of exposure in homes include point-of-use water sources such as taps and showerheads, as well as gardening soils. The relative human health impacts of NTM in these home environments remain poorly understood.This study tested associations between MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) and NTM  of five potential point-of-use sources of pathogen exposure in homes.A case-control study was conducted of Washington and Oregon residents who had been diagnosed with MAC-PD, and population controls matched by age, gender, and geography. Samples were collected from bathroom faucets, kitchen faucets, shower aerosols, indoor soil, and outdoor soil. Mycobacteria in environmental samples were identified in a blinded fashion by using bacteriological culture combined with PCR. The isolation of NTM from case homes (N = 56) vs. control homes (N = 51) was quantitatively compared using conditional logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.NTM were isolated from shower aerosols collected in case homes more often than in control homes. An adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NTM isolation from shower aerosols had a high odds ratio associated with disease (OR, 4.0., 95% CI, 1.2-13). Other home environmental samples (tap water, soils) did not exhibit this association.The results implicate shower aerosols as uniquely significant sources of NTM exposure in homes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662463>Genome-Wide Transposon Screen of a  Mutant Reveals the Substrates of Efflux Transporters.</a></h1><p>Bacteria express numerous efflux transporters that confer resistance to diverse toxicants present in their environment. Due to a high level of functional redundancy of these transporters, it is difficult to identify those that are of most importance in conferring resistance to specific compounds. The esistance-odulation-ivision (RND) protein family is one such example of redundant transporters that are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria. Within this family, the MexAB-OprM protein complex is highly expressed and conserved among  species. We exposed barcoded transposon mutant libraries in isogenic wild-type and Δ backgrounds in  B728a to diverse toxic compounds  to identify mutants with increased susceptibility to these compounds. Mutants with mutations in genes encoding both known and novel redundant transporters but with partially overlapping substrate specificities were observed in a Δ background. Psyr_0228, an uncharacterized member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, preferentially contributes to tolerance of acridine orange and acriflavine. Another transporter located in the inner membrane, Psyr_0541, contributes to tolerance of acriflavine and berberine. The presence of multiple redundant, genomically encoded efflux transporters appears to enable bacterial strains to tolerate a diversity of environmental toxins. This genome-wide screen performed in a hypersusceptible mutant strain revealed numerous transporters that would otherwise be dispensable under these conditions. Bacterial strains such as  that likely encounter diverse toxins in their environment, such as in association with many different plant species, probably benefit from possessing multiple redundant transporters that enable versatility with respect to toleration of novel toxicants. Bacteria use protein pumps to remove toxic compounds from the cell interior, enabling survival in diverse environments. These protein pumps can be highly redundant, making their targeted examination difficult. In this study, we exposed mutant populations of  to diverse toxicants to identify pumps that contributed to survival in those conditions. In parallel, we examined pump redundancy by testing mutants of a population lacking the primary efflux transporter responsible for toxin tolerance. We identified partial substrate overlap for redundant transporters, as well as several pumps that appeared more substrate specific. For bacteria that are found in diverse environments, having multiple, partially redundant efflux pumps likely allows flexibility in habitat .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638584>A flowchart is always useful: application to the interpretation of the cytobacteriological examination of urine.</a></h1><p>The cytobacteriological examination of urine (CBEU) is the most prescribed test in a microbiology laboratory. The objectives of this work were to present our experience in carrying out the CBEU and to share one of the means that we consider very useful in the daily practice of this crucial analysis. This is a 28-month prospective study (March 2016 to June 2018). The CBEU was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the medical microbiology referential (REMIC). Antibiotic susceptibility was studied in accordance with the recommendations of the l'European committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST). Cultures were positive for urinary tract infection in 5.09% (n=769) of cases and for  in 4.88% (n=737) of cases. E. coli alone accounted for 57.8% (n=850) of all isolates. In our experience, the display of the interpretation flowchart at the bench level, as well as the availability of clinical information and cytology results when examining urocultures, allows our technicians to decide, independently, what action to take for each CBEU according to the particular context of the patient for whom it has been prescribed. Similarly, this flowchart allows the unique microbiologist in the laboratory to contextually interpret each CBEU.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659191>Identification of novel targets for host-directed therapeutics against intracellular Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h1><p>During patient , Staphylococcus aureus is able to invade and proliferate within human cells to evade the immune system and last resort drugs such as vancomycin. Hijacking specific host molecular factors and/or pathways is necessary for pathogens to successfully establish an intracellular infection. In this study, we employed an unbiased shRNA screening coupled with ultra-fast sequencing to screen 16,000 human genes during S. aureus infection and we identified several host genes important for this intracellular pathogen. In addition, we interrogated our screening results to find novel host-targeted therapeutics against intracellular S. aureus. We found that silencing the human gene TRAM2 resulted in a significant reduction of intracellular bacterial load while host cell viability was restored, showing its importance during intracellular infection. Furthermore, TRAM2 is an interactive partner of the endoplasmic reticulum SERCA pumps and treatment with the SERCA-inhibitor Thapsigargin halted intracellular MRSA survival. Our results suggest that Thapsigargin could be repurposed to tackle S. aureus host cell infection in combination with conventional antibiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641084>Clustering as a Means To Control Nitrate Respiration Efficiency and Toxicity in Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Respiration is a fundamental process that has to optimally respond to metabolic demand and environmental changes. We previously showed that nitrate respiration, crucial for gut  by enterobacteria, is controlled by polar clustering of the nitrate reductase increasing the electron flux through the complex. Here, we show that the formate dehydrogenase electron-donating complex, FdnGHI, also clusters at the cell poles under nitrate-respiring conditions. Its proximity to the nitrate reductase complex was confirmed by its identification in the interactome of the latter, which appears to be specific to the nitrate-respiring condition. Interestingly, we have identified a multiprotein complex dedicated to handle nitric oxide resulting from the enhanced activity of the electron transport chain terminated by nitrate reductase. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic NADH-dependent nitrite reductase NirBD and the hybrid cluster protein Hcp are key contributors to regulation of the nitric oxide level during nitrate respiration. Thus, gathering of actors involved in respiration and NO homeostasis seems to be critical to balancing maximization of electron flux and the resulting toxicity. Most bacteria rely on the redox activity of respiratory complexes embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane to gain energy in the form of ATP and of an electrochemical gradient established across the membrane. Nevertheless, production of harmful and toxic nitric oxide by actively growing bacteria as either an intermediate or side-product of nitrate respiration challenges how homeostasis control is exerted. Here, we show that components of the nitrate electron transport chain are clustered, likely influencing the kinetics of the process. Nitric oxide production from this respiratory chain is controlled and handled through a multiprotein complex, including detoxifying systems. These findings point to an essential role of compartmentalization of respiratory components in bacterial cell growth.Copyright © 2019 Bulot et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686336>Decreased Root-Knot Nematode Gall Formation in Roots of the Morning Glory Ipomoea tricolor Symbiotic with Ergot Alkaloid-Producing Fungal Periglandula Sp.</a></h1><p>Many species of morning glories (Convolvulaceae) form symbioses with seed-transmitted Periglandula fungal endosymbionts, which produce ergot alkaloids and may contribute to defensive mutualism. Allocation of seed-borne ergot alkaloids to various tissues of several Ipomoea species has been demonstrated, including roots of I. tricolor. The goal of this study was to determine if infection of I. tricolor by the Periglandula sp. endosymbiont affects Southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) gall formation and host plant biomass. We hypothesized that I. tricolor plants infected by Periglandula (E+) would develop fewer nematode-induced galls compared to non-symbiotic plants (E-). E+ or E- status of plant lines was confirmed by testing methanol extracts from individual seeds for endosymbiont-produced ergot alkaloids. To test the effects of Periglandula on nematode , E+ and E- I. tricolor seedlings were grown in soil infested with high densities of M. incognita nematodes (N+) or no nematodes (N-) for four weeks in the greenhouse before harvesting. After harvest, nematode  of roots was visualized microscopically, and total gall number and plant biomass were quantified. Four ergot alkaloids were detected in roots of E+ plants, but no alkaloids were found in E- plants. Gall formation was reduced by 50% in E+ plants compared to E- plants, independent of root biomass. Both N+ plants and E+ plants had significantly reduced biomass compared to N- and E- plants, respectively. These results demonstrate Periglandula's defensive role against biotic enemies, albeit with a potential trade-off with host plant growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672506>Behavior Manipulation of Mosquitoes by a Mermithid Nematode.</a></h1><p>We examined manipulation of mosquito behavior by the parasitic mermithid nematode, Strelkovimermis spiculatus. This nematode species typically infects early instar host larvae and emerges after parasitic development to kill last-instar larvae. Parasitized adults, however, have occasionally been reported from field collections. We obtained low rates (1.7 to 11.5%) of parasitized adults in laboratory exposures only when Culex pipiens pipiens fourth-instar larvae nearing pupation were exposed to infective nematodes. This did not allow an adequate interval for parasitic development in immature host stages. Parasitized adult females in a multiple-choice assay were three times more likely to seek water than a blood source (63.1 vs. 20.5%), whereas uninfected females were twice as likely to seek blood than water (64%3.9 vs. 32.6%). This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing the only mechanism for dispersal and  of new host habitats while concurrently avoiding risks from the defensive behaviors associated with blood-feeding. Behavioral alternation in Cx. p. pipiens larval hosts was also examined using larvae infected as second instars to allow for a normal duration of parasitic development. As larvae neared pupation and parasite emergence, parasitized larvae became more spatially aggregated than unparasitized larvae. This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing a corresponding increase in post-parasite aggregation, which facilitates formation of large mating clusters and concomitantly reproductive success. Parasites derive fitness gains by overriding host autonomy, whereas hosts have zero fitness once parasitism is established, suggesting a coevolutionary response is inoperative and that the behavioral modifications may be adaptive.Copyright © 2019.

The subspecies  originated in Africa and was introduced to the Americas in 1956. For the last 60 years, it hybridized successfully with European subspecies, previous residents in the area. The result of this hybridization was called Africanized honey bee (AHB). AHB has spread since then, arriving to Puerto Rico (PR) in 1994. The honey bee population on the island acquired a mosaic of features from AHB or the European honey bee (EHB). AHB in Puerto Rico shows a major distinctive characteristic, docile behavior, and is called gentle Africanized honey bees (gAHB). We used 917 SNPs to examine the population structure, genetic differentiation, origin, and history of range expansion and  of gAHB in PR. We compared gAHB to populations that span the current distribution of  worldwide. The gAHB population is shown to be a single population that differs genetically from the examined populations of AHB. Texas and PR groups are the closest genetically. Our results support the hypothesis that the Texas AHB population is the source of gAHB in Puerto Rico.© 2019 The Authors.

Climatological factors may also alter the dynamics of the interactions between plant pathogens and their hosts.  (=) , the causal agent of Swiss needle cast (SNC) of Douglas-fir, is endemic to western North America where it exists as two sympatric, reproductively isolated lineages. The abundance of this fungus and the severity of SNC are strongly influenced by climate. We used statistical and population genetic analyses to examine relationships between environment, pathogen population structure, and SNC severity. Although  Lineage 2 in western Oregon and Washington was most abundant where SNC symptoms were most severe, we did not detect a significant relationship between Lineage 2 and disease severity. Warmer winter temperatures were inversely correlated with foliage retention () and positively correlated with the relative abundance of Lineage 2 (). However when distance inland, which was strongly correlated with both  and , was included in the model, there was no significant relationship between Lineage 2 and . Spring/early summer dew point temperatures also were positively associated with total  abundance ( index ()) and inversely correlated with . Warmer summer mean temperatures were associated with lower  and higher . Our results suggest that the two lineages have overlapping environmental optima, but slightly different tolerance ranges. Lineage 2 was absent from more inland sites where winters are colder and summers are warm and dry, while Lineage 1 occurred at most sites across an environmental gradient suggesting broader environmental tolerance. These relationships suggest that climate influences the abundance and distribution of this ecologically important plant pathogen and may have played a role in the evolutionary divergence of these two cryptic fungal lineages.© 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of this work was to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and neonatal outcomes of pathogenic   in pregnant women.A total of 137 women from southern Taiwan with singleton pregnancies were enrolled between March 2016 and June 2017. The women were prospectively screened for   in the rectovaginal region during prenatal examination. The exclusion criteria are twin pregnancy of the mother and major anomaly of the neonate. All  isolates were identified as either pathogenic or commensal strains, and their susceptibility to various antimicrobials was investigated.

Epidemiological studies have linked perinatal antibiotic exposure in human newborns to an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but if this effect is mediated by the gut-lung axis is unknown. To explore antibiotic disruption of the newborn gut-lung axis, we studied how perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure influenced lung injury in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that disruption of intestinal commensal  during the perinatal period promotes a more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype characterized by increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, metagenomic shifts were associated with decreased IL-22 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage and were independent of hyperoxia-induced inflammasome activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unrecognized influence of the gut-lung axis during the development of neonatal lung injury, which could be leveraged to ameliorate the most severe and persistent pulmonary complication of preterm birth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649634>Yeasts of Burden: Exploring the Mycobiome-Bacteriome of the Piglet GI Tract.</a></h1><p>Interactions between the bacteria and fungi in the gut microbiome can result in altered nutrition, pathogenicity of infection, and host development, making them a crucial component in host health. Associations between the mycobiome and bacteriome in the piglet gut, in the context of weaning, remain unknown. Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall microbiome development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome. Potential interactions between genera were found in the lower piglet GI bacteriome and mycobiome with positive correlations found between the fungus, , and several bacterial species, including .  demonstrated negative correlations with the short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria , , and .

In case of expectant management and with a low rate of antibiotic prophylaxis, home care compared to hospitalization could be associated with an increase in neonatal infections (LE3), especially in case of group B streptococcus  (LE3). Home care is therefore not recommended (Grade C). In the absence of spontaneous labor within 12 hours of rupture, antibiotic prophylaxis could reduce the risk of maternal intrauterine infection but not of neonatal infection (LE3). Its use after 12 hours of rupture in term prelabor rupture of the membranes is therefore recommended (Grade C). When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, intravenous beta-lactams are recommended (Grade C). Induction of labor with oxytocin (LE1), prostaglandin E2 (LE1) or misoprostol (LE1), is associated with shorter rupture of membranes to delivery intervals when compared to expectant management. Compared with expectant management, immediate induction of labor is not associated with lower rates of neonatal infection (LE1), even among women with a positive streptococcus B vaginal swab (LE2). Thus, expectant management can be offered without increasing the risk of neonatal infection (Grade B). Induction of labor is not associated with an increase or decrease in the cesarean delivery rate (LE2), whatever parity (LE2) or Bishop score at admission (LE3). Induction can thus be proposed without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery (Grade B). No induction method (oxytocin, dinoprostone, misoprostol or Foley Catheter) has demonstrated superiority over another, whether to reduce rate of intrauterine or neonatal infection, rate of cesarean delivery or to shorten rupture of membranes to delivery intervals regardless of Bishop's score and parity.Term prelabor rupture of membranes is a frequent event. A 12-hour delay without onset of spontaneous labor was chosen to differentiate a physiological condition from a potentially unsafe situation justifying an antibiotic prophylaxis. Expectant management or induction of labor can both be proposed, even in case of positive screening for streptococcus B, depending on the patient's wishes and maternity units' organization (Professional consensus).Copyright © 2019.

Increased understanding of risk factors associated with intestinal  of EPE is crucial to implement adequate actions against AMR. The aim of this study was to define potential risk factors for prolonged intestinal  with EPE. A secondary aim was to analyze if patients were adequately informed about being infected or colonized by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Patients with a positive clinical EPE culture from urine, blood or feces were recruited in a region in the south of Sweden. Selective EPE fecal cultures were obtained at least three months after the initial positive culture. Prolonged intestinal  was defined as the prevalence of any EPE in the follow-up fecal sample. Risk factors for prolonged intestinal  were evaluated by using a questionnaire and by retrospective review of medical records. A univariate model and a multivariate regression analysis were performed to identify possible risk factors for intestinal EPE .Out of 143 patients included in the study, 57% remained positive for EPE at the second sampling. In a multivariate regression model, urological intervention, history of EPE infection and travel to Africa and/or Asia within 2 years were found to be significantly associated with prolonged intestinal  of EPE. Before being approached by us, 50% of patients displayed inadequate knowledge of EPE infection or .In this prospective cohort study, urological intervention within 6 months and a history of EPE infection are independently associated with prolonged intestinal  with EPE. In contrast, travel to Africa and/or Asia within 2 years is associated with a decreased risk of prolonged intestinal  with EPE. There is room for improvement when it comes to patient information regarding EPE to decrease of spread.© 2019 Ljungquist et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633563>Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae - once positive always positive?</a></h1><p>This review provides an overview of gastrointestinal tract  with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), including risk factors for , determinants for duration of , and whether patients can decolonize, either spontaneously or via targeted interventions.CPE  is disseminating globally with increasing numbers of carbapenemases being identified in increasing patient cohorts.

Although new methods for expediting decolonization are being investigated, including faecal microbiota transplantation, high quality evidence of impact is lacking.Current evidence indicates that CPE  usually persists throughout the duration of most hospital admissions, although the majority of patients will subsequently spontaneously decolonize. Difficulties remain in determining the point at which patients can be considered decolonized because of the lack acceptable criteria for defining eradication. This has significance implications for infection prevention and control measures during the initial and subsequent hospital admissions.

In general, motility and fast expansion are expected to be beneficial for  and hence for the fitness of an organism. Here we apply an evolution protocol to investigate phenotypical requirements for colonizing habitats of different sizes during range expansion by chemotaxing bacteria. Contrary to the intuitive expectation that faster is better, we show that there is an optimal expansion speed for a given habitat size. Our analysis showed that this effect arises from interactions among pioneering cells at the front of the expanding population, and revealed a simple, evolutionarily stable strategy for colonizing a habitat of a specific size: to expand at a speed given by the product of the growth rate and the habitat size. These results illustrate stability-to-invasion as a powerful principle for the selection of phenotypes in complex ecological processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660878>Prevalence of and risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in the West of Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Several reports designate the recent increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) nasal carriage. Because of the scanty information regarding the nasal carriage sate of MRSA in the west of Iran, the purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of CA-MRSA in Sanandaj city.Swabs collected from anterior nares of 600 volunteers were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. The isolates were further investigated for methicillin resistance by using the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, followed by PCR-amplification of the mecA gene. SCCmec types and the presence of the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (pvl) encoding genes were determined through PCR. Finally, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the agar diffusion method.Nasal screening identified 181 S. aureus, of which 55 isolates were MRSA. SCCmec types IV and V were detected in MRSA at frequencies of 80 and 20%, respectively. The overall frequency of pvl genes among the MRSA isolates was 14.54%. MRSA isolates were highly susceptible (98.18%) to mupirocin, gentamicin, and fusidic acid.The high prevalence of CA-MRSA carriage in the population could pose a serious public health concern for the region.

EIF3B is a core subunit of the EIF3 family, and is overexpressed in many tumors. EIF3B is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, as well as the genesis and development of tumors. However, the potential role of EIF3B in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. In the current study, we explored the clinical significance and the possible mechanism of EIF3B in the progression of GC.EIF3B expression was analyzed in 78 GC tissue samples through quantitative PCR and in 94 GC tissue samples through immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The correlation between EIF3B and clinicopathological features was analyzed in GC tissues. The role of EIF3B in GC progression was investigated through in vitro and in vivo assays.EIF3B expression was upregulated in GC tissues (73.4%, IHC). High expression of EIF3B was significantly correlated with the depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (=0.000, 0.000 and 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that GC patients with high EIF3B expression suffered a poorer 5-year survival. EIF3B promoted GC cell proliferation and was strongly associated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in GC samples (=0.009). It also enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion, which were affected through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Stat3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of EIF3B in GC cells suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors and lung metastatic  in vivo. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Western blot results demonstrated that EIF3B activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.Our results suggest that EIF3B plays an oncogenic role in GC progression and serves as an independent prognostic factor for GC patients.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692755>[Seroprevalence and factors associated with viral hepatitis B among pregnant women in Parakou, Republic of Benin].</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study is to determine the seroprevalence and the factors associated with viral hepatitis B among pregnant women at the Departmental University Hospital of Borgou (CHUD-B).We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study with prospective collection of data.

Exosomes enable prooncogenic secretome delivering and trafficking for long-distance cell-to-cell communication. This study aims to explore molecular mechanisms underlying how ASPH network regulates designated exosomes to program development and progression of breast cancer.Stable cell lines overexpressing or knocking-out of ASPH were established using lentivirus transfection or CRISPR-CAS9 systems. Western blot, MTT, immunofluorescence, luciferase reporter, co-immunoprecipitation, 2D/3-D invasion, tube formation, mammosphere formation, immunohistochemistry and newly developed in vitro metastasis were applied.Through physical interactions with Notch receptors, ligands (JAGs) and regulators (ADAM10/17), ASPH activates Notch cascade to provide raw materials (especially MMPs/ADAMs) for synthesis/release of pro-metastatic exosomes. Exosomes orchestrate EMT, 2-D/3-D invasion, stemness, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. Small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of ASPH's β-hydroxylase specifically/efficiently abrogated in vitro metastasis, which mimics basement membrane invasion at primary site, intravasation/extravasation (transendothelial migration), and /outgrowth at distant sites. Multiple organ-metastases in orthotopic and tail vein injection murine models were substantially blocked by a specific SMI. ASPH is silenced in normal adult breast, upregulated from in situ malignancies to highly expressed in invasive/advanced ductal carcinoma. Moderate-high expression of ASPH confers more aggressive molecular subtypes (TNBC or Her2 amplified), early recurrence/progression and devastating outcome (reduced overall/disease-free survival) of breast cancer. Expression profiling of Notch signaling components positively correlates with ASPH expression in breast cancer patients, confirming that ASPH-Notch axis acts functionally in breast tumorigenesis.ASPH-Notch axis guides particularly selective exosomes to potentiate multifaceted metastasis. ASPH's pro-oncogenic/pro-metastatic properties are essential for breast cancer development/progression, revealing a potential target for therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644663>High-resolution computed tomography findings in young infants with cystic fibrosis detected by newborn screening.</a></h1><p>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) allows the early detection of pathological changes in the lung structure, and reproducible scoring systems can be used to quantify chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of the study was to describe early HRCT findings according to a validated scoring system in infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS).This cross-sectional study included infants with CF diagnosed by NBS who were born between January 2013 and January 2017 and who underwent HRCT scanning within the first year after diagnosis when they were clinically stable. The CT scans were evaluated using the modified Bhalla score.Thirty-two subjects underwent HRCT scanning. The mean total-modified Bhalla score was 3.6±2.1, and 93.8% of the scans were abnormal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway  was associated with increased modified Bhalla score values. Bronchial wall thickening was the most common feature (90.6%), followed by bronchial collapse/consolidation (59.4%), mosaic attenuation/perfusion (50%), bronchiectasis (37.5%) and mucus plugging (15.6%). Bronchial wall thickening was diffuse in most of the patients.A substantial proportion of infants diagnosed with CF after detection by NBS already showed evidence of lung disease. P. aeruginosa  was associated with increased Bhalla scores, highlighting the importance of this CF pathogen in early structural lung disease. The presence of bronchial wall thickening at such a young age may reflect the presence of airway inflammatory processes.

The bean bug  acquires a specific bacterial symbiont of the genus  from environmental soil and harbors it in midgut crypts. The genus  consists of over 100 species, showing ecologically diverse lifestyles, and including serious human pathogens, plant pathogens, and nodule-forming plant mutualists, as well as insect mutualists. Through infection tests of 34  species and 18 taxonomically diverse bacterial species, we demonstrate here that nonsymbiotic  and even its outgroup  could stably colonize the gut symbiotic organ and provide beneficial effects to the bean bug when inoculated on aposymbiotic hosts. However, coinoculation revealed that the native symbiont always outcompeted the nonnative bacteria inside the gut symbiotic organ, explaining the predominance of the native  symbiont in natural bean bug populations. Hence, the abilities for  and cooperation, usually thought of as specific traits of mutualists, are not unique to the native  symbiont but, to the contrary, competitiveness inside the gut is a derived trait of the native symbiont lineage only and was thus critical in the evolution of the insect gut symbiont.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681240>Lactoferrin Disaggregates Pneumococcal Biofilms and Inhibits Acquisition of Resistance Through Its DNase Activity.</a></h1><p> colonizes the upper airways of children and the elderly.  progresses to persistent carriage when  forms biofilms, a feature required for the development of pneumococcal disease. Nasopharyngeal biofilms are structured with a matrix that includes extracellular DNA (eDNA), which is sourced from the same pneumococci and other bacteria. This eDNA also allows pneumococci to acquire new traits, including antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of lactoferrin (LF), at physiological concentrations found in secretions with bactericidal activity [i.e., colostrum (100 μM), tears (25 μM)], in eradicating pneumococcal biofilms from human respiratory cells. The efficacy of synthetic LF-derived peptides was also assessed. We first demonstrated that LF inhibited  of  on human respiratory cells without affecting the viability of planktonic bacteria. LF-derived peptides were, however, bactericidal for planktonic pneumococci but they did not affect viability of pre-formed biofilms. In contrast, LF (40 and 80 μM) eradicated pneumococcal biofilms that had been pre-formed on abiotic surfaces (i.e., polystyrene) and on human pharyngeal cells, as investigated by viable counts and confocal microscopy. LF also eradicated biofilms formed by  strains with resistance to multiple antibiotics. We investigated whether treatment with LF would affect the biofilm structure by analyzing eDNA. Surprisingly, in pneumococcal biofilms treated with LF, the eDNA was absent in comparison to the untreated control (∼10 μg/ml) or those treated with LF-derived peptides. EMSA assays showed that LF binds  DNA and a time-course study of DNA decay demonstrated that the DNA is degraded when bound by LF. This LF-associated DNase activity inhibited acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in both  transformation assays and in a life-like bioreactor system. In conclusion, we demonstrated that LF eradicates pneumococcal-colonizing biofilms at a concentration safe for humans and identified a LF-associated DNAse activity that inhibited the acquisition of resistance.Copyright © 2019 Angulo-Zamudio, Vidal, Nazmi, Bolscher, Leon-Sicairos, Antezana, Canizalez-Roman and León-Sicairos.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694895>Reduced Fitness Costs of  Compared to Mutated  in Isogenic Colistin-Resistant KPC-3-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we provide the results of a detailed genomic analysis and the growth characteristics of a colistin-resistant KPC-3-producing  sequence type 512 (ST512) isolate (the colR-KPC3-KP isolate) with a mutated  and isogenic isolates of colR-KPC3-KP with  isolated from an immunocompromised patient.

Several PCR methods have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of PCP. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a real-time PCR in the diagnosis of PCP, in patients with various underlying diseases.Ninety-seven BAL samples and 94 sputum samples from 191 patients were used in the study. Patients were classified as PCP (121 patients) or non-PCP (70 patients) based on their clinical and radiological presentations.Real time PCR amplified the P. jirovecii mitochondrial large-subunit rRNA gene with a detection limit of 68 copies of DNA per reaction. Non-PCP pathogens including 32 different fungi and bacteria were also evaluated. Overall, 71.9% of the samples from PCP patients and 14.5% of those from non-PCP patients were positive for the PCR test with a C value of the real-time PCR below 45. The main underlying diseases of the patients were hematological or solid malignancies (47.1%) and HIV infection (8.9%). The C values of the test were significantly lower in BAL samples from PCP patients than those from non-PCP patients (p = 0.024). No non-PCP patient had a C value below 30, whereas samples from 24.8% of PCP patients with underlying diseases had a C value below 30.Since false positive PCR results were obtained, perhaps due to , we suggest that the diagnosis of PCP should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, and PCR results.Copyright © 2019.

Previously, it was thought that C. difficile was primarily a hospital-acquired infection, however, with the emergence of community-associated cases, and whole-genome sequencing suggesting the majority of the hospital C. difficile infection (CDI) cases are genetically distinct from one another, there is compelling evidence that sources/reservoirs of C. difficile outside hospitals play a significant role in the transmission of CDI.To review the 'One Health' aspects of CDI, focusing on how community sources/reservoirs might be acting as a conduit in the transfer of C. difficile between animals and humans. The importance of a One Health approach in managing CDI is discussed.A literature search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science for relevant papers published from 01 January 2000 to 10 July 2019.We present evidence that demonstrates transmission of C. difficile in hospitals from asymptomatic carriers to symptomatic CDI patients. The source of  is most probably community reservoirs, such as foods and the environment, where toxigenic C. difficile strains have frequently been isolated. With high-resolution genomic sequencing, the transmission of C. difficile between animals and humans is likely despite a clear epidemiological link often being absent.

However, recent studies have challenged the requirement of EMT for metastasis. Here, we assessed in different models of primary skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) whether EMT is associated with metastasis. The incidence of metastasis was much higher in SCCs presenting EMT compared to SCCs without EMT, supporting the notion that a certain degree of EMT is required to initiate the metastatic cascade in primary skin SCCs. Most circulating tumor cells presented EMT, whereas most lung metastasis did not present EMT, showing that mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is important for metastatic . In contrast, immunodeficient mice transplanted with SCCs, whether displaying EMT or not, presented metastasis. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the association of EMT and metastasis is model dependent, and metastasis of primary skin SCCs is associated with EMT.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study aims at identifying potentiator combinations that can considerably enhance the limited channel activity of a panel of CFTR gating mutants over monotherapy.The functional response of 13 CFTR mutants to single potentiators or systematic potentiator combinations was determined in the human bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o- and a subset of them was confirmed in primary human nasal epithelia (HNE).In six out of thirteen CFTR missense mutants the fractional plasma membrane (PM) activity, a surrogate measure of CFTR channel gating, reached only ∼10-50% of WT channel activity upon VX-770 treatment, indicating incomplete gating correction. Combinatorial potentiator profiling and cluster analysis of mutant responses to 24 diverse investigational potentiators identified several compound pairs that improved the gating activity of R352Q-, S549R-, S549N-, G551D-, and G1244E-CFTR to ∼70-120% of the WT. Similarly, the potentiator combinations were able to confer WT-like function to G551D-CFTR in patient-derived human nasal epithelia.This study suggests that half of CF patients with missense mutations approved for VX-770 administration, could benefit from the development of dual potentiator therapy.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) , its symbiotic endophyte , and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695752>RstA, a two-component response regulator, plays important roles in multiple virulence-associated processes in enterohemorrhagic  O157:H7.</a></h1><p>Enterohemorrhagic  O157:H7 (EHEC O157) causes bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. EHEC O157 encounters varied microenvironments during infection, and can efficiently adapt to these using the two-component system (TCS). Recently, a functional TCS, RstAB, has been implicated in the regulation of virulence of several bacterial pathogens. However, the regulatory function of RstAB in EHEC O157 is poorly understood. This study aimed at providing insights into the global effects of RstA on gene expression in EHEC O157.In the present study, we analyzed gene expression differences between the EHEC O157 wild-type strain and a Δ mutant using RNA-seq technology. Genes with differential expression in the Δ mutant compared to that in the wild-type strain were identified and grouped into clusters of orthologous categories. RstA promoted EHEC O157 LEE gene expression, adhesion in vitro, and  in vivo by indirect regulation. We also found that RstA could bind directly to the promoter region of  and  to enhance acid tolerance and decrease biofilm formation by modulating the concentration of c-di-GMP.In summary, the RstAB TCS in EHEC O157 plays a major role in the regulation of virulence, acid tolerance, and biofilm formation. We clarified the regulatory function of RstA, providing an insight into mechanisms that may be potential drug targets for treatment of EHEC O157-related infections.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646536>Calcium Regulation of Bacterial Virulence.</a></h1><p>Calcium (Ca) is a universal signaling ion, whose major informational role shaped the evolution of signaling pathways, enabling cellular communications and responsiveness to both the intracellular and extracellular environments. Elaborate Ca regulatory networks have been well characterized in eukaryotic cells, where Ca regulates a number of essential cellular processes, ranging from cell division, transport and motility, to apoptosis and pathogenesis. However, in bacteria, the knowledge on Ca signaling is still fragmentary. This is complicated by the large variability of environments that bacteria inhabit with diverse levels of Ca. Yet another complication arises when bacterial pathogens invade a host and become exposed to different levels of Ca that (1) are tightly regulated by the host, (2) control host defenses including immune responses to bacterial infections, and (3) become impaired during diseases. The invading pathogens evolved to recognize and respond to the host Ca, triggering the molecular mechanisms of adhesion, biofilm formation, host cellular damage, and host-defense resistance, processes enabling the development of persistent infections. In this review, we discuss: (1) Ca as a determinant of a host environment for invading bacterial pathogens, (2) the role of Ca in regulating main events of host  and bacterial virulence, and (3) the molecular mechanisms of Ca signaling in bacterial pathogens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636946>Infection in patchy populations: Contrasting pathogen invasion success and dispersal at varying times since host .</a></h1><p>Repeated extinction and recolonization events generate a landscape of host populations that vary in their time since . Within this dynamic landscape, pathogens that excel at invading recently colonized host populations are not necessarily those that perform best in host populations at or near their carrying capacity, potentially giving rise to divergent selection for pathogen traits that mediate the invasion process. Rarely, however, has this contention been empirically tested. Using , we explored how differences in the  history of a host population influence the invasion success of different genotypes of the pathogen . By partitioning the pathogen invasion process into a series of individual steps, we show that each pathogen optimizes invasion differently when encountering host populations that vary in their time since . All pathogen genotypes were more likely to establish successfully in recently colonized host populations, but the production of transmission spores was typically maximized in either the subsequent growth or stationary phase of host . Integrating across the first three pathogen invasion steps (initial establishment, proliferation, and secondary infection) revealed that overall pathogen invasion success (and its variance) was, nonetheless, highest in recently colonized host populations. However, only pathogens that were slow to kill their host were able to maximize host-facilitated dispersal. This suggests that only a subset of pathogen genotypes-the less virulent and more dispersive-are more likely to encounter newly colonized host populations at the front of a range expansion or in metapopulations with high extinction rates. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off for a pathogen between dispersal and virulence, and evidence for higher invasion success in younger host populations, a finding with clear implications for pathogen evolution in spatiotemporally dynamic settings.© 2019 The Author(s).

The nature of the vaginal microbiota is well-known; in contrast, the upper reproductive tract remains largely unexplored. Alteration in the uterine microbiota, which is dependent on the nutrients and hormones available to the uterus, is likely to play an important role in uterine-related diseases such as hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. Uterine mucosa is an important tissue barrier whose main function is to offer protection against pathogens and other toxic factors, while maintaining a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbes. These characteristics are shared by all the mucosal tissues; however, the uterine mucosa is unique since it changes cyclically during the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. The immune system, besides its role in the defense process, plays crucial roles in reproduction as it ensures local immune tolerance to fetal/paternal antigens, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. The human endometrium contains a conspicuous number of immune cells, mainly Natural Killers (NK) cells, which are phenotypically distinct from peripheral cytotoxic NK, cells and macrophages. The endometrium also contains few lymphoid aggregates comprising B cell and CD8 T cells. The number and the phenotype of these cells change during the menstrual cycle. It has become evident in recent years that the immune cell phenotype and function can be influenced by microbiota. Immune cells can sense the presence of microbes through their pattern recognition receptors, setting up host-microbe interaction. The microbiota exerts an appropriately controlled defense mechanism by competing for nutrients and mucosal space with pathogens. It has recently been considered that uterus is a non-sterile compartment since it seems to possess its own microbiota. There has been an increasing interest in characterizing the nature of microbial  within the uterus and its apparent impact on fertility and pregnancy. This review will examine the potential relationship between the uterine microbiota and the immune cells present in the local environment.Copyright © 2019 Agostinis, Mangogna, Bossi, Ricci, Kishore and Bulla.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666368>Genotypic characterization of LA-MRSA CC398 in pigsty visitors - Transient carriage or persistence?</a></h1><p>Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant  (LA-MRSA) of clonal complex (CC) 398 has become a rising issue for public health. While it is known that > 80% of pig farmers are colonized with LA-MRSA, only few studies assessed the situation for humans with occasional livestock contact. Recently it was shown that over 75% of scientific field workers visiting pigsties were temporarily carrying LA-MRSA.To find out whether they were transiently or permanently colonized, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to analyze the relatedness of isolates from these recurrently LA-MRSA-positive field workers and from corresponding pigsties. Sequences were analyzed using  typing (, cgMLST) and the BEAST software package was used to examine phylogeny.In total, 81 samples from three field workers on eight different pigsties over a period of 2.5 years were sequenced. All isolates belonged to  types t011, t034 or t2011 with different types found in the same field worker at different time points. Analysis of cgMLST revealed nine genotypic clusters, mostly correlating with the pigsty on which they were sampled. Field worker isolates clustered with the samples from farms that were visited on the same day. BEAST analysis corroborated the cgMLST-based clustering and suggests an origin of the lineage about 22 years ago.We conclude that nasal LA-MRSA  among humans with occasional livestock contact is common but most likely only temporary. Furthermore, we showed that the Western German LA-MRSA CC398 originated in the late 1990s and diversified into farm-specific genotypes, which stay relatively consistent over time.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691864>The added value of the selective SuperPolymyxin™ medium in detecting rectal carriage of Gram-negative bacteria with acquired colistin resistance in intensive care unit patients receiving selective digestive decontamination.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine the value of using SuperPolymyxin™ selective medium (ELITech Group, Puteaux, France) in addition to conventional non-selective inoculation methods in the detection of acquired colistin resistance in a Dutch intensive care unit (ICU) that routinely uses selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD). We performed a cross-sectional study with prospective data collection in a tertiary-care ICU. All consecutive surveillance rectal swabs of ICU-patients receiving SDD were included and cultured in an observer-blinded approach using (1) a conventional culture method using non-selective media and (2) SuperPolymyxin™ selective medium. MIC values for colistin of non-intrinsically colistin-resistant Gram-negative isolates were determined with broth microdilution (BMD) using Sensititre™ and colistin resistance was confirmed using BMD according to EUCAST guidelines. One thousand one hundred five rectal swabs of 428 unique ICU-patients were inoculated using both culture methods, yielding 346 and 84 Gram-negative isolates for BMD testing with the conventional method and SuperPolymyxin™ medium, of which 308 and 80 underwent BMD, respectively. The number of identified rectal carriers of isolates with acquired colistin resistance was 3 (0.7%) for the conventional method, 4 (0.9%) for SuperPolymyxin™, and 5 (1.2%) for both methods combined. The number of isolates with acquired colistin resistance was 4 (1.0%) for the conventional method, 8 (2.1%) for SuperPolymyxin™ and 9 (2.3%) for both methods combined. In a surveillance setting of low prevalence of acquired colistin resistance in patients that receive SDD in a Dutch tertiary-care ICU, SuperPolymyxin™ had a higher diagnostic yield than conventional inoculation methods, but the combination of both had the highest diagnostic yield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687974>Immune exclusion by naturally-acquired secretory IgA to the pneumococcal pilus-1.</a></h1><p>Successful infection by mucosal pathogens requires overcoming the mucus barrier. To better understand this key step, we performed a survey of the interactions between human respiratory mucus and the human pathogen S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal adherence to adult human nasal fluid was seen only by isolates expressing pilus-1. Robust binding was independent of pilus-1 adhesive properties but required Fab-dependent recognition of RrgB, the pilus shaft protein, by naturally-acquired secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Pilus-1 binding by specific sIgA led to bacterial agglutination, but adherence required interaction of agglutinated pneumococci and entrapment in mucus particles. To test the effect of these interactions in vivo, pneumococci were preincubated with human sIgA prior to intranasal challenge in a mouse model of . sIgA-treatment resulted in rapid immune exclusion of pilus-expressing pneumococci. Our findings predict that immune exclusion would select for non-piliated isolates in individuals who acquired RrgB-specific sIgA from prior episodes of  with piliated strains. Accordingly, genomic data comparing isolates carried by mothers and their children showed that mothers are less likely to be colonized with pilus-expressing strains. Our study provides a specific example of immune exclusion involving naturally-acquired antibody in the human host, a major factor driving pneumococcal adaptation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662046>. in Loggerhead Sea Turtles (): From  to Infection.</a></h1><p>With the aim of evaluating the presence of . in sea turtles with and without lesions and assessing the risk factors favoring  and/or infection, 74 loggerhead sea turtles () admitted to rescue and rehabilitation clinics in Italy were analyzed.

Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence. Homosexual behaviour may represent a risk factor for its transmission, while CD4 count and viremia didn't correlate with the presence of the protist. The pathogenetic role of Blastocystis remains unclear and no gut inflammation status was detected in Blastocystis-carriers. The only symptom associated with Blastocystis was the flatulence, evidencing a link between the presence of the protist and the composition and stability of gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637902>Influenza a virus and  coinfection potentially promotes bacterial  and enhances B lymphocyte depression and reduction.</a></h1><p>Influenza has frequently been epidemic in recent years. However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic B lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP  and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral immunity. Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP  and promote B lymphocyte-suppression and reduction. Eventually, the pneumonia worsened.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651305>Comparing methods to estimate incremental inpatient costs and length of stay due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Alberta, Canada.</a></h1><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic bacterial organism resistant to first line antibiotics. Acquisition of MRSA is often classified as either healthcare-associated or community-acquired. It has been shown that both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections contribute to the spread of MRSA within healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental inpatient cost and length of stay for individuals colonized or infected with MRSA. Common analytical methods were compared to ensure the quality of the estimate generated. This study was performed at Alberta Ministry of Health (Edmonton, Alberta), with access to clinical MRSA data collected at two Edmonton hospitals, and ministerial administrative data holdings.A retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA was identified using a provincial infection prevention and control database. A coarsened exact matching algorithm, and two regression models (semilogarithmic ordinary least squares model and log linked generalized linear model) were evaluated. A MRSA-free cohort from the same facilities and care units was identified for the matched method; all records were used for the regression models. Records span from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015, for individuals 18 or older at discharge.Of the models evaluated, the generalized linear model was found to perform the best. Based on this model, the incremental inpatient costs associated with hospital-acquired cases were the most costly at $31,686 (14,169 - 60,158) and $47,016 (23,125 - 86,332) for  and infection, respectively. Community-acquired MRSA cases also represent a significant burden, with incremental inpatient costs of $7397 (2924 - 13,180) and $14,847 (8445 - 23,207) for  and infection, respectively. All costs are adjusted to 2016 Canadian dollars. Incremental length of stay followed a similar pattern, where hospital-acquired infections had the longest incremental stays of 35.2 (16.3-69.5) days and community-acquired  had the shortest incremental stays of 3.0 (0.6-6.3) days.MRSA, and in particular, hospital-acquired MRSA, places a significant but preventable cost burden on the Alberta healthcare system. Estimates of cost and length of stay varied by the method of analysis and source of infection, highlighting the importance of selecting the most appropriate method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654686>Spray-drying of inhalable, multifunctional formulations for the treatment of biofilms formed in cystic fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious lung disease, commonly susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The dense mucus together with biofilm formation limit drug permeability and prevent the drug from reaching the site of action, causing treatment failure of the bacterial infection. Besides the use of antibiotics, the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is recommended to be co-administered in the treatment of CF. Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying. Azi/NAC and Tobra/NAC form co-amorphous salt systems that were physically stable under storage at stress conditions. For particle characterization, the obtained mass median aerodynamic diameters were in a suitable range for inhalation (< 5.0μm). The multifunctional antibiotic/NAC formulations conserved or improved the antibiotic susceptibility and showed promising results regarding the inhibition of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates  by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner. Consequently, local activation of cutaneous MAIT cells promotes wound healing. Together, our work uncovers a privileged interaction between defined members of the microbiota and MAIT cells, which sequentially controls both tissue-imprinting and subsequent responses to injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This process can promote the evolution of self-fertilization, but implicating historical processes as drivers of trait evolution is often difficult and requires an explicit model of biogeographic history. In plants, contemporary limits to outcrossing are often invoked as evolutionary drivers of self-fertilization, but historical expansions may shape mating system diversity, with leading-edge populations evolving elevated selfing ability. In a widespread plant, , we identified a glacial refugium in the southern Appalachian Mountains from spatial patterns of genetic drift among 24 populations. Populations farther from this refugium have smaller effective sizes and fewer rare alleles. They also displayed elevated heterosis in among-population crosses, reflecting the accumulation of deleterious mutations during range expansion. Although populations with elevated heterosis had reduced segregating mutation load, the magnitude of inbreeding depression lacked geographic pattern. The ability to self-fertilize was strongly positively correlated with the distance from the refugium and mutation accumulation-a pattern that contrasts sharply with contemporary mate and pollinator limitation. In this and other species, diversity in sexual systems may reflect the legacy of evolution in small, colonizing populations, with little or no relation to the ecology of modern populations.© 2019 The Author(s).

Tip growth relies on a tight coordination between the protoplast growth and the synthesis/remodeling of the external cell wall. In root hairs and pollen tubes of the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana, cell wall integrity (CWI) mechanisms monitor this coordination through the Malectin-like receptor kinases (MLRs), such as AtANXUR1 and AtFERONIA, that act upstream of the AtMARIS PTI1-like kinase. Here, we show that rhizoid growth in the early diverging plant, Marchantia polymorpha, is also controlled by an MLR and PTI1-like signaling module. Rhizoids, root hairs, and pollen tubes respond similarly to disruption of MLR and PTI1-like encoding genes. Thus, the MLR and PTI1-like signaling module that controls CWI during tip growth is conserved between M. polymorpha and A. thaliana, suggesting that it was active in the common ancestor of land plants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal microbiota, the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut , facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic.

Genotype SOD2 was observed only in  pneumonia patients while the genotype SOD1 was observed in both colonized and  pneumonia patients.  This study provides epidemiological information about SOD genotypes distribution in Spain, showing a low genetic diversity and a predominant presence of genotype SOD1 in colonized patients. SOP Nested PCR was more sensitive and accurate assay in  pneumonia patients than in colonized individuals.Copyright © 2019 Morilla, González-Magaña, Friaza, de Armas, Medrano, Calderón and de la Horra.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689800>Risk factors of invasive candidiasis in critical cancer patients after various gastrointestinal surgeries: A 4-year retrospective study.</a></h1><p>For early diagnosis and treatment of invasive candidiasis (IC), the well-known risk factors may not apply in the intensive care unit (ICU). This retrospective study identified the risk factors predicting IC and candidemia in cancer patients under intensive care after gastrointestinal surgery.Enrolled were 229 cancer patients admitted to our oncology surgical ICU after gastrointestinal surgery between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2014.The most common types of solid gastrointestinal cancers were gastric (49.8%), colon (20.1%), and esophageal (18.3%). The percentage of patients with corrected Candida  index (CCI) ≥0.4 was 31.9%. IC was confirmed in 19 patients (8.3%), and the ICU mortality was 15.8%. Candida albicans accounted for 52.6% of the total number of pathogenic Candida isolates. Among patients with CCI ≥0.4, the cancers with the highest prevalence were cardiac (45%) and gastric (36%), with ICU mortalities of 20% and 4.9%, respectively. For the diagnosis of candidemia, (1-3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) ≥80 pg/mL showed a sensitivity and specificity of 25% and 82.7%, respectively, positive and negative predictive values 6.7% and 95.7%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.512. CCI ≥0.4 was the only significant predictor of IC, and number of organ failures was the only predictor of candidemia (P = .000 and .026).CCI ≥0.4 was the only significant risk factor predicting IC, with greater prediction of intra-abdominal candidiasis but failure to predict candidemia. Blood culture and BDG detection are recommended to supplement diagnosis. Patients may have multifocal and high-grade Candida  after cardiac surgery, and; therefore, are at high risk of IC, which should be taken seriously.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649239>Severe head dysgenesis resulting from imbalance between anterior and posterior ontogenetic programs.</a></h1><p>Head dysgenesis is a major cause of fetal demise and craniofacial malformation. Although mutations in genes of the head ontogenetic program have been reported, many cases remain unexplained. Head dysgenesis has also been related to trisomy or amplification of the chromosomal region overlapping the CDX2 homeobox gene, a master element of the trunk ontogenetic program. Hence, we investigated the repercussion on head morphogenesis of the imbalance between the head and trunk ontogenetic programs, by means of ectopic rostral expression of CDX2 at gastrulation. This caused severe malformations affecting the forebrain and optic structures, and also the frontonasal process associated with defects in neural crest cells . These malformations are the result of the downregulation of genes of the head program together with the abnormal induction of trunk program genes. Together, these data indicate that the imbalance between the anterior and posterior ontogenetic programs in embryos is a new possible cause of head dysgenesis during human development, linked to defects in setting up anterior neuroectodermal structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694931>Capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 3 is required for tumor metastasis.</a></h1><p>Metastasis accounts for 90% of deaths caused by solid tumors. But the multitude of mecha-nisms underlying tumor metastasis remains poorly understood. CARMIL1 and 2 proteins are capping protein (CP) interactants and multidomain regulators of actin-based mobility. However, CARMIL3's function has not been explored. Through bioinformatic metadata analysis we find that high CARMIL3 expression correlates with poor survival of breast and prostate cancer patients. Functional studies in murine and xenograft tumor models by targeted diminution of CARMIL3 expression or forced expression demonstrate that CARMIL3 is vitally important for tumor metastasis, especially for metastatic . Consistent with a predominantly cell-intrinsic mode of action, CARMIL3 is also crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometric analyses identifies a group of CARMIL3-interacting proteins, including capping protein, that are involved in actin cytoskeletal organization, which is required for cell polarization and focal adhesion formation. Moreover, molecular pathway enrichment analysis reveals that lack of CARMIL3 leads to loss of cell adhesions and low CARMIL3 expression in breast cancer patient specimens is implicated in epithelial mesenchymal transition. We also find that CARMIL3 sustains adherens junction between tumor cells. This is accomplished by CARMIL3 maintaining E-cadherin transcription downstream of HDACs through inhibiting ZEB2 protein level, also via protecting β-catenin from ubiquitination-mediated degradation initiated by the destruction complex. Implications: The study uncovers CARMIL3 as a novel and critical regulator of metastatic progression of cancers and suggests therapeutic potentials to target CARMIL3.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696317>Evolutionary convergence or homology? Comparative cytogenomics of Caesalpinia group species (Leguminosae) reveals diversification in the pericentromeric heterochromatic composition.</a></h1><p>We demonstrated by cytogenomic analysis that the proximal heterochromatin of the Northeast Brazilian species of Caesalpinia group is enriched with phylogenetically conserved Ty3/Gypsy-Tekay RT, but diverge in the presence of Ty3/Gypsy-Athila RT and satDNA. The Caesalpinia Group includes 225 species and 27 monophyletic genera of which four occur in Northeastern Brazil: Erythrostemon (1 sp.), Cenostigma (7 spp.), Libidibia (1 sp.), and Paubrasilia (1 sp.). The last three genera are placed in different clades in the Caesalpinia Group phylogeny, and yet they are characterized by having a numerically stable karyotype 2n = 24 (16 M+8A) and GC-rich heterochromatic bands (chromomycin A positive/CMA bands) in the proximal chromosome regions. To characterize the composition of their heterochromatin and test for the homology of these chromosomal regions, genomic DNA was extracted from Cenostigma microphyllum, Libidibia ferrea, and Paubrasilia echinata, and sequenced at low coverage using the Illumina platform. The genomic repetitive fractions were characterized using a Galaxy/RepeatExplorer-Elixir platform. The most abundant elements of each genome were chromosomally located by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and compared to the CMA heterochromatin distribution. The repetitive fraction of the genomes of C. microphyllum, L. ferrea, and P. echinata were estimated to be 41.70%, 38.44%, and 72.51%, respectively. Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons (RT), specifically the Tekay lineage, were the most abundant repeats in each of the three genomes. FISH mapping revealed species-specific patterns for the Tekay elements in the proximal regions of the chromosomes, co-localized with CMA bands. Other species-specific patterns were observed, e.g., for the Ty3/Gypsy RT Athila elements which were found in all the proximal heterochromatin of L. ferrea or restricted to the acrocentric chromosomes of C. microphyllum. This Athila labeling co-localized with satellite DNAs (satDNAs). Although the Caesalpinia Group diverged around 55 Mya, our results suggest an ancestral  of Tekay RT in the proximal heterochromatin. Thus, the present-day composition of the pericentromeric heterochromatin in these Northeast Brazilian species is a combination of the maintenance of an ancestral Tekay distribution with a species-specific accumulation of other repeats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666782>Nasal and Hand Carriage Rate of  among Food Handlers Working in Jimma Town, Southwest Ethiopia.</a></h1><p>Food handlers have been recognized to play a major role in the transmission of food borne diseases, contributing significantly to the global incidence and burden of the diseases. This study, therefore, aimed to assess the nasal and hand carriage of Staphylococcus aureus among food handlers in Jimma Town.A community based cross sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017. Swab specimens from nasopharyngeal and hands of food handlers working in food establishments were collected for isolation and identification of S. aureus using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was done using disc diffusion method. Associations of selected variables for S. aureus  were determined using SPSS version 20 with p ≤ 0.05 taken as statistically significant.Among the 300 food handlers working in hotels and restaurants in Jimma Town, 86(28.7%) were colonized by S. aureus. The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from nose, hand and both parts (nose and hand) were 27(9%), 34(11.3%) and 25(8.3%), respectively. There was strong association (P=0.00336) between carriage rate of S. aureus and food handlers' job category. The majority (90.7%) of the isolates were resistant to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Increased levels of sensitivity were observed against Ciprofloxacin (96.5%), Cefoxitin (95.3%) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (94.2%).This study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus carriers among food handlers and high antibacterial resistance towards commonly prescribed drugs, justifying the screening of food handlers to detect and treat carriers and protect restaurant customers from staphylococcal food poisoning.© 2019 Getenet Beyene, et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652382>The effects of diadromy and its loss on genomic divergence: the case of amphidromous Galaxias maculatus populations.</a></h1><p>Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that affect the genetic divergence between diadromous and resident populations across heterogeneous environments is a challenging task. While diadromy may promote gene flow leading to a lack of genetic differentiation among populations, resident populations tend to be affected by local adaptation and/or plasticity. Studies on these effects on genomic divergence in non-model amphidromous species are scarce. Galaxias maculatus, one of the most widespread fish species in the Southern Hemisphere, exhibits two life histories, an ancestral diadromous, specifically, amphidromous form and a derived freshwater resident form. We examined the genetic diversity and divergence among 20 estuarine and resident populations across the Chilean distribution of G. maculatus and assessed the extent to which selection is involved in the differentiation among resident populations. We obtained nearly 4400 SNP markers using a RADcap approach for 224 individuals. As expected, collections from estuarine locations typically consist of diadromous individuals. Diadromous populations are highly differentiated from their resident counterparts by both neutral and putative adaptive markers. While diadromous populations exhibit high gene flow and lack site fidelity, resident populations appear to be the product of different  events with relatively low genetic diversity and varying levels of gene flow. In particular, the northernmost resident populations were clearly genetically distinct and reproductively isolated from each other suggesting local adaptation. Our study provides insights into the role of life history differences in the maintenance of genetic diversity and the importance of genetic divergence in species evolution.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634039>Genome-wide associations and transcriptional profiling reveal ROS regulation as one underlying mechanism of sheath blight resistance in rice.</a></h1><p>Rice sheath blight, caused by the necrotrophic fungus  Kühn continues to be an important and challenging rice disease worldwide. Here we used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) over a high-density rice array to facilitate the identification of potential novel genes and quantitative trait loci related to sheath blight resistance. We identified multiple regions that significantly associated with independent disease components in chromosomes 1, 4, and 11 under controlled condition. In particular, we investigated , a quantitative trait loci enriched with defense-related genes that reduce disease lesion in a near-isogenic line. RNA profiling of the line carrying  showed a number of differentially expressed genes related to ROS-redox pathway.

However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal  are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the microbiota. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the tissue-specific rules governing the dialogue between a host and its microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671613>Biological Control of Alternaria Leaf Spot Caused by  spp. in Jerusalem Artichoke ( L.) under Two Fertilization Regimes.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of integrating resistant genotypes of Jerusalem artichoke with  isolate T9 to control Alternaria leaf spot caused by  spp. under two fertilization regimes and to determine whether T9 application induced chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activity in Jerusalem artichoke leaves. Six Jerusalem artichoke varieties (resistant varieties JA15, JA86, and JA116 and susceptible varieties HEL246, HEL293, and JA109) and three disease control methods (a non-inoculated control, application of  T9, and fungicide sprays (propiconazole at a rate of 30 mL/20 L of water, 375 ppm)) was conducted in two separate trials (different fertilization regimes) at the experimental farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Resistant genotypes controlled Alternaria leaf spot effectively. Application of  showed low efficacy to control Alternaria leaf spot, but in specific susceptible genotypes-HEL246 and HEL293-the application of  could reduce disease severity up to 10%. The application of  was associated with a rise in production of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase in HEL246 seedlings. The number of  propagules in soil, as well as the extent of  of roots and leaves, were monitored. The results indicated that application of  had higher propagules than non-inoculated control.

The influence of starvation-associated stress on the behavior of non-toxin-producing strains of  serotype O157:H7 and serotypes O26, O103, O111, and O145 was examined subsequent to their introduction to the phyllosphere of field-grown romaine lettuce as inocula simulating starved (96 h in sterile deionized water) and nutrient-depleted (24 h broth culture) cells. As with  O157:H7, leaf populations of the non-O157 strains declined rapidly during the first 72 h postinoculation, displaying the biphasic decay curve typical of serotype O157:H7 isolates. Preinoculation treatment appeared not to influence decay rates greatly ( > 0.5), but strain-specific differences (persistence period and attachment proficiency) indicated that serotype O103:H2 strain PARC445 was a better survivor. Also assessed was the impact of preinoculation treatment on phenotypes key to leaf  and survival and the expression of starvation stress-associated genes. The 96-h starvation period enhanced biofilm formation in one strain but reduced motility and autoinducer 2 formation in all five study strains relative to those characteristics in stationary-phase cells. Transcription of  and  was reduced significantly ( < 0.05) in starvation-stressed cells relative to that for exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. Strain-specific differences were observed; serotype O103:H2 PARC445 had greater downturns than did serotype O157:H7 and other non-O157 strains. Within this particular cohort, the behavior of the representative serotype O157:H7 strain, PARC443 (ATCC 700728), was not predictive of behavior of non-O157 members of this STEC group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675110>Genotype-specific effects of ericoid mycorrhizae on floral traits and reproduction in Vaccinium corymbosum.</a></h1><p>Most plants interact with mycorrhizal fungi and animal pollinators simultaneously. Yet, whether mycorrhizae affect traits important to pollination remains poorly understood and may depend on the match between host and fungal genotypes. Here, we examined how ericoid mycorrhizal fungi affected flowering phenology, floral traits, and reproductive success, among eight genotypes of highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum (Ericaceae). We asked three overarching questions: (1) Do genotypes differ in response to inoculation? (2) How does inoculation affect floral and flowering traits? (3) Are inoculated plants more attractive to pollinators and less pollen limited than non-inoculated plants of the same genotype?To examine these questions, we experimentally inoculated plants with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, grew the plants in the field, and measured flowering and floral traits over 2 years. In year 2, we conducted a hand-pollination experiment to test whether plants differed in pollen limitation.Inoculated plants had significantly higher levels of  for some genotypes, and there were significant floral trait changes in inoculated plants for some genotypes as well. On average, inoculated plants produced significantly larger floral displays, more fruits per inflorescence, and heavier fruits with lower sugar content, than non-inoculated, control plants. Hand pollination enhanced the production of fruits, and fruit mass, for non-inoculated plants but not for those that were inoculated.Our results demonstrate that inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced flowering and altered investment in reproduction in genotype-specific ways. These findings underscore the importance of examining belowground symbionts and genotype-specific responses in their hosts to fully understand the drivers of aboveground interactions.© 2019 The Authors.

We determined nasal carriage of S. aureus in patients undergoing MHS by comparing the yield of a conventional culture with that of a rapid molecular test (Xpert® SA Nasal Complete, Cepheid).From July 2015 to April 2017, all patients who were to undergo MHS were invited to participate in the study. We obtained two nasal cultures from each patient just before entering the operating room, independently of a previous test for the determination of nasal  by this microorganism performed before surgery. One swab was used for conventional culture in the microbiology laboratory, and the other was used for the rapid molecular test. We defined nasal  as the presence of a positive culture for S. aureus using either of the two techniques. All patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death.Overall, 57 out of 200 patients (28.5%) were colonized by S. aureus at the time of surgery. Thirty-three patients had both conventional culture- and PCR-positive results. Twenty-four patients had a negative culture and a positive PCR test. Only twenty-one percent (12/57) of colonized patients had undergone an attempt to decolonise before the surgical intervention.A significant proportion of patients undergoing MHS are colonized by S. aureus in the nostrils on entering the operating room. New strategies to prevent SSI by this microorganism are needed. Rapid molecular tests immediately before MHS, followed by immediate decolonisation, must be evaluated.

Antibiotic resistant infections disproportionately affect those with immunocompromising conditions, chronic , and frequent antibiotic use such as transplant patients or those with cystic fibrosis. However, clinicians lack the diagnostic tools to confidently diagnose and treat infections, leading to widespread use of empiric broad spectrum antimicrobials, often for prolonged duration.A 22 year-old Caucasian female with cystic fibrosis received a bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation 5 months prior to the index hospitalization. She underwent routine surveillance bronchoscopy and was admitted for post-procedure fever. A clear cause of infection was not identified by routine methods. Imaging and bronchoscopic lung biopsy did not identify an infectious agent or rejection. She was treated with a prolonged course of antimicrobials targeting known colonizing organisms from prior bronchoalveolar lavage cultures (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus). However, we identified Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in two independent whole blood samples using direct-pathogen sequencing, which was not identified by other methods.This case represents a common clinical conundrum: identification of infection in a high-risk, complex patient. Here, direct-pathogen sequencing identified a pathogen that would not otherwise have been identified by common techniques. Had results been clinically available, treatment could have been customized, avoiding a prolonged course of broad spectrum antimicrobials that would only exacerbate resistance. Direct-pathogen sequencing is poised to fill a diagnostic gap for pathogen identification, allowing early identification and customization of treatment in a culture-independent, pathogen-agnostic manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682611>Mycobacterium abscessus infection in the stomach of patients with various gastric symptoms.</a></h1><p>Development of gastric diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is often associated with several biotic and abiotic factors. Helicobacter pylori infection is such a well-known biotic factor. However, not all H. pylori-infected individuals develop gastric diseases and not all individuals with gastric diseases are infected with H. pylori. Therefore, it is possible that other gastric bacteria may contribute to the formation and progression of gastric disease. The aim of this study was to isolate prevalent gastric bacteria under microaerobic condition and identify them by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Analysis of gastric biopsies showed infection of Mycobacterium abscessus (phylum Actinobacteria) to be highly prevalent in the stomachs of subjects included. Our data show that of 129 (67 male and 62 female) patients with gastric symptoms, 96 (51 male and 45 female) showed the presence of M. abscessus in stomach tissues. Infection of M. abscessus in gastric epithelium was further confirmed by imaging with acid fast staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Our imaging data strongly suggested that M. abscessus is an intracellular colonizer residing inside the gastric epithelial cells rather than in macrophages. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the mycobacterial hsp65 gene showed that the nearest match to the M. abscessus strains isolated from our study subjects is the M. abscessus strain ATCC 19977. Surprisingly, the subjects studied, the prevalence of M. abscessus infection in stomach is even higher than the prevalence of H. pylori infection. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study showing the  of M. abscessus in human gastric mucosa among patients with various gastric symptoms. This study could provide usher in a new opportunity to understand the role of less studied gastric bacteria in the development of gastric diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669358>Hfq modulates global protein pattern and stress response in Bordetella pertussis.</a></h1><p>B. pertussis is the etiological agent of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease which remains uncontrolled worldwide. Understanding how this pathogen responds to the environmental changes and adapts to different niches found inside the host might contribute to gain insight into bacterial pathogenesis. Comparative analyses of previous transcriptomic and proteomic data suggested that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms modulate B. pertussis virulence in response to iron availability. Iron scarcity represents one of the major stresses faced by bacterial pathogens inside the host. In this study, we used gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS-based proteomics to investigate whether Hfq, a highly conserved post-transcriptional regulatory protein, is involved in B. pertussis adaptation to low iron environment. To this end, we compared the protein profiles of wild type B. pertussis and its isogenic hfq deletion mutant strain under iron-replete and iron-depleted conditions. Almost of 33% of the proteins identified under iron starvation was found to be Hfq-dependent. Among them, proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance and virulence factors that play a key role in the early steps of host  and bacterial persistence inside the host cells. Altogether these results suggest that Hfq shapes the infective phenotype of B. pertussis. SIGNIFICANCE: In the last years, it became evident that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in ba cteria plays a central role in host-pathogen interactions. Hfq is a bacterial protein that regulates gene expression at post-transcriptional level found pivotal in the establishment of successful infections. In this study, we investigated the role of Hfq in Bordetella pertussis response to iron starvation, one of the main stresses imposed by the host. The data demonstrate that Hfq regulates the abundance of a significant number of B. pertussis proteins in response to iron starvation. Among them, virulence factors and proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance, key players in host  and intracellular bacterial survival. Altogether, our results suggest a relevant role of Hfq in B. pertussis adaptation to the different niches found inside the host eventually granting bacterial pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

UMB exhibited significant antibiofilm activity (83%) at 500 μg/ml concentration without growth alteration.

Furthermore, real time PCR analysis revealed the reduced expression of adhesion encoding genes (, and ). Down regulation of  and reduced production of secreted hydrolases upon UMB treatment were speculated to hinder invasive lifestyle of MRSE. Additionally, UMB hindered slime synthesis and biofilm matrix components, which were believed to augment antibiotic susceptibility.  assays using  divulged the non-toxic nature of UMB and validated the antibiofilm, antivirulence, and antiadherence properties of UMB observed in  assays. Thus, UMB impairs MRSE biofilm by turning down the initial attachment and intercellular adhesion.

The larvae affected by fungi are characterized by a decrease in PO and dopamine levels. In the initial stages of toxicosis and/or fungal infection (12 h posttreatment), increases in the activity of insect detoxifying enzymes (GST and EST) and acid proteases are observed after monotreatments, and these increases are suppressed after combined treatment with the fungus and avermectins.

Aethionema arabicum (Brassicaceae) is a dimorphic annual species that is hypothesized to survive stressful conditions during  due to adaptive plasticity in life-phase (vegetative vs sexual) and fruit morph (dehiscent [DEH] vs indehiscent fruits [IND]). We tested for adaptive plasticity in life-phase and fruit morphs along laboratory environmental stress gradients found in the natural habitats of Ae. arabicum. We considered optimal environmental conditions (750-2000 m above sea level) to be those that resulted in the following fitness parameters: higher biomass and a higher total number of fruits compared to stressful habitats. We found evidence of plasticity in life-phase and fruit-morph along a stressful environmental gradient. High hydrothermal stress proportionally increased the number of dehiscent morphs and non-dormant seeds germinating in autumn. This offsets natural phenology towards dry and cold winter (less hydrothermal stress), yielding fewer fruits that dehisce in the next generation. We conclude that the plastic responses of Ae. arabicum to natural stress gradients constitute a strategy of long-term adaptive benefits and favouring potential pathways of colonisation of the optimal habitat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697131>Emergence of a transnational LGBTI psychology: Commonalities and challenges in advocacy and activism.</a></h1><p>This contribution explores the historical developments of transnational lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) psychology in Colombia, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa in relationship to U.S. LGBT psychology. LGBTI psychology in these diverse contexts share commonalities but also have important variations in their development and focus within LGBTI concerns.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root  with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

This exquisite level of adaptation requires a robust modulation of their physiological and metabolic features. Additionally, virulence determinants, which include host invasion,  and survival despite the host's immune responses and antimicrobial therapy, must be optimally orchestrated by the pathogen at all times during infection. This can only be achieved by tight coordination of gene expression. A large body of evidence implicate the prolific roles played by bacterial regulatory RNAs in mediating gene expression both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

Over-expression or knockdown of MSLN has been implicated in PDAC aggressiveness. This activity has been ascribed to MSLN-induced activation of MAPK or NF-κB signaling pathways and to interaction of MSLN with its only known binding partner, MUC16. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to delete MSLN from PDAC, then restored expression of wild-type (WT) or Y318A mutant MSLN by viral transduction. We found that MSLN KO cells grew in culture and as subcutaneous tumors in mouse xenografts at the same rate as WT cells but formed intraperitoneal (IP) metastases poorly. Complementation with WT MSLN restored IP growth, while complementation with Y318A mutant MSLN, which does not bind MUC16, was ineffective at enhancing growth in both MUC16(+) and MUC16(-) models. Restoration of WT MSLN did enhance growth but did not affect cell-to-cell binding, cell viability in suspension or signaling pathways previously identified as contributing to the pro-tumorigenic effect of MSLN. RNA deep sequencing of tumor cells identified no changes in transcriptional profile that could explain the observed phenotype. Further, no histologic changes in tumor cell proliferation or morphology were observed in mature tumors. Examination of nascent MSLN KO tumors revealed decreased microvascular density as IP tumors were forming, followed by decreased proliferation, which resolved by 2 weeks post-implantation. These data support a model whereby MSLN expression by tumor cells contributes to metastatic . Implications: MSLN confers a growth advantage to tumor cells during  of peritoneal metastasis.

In the moss, Physcomitrella patens, a 3D leafy gametophore originates from filamentous cells that grow in a two-dimensional (2D) plane through a series of asymmetric cell divisions. Asymmetric cell divisions that coincide with different cell division planes and growth directions enable the developmental switch from 2D to 3D, but insights into the underlying mechanisms coordinating this switch are still incomplete. Using 2D-, 3D-imaging and image segmentation, we characterized two geometric cues, the width of the initial cell and the angle of the transition division plane, which sufficiently distinguished a gametophore initial cell from a branch initial cell. These identified cues were further confirmed in gametophore formation mutants. The identification of a fluorescent marker allowed us to successfully predict the gametophore initial cell with more than 90% accuracy before morphological changes, supporting our hypothesis that, before the transition division, parental cells of the gametophore initials possess different properties compared to branch initials. Our results suggest that the cell fate decision of the initial cell is determined in the parental cell, prior to the transition division.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695684>A  Model for Determining Infectivity of Zoonotic .</a></h1><p>To better understand public health implications of waterfowl as reservoirs for zoonotic sources of  in recreational waters, we developed a  (chick) model of infection to assess the pathogenicity of environmental isolates of .

Patients aged 18 years or older who had been using an endotracheal tube for 48 hours were recruited. Tracheal secretions were collected; after extubation, the ETs were cut into two fragments in the infra-cuff region. One of these fragments was placed in a solution containing antibiotics and sent to the lab for culture and identification of yeasts. The remaining fragment was fixed and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In total, 20 patients with an average age of 73.3 years (± 13.1) participated in this study. These patients remained under endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation for an average of 6.4 (± 1.8) and 13.5 days (± 15), respectively. Of these patients, 45 % showed respiratory tract  by yeasts of the  genus, with  being the most frequently isolated species (66.7 %).

LEAF is most commonly non-infectious in origin and associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines.The LIFECODES pregnancy cohort was designed to prospectively collect data to evaluate the association of maternal inflammatory biomarkers with preterm birth in women who delivered between 2007 and 2008 at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Our secondary analysis of the data from the cohort identified 182 women for whom inflammatory biomarkers (i.e. interleukin-10, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and C-reactive protein) collected longitudinally over four prenatal visits was available. Maternal temperature and other clinical variables were abstracted from medical records. The primary outcome, the presence of LEAF, was defined as oral temperature ≥ 38°C (≥100.4°F) after epidural analgesia initiation. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between inflammatory biomarker concentrations and the odds of developing an intrapartum fever after adjusting for a number of potential confounders.Women who developed LEAF were more likely to have a longer duration of epidural analgesia, whereas women who did not develop LEAF were more likely to have induced labor and positive or unknown Group B Streptococcus  status.

From the biological and botanical perspectives, the interaction between microorganisms and perennial woody plants falls within the category of stable relationships from which the plants can benefit in multiple ways. The life cycle of the host ensures persistence in all seasons, repeated chances of contact, and consequent microbiota accumulation over time, leading to potentially high diversity compared with that of herbaceous short-lived plants. Furthermore, grapevines are agriculturally exploited, highly selected germplasms where a profound man-driven footprint has indirectly and unconsciously shaped the inner microbiota through centuries of cultivation and breeding. Moreover, since endophyte metabolism can contribute to that of the plant host and its fruits' biochemical composition, the nature of grapevine endophytic taxa identities, ecological attitudes, potential toxicity, and clinical relevance are aspects worthy of a thorough investigation. Can endophytic taxa efficiently defend grapevines by acting against pests or confer enough fitness to the plants to endure attacks? What are the underlying mechanisms that translate into this or other advantages in the hosting plant? Can endophytes partially redirect plant metabolism, and to what extent do they act by releasing active products? Is the inner microbial  necessary priming for a cascade of actions? Are there defined environmental conditions that can trigger the unleashing of key microbial phenotypes? What is the environmental role in providing the ground biodiversity by which the plant can recruit microsymbionts?

Relative to wild type, the selected complex I, II, and III mutants showed decreased total respiration, increased alternative respiration, as well as increased redox charge of the NADP(H) pool and decreased redox charge of the NAD(H) pool in the dark. In the light, mETC mutants accumulated free amino acids, albeit to varying degrees. Glycine and serine, which are involved in carbon recycling from photorespiration, and N-rich amino acids were predominantly increased in mETC mutants compared to the wild type. Taking together the physiological phenotypes of all examined mutants, our results suggest a connection between the limitation in the re-oxidation of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial matrix and the induction of nitrate assimilation into free amino acids in the cytosol, which seems to be engaged as an additional sink for reducing power. The  mutant was less susceptible to  and did not show hampered salicylic acid (SA) accumulation as previously reported for  knock-down plants. The ROS burst remained unaffected in , emonstrating that subunit SDH2 is not involved in the control of ROS production and SA signaling by complex II. Moreover, the  mutant showed only 20% of   compared to wild type, with the ROS burst and the production of callose papillae being significantly increased compared to wild type.

Given the significant impact that gut microbes have on our health, it is essential to identify key host and environmental factors that shape this diverse community. While many studies have highlighted the impact of diet on gut microbiota, little is known about how the host regulates this critical diet-microbiota interaction. In our present study, we discovered that gut IgA targeted a protein complex involved in the utilization of an important dietary polysaccharide: fructan. While the presence of dietary fructans was previously thought to allow unrestricted growth of fructan-utilizing bacteria, our work shows that gut IgA, by targeting proteins responsible for fructan utilization, provides the host with tools that can restrict the microbial utilization of such polysaccharides, thereby controlling their growth.Copyright © 2019 Joglekar et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689331>High salinity tolerance of invasive blue catfish suggests potential for further range expansion in the Chesapeake Bay region.</a></h1><p>In estuaries, salinity is believed to limit the  of brackish water habitats by freshwater species. Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus, recognized as a freshwater species, is an invasive species in tidal rivers of the Chesapeake Bay. Salinity tolerance of this species, though likely to determine its potential range expansion and dispersal in estuarine habitats, is not well-known. To address this issue, we subjected blue catfish to a short-term salinity tolerance experiment and found that this species tolerates salinities higher than most freshwater fishes and that larger blue catfish tolerate elevated salinities for longer periods compared with smaller individuals. Our results are supported by spatially extensive, long-term fisheries surveys in the Chesapeake Bay region, which revealed a gradual (1975-2017) down-estuary range expansion of blue catfish from tidal freshwater areas to habitats exceeding 10 psu [practical salinity units] and that large blue catfish (> 200 mm fork length) occur in salinities greater than 10 psu in Chesapeake Bay tributaries.

Here we identify a potential mechanism for stent discoloration, characterize potential changes in stent surface characteristics, and their impact on encrustation and bacterial .Twenty (20) Polaris Ultra and 20 Percuflex Plus stents (same polymer material) with varying degrees of discolouration were collected from Japanese and Canadian patients. Surface characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted. Encrustation of variably discolored stents was assessed via Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and bacterial adhesion to discolored and control stents via Colony forming Unit counts.Bismuth subcarbonate was found in control stents and discoloration was induced via incubation in 1% sodium sulfide and increasing concentrations of HCl to produce H2S. Discoloration of either patient-derived stents or in vitro discolored stents did not result in significant changes in stent material or increased rates of encrustation or bacterial adhesion.Ureteral stent discoloration may be triggered by sulfur containing urinary components reacting with bismuth subcarbonate in the stent material, rather than the surface deposition of unusual crystals as previously proposed. Stent discoloration does not result in increased levels of encrustation or bacterial adhesion.

However, we lack a framework that adequately captures how these strategies vary among species. Observations from around the world now allow us to quantify the variation observed in commonly-measured fine-root traits but it is unclear how root traits are interrelated and whether they fall along an "economic" spectrum of acquisitive to conservative strategies. We assessed root trait variation and mycorrhizal  rates by leveraging the largest global database of fine-root traits (the Fine-Root Ecology Database; FRED). We also developed a heuristic model to explore the role of mycorrhizal fungi in defining belowground exploration efficiency across a gradient of thin- to thick-diameter roots. In support of the expectations of the "root economic spectrum," we found that root diameter was negatively related to specific root length (Pearson's =-0.76). However, we found an unexpected negative relationship between root diameter and root tissue density (Pearson's  = -0.40), and we further observed that root nitrogen content was largely unrelated to other economic traits. Mycorrhizal  was most closely associated with root diameter (Pearson's  = 0.62) and was unrelated to root tissue density and root nitrogen. The heuristic model demonstrated that while thinner roots have inherently greater capacity to encounter soil resources based on higher surface area per unit mass, the potential for increased associations with mycorrhizal fungi in thicker roots, combined with greater hyphal growth, can result in equally acquisitive strategies for both thin- and thick roots. Taken together, our assessments of root trait variation, trade-offs with mycorrhizal fungi, and broader connections to root longevity allowed us to propose a series of fundamental constraints on belowground resource acquisition strategies. Physical tradeoffs based on root construction (i.e., economic traits) and functional limitations related to the capacity of a root to encounter and acquire soil resources combine to limit the two-dimensional belowground trait space. Within this trait space there remains a diversity of additional variation in root traits that facilitates a wide range of belowground resource acquisition strategies.Copyright © 2019 McCormack and Iversen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644974>Covalent grafting of titanium with a cathelicidin peptide produces an osteoblast compatible surface with antistaphylococcal activity.</a></h1><p>Bacterial infection of orthopaedic implants, often caused by Staphylococcus species, may ultimately lead to implant failure. The development of infection-resistant, osteoblast-compatible biomaterials could represent an effective strategy to prevent bacterial  of implants, reducing the need for antibiotics. In this study, the widely used biomaterial titanium was functionalized with BMAP27(1-18), an α-helical cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide that retains potent staphylocidal activity when immobilized on agarose beads. A derivative bearing a short spacer with a free thiol at the N-terminus was coupled to silanized titanium disks via thiol-maleimide chemistry. Tethering was successful, as assessed by Contact angle, Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), with an average surface mass density of 456 ng/cm and a layer thickness of 3 nm. The functionalized titanium displayed antimicrobial properties against a reference strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis with well-known biofilm forming capability. Reduction of bacterial counts and morphological alterations of adhering bacteria, upon 2 h incubation, indicate a rapid contact-killing effect. The immobilized peptide was not toxic to osteoblasts, which adhered and spread better on functionalized titanium when co-cultured with bacteria, compared to non-coated surfaces. Results suggest that functionalization of titanium with BMAP27(1-18) could be promising for prevention of bacterial  in bone graft applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Group 1 was defined as the control group and group 2 was defined as the infected control group. Groups 3 and 4 were defined as Dacron grafted and MRSE infected groups, treated with tigecycline and MSCs, respectively. Groups 5 and 6 were performed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and infected with MRSE. These groups were also administered tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Groups 7 and 8 were infected with MRSE without graft administration and were also performed tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Grafts and soft tissue specimens were collected at 13 days postoperatively. Colony counts of peri-graft tissue were performed. All samples were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the markers that determine stem cell activity.The overall success of the treatments was assessed by the number of rats with MRSE recurrence, regardless of graft used. The difference between the untreated group 2, tigecycline groups (3, 5 and 7) and MSCs groups (4, 6 and 8) were statistically significant. Success of MSC and tigecycline treatments was similar in Dacron, PTFE, and non-grafted groups. There was a resistance of MRSE infection in Dacron groups to MSC and tigecycline treatments. This was considered to be indicative of the susceptibility of the Dacron grafts to infection. However, there was no significant difference between group 2 and Dacron groups in terms of bacterial . ELISA results were significant in three cytokines.Mesenchymal stem cells can be considered as an alternative treatment option on its own or part of a combination therapy for control of vascular graft infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655448>Waxing and cultivar affect Salmonella enterica persistence on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) fruit.</a></h1><p>A dearth of knowledge exists on the pathogen-commodity association of Salmonella enterica on cucumber, despite cucumbers being implicated in multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in recent years in the U.S. Data are lacking on cultivar susceptibility to Salmonella  in relation to heterogeneity in fruit surface morphology. Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic microbiota is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen . Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nasopharyngeal swabbing was processed using a molecular method. We used logistic regression models to examine independent associations between pneumococcal carriage and potential risk factors. All associations with a p-value of < 0.25 in the bivariate regression analyses were subsequently entered in the multivariate regression model.A total of 637 children aged 1 to 59 months admitted for acute respiratory infection were included. The rate of respiratory virus carriage was 76%, whereas that of bacteria was 47% and that of bacteria-virus co- was 42%. A bivariate analysis showed that carriage was not related to gender, father's or mother's education level, father's occupation, type of housing or lighting, or passive exposure to cigarette smoking in the house. It was also not linked to complete vaccination with PCV-13 or PPSV-23 and antibiotic treatment prior to hospitalization. A multivariate analysis showed that carriage was related to age greater than 3 months, maternal occupation, house flooring type, and co- of another bacterium and virus.These results can be helpful to understand the dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal ; they confirm the interest of vaccinating infants before the age of 3 months with appropriate vaccine to prevent spread nasopharyngeal  and pneumococcal diseases in children.© Ibrahim Dan Dano et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695873>Discussion of development processes in insect-fungus association derived from the shaggy parasol fruiting on the nests of hairy wood ants.</a></h1><p>, typically regarded as a rich grassland or open forest "mushroom" species, was found fruiting abundantly on nests of , occurring in a  plantation.

Many monoherbal and polyherbal formulations have been reported to hasten/accelerate wound healing activity in freshly prepared incisional and excisional experimental wound models. In the present review, an attempt has been made to throw light on importance of microbial infection in the process of wound healing and antimicrobial activity of herbal formulations. Different herbal formulations have been reported to hasten/accelerate the process of wound healing by enhancing epitheliazation, neovascularization, formation of granulation tissue, collagen synthesis, wound contraction, tensile strength, etc. As these studies have been conducted in freshly prepared non-infected wounds, it is difficult to ascertain the wound healing potential of these formulations in absence of microbial /infection and results are not justifiable because the healing is limited to non-infected wounds. It would be more appropriate to ascertain the wound healing potential and not hastening/accelerating the wound healing property of newer herbal formulations on wound healing in experimental animals in presence of /infection. Hence, it is recommended to strengthen these study protocols further using suitable controls to find out the antimicrobial activities of herbal formulations and their effect on wounds colonized/infected with pathogenic microbes in significant numbers to achieve more meaningful and concrete conclusions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

GAGs such as hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate consist of repeating disaccharide units of uronate and amino sugar residues, and are depolymerized to unsaturated disaccharides by bacterial extracellular or cell-surface polysaccharide lyase. The disaccharides are degraded and metabolized by cytoplasmic enzymes such as unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, isomerase, and reductase. The genes encoding these enzymes are assembled to form a GAG genetic cluster. Here, we demonstrate the Streptococcus agalactiae phosphotransferase system (PTS) for import of unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide. S. agalactiae NEM316 was found to depolymerize and assimilate hyaluronan, whereas its mutant with a disruption in the PTS genes included in the GAG cluster was unable to grow on hyaluronan, while retaining the ability to depolymerize hyaluronan. Using toluene-treated wild-type cells, the PTS activity for import of unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide was significantly higher than that observed in the absence of the substrate. In contrast, the PTS mutant was unable to import unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide, indicating that the corresponding PTS is the only importer of fragmented hyaluronan, which is suitable for PTS to phosphorylate the substrate at the C-6 position. This is distinct from Streptobacillus moniliformis ATP-binding cassette transporter for import of sulfated and non-sulfated fragmented GAGs without substrate modification. The three-dimensional structure of streptococcal EIIA, one of the PTS components, was found to contain a Rossman-fold motif by X-ray crystallization. Docking of EIIA with another component EIIB by modeling provided structural insights into the phosphate transfer mechanism. This study is the first to identify the substrate (unsaturated hyaluronan disaccharide) recognized and imported by the streptococcal PTS. The PTS and ABC transporter for import of GAGs shed light on bacterial clever /infection system targeting various animal polysaccharides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670814>Longitudinal  With Streptococcus pneumoniae During the First Year of Life in a Healthy Newborn Cohort.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to characterize longitudinal  with Streptococcus pneumoniae during the first year of life within a community newborn infant cohort, and assess the relationship between antibiotic exposure and  with antibiotic-resistant organisms.During April 2013-February 2014, 326 infants were enrolled from an urban academic hospital well-baby nursery. At ages 4, 8, and 12 months, we collected antibiotic data, other exposure data, and nasopharyngeal cultures for pneumococcal isolation.Follow-up visits were completed for 211, 158, and 144 infants at ages 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. By 12 months, 33% of infants attending the visits had ever been exposed to antibiotics, 67% if exposures to maternal antibiotics at birth are included. Pneumococci were isolated at 38/839 (4.5%) visits from 38 infants, including one 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotype (6A). There were 1 (0.3%), 15 (7%), 7 (4%), and 15 (10%) infants who were colonized at 0-, 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits, respectively. By age 12 months, at least 35 (11%) infants had ever been colonized. Sixteen isolates (42%) exhibited nonsusceptibility to at least 1 antibiotic. Infants with recent antibiotic exposure were not more likely to be colonized or to harbor nonsusceptible organisms.Within a hospital birth cohort followed in the community, pneumococcal  and related antibiotic resistance were lower than previously reported, likely associated with PCV13 use. Antibiotic exposure was not associated with subsequent  with resistant isolates. The influence of other environmental factors needs further study.© The Author(s) 2019.

Both mammalian and fungal cells can convert arachidonic acid into the lipid mediator, prostaglandin E2 (PGE), but the physiological significance of fungus-derived PGE remains elusive. Here we report that a  mutant deficient in PGE production suffered a loss of competitive fitness in the murine gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that PGE supplementation mitigated this fitness defect. Impaired fungal PGE production affected neither the  fitness of  nor hyphal morphogenesis and virulence in either systemic or mucosal infection models. Instead, fungal production of PGE was associated with enhanced fungal survival within phagocytes. Consequently, ablation of colonic phagocytes abrogated the intra-GI fitness boost conferred by fungal PGE. These observations suggest that  has evolved the capacity to produce PGE from arachidonic acid, a host-derived precursor, to promote its own  of the host gut. Analogous mechanisms might undergird host-microbe interactions of other symbiont fungi.Copyright © 2019 Tan, Lim, Tan, Leong and Pavelka.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652848>Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi  Promotes Changes in the Volatile Compounds and Enzymatic Activity of Lipoxygenase and Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase in  L.

Sixteen supergroups have been described from different host taxa. Four supergroups A, B, M, and N were found in aphids according to prior studies. The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, are typical polyphagous species with global distributions. We conducted an extensive and systematic survey of Wolbachia infections in these aphids from China. High incidences of Wolbachia infection were detected. The total infection incidence was 60% in A. gossypii and 88% in M. persicae. Both aphid species were infected with supergroups A, B and M. Different incidences of infection were observed among the seven geographical regions in China, which suggested a positive relationship between Wolbachia infections and the geographical distribution of aphid species. Furthermore, multiple infection patterns (M, B, A&M, B&M, and A&B&M) were observed. Infection patterns M and B&M were detected in almost all populations. Patterns A&B&M and B showed geographical restriction in North China. Three factors can possibly influence the Wolbachia infection incidences and patterns: the geographical distribution, aphid species, and different supergroup types.© The Author(s) 2019.

Deletion of gL detargets the virus from Eph family receptors. The ability of this gL-minus Gag recombinant RRV to infect, persist, and elicit immune responses was evaluated after intravenous inoculation of two  RRV-naïve rhesus monkeys. Both monkeys responded with an anti-RRV antibody response, and quantitation of RRV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by real time PCR revealed levels similar to those in monkeys infected with recombinant gL+ RRV. Comparison of RRV DNA levels in sorted CD3+ vs. CD20+ vs. CD14+ PBMC subpopulations indicated infection of the CD20+ subpopulation by the gL-minus RRV. This contrasts with results obtained with transformed B cell lines  where deletion of gL resulted in markedly reduced infectivity. Over a period of 20 weeks Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses were documented by major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) tetramer staining. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses, which were predominantly directed against the Mamu-A*01-restricted Gag(181-189)CM9 epitope, could be inhibited by blockade of MHC-I presentation. Our results indicate that gL and the interaction with Eph family receptors is dispensable for the  of the B cell compartment following high-dose infection by the intravenous route, which suggests the existence of alternative receptors. Further, gL-minus RRV elicits cellular immune responses that are predominantly canonical in nature. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with a substantial disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, often in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) has shown potential as a vector to immunize monkeys with antigens from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the macaque model for HIV. KSHV and RRV engage cellular receptors from the Eph family via the viral gH/gL glycoprotein complex. We have now generated a recombinant RRV that expresses the SIV Gag antigen and does not express gL. This recombinant RRV was infectious by the intravenous route, established persistent infection in the B cell compartment, and elicited strong immune responses to the SIV Gag antigen. These results argue against a role of gL and Eph family receptors for B cell infection by RRV  and have implications for the development of a live-attenuated KSHV vaccine or vaccine vector.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693806>Prevention of Early Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia after Cardiac Arrest.</a></h1><p>Patients who are treated with targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm are at increased risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The benefit of preventive short-term antibiotic therapy has not been shown.We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving adult patients (>18 years of age) in intensive care units (ICUs) who were being mechanically ventilated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to initial shockable rhythm and treated with targeted temperature management at 32 to 34°C. Patients with ongoing antibiotic therapy, chronic  with multidrug-resistant bacteria, or moribund status were excluded. Either intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (at doses of 1 g and 200 mg, respectively) or placebo was administered three times a day for 2 days, starting less than 6 hours after the cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was early ventilator-associated pneumonia (during the first 7 days of hospitalization). An independent adjudication committee determined diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia.A total of 198 patients underwent randomization, and 194 were included in the analysis. After adjudication, 60 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia were confirmed, including 51 of early ventilator-associated pneumonia. The incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia was lower with antibiotic prophylaxis than with placebo (19 patients [19%] vs. 32 [34%]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.92; P = 0.03). No significant differences between the antibiotic group and the control group were observed with respect to the incidence of late ventilator-associated pneumonia (4% and 5%, respectively), the number of ventilator-free days (21 days and 19 days), ICU length of stay (5 days and 8 days if patients were discharged and 7 days and 7 days if patients had died), and mortality at day 28 (41% and 37%). At day 7, no increase in resistant bacteria was identified. Serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.A 2-day course of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate in patients receiving a 32-to-34°C targeted temperature management strategy after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm resulted in a lower incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia than placebo.

However, the dynamics of these microbiota have not been fully identified. Here we present joint 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA (cDNA) comparison of input (snow), storage (cryoconite), and output (supraglacial stream water) habitats across the Dark Zone over the melt season. We reveal that all three Dark Zone communities have a preponderance of rare taxa exhibiting high protein synthesis potential (PSP). Furthermore, taxa with high PSP represent highly connected 'bottlenecks' within community structure, consistent with their roles as metabolic hubs. Finally, low abundance-high PSP taxa affiliated with Methylobacterium within snow and stream water suggest a novel role for Methylobacterium in the carbon cycle of Greenlandic snowpacks, and importantly, the export of potentially active methylotrophs to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Contrary to our expectations, host genotype effects were not any stronger in fields with high disease pressure than in uninfected fields, and microbiome succession over time was similar in heavily infected and uninfected plants. ●These results show that introgressed QTL can greatly improve broad-spectrum disease resistance while having only limited and inconsistent pleiotropic effects on the leaf microbiome in maize.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652281>Shift in trophic niches of soil microarthropods with conversion of tropical rainforest into plantations as indicated by stable isotopes (15N, 13C).</a></h1><p>Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide, affecting above and below ground animal communities by altering their trophic niches. However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of single oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic shift was either due to changes in trophic level (δ15N values), to changes in the use of basal resources (δ13C values) or to changes in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity. Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar trend. Overall, the results suggest that  of very different ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647840>Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and expression of GFP in Ascochyta lentis to characterize ascochyta blight disease progression in lentil.</a></h1><p>The plant immune system is made up of a complex response network that involves several lines of defense to fight invading pathogens. Fungal plant pathogens on the other hand, have evolved a range of ways to infect their host. The interaction between Ascochyta lentis and two lentil genotypes was explored to investigate the progression of ascochyta blight (AB) in lentils. In this study, we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for A. lentis by constructing a new binary vector, pATMT-GpdGFP, for the constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Green fluorescence was used as a highly efficient vital marker to study the developmental changes in A. lentis during AB disease progression on the susceptible and resistant lentil accessions, ILL6002 and ILL7537, respectively. The initial infection stages were similar in both the resistant and susceptible accessions where A. lentis uses infection structures such as germ tubes and appressoria to gain entry into the host while the host uses defense mechanisms to prevent pathogen entry. Penetration was observed at the junctions between neighbouring epidermal cells and occasionally, through the stomata. The pathogen attempted to penetrate and colonize ILL7537, but further fungal advancement appeared to be halted, and A. lentis did not enter the mesophyll. Successful entry and  of ILL6002 coincided with structural changes in A. lentis and the onset of necrotic lesions 5-7 days post inoculation. Once inside the leaf, A. lentis continued to grow, colonizing all parts of the leaf followed by plant cell collapse. Pycnidia-bearing spores appeared 14 days post inoculation, which marks the completion of the infection cycle. The use of fluorescent proteins in plant pathogenic fungi together with confocal laser scanning microscopy, provide a valuable tool to study the intracellular dynamics,  strategy and infection mechanisms during plant-pathogen interaction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681224>Inhibition of Virulence-Related Traits in  pv.  by Gunpowder Green Tea Extracts.</a></h1><p>Green tea is a widely-consumed healthy drink produced from the leaves of . It is renowned for its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties, but also displays significant antimicrobial activity against numerous human pathogens. Here we analyzed the antimicrobial activity of Gunpowder green tea against  pv.  (Psa), the agent that causes kiwifruit bacterial canker. At the phenotypic level, tea extracts strongly inhibited Psa growth and swimming motility, suggesting it could reduce Psa epiphytic survival during plant . The loss of bacterial virulence-related traits following treatment with tea extracts was also investigated by large-scale transcriptome analysis, which confirmed the  phenotypes and revealed the induction of adaptive responses in the treated bacteria allowing them to cope with iron deficiency and oxidative stress. Such molecular changes may account for the ability of Gunpowder green tea to protect kiwifruit against Psa infection.Copyright © 2019 Lovato, Pignatti, Vitulo, Vandelle and Polverari.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681230>Phylogeography and Ecological Niche Shape the Cichlid Fish Gut Microbiota in Central American and African Lakes.</a></h1><p>Cichlid fishes, with their repeated  of lakes and subsequent radiations at different scales of phylogenetic and ecological diversification, offer an excellent model system to understand the factors shaping the host-gut microbiota association in nature. Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of the  species complex from Central America (known as the Midas cichlid complex), encompassing 158 wild specimens (13 species) collected from seven Nicaraguan lakes, and combined these data with previously published data from two African lakes (spanning 29 species). Our aim was to comprehensively explore trends in microbiota variation and persistence along the large spatial and temporal scales of cichlid diversification (from the oldest radiation in L. Tanganyika, 9-12 My old, to young ones in Nicaraguan crater lakes, <0.5 My old), in allopatry and sympatry (within and across lakes), and across the range of dietary niches (from highly specialized to generalist feeders). Despite their extraordinary diversity, cichlids shared a remarkably conserved microbial taxonomic profile, which argues for a primary role of the host genetics in the assembly and maintenance of these microbial communities. Within this partly constrained microbiota profile, geographic isolation (continent and lake) represented the first level of discrimination. For the Midas cichlid, a partial congruency was found between host microbiota and genetic distances, suggesting that microbial communities have partly diversified along their cichlid phylogeographic history of crater lake . In sympatry (within lakes), the young and poorly ecologically diversified cichlid assemblages of Central American lakes display largely unresolved gut microbiotas (in terms of both alpha and beta diversities), whereas the phylogenetically and ecologically diverse species found in African lakes showed greater microbial interspecific diversity. This pattern largely points to the level of habitat segregation, trophic niche overlap, and reproductive barriers as major modulators of the gut microbiota connectivity among sympatric species.Copyright © 2019 Baldo, Riera, Salzburger and Barluenga.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643005>In vitro mycorrhization of pear (Pyrus communis).</a></h1><p>The Mycelium Donor Plant system (MDP) was adapted to study the time course of the  of Pyrus communis by Rhizophagus irregularis under in vitro conditions.

During ensiling, the levels of pH, acetic acid (AA), butyric acid (BA), propionic acid (PA), and the population of yeast and aerobic bacteria were significantly (p>0.05) lower, while lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Lactic acid (LA) were significantly (P < 0.001) higher with the steps forward of ensiling in with BM 18-2 as compared to without BM 18-2 colonized of Hybrid Pennisetum. During the different ensiling days, at 3 , 6 , 15 , and 30 , the genus Brevundimonas, Klebsiella, Lactococcus, Weissella, Enterobacter, Serratia, etc population were significantly decreased, while genus Pediococcus acidilactici and L. plantarum were significantly influenced in treated groups as compared to control. The genus Lactobacillus and Pediococcus were positively correlated with treatment groups.It is concluded that the endophytic bacteria strain Bacillus megaterium 18-2 significantly promoted growth characteristics and biomass yield before ensiling and after ensiling inoculated with or with L. plantarum could improve the distinct changes of the undesirable microbial diversity, chemical composition, and stabilization properties in with BM 18-2 as compared to without BM 18-2 colonized Hybrid Pennisetum.

Despite the excellent microbe-inhibitory effect of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based coatings, marine bacteria could still attach to surfaces and form natural biofilms. However, there is little information available on the common structural features of pioneer surface-biofilm bacteria (PSB) communities on different PDMS-based coatings with regard to their compositions, distributions and diversity. Herein, the present study aims to explore the compositional and structural features of the PSB communities on different PDMS-based coatings using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in terms of the taxonomic structures at phylum, family and genus level. The results revealed the PSB communities on different PDMS-based coatings possessed high similarities in compositional, structural and diversity features, but varied greatly in relative abundance and distributions. Proteobacteria was the most diverse and overwhelming phylum in biofilms formed on all PDMS-based coatings, followed by Cyanobacteria. In addition, the decreased abundance of Proteobacteria and the increased abundance of Cyanobacteria on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-modifed PDMS composites (CPCs) may contribute to their differential anti-biofouling effect against the  of juvenile macrofoulers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Adaptive immunity is principally founded on T-cell and B-cell populations, but also includes the host microbiome. The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with a great organism diversity and refined genomic structure that resides in the intestinal tract and has a central position in human health and disease.5 Neuroimmune dysregulation, relying of the highly sensitive and fine-tuned equilibrium between microbiome and adaptive immunity, can tip the scales towards neuroinflammation and disruption of higher-order brain networks.4,6,7 During the last decade, the human microbiome and the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB)-axis have become a novel epicentre in mental health research as a potentially vital new determinant in the field of neuroimmunoregulation, brain development, emotions, cognition and behaviour.7 The MGB-axis represents a bidirectional, key communication pathway between the immune system and the brain, thus partly also mediating the regulation of cognitive and emotional processing. An imbalanced human microbiome might greatly influence proper neuroimmune reactions and neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects and could thus play a pivotal role in the susceptibility and aetiology of psychiatric illness. Recent research offers first evidence that patients with SCZ show marked disturbances of gut bacterial taxa composition with a decreased microbiome diversity index, party associated with specific SCZ phenotype, symptom severity and treatment response.8,9 As the elegant education of the adaptive immune compartment depends on the  niche, antigen type and metabolic property of different gut microbes, T-cell differentiation as well as a continuous diversification of B-cell repertoire is expressed through microbiome-related, antigen-specific receptors that define a unique clonotype.10 However, there is only sparse evidence on the precise role of the microbiome on the programming of T- and B-cells in the underlying neurobiological pathways of SCZ and even less findings on the association of molecular T- and B-cell receptor repertoire signature and microbiome clonal landscape with specific phenotypical features of the disease.11 The latest conceptual advances in immunology urge an integrative re-evaluation of previous immunological findings in SCZ through modern approaches. High-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a powerful singlecell transcriptomic tool to profile the whole clonal landscape of T and B cells and human microbiome. NGS thus offers a unique opportunity for in-depth characterization of cellular and molecular signatures of adaptive immune receptor repertoires and microbiome taxonomy in SCZ and investigation of their intersection as a relevant pathway of disease progression and phenotype differentiation. SCZ patients are likely to show a diverging host-microbiome immune homeostasis with disease-specific clonotypes of adaptive immune receptor repertoires associated with altered microbiome taxonomy and molecular signature differences, which, in turn, may be related to distinct symptomatic phenotypes and neurocognitive patterns. Such sophisticated immuno-bioinformatic analyses may transform our understanding of SCZ by identification of novel neuroimmune pathways, offering us clinically accessible symptomatic and diagnostic biomarkers important for personalized medicine implications.12 An increased understanding and better characterization of immuno-phenotypes in SCZ will better guide the development of novel immune-based treatments in this severe disease and pave the way for possible prevention options through implementation of antibody engineering, vaccine design, and cellular immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665981>Indigenous Children and Young People in Residential Care: A Systematic Scoping Review.</a></h1><p>In Australia and internationally, Indigenous children are seriously overrepresented in the child welfare system.

Utilizing a systematic scoping review methodology, the study returned a total of 637 peer-reviewed articles that were identified and reviewed for inclusion. The process of exclusion resulted in the inclusion of eight peer-reviewed studies and 51 reports and discussion papers sourced from gray literature. Findings from this study, though dearth, indicate that trauma-informed and culturally safe interventions play a significant role in Indigenous children's health and well-being while in care. Their experiences of abuse and neglect transcend individual trauma and include intergenerational pain and suffering resulting from long-lasting impacts of , displacement from culture and country, genocidal policies, racism, and the overall systemic disadvantage. As such, a therapeutic response, embedded within Indigenous cultural frameworks and knowledges of trauma, is not only important but absolutely necessary and aims to acknowledge the intersectionality between the needs of Indigenous children in care and the complex systemic disadvantage impacting them.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694788>[GEMICOMED/GEIRAS-SEIMC recommendations for the management of Candida auris infection and ].</a></h1><p>Candida auris is a new species of Candida that causes nosocomial outbreaks in several countries around the world, including Spain. C.auris is resistant to fluconazole and multi- and pan-resistant strains have been described. It is highly transmissible and can survive long term in the hospital environment, causing long-lasting outbreaks that are difficult to detect in early stages, and making it difficult to control and eradicate. It is currently an emerging threat to global health. This document provides a set of guidelines, developed by a multidisciplinary team, to limit the impact and facilitate the control of C.auris infection based on the experiences gathered in the Spanish and English outbreaks. The implementation of early and strict surveillance and control measures is essential to prevent the spread of the outbreak, which can spread over time, posing a significant risk to complex, critical and immunocompromised surgical patients. Immediate notification of C.auris isolation to clinical and infection control teams, as well as to health authorities and institutions, is essential to implement infection control measures at all levels in a timely manner, to prevent internal and inter-centre transmission, and to ensure a proper surveillance and prevention to patients who are already colonized and can develop an infection.Copyright © 2019 Asociación Española de Micología.

Organic matter (OM) amendment and plant  are considered to be effective in enhancing water stable aggregation, but the underlying mechanisms have yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to characterise detailed changes in physicochemistry, Fe-bearing mineralogy, and organo-mineral interactions in magnetite Fe-ore tailings subject to the combined treatments of OM amendment and plant , by employing various micro-spectroscopic methods, including synchrotron based X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectroscopy (NanoSIMS). The results indicated that OM amendment and plant  neutralized the tailings' alkaline pH and facilitated water stable aggregate formation. The resultant aggregates were consequences of ligand promoted bioweathering of primary Fe bearing minerals (mainly biotite-like minerals) and the formation of secondary Fe rich mineral gels. Especially, the sequestration of organic matter (rich in carboxyl, aromatic, and/or carbonyl C) by Fe rich minerals via ligand exchange and/or hydrophobic interactions contributed to the aggregation. These findings have uncovered the processes and mechanisms of water stable aggregate formation driven by OM amendment and plant  in alkaline Fe ore tailings, thus providing important basis for eco-engineered pedogenesis in the tailings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637143>Fundamental niche unfilling and potential invasion risk of the slider turtle .</a></h1><p>How species colonize new environments is still a fundamental question in ecology and evolution, assessable by evaluating range characteristics of invasive species. Here we propose a model approach to evaluate environmental conditions and species features to predict niche changes in non-equilibrium contexts. It incorporates potentially range-limiting processes (fundamental niche), hence allowing for better predictions of range shifts, differentiation of analog and non-analog conditions between the native and non-native (invaded) ranges, and identification of environmental conditions not currently available but likely in the future. We apply our approach with the worldwide invasive slider-turtle .We estimated the native and non-native realized niches of  and built its fundamental niche based on key features of the turtle's temperature physiological tolerance limits and survival-associated factors. We next estimated response functions adjusted to the physiological predictor variables and estimated habitat suitability values, followed by a comprehensive set of analyses and simulations to compare the environmental conditions occupied by  (at its native and non-native ranges).Climatic space analysis showed that the 's non-native realized niche is 28.6% greater than the native one. Response curves showed that it does not use its entire range of temperature tolerances (density curves for native: 5.3-23.7 °C and non-native: 1.7-28.4 °C ranges). Whether considering the mean temperature of the warmest or the coldest quarter, it occupies a wider range of temperatures along its non-native distribution. Results of the response curves for worldwide (global) and across Mexico (regional) comparisons showed it occupies analog and non-analog conditions between its native and invaded ranges, exhibiting also unoccupied suitable climatic conditions.We demonstrate that  occupies a wider subset of its fundamental niche along its non-native range (within its physiological tolerances), revealing that the species observed niche shift corresponds to a different subset of its fundamental niche (niche unfilling). We also identified suitable environmental conditions, globally and regionally, where the slider turtle could potentially invade. Our approach allows to accurately predict niche changes in novel or non-equilibrium contexts, which can improve our understanding about ecological aspects and geographic range boundaries in current and potential invasions.©2019 Espindola et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667953>Root  by endophytic insect pathogenic fungi.</a></h1><p>Several ascomycetous insect pathogenic fungi, including species in the genera Beauveria and Metarhizium, are also plant root symbionts/endophytes and are termed endophytic insect pathogenic fungi (EIPF). The ability of these fungi to infect insects as well as colonize plant roots is coupled in that EIPF can translocate insect-derived nitrogen from infected insect cadavers in the soil to the host plant in exchange for plant photosynthate. This symbiotic interaction offers other benefits to the plant; EIPF can improve plant growth, they are antagonistic to plant pathogens and herbivores and can enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. The mechanisms and underlying biochemical and genetic features of insect pathogenesis are generally well established. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the underlying mechanisms in this plant symbiotic association. Here we review five aspects of EIPF interactions with host plant roots: (1) rhizosphere , (2) signaling factors from the plant and EIPF, (3) modulation of plant defense responses, (4) nutrient exchange, and (5) tripartite interactions with insects and other microorganisms. The elucidation of these interactions is fundamental to understanding this symbiotic association for effective application of EIPF in an agricultural setting.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692514>Prevalence of methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) carriage and pattern of antibiotic resistance among sheep farmers from Southern Italy.</a></h1><p>We conducted a cross-sectional study to measure the prevalence of methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) , with a particular focus on livestock associated (LA)-MRSA in farmers working in contact with livestock (sheep) in one Italian region.

MRSA colonized workers were found in three farms;  was isolated in 97 workers (35.5%), whereas MRSA was isolated in 3 (1.1%) workers. All MRSA isolates were classified as multidrug resistant. Two of the MRSA isolates were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin (QDA), mupirocin, erythromycin, and tetracycline.

Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Lypd8 strongly contributes to early-phase defense against Citrobacter rodentium, which causes colitis by inducing attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on colonic epithelia. Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium  in the colon, resulting in severe colitis with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria.

The confirmation of a likely episode of cyst infection by isolating the pathogenic microorganism in a clinical scenario is possible only in the minority of cases. The available antimicrobial treatment guidelines, therefore, might not be appropriate to some patients.We describe two unique cases of kidney cyst infection by Candida albicans, a condition that has not been previously described in literature. Both cases presented clear risk factors for Candida spp. infection. However, since there was no initial indication of cyst aspiration and culture, antifungal therapy was not immediately started and empirical treatment was initiated as recommended by the current guidelines. Antifungal treatment was instituted in both cases along the clinical course, according to their specificities.Our report highlights the possibility of Candida spp. cyst infection. Failure of clinical improvement with antibiotics should raise the suspicion of a fungal infection. Identification of infected cysts should be pursued in such cases, particularly with PET-CT, and when technically possible followed by cyst aspiration and culture to guide treatment. Risk factors for this condition, such as Candida spp. , previous antimicrobial therapy, hemodialysis, necrotizing pancreatitis, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary surgical procedure, central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, diabetes mellitus and immunodeficiency (neutropenia < 500 neutrophils/mL, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant drugs), should be also considered accepted criteria for empirical antifungal therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659300>Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4 T cells via parenteral immunization.</a></h1><p>The generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T) is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines. We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4 T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here, we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4 mucosal T Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17ACD4 T in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T in prevention of pneumococcal , and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization.

More than 75% of the genes were part of the core genome in each isolate and the higher fraction of gene assign to different functional categories in dispensable genes indicated that these genes acquired for better adaptability and diversity. High concordance (97%) was detected between phenotypically confirmed antibiotic resistances and identified antibiotic resistance genes from WGS. The resistance determinants were mainly located on mobile genetic elements (MGE) on plasmids or integrated into the chromosome. Most of known and putative virulence genes were part of the core genome, but a small fraction were detected on MGE. Predicted integrated phage were highly diverse and many harbored virulence, metal resistance, or antibiotic resistance genes. CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) patterns revealed the common ancestry or infection history among Salmonella serovars. Overall genomic analysis revealed a great deal of diversity among Salmonella serovars due to acquired genes that enable them to thrive and survive during infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634477>Preoperative topical liposomal ozone dispersion to reduce bacterial  in conjunctival sac and periocular skin.</a></h1><p>Periocular skin and ocular conjunctiva bacteria as part of the ocular microbiome plays an important role in maintenance of healthy ocular surface and protect against pathogenic species. Prophylaxis represents a keystone to reduce this bacterial load before surgical procedures. Despite many prophylactic agents are available the preferred perioperative ocular surface antimicrobial agent is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of preoperative liposomal ozone dispersion in reducing bacterial  from the conjunctival sac and periocular skin in dogs, in comparison with povidone-iodine. Twenty-two owned dogs consisting with 44 eyes in total scheduled for diversified ophthalmic surgery or surgical procedure were enrolled for the study and divided in four groups (ozone eyelid, ozone conjunctiva, fluoroquinolone, placebo) receiving the respective preoperative protocol. A swab was taken before beginning and at the end of the protocol evaluating total microbial count, coagulase positive and negative staphylococci as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in CFU for total microbial count, coagulase positive and negative staphylococci both for liposomal ozone dispersion and povidone iodine; For group, no statistical difference in median CFU for both one-day placebo and fluoroquinolone preoperative prophylactic topical therapy. The results of the present study demonstrate that liposomal ozone-dispersion is able to reduce preoperative bacterial load in ocular surface at the same strength of povidone iodine.Copyright © 2019.

Teleost fishes are among the few vertebrates to undergo widespread  of caves and often exhibit eye regression with blindness. Cave populations of the poeciliid fish  (cave molly) exhibit reduced-albeit functional-eyes, offering the opportunity to investigate partial eye regression. We sequenced eye transcriptomes of cave and surface populations of  to identify differentially expressed genes that potentially underlie eye regression in cave mollies. We identified 28 significantly differentially expressed genes, 20 of which were directly related to light sensitivity, eye structure and visual signaling. Twenty-six of these genes were downregulated in cave compared to surface populations. Functional enrichment analysis revealed eye-related gene ontologies that were under-represented in cave mollies. In addition, a set of co-expressed genes related to vision and circadian rhythm was correlated with habitat type (cave versus surface). Our study suggests that differential gene expression plays a key role in the beginning evolutionary stages of eye regression in , shedding further light on regressive evolution in cavefish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669610>Nasal  of Staphylococcus aureus and the risk of surgical site infection after spine surgery: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Nasal  of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) may increase the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after spine surgeries, although the results of previous studies were inconsistent.To evaluate the influences of nasal  of SA, methicillin-susceptible SA (MSSA), and methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) on the incidence of SSI after spine surgery.systematic review and meta-analysis.Seven studies including 10,650 patients who underwent nasal swab examination before spine surgeries were included, and 221 patients had nasal  of MRSA at baseline.Association between baseline nasal  of SA, MRSA and SSI after spine surgery.Relevant follow-up studies were identified through systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. A random effects model was applied to pool the results. Subgroup analyses were performed according to whether MRSA decolonization was applied.During follow-up, a total of 244 SSI events occurred, including 57 MRSA-SSI events. Pooled results showed that nasal SA (risk ratio [RR]=0.75, p=0.22) or MSSA  (RR=0.60, p=0.22) did not significantly affect the risk of overall SSI after surgeries. However, nasal MRSA  was associated with significantly increased risks of overall SSI and MRSA-SSI (RR=2.52 and 6.21 respectively, both p<0.001). Interestingly, the associations between nasal MRSA  and increased risks of overall and MRSA-SSI remained significant in studies without MRSA decolonization, but became insignificant in studies with MRSA decolonization.Nasal MRSA  may be associated with increased risks of overall SSI and MRSA-SSI after spine surgeries, and nasal MRSA decolonization may be associated with a reduction of SSI in these patients.Copyright © 2019.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes the skin of most AD subjects and is the most common organism to cause infections. Overt bacterial infection is easily recognised by the appearance of weeping lesions, honey-coloured crusts, and pustules. However, the wide variability in clinical presentation of bacterial infection in AD and the inherent features of AD - cutaneous erythema and warmth, oozing associated with oedema, and regional lymphadenopathy - overlap with those of infection, making clinical diagnosis challenging. Furthermore, some features may be masked because of anatomical site- and skin-type-specific features, and the high frequency of S. aureus  in AD makes positive skin swab culture of suspected infection unreliable as a diagnostic tool. The host mechanisms and microbial virulence factors that underlie S. aureus  and infection in AD are incompletely understood. The aim of this article is to present the latest evidence from animal and human studies, including recent microbiome research, to define the clinical features of bacterial infections in AD, and to summarize our current understanding of the host and bacterial factors that influence microbial  and virulence.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636880>Retrospective Analysis of Microbial  Patterns in Central Venous Catheters, 2013-2017.</a></h1><p>This study was performed to provide epidemiological information on microbial  in central venous catheters (CVCs).CVCs submitted to Medical Microbiology Laboratory from January 1, 2013, through October 1, 2017, which met our criteria would be included for analysis.
