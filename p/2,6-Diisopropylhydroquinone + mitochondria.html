<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583724>iTRAQ-based mitochondrial proteome analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying postharvest senescence of Zizania latifolia.</a></h2><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying postharvest senescence of Zizania latifolia, the changes in the mitochondrial proteome of plants treated with or without (control) 1-methyleyelopropene and ethylene during storage at room temperature for 0, 3 and 6 days were investigated using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling combined with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1,390 proteins with two or more peptides were identified, of which 211 showed a significant (p < .05) change (at least twofold) in relative abundance. Monitoring the parallel reaction validated the reliability and accuracy of the iTRAQ results. Bioinformatics and functional analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) revealed that postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia could be attributed to (a) strengthened pentose phosphate pathway, (b) imbalanced protein, amino acid, organic acid, and fatty acid metabolism, (c) disordered energy homeostasis, (d) exacerbated oxidative damage, (e) RNA degradation, (f) activation of the Ca , mitogen-activated protein kinase, and jasmonic acid signaling pathways, (g) programed cell death, (h) excessive biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, or (i) degradation of cell structure. Our findings provide integrated insight into the molecular mechanisms of postharvest senescence during storage as well as the DEPs that show promise as targets for controlling senescence-induced quality deterioration of Z. latifolia. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest senescence is the most important factor that causes fast quality deterioration of Zizania latifolia. The understanding of the processes leading to postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia is essential in enhancing the commercial value and extending the shelf life of the product. It is currently believed that the mitochondrial metabolism is closely related to postharvest senescence. For this, the changes of proteome in Z. latifolia  treated with or without (control) 1-MCP and ETH during storage at room temperature were investigated. Results showed that a variety of physiobiochemical responses occur during postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia. 1-MCP treatment significantly inhibited the changes of these physiobiochemical processes, finally, retarding the postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia. ETH treatment had opposite effects on proteome changes compared with 1-MCP treatment. Taken together, these results enrich the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669621>In silico simulation of reversible and irreversible swelling of : the role of membrane rigidity.</a></h2><p> have been widely accepted as the main source of ATP in the cell. The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is important for the maintenance of ATP production and other functions of . The electron transport chain (ETC) generates an electrochemical gradient of protons known as the proton-motive force across the IMM and thus produces the mitochondrial membrane potential that is critical to ATP synthesis. One of the main factors regulating the structural and functional integrity of the IMM is the changes in the matrix volume. Mild (reversible) swelling regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function; however, excessive (irreversible) swelling causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The central mechanism of mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of non-selective channels known as permeability transition pores (PTPs) in the IMM by high mitochondrial Ca and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mechanisms of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling and transition between these two states are still unknown. The present study elucidates an upgraded biophysical model of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics. The model provides a description of the PTP regulation dynamics using an additional differential equation. The rigidity tensor was used in numerical simulations of the mitochondrial parameter dynamics with different initial conditions defined by Ca concentration in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. We were able to estimate the values of the IMM rigidity tensor components by fitting the model to the previously reported experimental data. Overall, the model provides a better description of the reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a "toxic inhibition" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized  isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase . Interesting, the decreased protein amount of -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase . Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase /3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than "toxic inhibition" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.Copyright © 2019.

However, the role of MKP1 in neuroinflammation has not been fully understood. The aim of this study is to figure out the influence of MKP1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated microglia BV- cells and investigate whether MKP1 reduces BV- cell death via modulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The results of this study demonstrated that MKP1 was rapidly downregulated after exposure to LPS. However, the transfection of MKP1 adenovirus could reverse cell viability and attenuate LPS-mediated BV- cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, MKP1 overexpression alleviated ER stress and corrected LPS-induced calcium overloading. Besides, MKP1 adenovirus transfection also reversed mitochondrial bioenergetics, maintained mitochondrial membrane potential, and blocked -initiated apoptosis signals. Furthermore, we found that MKP1 overexpression is associated with inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (MAPK-JNK) pathway. Interestingly, the activation of MAPK-JNK pathway could abolish the protective effects of MKP1 on BV- cells survival and mitochondrial function in the presence of LPS. Altogether, our results identified MKP1 as a primary defender of neuroinflammation via modulating ER stress and mitochondrial function in a manner dependent on MAPK-JNK pathway. These findings may open a new window for the treatment of neuroinflammation in the clinical setting.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597355>Mitochondrial Calcium Uptake Is Instrumental to Alternative Macrophage Polarization and Phagocytic Activity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are highly plastic and dynamic cells that exert much of their function through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis depends on a coordinated, finely tuned, and compartmentalized regulation of calcium concentrations. We examined the role of mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in macrophage polarization and function. In primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages, calcium uptake in  was instrumental for alternative (M2) macrophage polarization. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibition with KB-R7943 or MCU knockdown, which prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake, reduced M2 polarization, while not affecting classical (M1) polarization. Challenging macrophages with  fragments induced spikes of mitochondrial calcium concentrations, which were prevented by MCU inhibition or silencing. In addition,  remodelled in M2 macrophages during phagocytosis, especially close to sites of  internalization. Remarkably, inhibition or knockdown of MCU significantly reduced the phagocytic capacity of M2 macrophages. KB-R7943, which also inhibits the membrane sodium/calcium exchanger and Complex I, reduced  energization and cellular ATP levels, but such effects were not observed with MCU silencing. Therefore, phagocytosis inhibition by MCU knockdown depended on the impaired mitochondrial calcium buffering rather than changes in mitochondrial and cellular energy status. These data uncover a new role for MCU in alternative macrophage polarization and phagocytic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581537>Inhibitors of Oxidative Phosphorylation Modulate Astrocyte Inflammatory Responses through AMPK-Dependent Ptgs2 mRNA Stabilization.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory activation of astroglia adds to the pathology of various neurological diseases. Astrocytes respond to microglia-derived cytokines such as interleukin-1α (IL-1α) with enhanced inflammatory signaling. This provokes pro-inflammatory gene expression of, among others, the eicosanoid-generating enzyme prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase  (Ptgs2). Whereas metabolic regulation of innate immune cell inflammatory responses is intensely studied, pathways related to how metabolism modulates inflammatory signaling in astrocytes are underexplored. Here, we examined how mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation affects inflammatory responses towards IL-1α and tumor necrosis factor α in neonatal rat astrocytes. Blocking respiratory complex I and III or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase did not affect activation of inflammatory signaling by IL-1α, but did elicit differential effects on inflammatory gene mRNA expression. Remarkably, mRNA and protein expression of Ptgs2 by IL-1α was consistently up-regulated when oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. The increase of Ptgs2 resulted from mRNA stabilization. Mitochondrial inhibitors also increased IL-1α-triggered secretion of eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E, prostaglandin F, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F, as assessed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mechanistically, attenuating oxidative phosphorylation elevated adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK silencing prevented Ptgs2 up-regulation by mitochondrial inhibitors, while AMPK activators recapitulated Ptgs2 mRNA stability regulation. Our data indicate modulation of astrocyte inflammatory responses by oxidative metabolism, with relevance towards eicosanoid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610916>Zinc protects chondrocytes from monosodium iodoacetate-induced damage by enhancing ATP and mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized with articular cartilage degradation, and monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-treated chondrocyte is the most commonly used model for mimicking OA progression. Zinc protects chondrocytes from MIA-induced damage. Here, we explored the protective effects of 25 μM zinc on 5 μM MIA-treated SW1353 cells (human chondrosarcoma cell line) through the analysis of energy metabolism- and autophagy-related parameters. We found that the exposure of SW1353 cells to MIA decreased ATP levels, expression of glycolysis-related proteins, including glucose transporter 1, hexokinase , and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, and the levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and V subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. MIA treatment also decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including autophagic elongation protein 5 (ATG5), ATG7, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3-II) and mitophagy-related proteins, including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), ubiquitin, and p62. These results indicate that MIA interferes with energy metabolism and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional  (so called mitophagy). Interestingly, zinc exposure could almost completely reverse the effects of MIA, suggesting its potential protective role against OA progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

After 21 vibration sessions against the background of inhibition of NAD-dependent substrate oxidation in liver , the rate metabolism of exogenous succinic acid increased by 44% and then decreased with prolongation of the effect, which indicated impaired function of the respiratory chain. Similar fluctuations of the parameters were revealed in kidney , though their amplitude was lower.

Our goal is to identify the key factor in the process by which cells develop temozolomide (TMZ) resistance.Resistant cell lines derived from U87MG and A172 were established through long-term co-incubation of TMZ. Primary tumors obtained from patients were maintained as patient-derived xenograft for studies of tumor-initating cell (TIC) features. The cell manifestations were assessed in the gene modulated cells for relevance to drug resistance.Among the -related genes in the gene expression databases, superoxide dismutase  (SOD2) was a significant factor in resistance and patient survival. SOD2 in the resistant cells functionally determined the cell fate by limiting TMZ-stimulated superoxide reaction and cleavage of caspase-3. Genetic inhibition of the protein led to retrieval of drug effect in mouse study. SOD2 was also associated with the TIC features, which enriched in the resistant cells. The CD133 specific subsets in the resistant cells exhibited superior superoxide regulation and the SOD2-related caspase-3 reaction. Experiments applying SOD2 modulation showed a positive correlation between the TIC features and the protein expression. Finally, co-treatment with TMZ and the SOD inhibitor sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate in xenograft mouse models with the TMZ-resistant primary tumor resulted in lower tumor proliferation, longer survival, and less CD133, Bmi-1, and SOD2 expression.SOD2 plays crucial roles in the tumor-initiating features that are related to TMZ resistance. Inhibition of the protein is a potential therapeutic strategy that can be used to enhance the effects of chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648163>Hepatotoxicity and mechanism study of chrysophanol-8-O-glucoside in vitro.</a></h2><p>To better understand the hepatotoxicity of anthraquinone glycosides, the hepatotoxicity of six anthraquinone glycosides was evaluated. The results show that chrysophanol-8-O-glucoside(C8G) has strong hepatotoxicity and can lead to increased LDH leakage and ROS, decreased GSH and MMP in L-02 hepatocytes. The results of C8G hepatotoxicity proteomics shows that, a total of 773 differentially expressed proteins were screened and analyzed using GO analysis and Pathway enrichment analysis. Our results show that C8G can lead to abnormal oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting the function of mitochondrial complexes, resulting in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and eventually resulting in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Western blot results verified the accuracy of quantitative proteomic results, and also evaluated the expression of Bax, caspase-3, -8, -9, Bcl-, Cyt C in the  and cytosolic. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes activity assay result also confirmed that C8G could inhibit the activity of all mitochondrial complexes. The results of this study indicate that the hepatotoxicity mechanism of C8G is related to mitochondrial dysfunction, especially the mitochondrial complex function.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole metabolism suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618756>The ADP/ATP translocase drives mitophagy independent of nucleotide exchange.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial homeostasis vitally depends on mitophagy, the programmed degradation of . The roster of proteins known to participate in mitophagy remains small. We devised here a multidimensional CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screen, using multiple mitophagy reporter systems and pro-mitophagy triggers, and uncover numerous new components of Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Unexpectedly, we identify the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) complex as required for mitophagy in multiple cell types. While pharmacological inhibition of ANT-mediated ADP/ATP exchange promotes mitophagy, genetic ablation of ANT paradoxically suppresses mitophagy. Importantly, ANT promotes mitophagy independently of its nucleotide translocase catalytic activity. Instead, the ANT complex is required for inhibition of the presequence translocase TIM23, leading to PINK1 stabilization, in response to bioenergetic collapse. ANT modulates TIM23 indirectly via interaction with TIM44, known to regulate peptide import through TIM23. Mice lacking ANT1 reveal blunted mitophagy and consequent profound accumulation of aberrant . Disease-causing human mutations in ANT1 abrogate binding to TIM44 and TIM23 and inhibit mitophagy. Together, these data identify a novel and essential function for ANT as a fundamental mediator of mitophagy in health and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625574>-targeted therapy rescues development and quality of embryos derived from oocytes matured under oxidative stress conditions: a bovine in vitro model.</a></h2><p>Can we use a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant (Mitoquinone) during in vitro embryo culture to rescue developmental competence of oocytes matured under lipotoxic conditions, exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress?Supplementation of embryo culture media with Mitoquinone reduced oxidative stress and prevented mitochondrial uncoupling in embryos derived from metabolically compromised oocytes in vitro, leading to higher blastocyst rates and lower blastomeric apoptosis.Maternal metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-II diabetes are associated with hyperlipidemia and elevated free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in the ovarian follicular fluid (FF). Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of palmitic acid (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty acid-free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX- and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

The study used male young Wistar rats aged 22-30 days, divided into three experimental groups and the control group. Brain maturity in such animals corresponds to that of 1- or -year-old children. Hyperthermic stress was evoked by placing animals in a 45°C water bath for four consecutive days. TPM at a dose of 80 mg/kg b.m. was administered with an intragastric tube before and immediately after FS. Specimens (1 mm3) collected from the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors, fixed via transcardial perfusion with a solution of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, were routinely processed for transmission-electron microscopic analysis. Advanced ultrastructural changes induced by hyperthermic stress were manifested by distinct swelling of hippocampal pre- and post-synaptic axodendritic and axospinal endings, including their vacuolization and disintegration. The axoplasm of the presynaptic boutons contained a markedly decreased number of synaptic vesicles and their abnormal accumulation in the active synaptic region. The synaptic junctions showed a dilated synaptic cleft and a decreased synaptic active zone. TPM used directly after FS was ineffective in the prevention of hyperthermia-induced injury of synaptic endings in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors. However, "prophylactic" administration of TPM, prior to FS induction, demonstrated a neuroprotective effect against synaptic damage in approximately 25% of the synaptic endings in the hippocampal sectors, more frequently located in perivascular zones. It was manifested by smaller oedema of both presynaptic and postsynaptic parts, containing well-preserved , increased number and regular distribution of synaptic vesicles within the axoplasm, and increased synaptic active zone. Our current and previous findings suggest that TPM administered "prophylactically", before FS, could exert a favourable effect on some synapses, indirectly, via the vascular factor, i.e. protecting blood-brain barrier components and through better blood supply of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors, which may have practical implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678302>Recurrent Rearrangements in PRKACA and PRKACB in Intraductal Oncocytic Papillary Neoplasms of the Pancreas and Bile Duct.</a></h2><p>Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms (IOPNs) of the pancreas and bile duct contain epithelial cells with numerous, large  and are cystic precursors to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), respectively. However, IOPNs do not have the genomic alterations found in other pancreatobiliary neoplasms. In fact, no recurrent genomic alterations have been described in IOPNs.

Four invasive PDACs and  intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas from the same patients as the IOPNs, were also available for analysis. Samples of pancreatic cyst fluid (n=5, collected before surgery) and bile duct brushings (n=) were analyzed for translocations.

Our investigations using the closely related mouse strains C57BL/6NJ (6NJ; +NNT) and C57BL/6J (6J; -NNT) revealed that NNT is required for the provision of NADPH and that the upregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase- (IDH2) activity is not enough to compensate for the absence of NNT, which is consistent with previous observations. Intriguingly, despite the absence of NNT, 6J  had rates of HO production (58.56 ± 3.79 pmol mg min) that were similar to samples collected from 6NJ mice (72.75 ± 14.26 pmol mg min) when pyruvate served as the substrate. However, 6NJ  energized with succinate produced significantly less HO (59.95 ± .13 pmol mg min) when compared to samples from 6J mice (116.39 ± 20.74 pmol mg min), an effect that was attributed to the presence of NNT. Further investigations into the HO eliminating capacities of these  led to the novel observation that 6J  compensate for the loss of NNT by upregulating catalase. Indeed, 6NJ and 6J  energized with pyruvate or succinate displayed similar rates for HO elimination, quenching ~84% and ~86% of the HO, respectively, in the surrounding medium within 30 s. However, inclusion of palmitoyl-CoA, an NNT inhibitor, significantly limited HO degradation by 6NJ  only (~55% of HO eliminated in 30 s). Liver  from 6J mice treated with palmitoyl-CoA still cleared ~80% of the HO from the surrounding environment. Inhibition of catalase with triazole compromised the capacity of 6J  to maintain HO steady-state levels. By contrast, disabling NADPH-dependent antioxidant systems had a limited effect on the HO clearing capacity of 6J . Liver  collected from 6NJ mice, on the other hand, were more reliant on the GSH and TRX systems to clear exogenously added HO. However, catalase still played an integral in eliminating HO in 6NJ liver . Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that catalase protein levels were ~7.7-fold higher in 6J .

However, non-surgical treatments for uterine myomas have not been fully evaluated. In Korea and China, Gyejibongnyeong-hwan (GBH) is widely used to treat gynecological diseases. Thus, we investigated the effects of GBH in human uterine myoma cells (hUtMCs). The hUtMCs were collected from patients undergoing curative surgery. Cell viability was analyzed  3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. The expression levels of p53, Bax, Bcl-, cleaved-caspase-3, and caspase-9 were determined by Western blotting. Apoptosis and ROS levels were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. First, we determined the adequate concentration that did not affect normal cells, and then investigated the time-dependent anti-neoplastic effect of GBH to decide the appropriate treatment time under a non-toxic concentration. Cell viability and number were significantly reduced by GBH at 48 h in a dose-dependent manner (0-200 µg/ml). The ratio of Bax to Bcl2 and expression of p53, cleaved-caspase-3, and caspase-9 increased, representing GBH induced apoptosis in uterine leiomyomas. In addition, preliminary tests using pan-caspase inhibitor/p53 inhibitor with GBH rescued the GBH-mediated apoptotic effect. Furthermore, GBH significantly increased the mitochondrial ROS concentration, and preliminary test showed that  ROS scavenger reduced the percentages of early apoptosis cell. These results suggest that GBH may induce apoptosis of leiomyomas and demonstrated that GBH can be a potential therapeutic and/or preventive agent for uterine leiomyomas.Copyright © 2019 Lee, Choi, Ha, Ji, Shin and Jung.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659858>Protein Kinase Cα Mediates Recovery of Renal and Mitochondrial Functions Following Acute Injury.</a></h2><p>Previously, we have shown that active PKCα promotes recovery of mitochondrial function after injury in vitro [24]. This study examined whether PKCα regulates recovery of mitochondrial and kidney functions after ischemia-induced acute injury (AKI) in vivo. Markers of kidney injury were increased after bilateral ischemia and returned to normal levels in wild-type (WT) mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complexes and F F -ATPase decreased after ischemia and recovered in WT mice. Reperfusion after ischemia was accompanied by translocation of active PKCα to . PKCα deletion reduced mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complex I and F F -ATPase in non-injured kidneys, indicating that PKCα is essential in developing fully functional renal . These changes in PKCα-deficient mice were accompanied by lower levels of complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) and the γ-subunit of F F -ATPase. Also, lack of PKCα exacerbated ischemia-induced decreases in respiration, complex I and F F -ATPase activities, and blocked their recovery after injury, indicating a crucial role of PKCα in promoting mitochondrial recovery after AKI. Further, PKCα deletion exacerbated acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins of energy metabolism after ischemia due to decreases in deacetylase and desuccinylase (sirtuin3 and sirtuin5) levels in renal . Thus, our data show a novel role for PKCα in regulating levels of mitochondrial sirtuins and acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that PKCα deletion: 1) affects renal physiology by decreasing mitochondrial capacity for maximum respiration, ) blocks recovery of mitochondrial functions, renal morphology and functions after AKI, and 3) decreases survival after AKI.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611767>The Impairments of α-Synuclein and Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin in Rotenone-Induced SH-SY5Y Cells and Mice Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). α-synuclein (α-syn) is known to regulate mitochondrial function and both PINK1 and Parkin have been shown to eliminate damaged  in PD. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is expressed in several distinct subcellular compartments and mediates the effects of nutrients, growth factors, and stress on cell growth. However, the contributions of these various regulators to DAergic cell death have been demonstrated mainly in culture with serum, which is known to dramatically influence endogenous growth rate and toxin susceptibility through nutrient and growth factor signaling. Therefore, we compared neurotoxicity induced by the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone (ROT, 5 or 10 μM for 24 h) in SH-SY5Y cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% FBS, or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, serum-free). In addition, C57BL/6J mice were injected with 12 μg ROT into the right striatum, and brains examined by histology and Western blotting  weeks later for evidence of DAergic cell death and the underlying signaling mechanisms. ROT dose-dependently reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability in all serum groups without a significant effect of serum concentration. ROT injection also significantly reduced immunoreactivity for the DAergic cell marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in both the mouse striatum and SNpc. Western blotting revealed that ROT inhibited TH and Parkin expression while increasing α-syn and PINK1 expression in both SH-SY5Y cells and injected mice, consistent with disruption of mitochondrial function. Moreover, expression levels of the mTOR signaling pathway components mTORC, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ULK1, and ATG13 were altered in ROT-induced PD. Further, serum level influenced mTOR signaling in the absence of ROT and the changes in response to ROT. Signs of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and altered expression of tethering proteins mediating -associated ER contacts (MAMs) were also altered concomitant with ROT-induced neurodegeneration. Taken together, this study demonstrates that complex mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mTOR nutrient-sensing pathways, ER stress, and disrupted MAM protein dynamics are involved in DAergic neurodegeneration in response to ROT.Copyright © 2019 Ramalingam, Huh and Lee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622636>Fish herpesvirus protein (CaHV-138L) can target to mitochondrial protein FoF1 ATPase.</a></h2><p>Herpesvirus infection usually rely on the interaction between viralf protein and host protein to enhance replication of the enveloped virus. Fish Carassius auratus herpesvirus (CaHV) is highly pathogenic pathogen causing gill acute hemorrhages of crucian carp (Carassius auratus) and high moritality rates among those infected fish. The protein of CaHV (CaHV-138 L) containing two transmembrane (TM) domains and an immunoglobulin C- Type (IGc2) domain was predicted as a viral membrane protein. In this investigation, fluorescence observation showed that full-length CaHV-138 L mainly localized on the plasma membrane or around nuclear membrane of fish fathead minnow (FHM) cells in a punctate pattern. The TM domain deletion mutants of CaHV-138 L (ΔTM1, ΔTM2, and ΔTM1&ΔTM2) diffusely distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, mainly presented patchy fashion in the cytoplasm, and mainly presented both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, respectively. Obviously, the TM domain deletion mutants significantly affected CaHV-138 L subcellular localization. Meanwhile, colocalization assay showed that the full-length viral protein colocalized with . Furthermore, the interaction between CaHV-138 L and host protein was identified by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. The host mitochondrial protein FoF1 ATP synthase (FoF1-ATPase) that interacts with this viral protein was screened. The data indicated that CaHV-138 L can target to mitochondrial protein FoF1-ATPase, which might provide energy for virus replication through mediating mitochondrial ATP synthesis.

Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive metabolite of hyperglycemia, serves as a major precursor of advanced glycation end products that play key roles in diabetic complications. Ginsenoside Rb1 (abbreviated as Rb1) has received extensive attention due to its potential therapeutic effects on diabetes and neurodegeneration. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Rb1 on MGO-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells and the related mechanism. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with Rb1 for 8 h and then exposed to MGO (0.5 mM) for 24 h. Cell survival was assessed by the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed using Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining and an Annexin-V/PI kit. The activities of oxidative stress markers were examined using commercial kits. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining and JC-1 staining were used to evaluate  injury. In addition, protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis. As a result, Rb1 alleviated the injury induced by MGO by increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and total glutathione, decreasing the level of malondialdehyde, and alleviating mitochondrial damage and ROS production. Furthermore, Rb1 could enhance the Bcl-/Bax ratio, inhibit the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9, and enhance the levels of phosphorylated Akt. Moreover, the protective effects of Rb1 against MGO-induced apoptosis were partly abolished by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation. Our results demonstrated that Rb1 ameliorated MGO-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells via activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Different molecular targets for CBD were proposed, including cannabinoid receptors and some plasma membrane ion channels. Here we have shown that cell lines derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T lineage (T-ALL), but not resting healthy T cells, are highly sensitive to CBD treatment. CBD effect does not depend on cannabinoid receptors or plasma membrane Ca-permeable channels. Instead, CBD directly targets  and alters their capacity to handle Ca. At lethal concentrations, CBD causes mitochondrial Ca overload, stable mitochondrial transition pore formation and cell death.

In this study, we used BAPTA-AM, a well-known membrane-permeable Ca chelator, to prevent cell injury by allaying the intracellular calcium overload. We explored the clinical potentials of BAPTA-AM-loaded liposome (BAL) in the treatment of the acute liver failure (ALF) mouse model, which is characterized by severe hepatic necrosis and apoptosis. We discovered that BAL can significantly inhibit D-GalN-induced LO2 cell damage as it increased cell viability by 60% and downregulated the LPS-stimulated inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophages by reversing the morphological change and modulating TNF-α and NF-κB expressions. Through systemic administration, BAL can rapidly accumulate in damaged liver tissue and exhibit excellent treatment effects on the D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF mouse model, including elevation of the survival rate (from 10 to 80%), recovery of normal liver indexes and liver health indicators, improvement of liver blood microcirculation (increased the blood flow volume by 80% and flow rate by 60%), and blood coagulation. The underlying hepatoprotective effect of BAL is presumably based on the antinecrosis and antiapoptosis abilities attributed to its inhibition on oxidative stress, restriction on TNF-α receptor, and -mediated apoptotic pathway by effectively clearing the overloaded intercellular calcium. BAL holds great potential as a new therapeutic strategy for ALF treatment, and its prominent cell rescue ability provides ample opportunities for the treatment of many other diseases that are characterized by rapid and massive cell damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614141>Trans-10-hydroxy--decenoic acid alleviates LPS-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction by activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that trans-10-hydroxy--decenoic acid (10-HDA), the exclusive lipid component of royal jelly (RJ), alleviates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro. However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL- and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP- and MMP-9) and increased the expression of tight junction proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of -associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of tight junction proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Exogenously activated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a potential therapy for chemotherapy-induced neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated a role for Nrf2/HO-1/CO in mediating vincristine-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting connexin 43 (Cx43) production in the spinal cord following the intrathecal application of the HO-1 inducer protoporphyrin IX cobalt chloride (CoPP) or inhibitor protoporphyrin IX zinc (ZnPP), and we analyzed the underlying mechanisms by which levo-corydalmine (l-CDL, a tetrahydroprotoberberine) attenuates vincristine-induced pain. Treatment with levo-corydalmine or oxycodone hydrochloride (a semisynthetic opioid analgesic, used as a positive control) attenuated vincristine-induced persistent pain hypersensitivity and degeneration of the sciatic nerve. In addition, the increased prevalence of atypical  induced by vincristine was ameliorated by l-CDL in both A-fibers and C-fibers. Next, we evaluated whether nuclear factor E2-related factor  (Nrf2), an upstream activator of HO-1, directly bound to the HO-1 promoter sequence and degraded heme to produce carbon monoxide (CO) following stimulation with vincristine. Notably, l-CDL dose-dependently increased HO-1/CO expression by activating Nrf2 to inhibit Cx43 expression in both the spinal cord and in cultured astrocytes stimulated with TNF-α, corresponding to decreased Cx43-mediated hemichannel. Furthermore, l-CDL had no effect on Cx43 following the silencing of the HO-1 gene. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Nrf2/HO-1/CO mediates Cx43 expression in vincristine-induced neuropathic pain. In addition, the present findings suggest that l-CDL likely protects against nerve damage and attenuates vincristine-induced neuroinflammation by upregulating Nrf2/HO-1/CO to inhibit Cx43 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>Twist-related protein  (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

In this study, we developed a spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte model that integrates -related Ca cycling components into our previously developed ventricular myocyte model consisting of a three-dimensional Ca release unit network. Mathematical formulations of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial Ca cycling, mitochondrial permeability transition pore stochastic opening and closing, intracellular reactive oxygen species signaling, and oxidized Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling were incorporated into the model. We then used the model to simulate the effects of mitochondrial depolarization on mitochondrial Ca cycling, Ca spark frequency, and Ca amplitude, which agree well with experimental data. We also simulated the effects of the strength of mitochondrial Ca uniporters and their spatial localization on intracellular Ca cycling properties, which substantially affected diastolic and systolic Ca levels in the  but exhibited only a small effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic Ca levels under normal conditions. We show that mitochondrial depolarization can cause Ca waves and Ca alternans, which agrees with previous experimental observations. We propose that this new, to our knowledge, spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte model, incorporating properties of mitochondrial Ca cycling and reactive-oxygen-species-dependent signaling, will be useful for investigating the effects of  on intracellular Ca cycling and action potential dynamics in ventricular myocytes.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

This study aims to investigate the effects of RvD1 (50 nM) on morphological and biochemical indicators of mitochondrial damage in primary retinal cells exposed to 30 mM d-glucose high glucose (HG). HG-cells exhibited photoreceptor damage characterized by short and small  with prevalent mitochondrial disruption, fragmentation, and aggregation.

Moreover, they expressed high cytosolic metalloproteinase matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP- activity. HG-cells treated with RvD1 (50 nM) showed reduced reactive oxygen species levels, improved mitochondrial morphology and function, promoted mitochondrial DNA repair by OGG1, and reduced cell apoptosis and metalloproteinase activity.

The regulatory mechanisms of these two processes share B-cell lymphoma- family proteins and AMBRA1, which are present in both the endoplasmic reticulum and . B-cell lymphoma- family proteins sense different stresses and interact with AMBRA1 to regulate autophagy and apoptosis, which are respectively mediated by Beclin1 and Caspases. Therefore, we investigated how different levels of stress on B-cell lymphoma- family proteins that bind to AMBRA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and  regulate the switch from autophagy to apoptosis.In this paper, we considered the responses of B-cell lymphoma- family proteins, which bind to AMBRA1 in both the endoplasmic reticulum and , to two different levels of stress in a model originally proposed by Kapuy et al. We investigated how these two stress levels affect the transition from autophagy to apoptosis and their effects on apoptosis activation over time. Additionally, we analyzed how the feedback regulation in this model affects the bifurcation diagrams of two levels of stress and cell fate decisions between autophagy and apoptosis.Autophagy is activated for minor stress in  regardless of endoplasmic reticulum stress, while apoptosis is activated for only significant stress in . Apoptosis is only sensitive to  stress. The time duration before apoptosis activation is longer in the presence of high AMBRA1 levels with high endoplasmic reticulum and  stress. AMBRA1 can compete with B-cell lymphoma- family proteins to bind and activate Beclin1 and thus promote the autophagy process for a long time before apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis is prone to occur with increasing activation of Caspases, inactivation of Beclin1-A and the Michaelis constant of Caspases.A novel mathematical model has been developed to understand the complex regulatory mechanisms of autophagy and apoptosis. Our model may be applied to further autophagy-apoptosis dynamic modeling experiments and simulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617661>Global Interactome Mapping of Mitochondrial Intermembrane Space Proteases Identifies a Novel Function for HTRA2.</a></h2><p>A number of unique proteases localize to specific sub-compartments of the , but the functions of these enzymes are poorly defined. Here, we used in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the interactomes of seven proteases localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). In total, we identified 802 high confidence proximity interactions with 342 unique proteins. While all seven proteases co-localized with the IMS markers OPA1 and CLPB, 230 of the interacting partners were unique to just one or two protease bait proteins, highlighting the ability of BioID to differentiate unique interactomes within the confined space of the IMS. Notably, high temperature requirement peptidase  (HTRA2) interacted with eight of 13 components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, a multiprotein assembly essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial cristae structure. Knockdown of HTRA2 disrupted cristae in HEK 293 and OCI-AML2 cells, and led to increased intracellular levels of the MIB subunit IMMT. Using a cell-free assay we demonstrate that HTRA2 can degrade recombinant IMMT but not two other core MIB complex subunits, SAMM50 and CHCHD3. Our IMS protease interactome thus represents a rich dataset that can be mined to uncover novel IMS protease biology. This article is protected by copyright.

New hypotheses have suggested that AD involves neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) presents anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. The present study evaluated the AuNP treatment on an AD model (okadaic acid, OA). Male Wistar rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with OA (100 μg); 24 h later they were treated with 20-nm AuNP (at a dose .5 mg/kg) every 48 h for 21 days. The following groups were separated (n = 12/group): Sham, AuNP, OA, and OA + AuNP. OA increases Tau phosphorylation in the cortex and hippocampus, while AuNP treatment maintained it as normal. Spatial memory was impaired by OA, and AuNP treatment prevented this deficit. Neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NGF- β) in the cortex and hippocampus were decreased by OA. The OA and OA + AuNP groups showed increased interleukin (IL)-1 β in the hippocampus and cortex, and the AuNP group showed increased IL-1 β in the hippocampus. In both groups, S100 levels in the cortex and hippocampus were increased by OA. IL-4 was increased in OA + AuNP animals. AuNPs prevented oxidative stress (sulfhydryl and nitrite levels) in brain structures induced by OA. Moreover, OA modulated ATP synthase activity, and AuNP maintained normal brain mitochondrial function. The antioxidant capacities were reduced by OA, and AuNP restored antioxidant status (SOD, catalase activities and GSH levels) on brain.

Platelets are one of the crucial factors for hemostasis and thrombosis. In terminally differentiated MKs many molecular process such as caspase activation and a massive cytoskeletal rearrangement drive the formation of cytoplasmic extensions called proplatelets. These cytoplasmic extensions packed with granules and organelles are then released from the bone marrow into the blood circulation as platelets. Classically, caspase activation is associated with apoptosis and recent reports suggest their involvement in cell differentiation and maturation. There is no clear evidence demonstrating the stimulus for caspase activation during megakaryocyte development. In the current study, we attempted to understand the importance of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the caspase activation during megakaryocyte maturation. We used human megakaryoblstic cell line (Dami cells) as an experimental model. We induced these cells with PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) a known inducer of megakaryocyte to understand the involvement of ER stress during maturation, with increased cell size in association with ER stress induced caspase activation. We used Thapsigargin, a non-competitive inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum CaATPase (SERCA) as a positive control to induce ER stress.Upon its treatment, we observed larger and adherent cells with the increased expression of megakaryocytic markers (CD41 and CD61) and UPR markers in PMA or Thapsigargin treated cells as compared to control. Also, Thapsigargin treatment induced increased caspase activity and PARP cleavage and showed decrease in ER calcium levels leading to reduced activity of calcium-dependent ER chaperones and accumulation of unfolded protein. The increased megakaryocyte maturation markers alongside with ER stress and caspase activation suggests the importance of ER stress in caspase activation during MK maturation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

Except that  times clinical dose of Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets could significantly reduce the content of CYP19 A1( P<0. 05) after 42 d administration,there were no significant changes in serum estrogen E2,FSH,LH and estrogen synthesis key enzymes CYP17 A1 in each administration group. Medium and high doses of Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets could increase the expression of apoptotic protein Bax in uterine and ovarian tissues( P<0. 05,P<0. 01),and all the administration groups could inhibit the expression of apoptotic inhibiting protein Bcl-( P <0. 05,P<0. 01,P<0.001),42 d was more obvious than 21 d. In conclusion,4 times and less than 4 times Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets did not cause obvious toxicity and histopathological changes in the reproductive organs of CIA rats,but it could reduce the level of serum estrogen synthesis key enzyme CYP19 A1 and affect the content of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl- in uterus and ovary tissues.

Here, we investigated its functions on -mediated apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. DAPI (4',6-diamidino--phenylindole) staining, annexin V-fluorexcein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection, and western blotting were applied to explore the apoptotic effect of Ivalin. Next, the induction effect of Ivalin on the mitochondrial pathway was also confirmed via a series of phenomena including the damage of  membrane potential,  cytochrome c escape, cleaved caspase-3 induction, and the reactive oxygen species generation. In this connection, we understood that Ivalin induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and the overload of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, we found that the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and subsequent p53 induction were associated with the apoptotic effect of Ivalin. These data confirmed that Ivalin might be a promising pro-apoptotic compound that can be utilized as a potential drug for clinical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607937>Excessive Accumulation of Ca in  of Y522S-RYR1 Knock-in Mice: A Link Between Leak From the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum and Altered Redox State.</a></h2><p>Mice (Y522S or YS), carrying a mutation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release channel of skeletal muscle fibers (ryanodine receptor type-1, RyR1) which causes Ca leak, are a widely accepted and intensively studied model for human malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility. Since the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and of  in MH crisis has been previously debated, here we sought to determine Ca uptake in  and its possible link with ROS production in single fibers isolated from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) of YS mice. We found that Ca concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, as detected with the ratiometric FRET-based 4mtD3cpv probe, was higher in YS than in wild-type (WT) fibers at rest and after Ca release from SR during repetitive electrical stimulation or caffeine administration. Also mitochondrial ROS production associated with contractile activity (detected with Mitosox probe) was much higher in YS fibers than in WT. Importantly, the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca uptake achieved by silencing MCU reduced ROS accumulation in the matrix and Ca release from SR. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS accumulation using Mitotempo reduced SR Ca release in YS fibers exposed to caffeine. The present results support the view that  take up larger amounts of Ca in YS than in WT fibers and that mitochondrial ROS production substantially contributes to the increased caffeine-sensitivity and to the enhanced Ca release from SR in YS fibers.Copyright © 2019 Canato, Capitanio, Cancellara, Leanza, Raffaello, Vecellio Reane, Marcucci, Michelucci, Protasi and Reggiani.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652711>Ubiquinol Supplementation Alters Exercise Induced Fatigue by Increasing Lipid Utilization in Mice.</a></h2><p>Ubiquinol (QH), a reduced form of coenzyme Q10, is a lipid antioxidant that is hydro-soluble and is commonly formulated in commercial supplements. Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group  (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634899>FSP1 is a glutathione-independent ferroptosis suppressor.</a></h2><p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of necrotic cell death marked by oxidative damage to phospholipids. To date, ferroptosis has been believed to be restrained only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH)-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs). The factors which underlie a given cell type's sensitivity to ferroptosis are, however, critical to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for cancer treatment. Although metabolic constraints and phospholipid composition contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been yet been identified that account for ferroptosis resistance. We undertook an expression cloning approach to identify genes able to complement GPX4 loss. These efforts uncovered the flavoprotein "apoptosis inducing factor -associated  (AIFM2)" as a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, hereafter renamed "ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1" (FSP1), initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene, confers an unprecedented protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that ferroptosis suppression by FSP1 is mediated via ubiquinone (CoQ): its reduced form ubiquinol traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, while FSP1 catalyses its regeneration by using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, FSP1/CoQ/NAD(P)H exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione (GSH) to suppress phospholipid peroxidation (pLPO) and ferroptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631063>Sirtuin 3 attenuates neuroinflammation-induced apoptosis in BV- microglia.</a></h2><p>In this study, we explored the upstream regulatory mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in microglial BV- cells. Our results demonstrate that Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) expression was downregulated in response to LPS-induced neuroinflammation. In addition, overexpression of Sirt3 attenuated LPS-induced BV- cell death. Functional studies illustrated that Sirt3 overexpression promoted normal mitochondrial function and inhibited -dependent apoptosis in LPS-treated BV- cells. At the molecular level, suppressor of ras val- (SRV2) promoted LPS-mediated mitochondrial damage by inducing mitochondrial fission. Sirt3 overexpression, which suppressed the transcription of SRV2 and thus suppressed mitochondrial fission, played an anti-apoptotic role in LPS-treated BV- cells. Furthermore, Sirt3 inhibited SRV2 expression via the Mst1-JNK pathway, and re-activation of this pathway abolished the protective effects of Sirt3 on mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that Sirt3-induced, Mst1-JNK-SRV2 signaling pathway-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial fission protected against neuroinflammation-mediated cell damage in BV- microglia. Sirt3 might therefore be an effective treatment for neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636081>Muscle Oxygen Supply and Use in Type 1 Diabetes, From Ambient Air to the Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain: Is There a Limiting Step?</a></h2><p>Long before clinical complications of type 1 diabetes (T1D) develop, oxygen supply and use can be altered during activities of daily life. We examined in patients with uncomplicated T1D all steps of the oxygen pathway, from the lungs to the , using an integrative ex vivo (muscle biopsies) and in vivo (during exercise) approach.We compared 16 adults with T1D with 16 strictly matched healthy controls. We assessed lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, exercise-induced changes in arterial O content (SaO, PaO, hemoglobin), muscle blood volume, and O extraction (via near-infrared spectroscopy). We analyzed blood samples for metabolic and hormonal vasoactive moieties and factors that are able to shift the O-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Mitochondrial oxidative capacities were assessed in permeabilized vastus lateralis muscle fibers.Lung diffusion capacity and arterial O transport were normal in patients with T1D. However, those patients displayed blunted exercise-induced increases in muscle blood volume, despite higher serum insulin, and in O extraction, despite higher erythrocyte ,3-diphosphoglycerate. Although complex I- and complex II-supported mitochondrial respirations were unaltered, complex IV capacity (relative to complex I capacity) was impaired in patients with T1D, and this was even more apparent in those with long-standing diabetes and high HbA. [Formula: see text]O was lower in patients with T1D than in the controls.Early defects in microvascular delivery of blood to skeletal muscle and in complex IV capacity in the mitochondrial respiratory chain may negatively impact aerobic fitness.

Hence, it is vital to determine the interactive effect of one pollutant with the other when they coexist in the environment. In the present study, the effect of antibiotic - tetracycline (TC) on the toxicity of P25 n-TiO was studied with marine microalgae, Chlorella sp. The impact of TC (1 mg L) on five different concentrations of n-TiO (0.25, 0.5, 1,  and 4 mg L) under both visible and UV-A illuminations was evaluated. Effective diameter of n-TiO in ASW at 0 h increased from 690.69 ± 19.55 nm (0.25 mg L) to 1183.04 ± 37.10 nm (0.25 mg L + 1 mg L) and 971.51 ± 14.61 nm (4 mg L) to 1324.12 ± 11.59 nm (4 mg L + 1 mg L) in presence of TC. A significant increase in the toxicity of 4 mg L n-TiO upon the addition of TC (68.16 ± 0.37% under visible and 80.21 ± 0.3% under UV-A condition) was observed. No significant difference in toxicity was observed between visible and UV-A illuminations. Further the toxicity data was corroborated through the measurement of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities. Independent action model showed antagonistic effect for lower concentrations of n-TiO and additive effect for higher concentrations of n-TiO when present in mixture with TC under both illuminations. For the higher mixture concentration of 4 mg L n-TiO and 1 mg L TC, the percentage TC removal was about 55.29% and 30% and the corresponding TOC removal was found to be 54.29% and 31.04% under visible and UV-A illuminations respectively. The site of ROS generation in Chlorella sp. was identified with electron transfer chain inhibitors. Both  and chloroplast acted as the site for the ROS generation in Chlorella sp. The SEM images of the algal cells upon exposure to n-TiO and mixture revealed the aggregation of cells and distortion of cell membrane.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Through its antioxidant activity, Isatis root polysaccharide (IRPS), a plant extract, can effectively reduce the cellular lipid peroxidation caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species inside . In the present study, there was examination of the effects of no supplementation (Control) of a semen extender with or supplementation in different concentrations of IRPS (0., 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. mg/mL) on sperm quality variables and antioxidant capacity during liquid storage. The results indicate that after prolonged storage (≥ 3 days), the sperm motility was greater in the group supplemented with 0.6 mg/mL IRPS than in the other groups (P <  0.05). The use of this IRPS concentration also resulted in maintanence of acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and antioxidant capacity of the sperm (P <  0.05). Furthermore, the results of an in vitro fertilization study indicate IRPS at 0.6 mg/mL markedly increased the sperm fertilization capacity (P <  0.01) and embryonic development to the blastocyst stage (P <  0.05). The addition of 0.6 mg/mL IRPS enhanced the antioxidant capacity of boar sperm, resulting in greater preservation of sperm motility and fertilization capacity during liquid storage. These findings indicate that IRPS has the potential to be used as a component of a semen-preserving diluent to maintain sperm quality during storage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In high glucose (HG)-treated podocytes, mitochondrial function and dynamics are abnormal, and intracellular metabolism is often disrupted. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier  (MPC2) mediates pyruvate transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix, which determines the cellular energy supply and cell survival. Here, we hypothesize that MPC2 damages  and induces apoptosis in HG-treated podocytes.We used Western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation to detect the expression of MPC2 in HG-treated podocytes. Pyruvate levels were measured to evaluate metabolic station. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured by inverted fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Mitochondrial morphology was assayed by MitoTracker Red staining, and cellular apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we treated podocytes with UK5099 and MPC2 siRNA to assess the outcomes of UK5099 treatment and MPC2 knockdown.Intracellular pyruvate accumulated, the  were damaged and cellular apoptosis increased in podocytes cultured with HG compared to that in control podocytes. MPC2 acetylation was significantly increased in HG-treated podocytes. Furthermore, the mitochondrial morphology changed, the MMP decreased, and cellular apoptosis increased. Inhibition of MPC2 function by UK5099 or MPC2 knockdown by siRNA produced the same abnormal effects observed following treatment with HG.MPC2 may mediate mitochondrial dysfunction in HG-treated podocytes, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± , - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in  and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

In this study, we sought to investigate its anticancer mechanisms in a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901 cells) and human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa cells). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that XSD-7 induced cytotoxicity in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.12 ± 0.05 µM, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies proved that XSD-7 inhibited microtubule polymerization during cell division in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells. Then, these cells were arrested at G2/M cell cycle and subsequently progressed into apoptosis. In further study, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis and Western blot analysis demonstrated that XSD-7 treatment-induced SGC-7901 cell apoptosis via both the -mediated pathway and the death receptor-mediated pathway. In contrast, XSD-7 induced apoptosis in HeLa cells mainly via the -mediated pathway.

We previously reported the reduction of RNA binding protein HuD in pancreatic β-cells of diabetes. Herein, we demonstrate that HuD plays a novel role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial fusion. We show enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation in the pancreas of db/db mice and HuD KO mice. Downregulation of HuD increases the number of cells with fragmented  and reduces the mitochondrial activity determined by mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in mouse insulinoma βTC6 cells. HuD binds to 3'-untraslated region of mitofusin  (Mfn2) mRNA and positively regulates its expression. Ectopic expression of Mfn2 in βTC6 cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA against HuD (shHuD) restores HuD-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.

Analyses of the available ,161 complete mitochondrial genomes of 1,042 fishes, including 115 deep-sea species, detect signals of positive selection in mitochondrial genes in nine branches of deep-sea fishes. Aerobic metabolism yields much more energy  unit of source material than anaerobic metabolism. The adaptive evolution of the mtDNA may reflect that aerobic metabolism plays a more important role than anaerobic metabolism in deep-sea fishes, whose energy sources (food) are extremely limited. This strategy maximizes the usage of energy sources. Eleven mitochondrial genes have convergent/parallel amino acid changes between branches of deep-sea fishes. Thus, these amino acid sites may be functionally important in the acquisition of energy, and reflect convergent evolution during their independent invasion of the harsh deep-sea ecological niche.Copyright © 2019 Shen, Pu, Chen, Murphy and Shen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584202>The combined inhibition of the CaMKIIδ and calcineurin signaling cascade attenuates IGF-IIR-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</a></h2><p>Cardiac hypertrophy is a common phenomenon observed in progressive heart disease associated with heart failure. Insulin-like growth factor receptor II (IGF-IIR) has been much implicated in myocardial hypertrophy. Our previous studies have found that increased activities of signaling mediators, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin induces pathological hypertrophy. Given the critical roles played by CaMKII and calcineurin signaling in the progression of maladaptive hypertrophy, we anticipated that inhibition of CaMKII and calcineurin signaling may attenuate IGF-IIR-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The current study, therefore, investigated the effects of IGF-IIR activation on the CaMKII and calcineurin signaling and whether the combinatorial inhibition of the CaMKIIδ and calcineurin signaling could ameliorate IGF-IIR-induced pathological hypertrophy. In the present study, we induced IGF-IIR through the cardiomyocyte-specific transduction of IGFII via adeno-associated virus  (AAV2) to evaluate its effects on cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, it was observed that the activation of IGF-IIR signaling through IGFII induces significant hypertrophy of the myocardium and increased cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. Moreover, we found that Leu IGF-II significantly induced calcineurin and CaMKII expression. Furthermore and importantly, the combinatorial treatment with CaMKII and calcineurin inhibitors significantly alleviates IGF-IIR-induced hypertrophic responses. Thus, it could be envisaged that the inhibition of IGF-IIR may serve as a promising candidate for attenuating maladaptive hypertrophy. Both calcineurin and CaMKII could be valuable targets for developing treatment strategies against hypertension-induced cardiomyopathies.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669736>Deferiprone and efonidipine mitigated iron-overload induced neurotoxicity in wild-type and thalassemic mice.</a></h2><p>We previously demonstrated that iron-overload in non-thalassemic rats induced neurotoxicity and cognitive decline.

Furthermore, a T-type calcium channels blocker (efonidipine) effectively attenuates cardiac dysfunction in thalassemic mice with iron-overload. However, the effects of both drugs on brain of iron-overload thalassemia has not been determined. We hypothesize that iron-overload induces neurotoxicity in Thalassemic and wild-type mice, and not only deferiprone, but also efonidipine, provides neuroprotection against iron-overload condition.Mice from both wild-type (WT) and β-thalassemic type (HT) groups were assigned to be fed with a standard-diet or high-iron diet containing 0.% ferrocene/kg of diet (HFe) for 4 months consecutively. After three months of HFe, 75-mg/kg/d deferiprone or 4-mg/kg/d efonidipine were administered to the HFe-fed WT and HT mice for 1 month.HFe consumption caused an equal impact on circulating iron-overload, oxidative stress, and inflammation in WT and HT mice. Brain iron-overload and iron-mediated neurotoxicity, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, glial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Alzheimer's like pathologies, were observed to an equal degree in HFe fed WT and HT mice. These pathological conditions were mitigated by both deferiprone and efonidipine.These findings indicate that iron-overload itself caused neurotoxicity, and T-type calcium channels may play a role in this condition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Changes in mitochondrial architecture affect cellular migration, autophagy and apoptosis. Silibinin is reported to have anti-breast cancer effect. We here report that silibinin at lower concentrations (30-90 μM) inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MDA-MB-231, by increasing the expression of epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and decreasing the expression of mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and vimentin. Besides, silibinin inhibition of cell migration is associated with reduction in the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases  and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9) and paxillin. In addition, silibinin treatment increases mitochondrial fusion through down-regulating the expression of mitochondrial fission-associated protein dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and up-regulating the expression of mitochondrial fusion-associated proteins, optic atrophy 1, mitofusin 1 and mitofusin . Silibinin perturbed mitochondrial biogenesis via down-regulating the levels of mitochondrial biogenesis regulators including mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC1) and nuclear respiratory factor (NRF2). Moreover, DRP1 knockdown or silibinin inhibited cell migration, and MFN1& knockdown restored it. Mitochondrial fusion contributes to silibinin's negative effect on cell migration. Silibinin decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, leading to inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, knockdown of mitofusin 1& (MFN 1&) relieved silibinin-induced inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Repression of ROS contributes to the inhibition of the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-β proteins as well as of cell migration.

Clenbuterol was administered to rats via drinking water (30 mg/L) for 3 weeks. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform composition, mitochondrial morphology, and fusion and fission regulatory protein levels in deep region and superficial region in tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were assessed. Clenbuterol induced the fiber type transition from slow to fast in both the regions of TA. The levels of optic atrophy protein 1, mitofusin , and mitochondrial fission 1, but not of dynamin-related protein 1, significantly decreased in deep and superficial muscles after clenbuterol administration (P < 0.01). Also, observation using the transmission electron microscopy showed a decrease in mitochondrial volume (P < 0.05) and an increase in proportion of continuous or interacting  across Z-lines (P < 0.05). We showed that clenbuterol administration induces a transition in the muscle fiber type composition toward fast phenotype and causes alterations in mitochondrial morphology with a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial fusion and fission regulatory protein levels. These mitochondrial morphological alterations may influence deleterious effects on skeletal muscle metabolism.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we test the hypothesis that cells exhibiting distinct forms of synaptic plasticity will have differences in dendritically localized RNAs. Indeed, we discover that each major subregion of the adult mouse hippocampus expresses a unique complement of dendritic RNAs. Specifically, we describe more than 1,000 differentially expressed dendritic RNAs, suggesting that RNA localization and local translation are regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, by focusing Gene Ontology analyses on the plasticity-resistant CA2, we identify an enrichment of -associated pathways in CA2 cell bodies and dendrites, and we provide functional evidence that these pathways differentially influence plasticity and mitochondrial respiration in CA2. These data indicate that differences in dendritic transcriptomes may regulate cell type-specific properties important for learning and memory and may influence region-specific differences in disease pathology.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646528>Calcium Channels and Calcium-Regulated Channels in Human Red Blood Cells.</a></h2><p>Free Calcium (Ca) is an important and universal signalling entity in all cells, red blood cells included. Although mature mammalian red blood cells are believed to not contain organelles as Ca stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum or , a 20,000-fold gradient based on a intracellular Ca concentration of approximately 60 nM vs. an extracellular concentration of 1. mM makes Ca-permeable channels a major signalling tool of red blood cells. However, the internal Ca concentration is tightly controlled, regulated and maintained primarily by the Ca pumps PMCA1 and PMCA4. Within the last two decades it became evident that an increased intracellular Ca is associated with red blood cell clearance in the spleen and promotes red blood cell aggregability and clot formation. In contrast to this rather uncontrolled deadly Ca signals only recently it became evident, that a temporal increase in intracellular Ca can also have positive effects such as the modulation of the red blood cells O binding properties or even be vital for brief transient cellular volume adaptation when passing constrictions like small capillaries or slits in the spleen. Here we give an overview of Ca channels and Ca-regulated channels in red blood cells, namely the Gárdos channel, the non-selective voltage dependent cation channel, Piezo1, the NMDA receptor, VDAC, TRPC channels, Ca.1, a Ca-inhibited channel novel to red blood cells and i.a. relate these channels to the molecular unknown sickle cell disease conductance P. Particular attention is given to correlation of functional measurements with molecular entities as well as the physiological and pathophysiological function of these channels. This view is in constant progress and in particular the understanding of the interaction of several ion channels in a physiological context just started. This includes on the one hand channelopathies, where a mutation of the ion channel is the direct cause of the disease, like Hereditary Xerocytosis and the Gárdos Channelopathy. On the other hand it applies to red blood cell related diseases where an altered channel activity is a secondary effect like in sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Also these secondary effects should receive medical and pharmacologic attention because they can be crucial when it comes to the life-threatening symptoms of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619992>Neoantimycin F, a -Derived Natural Product Induces -Related Apoptotic Death in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>-derived natural products have been become a major focus of anti-tumor drug discovery studies. Neoantimycin F (NAT-F), was isolated from  by our group. Here, we examined the anti-cancer activities and its underlying molecular mechanisms implicated in NAT-F-induced apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Our results showed that NAT-F exerted excellent growth-inhibitory activity against PC9 and H1299 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. NAT-F-induced cell cycle arrest at S and G/G phase in PC9 and H1299 cells, respectively. Further investigation revealed that the key proteins (including cyclinD1, cyclinE1, cyclinB1, CDK2, and CDK4) were involved in the cell regulation by NAT-F. Additionally, NAT-F significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induced DNA damage, nuclear condensation, and cell apoptosis in both cell lines. Moreover, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was markedly induced by NAT-F. Additional results revealed that NAT-F could up-regulate pro-apoptotic protein Bax and down-regulate anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-, Mcl-1, and Bcl-x, resulting in cytochrome c release from  and sequential activation of caspase-9 and -3, as well as the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Meanwhile, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK (p38), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway were also involved in anti-cancer activity of NAT-F in NSCLC cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that NAT-F possessed anti-proliferative effect and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells  and may be conducive to promote the development of novel anti-NSCLC agents.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Zhu, Wu, Shen, Lin, Wu, Liu, Tang, Zhou, Sun and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632295>Low-Intensity Running and High-Intensity Swimming Exercises Differentially Improve Energy Metabolism in Mice With Mild Spinal Muscular Atrophy.</a></h2><p>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of spinal-cord motor-neurons, is caused by mutations on Survival-of-Motor Neuron (SMN)-1 gene. The expression of , a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy metabolism, like glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of lipid metabolism with an enhancement of lipogenesis and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high lipid oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle , we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of  and complexes expression and () a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653119>Pathophysiology of Calcium Mediated Ventricular Arrhythmias and Novel Therapeutic Options with Focus on Gene Therapy.</a></h2><p>Cardiac arrhythmias constitute a major health problem with a huge impact on mortality rates and health care costs.

These synapses are defined by electron-dense presynaptic structures called ribbons, composed primarily of the structural protein Ribeye. Previous work has shown that voltage-gated influx of Ca through Ca1.3 channels is critical for hair-cell synapse function and can impede ribbon formation. We show that in mature zebrafish hair cells, evoked presynaptic-Ca influx through Ca1.3 channels initiates mitochondrial-Ca (mito-Ca) uptake adjacent to ribbons. Block of mito-Ca uptake in mature cells depresses presynaptic Ca influx and impacts synapse integrity. In developing zebrafish hair cells, mito-Ca uptake coincides with spontaneous rises in presynaptic Ca influx. Spontaneous mito-Ca loading lowers cellular NAD/NADH redox and downregulates ribbon size. Direct application of NAD or NADH increases or decreases ribbon size respectively, possibly acting through the NAD(H)-binding domain on Ribeye. Our results present a mechanism where presynaptic- and mito-Ca couple to confer proper presynaptic function and formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590128>HIF-1α/BNIP3 signaling pathway-induced-autophagy plays protective role during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.</a></h2><p>The study was established to inquire into the protective effect of the HIF-1α (Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α)/ BNIP3(Bcl-/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein) signal path-induced-autophagy during myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R) injury in heart-derived H9C2 cells as well as its potential underlying mechanism.Immediate myocardial I/R in SD (Spraque Dawley) rats and cytotoxicity of OGD/R injury on H9C2 cells with and without inhibitors or agonists of HIF-1α and BNIP3 were evaluated. Expression of mitochondrial autophagic protein were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. And the mitochondrial autophagosome were detected using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).I/R and OGD/R injury increased the expression level of HIF-1α, activated the downstream BNIP3 and subsequently triggered -dependent autophagy. Up-regulation the expression of HIF-1α and BNIP3 may promote the cardiac myocytes of SD rats of I/R injure and OGD/R injury-induced autophagy of H9C2 cells. Moreover, down-regulation the expression of HIF-1α or BNIP3-siRNA decreased H9C2 cells autophagy under OGD/R injury.Together, our studies indicated that HIF-1α synchronization regulate BNIP3 during OGD/R injury-induced autophagy in H9C2 cells, though BNIP3-induced autophagy acting as a survival mechanism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It has been reported that molecules such as liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) inhibit ferroptosis and promote cell survival however, the mechanisms underlying this action are not clearly understood. We investigated the role and mechanism of Lip-1 in reducing cell death in the ischemic myocardium. Using an I/R model of isolated perfused mice hearts in which Lip-1 was given at the onset of reperfusion, we found that Lip-1 protects the heart by reducing myocardial infarct sizes and maintaining mitochondrial structural integrity and function. Further investigation revealed that Lip-1-induced cardioprotection is mediated by a reduction of VDAC1 levels and oligomerization, but not VDAC2/3. Lip-1 treatment also decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and rescued the reduction of the antioxidant GPX4 caused by I/R stress. Meanwhile, mitochondrial Ca retention capacity needed to induce mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening did not change with Lip-1 treatment. Thus, we report that Lip-1 induces cardioprotective effects against I/R injury by reducing VDAC1 levels and restoring GPX4 levels.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

There is discussion about whether mitochondrial matrix Ca dynamics always mirror the cytoplasmic changes and whether this happens in vivo in whole organisms. In this study, we characterized cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca signals during spontaneous skeletal muscle contractions in zebrafish embryos expressing bioluminescent GFP-aequorin (GA, cytoplasm) and mitoGFP-aequorin (mitoGA, trapped in the mitochondrial matrix). The Ca transients measured with GA and mitoGA reflected contractions of the trunk observed by transmitted light. The mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP and the inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), DS16570511, abolished mitochondrial Ca transients whereas they increased the frequency of cytosolic Ca transients and muscle contractions, confirming the subcellular localization of mitoGA. Mitochondrial Ca dynamics were also determined with mitoGA and were found to follow closely cytoplasmic changes, with a slower decay. Cytoplasmic Ca kinetics and propagation along the trunk and tail were characterized with GA and with the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca indicator, Twitch-4. Although fluorescence provided a better spatio-temporal resolution, GA was able to resolve the same kinetic parameters while allowing continuous measurements for hours.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585135>Disease modifying mitochondrial uncouplers, MP101, and a slow release ProDrug, MP201, in models of Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS and here we tested if brain penetrant mitochondrial uncouplers, DNP (MP101) and a novel prodrug of DNP (MP201), have the pharmacology to suppress demyelination and axonal loss in two independent models of MS by modulating the entire organelle's physiology. First, the gold standard EAE mouse model for MS was evaluated by daily oral treatment Day 7-21 with either MP101 or MP201 post-immunization. Both MP101/MP201 significantly suppressed progression of paralysis with limited infiltration of inflammatory cells. Strikingly, although mitochondrial uncouplers do increase energy expenditure even at the low doses provided here, they paradoxically preserved body weight at all doses in comparison to wasting in advanced paralysis of the placebos. Second, the effects of the compounds on suppressing inflammation were also evaluated in the cuprizone model, independent of the immune system. MP101/MP201 had a striking effect preserving both myelination and protecting the axons, in comparison to the placebos where both were destroyed. Both MP101/MP201 induced a significant and sustained increase in neurotrophin, BDNF, in the spinal cords. Both MP101/MP201 suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS. Results indicate that MP101/MP201 may be a "disease modifying" treatment for MS by specifically modulating mitochondrial physiology. This would be a completely novel treatment for MS, targeting the  directly using a unique platform, mitochondrial uncouplers, that initially act non-genomically based upon biophysics, but cascades into cellular remodeling, neuroprotection and pro-survival.

Our previous study demonstrated thymoquinone (TQ) attenuated monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim of the present study is to systematically examine inhibitory effects of TQ on platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs in vitro and neointimal formation in vivo and elucidate the potential mechanisms. Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the aorta in rats. Cell viability and proliferation were measured in VSMCs using the MTT assay. Cell migration was detected by wound healing assay and Transwell assay. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Ki-67-positive cells were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry and terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. Molecules including the -dependent apoptosis factors, matrix metalloproteinase  (MMP2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), PTEN/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were determined by Western blot. Neointimal formation was induced by ligation in male Sprague Dawley rats and evaluated by HE staining. Thymoquinone inhibited PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation and the increase in α-SMA and Ki-67-positive cells. Thymoquinone also induced apoptosis via -dependent apoptosis pathway and p38MAPK. Thymoquinone blocked VSMC migration by inhibiting MMP2. Finally, TQ reversed neointimal formation induced by ligation in rats. Thus, TQ is a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of occlusive vascular diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for  months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1. increase versus 0., p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of  bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We used these novel targeting peptides to develop green- and red- Ca biosensors targeted to the IMS and to the CL. Based on their distinctive spectral properties, and comparable sensitivities these novel constructs were suitable to visualize Ca-levels in various (sub) compartments in a multi-chromatic manner. Functional studies that applied these new biosensors revealed that knockdown of MCU and EMRE yielded elevated Ca levels inside the CL but not the IMS in response to IP-generating agonists. Knockdown of VDAC1, however, strongly impeded the transfer of Ca through the OMM while the cytosolic Ca signal remained unchanged. The novel sub-mitochondrially targeted Ca biosensors proved to be suitable for Ca imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution in a multi-chromatic manner allowing simultaneous measurements.

Therefore, colorectal cancer research and cases have gained increasing attention. Oxaliplatin (OXA) is currently used in first-line chemotherapy to treat stage III and stage IV metastatic CRC. However, patients undergoing chemotherapy often develop resistance to chemo drugs being used. Evidence has confirmed that microRNAs regulate downstream genes in cancer biology and thereby have roles related to tumor growth, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and multi-drug resistance. The aim of our study is to establish whether miR-31-5p is an oncogene in human colorectal cancers that are resistant to OXA and further confirm its malignant phenotype-associated target molecule. From the results of miRNA microarray assay, we establish that miR-31-5p expression was upregulated in oxaliplatin-resistant (OR)-LoVo cells compared with parental LoVo cells. Moreover, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that miR-31-5p and large tumor suppressor kinase  (LATS2) were inversely related and that miR-31-5p and Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) were positively correlated in the same LoVo or OR-LoVo cells. Importantly, we reveal a novel drug-resistance mechanism in which the transcription factor FOXC1 binds to the miR-31 promoter to increase the expression of miR31-5p and regulate LATS2 expression, resulting in cancer cell resistance to OXA. These results suggest that miR-31-5p may be a novel biomarker involved in drug resistance progression in CRC patients. Moreover, the FOXC1/miR31-5p/LATS2 drug-resistance mechanism provides new treatment strategies for CRC in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649547>Mitophagy in Hepatic Insulin Resistance: Therapeutic Potential and Concerns.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by central obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease, type  diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic diseases.

Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway.  are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged  to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632863>Juvenile Parkinson Disease.</a></h2><p>Juvenile Parkinson's disease (JPD) is a rare movement disorder that presents before the age of 21 years.

However, the specific participants and precise mechanisms underlying this apoptotic pathway are poorly understood. The proapoptotic proteins Bak and Bax-members of the Bcl- family-are essential for the functioning of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout Bak in the human SH-SY5Y cell line and determined the effects of this knockout on TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis. Our data showed that overexpression of Bcl- dramatically prevented TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis, and then pro-apoptotic protein Bak was downregulated and became more resistant to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis, because both TNF/CHX-induced PARP cleavage and caspase activation were blocked in BAK-/- cells or using specific siRNA, whereas Bax was dispensable in TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis, as evidenced using specific siRNA. Bax translocated from the cytosol into the  in response to TNF/CHX, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of Bak significantly decreased this translocation. These results indicate that TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis does not occur in Bak-/- cells, suggesting that TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis is Bak-dependent but Bax-independent.Copyright © 2019 Jingtian Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583037>Crosstalk between Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Autophagy in Skeletal Muscle.</a></h2><p>Autophagy is responsible for the maintenance of skeletal muscle homeostasis, thanks to the removal of aberrant and dysfunctional macromolecules and organelles. During fasting, increased autophagy ensures the maintenance of the amino acid pool required for energy production. The activity of the mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU), the highly selective channel responsible for mitochondrial Ca uptake, controls skeletal muscle size, force, and nutrient utilization. Thus, both autophagy and mitochondrial Ca accumulation play a pivotal role to maintain muscle homeostasis and to sustain muscle function. Here, we address whether, in skeletal muscle, mitochondrial Ca uptake and autophagy are mutually related. Muscle-restricted MCU silencing partially inhibits the autophagy flux. Moreover, skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg7, known to cause the accumulation of dysfunctional , drastically reduces mitochondrial Ca accumulation. Thus, a vicious cycle takes place, in which reduced MCU activity hampers the autophagic flux, and loss of autophagy further impairs mitochondrial Ca signaling.Copyright © 2019 Gaia Gherardi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660648>Impact of alpha-tocopherol deficiency and supplementation on sacrocaudalis and gluteal muscle fiber histopathology and morphology in horses.</a></h2><p>A subset of horses deficient in alpha-tocopherol (α-TP) develop muscle atrophy and vitamin E-responsive myopathy (VEM) characterized by mitochondrial alterations in the sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis muscle (SC).To quantify muscle histopathologic abnormalities in subclinical α-TP deficient horses before and after α-TP supplementation and compare with retrospective (r)VEM cases.Prospective study; 16 healthy α-TP-deficient Quarter Horses.

Muscle fiber morphology and mitochondrial alterations were compared in samples from days 0 and 56 and in rVEM cases.Mitochondrial alterations more common than our reference range (<.5% affected fibers) were present in 3/8 control and 4/8 treatment horses on day 0 in SC but not in GM (mean, .; range, 0%-10% of fibers). Supplementation with α-TP for 56 days did not change the percentage of fibers with mitochondrial alterations or anguloid atrophy, or fiber size in GM or SC. Clinical rVEM horses had significantly more mitochondrial alterations (rVEM SC, 13% ± 7%; GM, 3% ± %) and anguloid atrophy compared to subclinical day 0 horses.Clinically normal α-TP-deficient horses can have mitochondrial alterations in the SC that are less severe than in atrophied VEM cases and do not resolve after 56 days of α-TP supplementation.

Mitochondrial-DNA was investigated for deletions and copy number variation.We found decreased levels of complex IV in the cerebellar Purkinje neurons of mice exposed to cuprizone. This decrease was not related to a general decrease in mitochondrial volume or mass, as there were no differences in the levels of complex I or TOMM20.Neurons are affected by cuprizone-treatment.

Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest  play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting  are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, gossypol acetate, Yougui pill, T- toxin, grifolic acid, cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin.

Macrophages are well-known for their pathogenic role in kidney fibrosis. Here, we report that PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in macrophages is compromised in experimental and human kidney fibrosis. We demonstrate downregulation of mitophagy regulators, mitofusin- (MFN2) and Parkin, downstream of PINK1 in kidney fibrosis. Loss of either Pink1 or Prkn promoted renal extracellular matrix accumulation and frequency of profibrotic/M2 macrophages. Pink1-/- or Prkn-/- bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed enhanced expression of rictor.  from TGF-β1-treated Pink1-/- BMDMs exhibited increased superoxide levels, and reduced respiration and ATP production. In addition, mitophagy in macrophages involves PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream MFN2 and MFN2-facilitated recruitment of Parkin to damaged , and macrophage-specific deletion of Mfn2 aggravates kidney fibrosis. Moreover, mitophagy regulators were downregulated in human CKD kidney and TGF-β1-treated human renal macrophages, whereas Mdivi1 treatment suppressed mitophagy mediators and promoted fibrotic response.

Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH- from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH- (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the  were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH- should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679456></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640957>[Interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cell death induced by dexamethasone].</a></h2><p>To investigate the relationship between necroptosis and apoptosis in MCET3-E1 cell death induced by glucocorticoids.MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated with 10-6 mol/L dexamethasone followed by treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (40 μmol/L) or the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (40 μmol/L) for  h.

The presence of TBT resulted in an upregulation of enzymes related to energy production via cellular respiration. The unique overexpression of NADH dehydrogenase and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, together with an increased level of cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthase subunits, and inorganic pyrophosphatase, indicates a strong energy deficit in the cells, leading to an increase in the ATP production. The overexpression of Prohibitin-1, a multifunctional protein associated with the proper functioning of , was observed as well. The data also revealed oxidative stress condition. Among reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes, only superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed active response against oxidative stress induced by the xenobiotic. The induction of a series of ROS-scavenging enzymes was supported by a microscopic analysis revealing a considerably large concentration of ROS in the hyphae.

The ER stress pathway is therefore a promising therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease. Although  saponins (PNS) are one of the patent medicines that are traditionally used to treat cardiovascular disorders, their effects on ER stress in cardiac myocytes remain unexploited so far. This study investigates the effects of PNS on ER stress and its associated cell apoptosis along with the related mechanism in cardiac myocytes. PNS compounds were identified  high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) assay. PNS-pretreated H9c2 cells, HL-1 cells, and primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were stimulated with thapsigargin (TG) to induce ER stress response and apoptosis. ER stress response was tested by immunofluorescence or immunoblot of the ER protein chaperones-calnexin, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Cell viability was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by immunoblot of Cleaved caspase-3 and flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Cytosolic, mitochondrial, and ER calcium dynamics were investigated by calcium imaging. Moreover, a ryanodine receptor type- (RyR) overexpression stable cell line was generated to verify the mechanism of RyR involved in PNS in the inhibition of ER stress and cell apoptosis. We demonstrate here that PNS protected cardiac myocytes from ER stress response and associated cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, PNS reduced the elevation of cytosolic calcium,  calcium, as well as ER calcium in response to either TG or histamine treatment. PNS protection in ER stress was regulated by RyR expression. In summary, PNS protection against TG-induced ER stress response and its associated cell apoptosis in cardiac myocytes is calcium dependent. Through the regulation of ER calcium release mediated by RyR, a novel mechanism for PNS in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases is thereby identified.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Xue, Li, Xiao, Shangguan, Zhang, Bai, Liu and Li.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632331>Energy Metabolism and Redox State in Brains of Wistar Audiogenic Rats, a Genetic Model of Epilepsy.</a></h2><p>The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a genetic model of epilepsy, specifically brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures, triggered by acute auditory stimulation. Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher oxygen consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino acids transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler ,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610192>Ellagic acid improves muscle dysfunction in cuprizone-induced demyelinated mice via mitochondrial Sirt3 regulation.</a></h2><p>Sirt3 enzyme and mitochondrial abnormality can be related to excess fatigue or muscular dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS).Ellagic acid (EA) has a mitochondrial protector, iron chelator, antioxidant, and axon regenerator in neurons.In this study the effect of EAon muscle dysfunction, its , and Sirt3 enzyme incuprizone-induced model of MSwas examined.

Here, the importance of NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) in TRPM2-mediated suppression of oxidant stress was explored. In TRPM2 depleted cells, antioxidant cofactors glutathione, NADPH, and NADH were significantly reduced. Cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Nrf2 and of IQGAP1, a modulator of Nrf2 stability regulated by intracellular calcium, were decreased. Antioxidant enzymes transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 and involved in GSH, NADPH, and NADH generation were significantly lower including PRX1 and PRX3, GPX4, GSTP1, GCLC, and MTHFD2. The glutamine pathway leading to GSH production was suppressed, and ATP and GTP levels were impaired. Reconstitution with wild type TRPM2 or Nrf2, but not TRPM2 pore mutant E960D, rescued expression of enzymes downstream of Nrf2 and restored GSH and GTP.

To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for 5 weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods.

Icariin has been shown to exert a protective effect on human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accordingly has implications for the prevention and treatment of IVDD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action are not fully established. In this study, the mechanisms underlying its protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced oxidative stress injury were investigated. In vitro, we demonstrated that icariin inhibits HO-induced -mediated apoptosis. It upregulates oxidative stress mediators, i.e., reactive oxygen species, and downregulates mitochondrial membrane potential. Nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf-) is a key factor involved in the regulation of the endogenous defense system. It was proved that icariin could activate the Nrf- signaling pathway, upregulate the protein expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 and the mitochondrial transcription factor, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in human NP cells. An Nrf- agonist and inhibitor promoted or partly abolished the protective effects of icariin on mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the Nrf- signaling pathway could be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, icariin ameliorated IVDD in a rat model by promoting Nrf- activity, and preserving extracellular matrix in NP cells. These data suggest that icariin could ameliorate IVDD in rat models in vivo. In summary, the protective effects of icariin on human NP cells may suppress the pathogenesis of IVDD via the Nrf- signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the Nrf- signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IVDD.Copyright © 2019.

Transient receptor potential melastatin  (TRPM2) channel is a Ca permeable cation channel that can be activated by HO and plays an important role in cellular functions. It is also able to promote susceptibility to cell death. We studied expression and functionality of TRPM2 in KGN cells and examined GCT tissue microarrays (TMAs) to explore in vivo relevance. We employed live cell, calcium and mitochondrial imaging, viability assays, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We confirmed that KGN cells produce HO and found that they express functional TRPM2. HO increased intracellular Ca levels and N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), a TRPM2 inhibitor, blocked this action. HO caused mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptotic cell death, which could be attenuated by a scavenger (Trolox). Immunohistochemistry showed parallel expression of NOX4 and TRPM2 in all 73 tumor samples examined. The results suggest that GCTs can be endowed with a system that may convey susceptibility to cell death. If so, induction of oxidative stress may be beneficial in GCT therapy.

Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and  through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the  to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino--phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). From the above, our research indicates that CA is a promising antifungal candidate when applied to C. albicans infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652767>Evidence for Nanoparticle-Induced Lysosomal Dysfunction in Lung Adenocarcinoma (A549) Cells.</a></h2><p>Polystyrene nanoparticles (PNP) are taken up by primary rat alveolar epithelial cell monolayers (RAECM) in a time-, dose-, and size-dependent manner without involving endocytosis. Internalized PNP in RAECM activate autophagy, are delivered to lysosomes, and undergo [Ca]-dependent exocytosis. In this study, we explored nanoparticle (NP) interactions with A549 cells.After exposure to PNP or ambient pollution particles (PM0.), live single A549 cells were studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy. PNP uptake and egress were investigated and activation of autophagy was confirmed by immunolabeling with LC3-II and LC3-GFP transduction/colocalization with PNP. Mitochondrial membrane potential, mitophagy, and lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) were assessed in the presence/absence of apical nanoparticle (NP) exposure.PNP uptake into A549 cells decreased in the presence of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of macropinocytosis. PNP egress was not affected by increased cytosolic [Ca]. Autophagy activation was indicated by increased LC3 expression and LC3-GFP colocalization with PNP. Increased LMP was observed following PNP or PM0. exposure. Mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged and mitophagy was not detected after NP exposure.Interactions between NP and A549 cells involve complex cellular processes leading to lysosomal dysfunction, which may provide opportunities for improved nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to lung cancer management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614134>Reduction of Rpd3 suppresses defects in locomotive ability and neuronal morphology induced by the knockdown of Drosophila SLC25A46 via an epigenetic pathway.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction causes various diseases. Mutations in the SLC25A46 gene have been identified in mitochondrial diseases that are sometimes classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type , optic atrophy, and Leigh syndrome. A homolog of SLC25A46 was identified in Drosophila and designated as dSLC25A46 (CG5755). We previously established mitochondrial disease model targeting of dSLC25A46, which causes locomotive dysfunction and morphological defects at neuromuscular junctions, such as reduced synaptic branch lengths and decreased numbers of boutons. The diverse symptoms of mitochondrial diseases carrying mutations in SLC25A46 may be associated with the dysregulation of some epigenetic regulators. To investigate the involvement of epigenetic regulators in mitochondrial diseases, we examined candidate epigenetic regulators that interact with human SLC25A46 by searching Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We discovered that HDAC1 binds to several SLC25A46 genomic regions in human cultured CD4 (+) cells, and attempted to prove this in an in vivo Drosophila model. By demonstrating that Rpd3, Drosophila HDAC1, regulates the histone H4K8 acetylation state in dSLC25A46 genomic regions, we confirmed that Rpd3 is a novel epigenetic regulator modifying the phenotypes observed with the mitochondrial disease model targeting of dSLC25A46. The functional reduction of Rpd3 rescued the deficient locomotive ability and aberrant morphology of motoneurons at presynaptic terminals induced by the dSLC25A46 knockdown. The present results suggest that the inhibition of HDAC1 suppresses the pathogenic processes that lead to the degeneration of motoneurons in mitochondrial diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cells that survive increased ROS often undergo malignant transformation. Many cancer cells tolerate high levels of ROS. Here we report a transiently increased production of HO and concomitant upregulation of antioxidative enzymes triggered by hepatocyte isolation; the HO levels revert in about two days in culture. Three-day survival rate of the isolated cells in the presence of .5-fold increase of HO is almost 80%. Apoptosis activation through the mitochondrial pathway is meanwhile reduced by inhibition of caspase-9 triggering. This reduction depends on the amount of HO production, as decreased production of HO in the presence of an antioxidant results in increased apoptosis triggering. These stress adaptations do not influence urea production, which is unchanged throughout the normal and stress adapted phases. We conclude that hepatocytes' stress adaptation is mediated by increased ROS production. In this case, high ROS improve cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677478>Visualizing Dynamic Performance of Lipid Droplets in a Parkinson's Disease Model via a Smart Photostable Aggregation-Induced Emission Probe.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease affected by diverse factors, and lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly recognized as major players in PD because of their relevance to neuron activity. However, long-term dynamic changes of LDs and their relative activity remain unclear. Here, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe named -DPAN was prepared and employed to visualize dynamic processes of LDs in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD for the first time, and LDs' accumulation-peak/plateau-decrease were confirmed. We further found a close relationship between LDs and variation in mitochondrial activity. Strikingly, the progression of cell death was accelerated by lipase, whereas pre-stimulation of LDs by unsaturated fatty acid-oleic acid decreased the death process by inhibiting excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fatty acid production, thereby protecting . The utilization of -DPAN demonstrates the importance of LDs in neuronal homeostasis, and effective tuning of LDs may prevent or inhibit PD progression.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Adherence to a Mediterranean diet reduces the incidence and severity of coronary artery disease, whereas supplementation with nitrate can improve submaximal exercise performance. Once ingested, oral commensal bacteria may reduce nitrate to nitrite, which may subsequently be reduced to nitric oxide during conditions of hypoxia and in the presence of "nitrite reductases" such as heme- and molybdenum-containing enzymes.We aimed to explore the putative effects of inorganic nitrate and nitrite on mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle.Mice were subjected to a nitrate/nitrite-depleted diet for  wk, then supplemented with sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, or sodium chloride (1 g/L) in drinking water ad libitum for 7 d before killing. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and expression of uncoupling protein (UCP) 3, ADP/ATP carrier protein (AAC) 1 and AAC2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were assessed by respirometry and Western blotting. Studies were also undertaken in human skeletal muscle biopsies from a cohort of coronary artery bypass graft patients treated with either sodium nitrite (30-min infusion of 10 μmol/min) or vehicle [0.9% (wt:vol) saline] 24 h before surgery.Neither sodium nitrate nor sodium nitrite supplementation altered mitochondrial coupling efficiency in murine skeletal muscle, and expression of UCP3, AAC1, or AAC2, and PDH phosphorylation status did not differ between the nitrite and saline groups. Similar results were observed in human samples.Sodium nitrite failed to improve mitochondrial metabolic efficiency, rendering this mechanism implausible for the purported exercise benefits of dietary nitrate supplementation.

It is well recognized that autophagy can regulate endothelial cell homeostasis, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype transition, and calcium (Ca) homeostasis in VSMCs. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that autophagy directly protects against vascular calcification (VC). Crosstalk between endosomes, dysfunctional , autophagic vesicles and Ca and phosphate (Pi) enriched matrix vesicles (MVs) may underpin the pathogenesis of VC. In this review, we summarize the current experimental evidence in understanding how autophagy maintains normal vascular cell function and its protective role against vascular calcification. We also discuss the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms through which autophagy inhibits vascular calcification.

The pathogenesis underlying LGMD-related cardiomyopathy remains unclear. NRIP (gene name DCAF6), a Ca-dependent calmodulin binding protein, was reduced in dystrophic muscles from LGMD patients. Mice lacking NRIP exhibit a myopathic phenotype resembling that in LGMD patients, making NRIP deficiency a potential culprit leading to cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to determine if NRIP deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.NRIP expression was reduced in both human and mouse failing hearts. Muscle-specific NRIP knockout (MCK-Cre::Dcaf6) mouse heart and isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly reduced contractility. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal sarcomere structures and mitochondrial morphology in MCK-Cre::Dcaf6 hearts. Protein co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging revealed that NRIP interacts with α-actinin  (ACTN2) at the Z-disc. We found that NRIP facilitated ACTN2-mediated F-actin bundling, and that NRIP deficiency resulted in reduced binding between Z-disc proteins ACTN2 and Cap-Z. In addition, NRIP-deficiency led to increased mitochondrial ROS and impaired mitochondrial respiration/ATP production owing to elevated cellular NADH/NAD ratios. Treatment with -directed antioxidant mitoTEMPO or NAD precursor nicotinic acid restored mitochondrial function and cardiac contractility in MCK-Cre::Dcaf6 mice.NRIP is essential to maintain sarcomere structure and mitochondrial/contractile function in cardiomyocytes. Our results revealed a novel role for NRIP deficiency in the pathogenesis of LGMD and heart failure. Targeting NRIP, therefore, could be a powerful new approach to treat myocardial dysfunction in LGMD and heart failure patients.Copyright © 2019.

In Experiment 1, assessment of cell membrane integrity by trypan blue exclusion staining was used to select the best cryoprotectant solution for each cryopreservation method. Primary growth (PG) oocytes showed the best percentage of membrane integrity (63.5 ± .99%) when SF4 solution ( M methanol + 0.1 M trehalose + 10% egg yolk solution) was employed.

Experiment  aimed to compare the vitrification and slow freezing techniques in the following parameters: morphology, oxidative stress, mitochondrial activity, and DNA damage. Frozen ovarian tissue showed higher ROS levels and lower mitochondrial activity than vitrified ovarian tissue.

Here, we found that HBV X protein (HBx) natural variants containing Ser-101 instead of Pro-101 increase reactive oxygen species levels in the  and activate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated/checkpoint kinase  pathway in the nucleus, resulting in the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20 and the subsequent upregulation of its protein levels. Therefore, HBx variants containing Ser-101 induced p53-dependent activation of PA28γ expression in human hepatoma cells. The elevated PA28γ levels upregulated HBx levels through the inhibition of seven in absentia homologue 1-dependent proteasomal degradation. The self-amplifying ability of HBx variants containing Ser-101 via a positive feedback loop involving p53 and PA28γ was accurately reproduced in both a 1.-mer HBV replicon and  HBV infection systems, which also provided evidence for the stimulation of HBV replication by these HBx variants.

Thus, it is vitally important to develop facile, rapid and accurate analytical methods for the detection of HClO/ClO- in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we have constructed three meso-substituted BODIPY selenides with different hydrocarbyl groups (ethyl for BSe-Et, benzyl for BSe-Bz and phenyl for BSe-Ph) as fluorescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO-. All three non-fluorescent probes can sense HClO/ClO- to form fluorescent selenoxides by blocking the photo-induced electron transfer process. Their sensing properties display a clear relationship with the structure of the hydrocarbyl. The sensing reactivity is heavily dependent on the electron-donating ability of hydrocarbyls, with the order of the response time as BSe-Et ( s) < BSe-Bz (5 s) ≪ BSe-Ph (>100 s). Both BSe-Et and BSe-Bz afford a large fluorescence response and very low detection limits (0.3 nM and 0.8 nM), and BSe-Bz displays a higher selectivity over BSe-Et.

In this study, the structure and composition of APS was determined, following the evaluation of in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of APS targeted macrophages and host immune system based on immunoregulated strategy. The results indicated that APS had no direct cytotoxicity against 4T1 cells, but APS mediated macrophages could significantly inhibit the growth of 4T1 cells by the induction of cell cycle arrest (G2 phase) and cell apoptosis. APS mediated macrophages promoted the apoptosis of 4T1 cells mainly through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The in vivo findings demonstrated that APS could markedly improve the thymus index and spleen index, and restore the structure of the damaged thymus and spleen tissue. APS could significantly enhance the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes and increase phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages in mice. Furthermore, APS was capable of up-regulating the expression of IL-, TNF-α and IFN-γ in peripheral blood.

Although the treatment outcomes of HNSCC have improved in recent years, the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage disease remains poor. Current treatment strategies for HNSCC include surgery as a primary therapy, while radio-, chemo-, and biotherapeutics can be applied as second-line therapy. Although tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a potent tumor suppressor cytokine, the stimulation of opposing signals impairs its clinical utility as an anticancer agent. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms regulating TNF-α‑induced opposing signals and their biological consequences in HNSCC cell lines. We determined the molecular mechanisms of TNF-α-induced opposing signals in HNSCC cells. Our in vitro analysis indicated that one of these signals triggers apoptosis, while the other induces both apoptosis and cell survival. The TNF-α-induced survival of HNSCC cells is mediated by the TNF receptor-associated factor  (TRAF2)/nuclear factor (NF)-κB-dependent pathway, while TNF-α-induced apoptosis is mediated by mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms through FADD-caspase-8-caspase-3 and ASK-JNK-p53-Noxa pathways. The localization of Noxa protein to both the  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was found to cause mitochondrial dysregulation and ER stress, respectively. Using inhibitory experiments, we demonstrated that the FADD‑caspase-8‑caspase-3 pathway, together with mitochondrial dysregulation and ER stress-dependent pathways, are essential for the modulation of apoptosis, and the NF-κB pathway is essential for the modulation of anti-apoptotic effects/cell survival during the exposure of HNSCC cells to TNF-α.

It is well known that  are the most vulnerable targets of heavy metals, but the key molecule/event that directly mediated mitochondrial dysfunction after Cr(VI) exposure is still unclear. The present study was aimed to explore whether Cr(VI) exposure could affect the mitochondrial fission/fusion process, and whether the related abnormal mitochondrial dynamics have been implicated in Cr(VI)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Cr(VI) exposure was characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRCC) I/II activities and levels, collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), depleted ATP, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Cr(VI) induced abnormal mitochondrial fission/fusion events, the antioxidant Nacetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) restored the abnormal mitochondrial function as well as the fission/fusion dynamics. ROS was the up-stream regulator of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling, and the application of a specific ERK1/ inhibitor PD98059 confirmed that activation of ERK1/ signaling was associated with the abnormal mitochondrial fission/fusion and mitochondrial dysfunction. We also demonstrated that treatment with dynamic-like protein 1 (DLP1)-siRNA rescued mitochondrial dysfunction in Cr(VI)-exposed L02 hepatocytes. We reached the conclusion that blockage of ROS-ERK-DLP1 signaling and mitochondrial fission alleviates Cr(VI)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in L02 hepatocytes, which may provide the new avenue for developing effective strategies to protect against Cr(VI)-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The nucleoside analogues resemble naturally occurring nucleosides and act by causing termination of the nascent DNA chain. These agents are generally safe and well tolerated as they are used by the viral, but not human polymerases in DNA replication. Actually, nucleoside analogues are a large class of agents that include drugs for cancer (cytarabine, gemcitabine, mercaptopurine), rheumatologic diseases (azathioprine, allpurinol) and even bacterial infections (trimethoprim). The nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV infection are often referred to as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, they have activity against both DNA dependent and RNA dependent DNA polymerases. They are believed to inhibit viral replication by several mechanisms, either by competitive inhibition of the viral polymerase or by DNA chain termination. Many of the antiviral nucleoside analogues are blocked at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleic acid, which results in failure of elongation of the nascent DNA molecule. Other antiviral nucleoside analogues are negative enantiomers (L-forms: lamivudine, emtricitabine, telbivudine) of the natural (D-form) nucleosides and interfere with replication, partially because of steric hindrance when they are taken up by the viral polymerase or added to the DNA molecule. Nucleoside analogues that are phosphorylated at the 5’ site are often referred to as nucleotide analogues, but this distinction is artificial as these agents (tenofovir, adefovir) are also nucleoside analogues. These features of the structure of nucleoside analogues are important because of the danger that they might be used by human polymerases and incorporated into RNA or DNA, which is the basis of the serious toxicities of the nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues can cause liver injury by several mechanisms. Most characteristic is a mitochondrial type of hepatic injury that is probably caused by the nucleoside analogue becoming incorporated into or blocking mitochondrial DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial gamma polymerase, leading to a depletion of  or decrease in their function. Mitochondrial injury can affect multiple tissues thereby causing myopathy, neuropathy, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic injury. The hepatic injury is characterized by accumulation of lactic acidosis, microvesicular steatosis and hepatic synthetic failure (LASH). Serum aminotransferase levels may be minimally elevated and jaundice arises late. The most dramatic example of hepatic mitochondrial injury occurred with the drug fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analogue that was withdrawn after several fatalities due to hepatic failure, lactic acidosis and pancreatitis arising  to 3 months after initiation of therapy during phase  trials in humans. A similar, but rare and less dramatic and partially reversible hepatic mitochondrial injury has been linked to use of didanosine (dideoxyinosine: ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytine: ddC), stavudine (d4T) and less commonly to zidovudine (AZT).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598384>The size of cell-free mitochondrial DNA in blood is inversely correlated with tumor burden in cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Circulating cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) are fragmented DNA molecules released into the blood by cells.

However, it is still unknown where these short mt-cfDNAs originate, and whether the length of mt-cfDNAs can be correlated with tumor burden and cancer progression. In this study, we first performed whole-genome sequencing analysis (WGS) of cfDNAs from a human tumor cell line-xenotransplantation mouse model and found that mt-cfDNAs released from transplanted tumor cells were shorter than the mouse counterpart. We next analyzed blood cfDNA samples from hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer patients and found that mt-cfDNA lengths were inversely related to tumor size as well as the concentration of circulating tumor DNA.

In the rat SCN neurons, the clearance of somatic Ca following depolarization-induced Ca transients involves Ca extrusion via Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and mitochondrial Ca buffering. Here we show an important role of intracellular Na in the regulation of [Ca] in these neurons. The effect of Na loading on [Ca] was determined with the Na ionophore monensin and the cardiac glycoside ouabain to block Na/K-ATPase (NKA). Ratiometric Na and Ca imaging was used to measure the change in [Na] and [Ca], and cell-attached recordings to investigate the effects of monensin and ouabain on spontaneous firing. Our results show that in spite of opposite effects on spontaneous firing and basal [Ca], both monensin and ouabain induced Na loading, and increased the peak amplitude, slowed the fast decay rate, and enhanced the slow decay phase of 20 mM K-evoked Ca transients. Furthermore, both ouabain and monensin preferentially enhanced nimodipine-insensitive Ca transients.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), induces the injury of vascular endothelial cells via oxidative stress. Oxymatrine (OMT), one of the main components of Sophora flavescens, has displayed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activity. However, the effect of OMT on the Hcy-induced endothelial injury is not clearly defined yet. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of OMT on the Hcy-induced endothelial injury and its mechanisms involved. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in vitro. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay (MTT), fluorescence staining, flow cytometry and western blotting were used in this study. OMT prevented the Hcy-induced toxicity and apoptosis in HUVECs. Moreover, OMT suppressed Hcy-induced increases in reactive oxygen species, lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde levels and increased superoxide dismutase levels. OMT reversed the Hcy-induced decrease in the protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid--related factor  (Nrf2). In addition, OMT reversed the Hcy-induced apoptosis related biochemical changes such as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and Bcl-/Bax protein ratio, and increased protein expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, OMT elevated the phosphorylation levels of Akt and eNOS, and the formation of nitric oxide (NO) in injured cells. These results suggest that OMT prevents Hcy-induced endothelial injury by regulating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and Akt-eNOS-NO signaling pathways concomitantly with accentuation of Nrf2 expression.Copyright © 2019.

Despite these enchanted features, there are many hurdles that need to be circumvented to ensure their long-term survival and viability after transplantation. Recently, hypoxia has been indicated as one of the most baffling stress conditions that can affect the survival rate of MSCs either positively or negatively depending on the level of hypoxia. MSCs can survive well under moderate hypoxia, but die shortly if they were exposed to severe hypoxia without clearly convincing explanation for this enigma. The current study reveals a novel mechanism of 26S proteasome in controlling the ability of BM-MSCs to withstand hypoxic stress by maintaining proper mitochondrial function. The results indicated that 26S proteasome remains functioning once BM- MSCs are exposed to moderate hypoxia (.5%O) and preserves their survival and proliferation mediated by intact mitochondrial performance, whereas 26S proteasome becomes inactive when BM-MSCs faces severe hypoxia that lead to poor mitochondrial function and less chance to survive longer. The outcomes of this study demonstrated the importance of 26S proteasome machinery in enhancing the resistance of BM-MSCs to hypoxic stress condition which may help in better planning future studies that target this system. Schematic representation summarizing the findings of the current study. 26S proteasome function preservation in normoxia and moderate hypoxia leads to maintain appropriate proliferation and mitochondrial activity in human BM-MSCs and promote their survival. On the opposite side, severe hypoxia disrupts the 26S proteasome function leading to significant reduction in the proliferation, survival and mitochondrial dynamics in human BM-MSCs causing their death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597260>Bio-Mediated Synthesis and Characterisation of Silver Nanocarrier, and Its Potent Anticancer Action.</a></h2><p>Discovery of a potent drug nanocarrier is crucial for cancer therapy in which drugs often face challenges in penetrating efficiently into solid tumours. Here, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a waste material,  (GM) fruit peel extract is demonstrated. The best condition for AgNPs synthesis was with 0.5 g of peel extract, 7.5 mM silver nitrate at 45 °C, ~pH 4 for 16 h. The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and 32.7 ± 5.7 nm in size. To test its efficiency to be used as drug carrier, plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was used as a test drug. AgNPs loaded with PCA (AgPCA) resulted in 80% of inhibition at 15.6 µg/mL as compared to AgNPs which only killed 5% of HCT116 colorectal cells at same concentration. The IC of AgNPs and AgPCA for HCT116 were 40. and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. At 15.6 µg/mL, AgPCA was not toxic to the tested colon normal cells, CCD112. Ag-based drug carrier could also potentially reduce the toxicity of loaded drug as the IC of PCA alone (148.1 µg/mL) was higher than IC of AgPCA (10.7 µg/mL) against HCT116. Further, 24-h treatment of 15.6 µg/mL AgPCA resulted in loss of membrane potential in the  of HCT116 cells and increased level of reaction oxygen species (ROS). These could be the cellular killing mechanisms of AgPCA. Collectively, our findings show the synergistic anticancer activity of AgNPs and PCA, and its potential to be used as a potent anticancer drug nanocarrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618661>Coenzyme Q10 mitigates ionizing radiation-induced testicular damage in rats through inhibition of oxidative stress and -mediated apoptotic cell death.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy is a common treatment modality for cancer patients; however, its use is limited by decreasing the probability of fertility in male cancer survivors. Therefore, this study aimed to define the capability of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a potent stimulator of mitochondrial function, in attenuating ionizing radiation (IR)-induced spermatogenesis impairments. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to a single dose of ϒ-rays (10 Gy) and/or treated with CoQ10 (10 mg/kg, orally, for  consecutive weeks). IR mediated irregular seminiferous tubules, which were emerged with typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis, and nuclear condensation, while CoQ10 significantly preserved the testicular structure and maintained spermatogenesis, which was displayed by higher levels of serum estradiol and testosterone. CoQ10 remarkably augmented sperm count, motility, and viability while diminished the rate of sperm-defects relatively to their counterparts after IR exposure. CoQ10 modulations in reproductive parameters were underpinned by attenuating IR-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by decreasing lipid peroxidation and increasing the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase activities, and glutathione level. Supporting the involvement of CoQ10 in the anti-apoptotic response, the reduced mRNA expression levels of p53, Puma, and Bax accompanied by the increased Bcl- mRNA expression were observed. Subsequently, CoQ10 ameliorated the  dependent apoptotic pathway through diminishing Bax/Bcl- ratio, caspase-3 protein expression, and DNA fragmentation in testes of irradiated rats. Taken together, our findings showed that CoQ10 conserved against IR-induced steroidogenesis disruption through subsiding -mediated oxidative stress injury in germinal cells.Copyright © 2019.

SNK-6 cells were treated with 30μmol/L Z-VAD-FMK (Pan-caspase inhibitor)+3ng/mL bortezomib, and 5, 10 μmol/L BAY11-7082+3 ng/mL bortezomib for 24 h respectively, then the cell viability was measured by CCK8 kit. After treatment of SNK-6 cells with different mass concentrations of bortezomib for 24 h, apoptosis was detected by AnnexinⅤ/PI flow cytometry; the expression of apoptosis-related protein Caspase-3, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Bcl- and NF-κB signaling pathway key proteins P65 and P100/P52 were detected by Western blot.Bortezomib inhibited the proliferation of SNK-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( <0.05), and IC ( (.87±0.06) ng/mL) at 24 h was lower than that at 48 h and 72 h ( <0.05). BAY11-7082 also inhibited the proliferation of SNK-6 cells with an IC = (9.73±0.36) μmol/L at 24 h. The combination treatment indicated that Z-VAD-FMK could attenuate the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on the proliferation of SNK-6 cells ( <0.05), while BAY11-7082 could enhance the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on the proliferation of SNK-6 cells ( <0.05). After treatment of SNK-6 cells with bortezomib for 24 h, apoptosis-related protein Caspase-3 cleavage, PARP activation, and Bcl- cleavage; NF-κB signaling pathway-related protein P65 phosphorylation level decreased, and P52 decreased.Bortezomib inhibits ENKTL cells proliferation by inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway and induces apoptosis of ENKTL cells via -mediated caspase pathway.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667843>Towards a plant model for enigmatic U-to-C RNA editing: the organelle genomes, transcriptomes, editomes and candidate RNA editing factors in the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis.</a></h2><p>•Hornworts are crucial to understand the phylogeny of early land plants.

C-to-U RNA editing is well understood after identification of many editing factors in models like Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens but there is no plant model yet to investigate U-to-C RNA editing.

We have used the Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique to measure transport of Na, K, H, Cl, NH  and Ca across the nuchal organ and body surface of embryos and neonates bathed in dechlorinated Hamilton tap water. Influx of Na and efflux of H and NH  were measured across the nuchal organ of both embryos and neonates. We propose that the efflux of K and Cl across the nuchal organ in embryos is related to the expansion of the haemocoel and release of intracellular solutes into the extracellular space during development. K is taken up across the nuchal organ later during development, coincident with expansion of the intracellular compartment through development of gills and other organs. Ca influx across the nuchal organ and body surface of neonates but not embryos is presumably related to calcification of the exoskeleton. Increases in the levels of Na and Ca in the water within the brood chamber suggests maternal provisioning of ions for uptake by the embryos. Our data thus support roles of the nuchal organ in ionoregulation, pH regulation, and nitrogenous waste excretion.© 2019.

Although many biological properties of chrysoeriol have been reported, such as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, the effects of chrysoeriol on the cellular models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether chrysoeriol prevents neurotoxicity induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP) in SH-SY5Y cells, a typical in vitro PD model. The cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The morphological changes of apoptotic cell nuclei were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. The expression of Bax, Bcl- and Caspase-3 were detected by western blot analysis. The  location in the cells was observed by Mitotracker staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by the JC-10 assay. Treatment with MPP significantly caused a decrease in the viability of cells and an increase in apoptosis, as evidenced by the upregulation of apoptotic cells, caspase-3 activity and antiapoptotic ratio. These effects were all reversed by pretreatment with chrysoeriol in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, pretreatment with chrysoeriol markedly mitigated the MPP-caused increases in the levels of the prosurvial signaling proteins, phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR. The presence of a specific PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, particularly abolished the chrysoeriol-induced activation of Akt phosphorylation and prevented the chrysoeriol-induced survival effect. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of chrysoeriol against MPP treatment requires the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Ultimately, chrysoeriol could be a promising therapeutic agent for the further experiment on the treatment of PD.Copyright © 2019.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type  diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced  release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647942>The compartmentalised nature of the mechanisms governing superoxide formation and scavenging in cells exposed to arsenite.</a></h2><p>In this study, respiration-proficient (RP) and -deficient (RD) cells were exposed to .5 or 10 μM arsenite to generate superoxide (O) respectively in the mitochondrial respiratory chain or via NADPH oxidase activation. These treatments, while causing similar, although mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent (RP-cells) or independent (RD-cells), delayed apoptosis, surprisingly generated identical kinetics and levels of dihydrorhodamine oxidation, indicative of O formation. These similarities were attributable to the involvement of a common upstream event resulting in activation of the two O-generating systems, and to intrinsic features of the cells. Both mechanisms required an initial and sequential mobilization of Ca from the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), with however different implications. The close contacts existing between the RyR and the  created optimal conditions for the Ca clearance, and the ensuing formation of O in RP-cell . Exposure to low concentrations of l-ascorbic acid (AA) transported by high affinity mechanisms in cells and , suppressed O formation. Much more Ca, and hence more arsenite, was necessary to promote NADPH oxidase activation in RD-cells, as a consequence of the cytosolic dilution and mitochondrial clearance of Ca. For the same reasons, an exposure to high concentrations of AA was required to suppress O formation under these conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To gain metabolic insight into this differential response, metabolome changes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were determined following short-term (0.5 and 3.0 h) vs. prolonged freezing (5.5 and 10.5 h) at -4.5°C resulting in reversible or irreversible injury, respectively. LD , the freezing duration causing 50% injury, was estimated to be ~3.1 h, and defined as the threshold beyond which tissues were irreversibly injured. From 39 identified metabolites, 19 were selected and clustered into 3 groups: (1) signaling-related (salicylic acid, aliphatic and aromatic amino acids), () injury-related (GABA, lactic acid, maltose, fatty acids, policosanols, TCA intermediates), and (3) recovery-related (ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol). Initial accumulation of salicylic acid during short-term freezing followed by a decline may be involved in triggering tolerance mechanisms in moderately injured tissues, while its resurgence during prolonged freezing may signal programmed cell death. GABA accumulated with increasing freezing duration, possibly to serve as a 'pH-stat' against cytoplasmic acidification resulting from lactic acid accumulation.  seems to be more sensitive to prolonged freezing than chloroplast since TCA intermediates decreased after LD while salicylic acid and maltose, produced in chloroplast, accumulate even at 10.5-h freezing. Fatty acids and policosanols accumulation with increasing freezing duration indicates greater injury to membrane lipids and epicuticular waxes. Ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol accumulated after short-term freezing, supposedly facilitating recovery while their levels decreased in irreversibly injured tissues.

The study was to investigate their role in cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanism. Isolated hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were Langendorff-perfused and cardiac I/R was achieved by 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Different concentrations of polyamines (0.1, 1, 10, and 15 μmol/L of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), cyclosporin A (0. μmol/L), or atractyloside (20 μmol/L) were given 10 min before the onset of reperfusion. The hemodynamics were monitored; the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the coronary effluent were measured spectrophotometrically; infarct size was determined by the ,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method; and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening was determined spectrophotometrically by the Ca-induced swelling of isolated cardiac . The results showed that compared to I/R alone, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment improved heart function, reduced LDH release, decreased infarct size, and these effects were inhibited by atractyloside (MPTP activator). In isolated  from normal rats, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment inhibited MPTP opening. However, 10 and 15 μmol/L polyamines treatment had the opposite effects, and these effects were inhibited by cyclosporin A (MPTP inhibitor). Our findings showed that polyamines may have either protective or damaging effects on hearts suffering from I/R by inhibiting or activating MPTP opening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581413>Carbon Monoxide Partially Mediates Protective Effect of Resveratrol Against UVB-Induced Oxidative Stress in Human Keratinocytes.</a></h2><p>Based on the antioxidative effect of resveratrol (RES) in mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through the induction of nuclear factor-erythroid -related factor- (Nrf2)/heme oxigenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, we investigated whether the protective activity of RES against ROS-mediated cytotoxicity is mediated by intracellular carbon monoxide (CO), a product of HO-1 activity, in ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. The cells were exposed to UVB radiation following treatment with RES and/or CO-releasing molecule- (CORM-). RES and/or CORM- upregulated HO-1 protein expression, accompanied by a gradual reduction of UVB-induced intracellular ROS levels. CORM- reduced intracellular ROS in the presence of tin protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, indicating that the cytoprotection observed was mediated by intracellular CO and not by HO-1 itself. Moreover, CORM- decreased RES-stimulated mitochondrial quantity and respiration and increased the cytosolic protein expressions of radical-scavenging superoxide dismutases, SOD1 and SOD2. Taken together, our observations suggest that RES and intracellular CO act independently, at least partly, in attenuating cellular oxidative stress by promoting antioxidant enzyme expressions and inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in UVB-exposed keratinocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609634>Gemini-based lipoplexes complement the mitochondrial phenotype in MFN1-Knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</a></h2><p> form a dynamic network of constantly dividing and fusing organelles. The balance between these antagonistic processes is crucial for normal cellular function and requires the action of specialized proteins. The mitochondrial membrane proteins Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and Mitofusin  (Mfn2) are responsible for the fusion of the outer membrane of adjacent . Mutations within Mfn1 or Mfn2 impair mitochondrial fusion and lead to some severe mitochondrial dysfunctions and mitochondrial diseases (MD). A characteristic phenotype of cells carrying defective Mfn1 or Mfn2 is the presence of a highly fragmented mitochondrial network. Here, we use a biocompatible mixture of lipids, consisting on synthetic gemini cationic lipids (GCL) and the zwitterionic phospholipid (DOPE), to complex, transport and deliver intact copies of MFN1 gene into MFN1-Knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MFN1-KO MEFs). We demonstrate that the GCL/DOPE-DNA lipoplexes are able to introduce the intact MFN1 gene into the cells and ectopically produce functional Mfn1. A four-fold increase of the Mfn1 levels is necessary to revert the MFN1-KO phenotype and to partially restore a mitochondrial network. This phenotype complementation was correlated with the transfection of GCL/DOPE-MFN1 lipoplexes that exhibited a high proportion of highly packaged hexagonal phase.

A large part of these alterations is due to dysfunctional Ca-storing organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and . Very recently, lysosomal Ca dysfunction has emerged as an important pathological change leading to neuronal loss in ALS. Remarkably, the Ca-storing organelles are interacting with each other at specialized domains controlling mitochondrial dynamics, ER/lysosomal function, and autophagy. This occurs as a result of interaction between specific ionic channels and Ca-dependent proteins located in each structure. Therefore, the dysregulation of these ionic mechanisms could be considered as a key element in the neurodegenerative process.

We have reported that thiol oxidation of ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) by -derived reactive oxygen species (mito-ROS) contributes to defective Ca homeostasis in cardiomyocytes (CMs) from aging rabbit hearts. However, mechanisms responsible for the increase in mito-ROS in the aging heart remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that age-associated decrease in autophagy is a major contributor to enhanced mito-ROS production and thereby pro-arrhythmic disturbances in Ca homeostasis.Ventricular tissues from aged rabbits displayed significant downregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial autophagy compared with tissues from young controls. Blocking autophagy with chloroquine increased total ROS production in primary rabbit CMs and mito-ROS production in HL-1 CMs. Furthermore, chloroquine treatment of HL-1 cells depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) to 50% that of controls. Blocking autophagy significantly increased oxidation of RyR2, resulting in enhanced propensity to pro-arrhythmic spontaneous Ca release under β-adrenergic stimulation. Aberrant Ca release was abolished by treatment with the mito-ROS scavenger mito-TEMPO. Importantly, the autophagy enhancer Torin1 and ATG7 overexpression reduced the rate of mito-ROS production and restored both Δψm and defective Ca handling in CMs derived from aged rabbit hearts.Decreased autophagy is a major cause of increased mito-ROS production in the aging heart. Our data suggest that promoting autophagy may reduce pathologic mito-ROS during normal aging and reduce pro-arrhythmic spontaneous Ca release via oxidized RyR2s.Copyright © 2019 Murphy, Baggett, Cooper, Lu, O-Uchi, Sedivy, Terentyev and Koren.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614705>The Beige Adipocyte as a Therapy for Metabolic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is traditionally categorized into white and brown relating to their function and morphology.

Therefore, targeting the mitochondrial Ca signaling involved in the bioenergetic and apoptotic pathways could serve as potential approaches to treat cancer patients. This chapter will review the role of Ca signaling in mediating the function of the  and its involvement in health and disease with special focus on the pathophysiology of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590697>Germ plasm-related structures in marine medaka gametogenesis; novel sites of Vasa localization and the unique mechanism of germ plasm granule arising.</a></h2><p>Germ plasm, a cytoplasmic factor of germline cell differentiation, is suggested to be a perspective tool for in vitro meiotic differentiation. To discriminate between the: (1) germ plasm-related structures (GPRS) involved in meiosis triggering; and () GPRS involved in the germ plasm storage phase, we investigated gametogenesis in the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma. The GPRS of the mitosis-to-meiosis period are similar in males and females. In both sexes, five events typically occur: (1) turning of the primary Vasa-positive germ plasm granules into the Vasa-positive intermitochondrial cement (IMC); () aggregation of some  by IMC followed by arising of mitochondrial clusters; (3) intramitochondrial localization of IMC-originated Vasa; followed by (4) mitochondrial cluster degradation; and (5) intranuclear localization of Vasa followed by this protein entering the nuclei (gonial cells) and synaptonemal complexes (zygotene-pachytene meiotic cells). In post-zygotene/pachytene gametogenesis, the GPRS are sex specific; the Vasa-positive chromatoid bodies are found during spermatogenesis, but oogenesis is characterized by secondary arising of Vasa-positive germ plasm granules followed by secondary formation and degradation of mitochondrial clusters. A complex type of germ plasm generation, 'the follicle cell assigned germ plasm formation', was found in late oogenesis. The mechanisms discovered are recommended to be taken into account for possible reconstruction of those under in vitro conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646532>ER- Calcium Transfer, Organelle Contacts and Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>It is generally accepted that interorganellar contacts are central to the control of cellular physiology. Virtually, any intracellular organelle can come into proximity with each other and, by establishing physical protein-mediated contacts within a selected fraction of the membrane surface, novel specific functions are acquired. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contacts with  are among the best studied and have a major role in Ca and lipid transfer, signaling, and membrane dynamics.Their functional (and structural) diversity, their dynamic nature as well as the growing number of new players involved in the tethering concurred to make their monitoring difficult especially in living cells. This review focuses on the most established examples of tethers/modulators of the ER- interface and on the roles of these contacts in health and disease by specifically dissecting how Ca transfer occurs and how mishandling eventually leads to disease. Additional functions of the ER- interface and an overview of the currently available methods to measure/quantify the ER- interface will also be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667715>Resveratrol Activates Neuronal Autophagy Through AMPK in the Ischemic Brain.</a></h2><p>During cerebral ischemia, oxygen and glucose levels decrease, producing many consequences such as the generation of reactive oxygen species, tissue injury, and the general metabolism collapse. Resveratrol triggers signaling dependent on the protein kinase activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMPK), the sensor of cellular energy metabolism that regulates autophagy, eliminates damaged , and increases energy sources. In the present study, we investigated the participation of AMPK activation in the protective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity. We found that resveratrol increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in primary cultured neurons exposed to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Resveratrol (1.8 mg/Kg; i. v.; administered at the beginning of reperfusion) decreased the infarct area and increased survival of rats subjected to MCAO. In neuronal cultures, resveratrol treatment (40 μM, after excitotoxicity) reduced the production of superoxide anion, prevented the overload of intracellular Ca associated to mitochondrial failure, reduced the release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and reduced death. It also promoted mitophagy (increased Beclin 1 level, favored the recruitment of LC3-II, reduced LAMP1, and reduced mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60 levels). In both models, inhibition of AMPK activation with Compound C obstructed the effect of resveratrol, showing that its protective effect depends, partially, on the activation of the AMPK/autophagy pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610358>Roles of mtDNA damage and disordered Ca homeostasis in the joint toxicities of cadmium and BDE209.</a></h2><p>Cadmium, a typical heavy metal, causes serious toxicities on many organs and tissues.

Although apoptosis mediated by  has been known to be a key player in inducing toxicities by cadmium, the detailed mechanisms are incompletely understood. Moreover, co-existence of cadmium and PBDEs has been found in various environment context and human body. However, studies on the joint toxicity of cadmium and PBDEs are still limited with largely unknown mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the adverse effects and mechanisms of single or combined treatment of CdCl and BDE209 on hepatocytes. We observed that apoptosis were significantly induced by CdCl, and the combined treatment of CdCl and BDE209 greatly promoted the progression of apoptosis. BDE209 induced mild apoptosis.  was the pivot of several mechanisms to induce apoptosis, including ROS production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mtDNA damage and disordered calcium (Ca) homeostasis. However, we found that mtDNA damage and disordered Ca homeostasis were the main mechanisms for CdCl-induced apoptosis while ROS production played important roles in BDE209-induced apoptosis. Less mtDNA damage occurred in BDE209-treated cells. In the cells with combined treatment, CdCl and BDE209 exhibited a complementary pattern for the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis, leading to the joint toxicities, in which CdCl showed more contributions. In a conclusion, our results demonstrated that combined exposure to cadmium and BDE209 causes joint adverse effects on hepatocytes through diverse mechanisms as mediated by .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

At 28 days of age, sixty broilers were randomly divided into the control group (25 ±  °C; 24 h/day) and the heat stress group (36 ±  °C; 8 h/day lasted for 1 week or  weeks). Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress. A typical heat stress response has been observed at this temperature. Compared with the control group, the birds subjected to heat stress at the end of the 1st week reduced (P ＜ 0.05) body weight (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), the activity of serum antioxidant enzyme and content of glutathione (GSH), while increased (P ＜ 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P ＞ 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change. Moreover, heat stress also did not affect (P ＞ 0.05) the IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in the pectorales, crureus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and spleen, while significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05) the corresponding tissues ROS production at the end of the 1st week of heat stress. In contrast, at the end of the 2nd week of heat stress, IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in heat stress group significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05), while the corresponding tissues ROS production had no difference (P ＞ 0.05) compared to the control group. Collectively, duration of thermal stress affects growth performance, serum oxidative stress indices, and the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production of broiler tissues in a time-dependent manner. There is a negative correlation between the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production in the corresponding tissues under heat stress.Copyright © 2019.

In the heart of Cisd2 knockout mice, Cisd2 deficiency causes intercalated disc defects and leads to degeneration of the  and sarcomeres, thereby impairing its electromechanical functioning. Furthermore, Cisd2 deficiency disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis via dysregulation of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (Serca2a) activity, resulting in an increased level of basal cytosolic Ca2+ and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload in cardiomyocytes. Most strikingly, in Cisd2 transgenic mice, a persistently high level of Cisd2 is sufficient to delay cardiac aging and attenuate age-related structural defects and functional decline. In addition, it results in a younger cardiac transcriptome pattern during old age. Our findings indicate that Cisd2 plays an essential role in cardiac aging and in the heart's electromechanical functioning. They highlight Cisd2 as a novel drug target when developing therapies to delay cardiac aging and ameliorate age-related cardiac dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587505>Quantifying the inhibitory effect of Bcl-xl on the action of Mff using live-cell fluorescence imaging.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial fission regulates mitochondrial function and morphology, and has been linked to apoptosis. The mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), a tail-anchored membrane protein, induces excessive mitochondrial fission, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of Bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic protein, on the action of Mff by using live-cell fluorescence imaging. Microscopic imaging analysis showed that overexpression of Mff induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, which was reversed by co-expression of Bcl-xl. Microscopic imaging and live-cell FRET analysis demonstrated that Bcl-xl reconstructs the Mff network from punctate distribution of higher-order oligomers to filamentous distribution of lower-order oligomers. Live-cell FRET two-hybrid assay showed that Bcl-xl interacted with Mff to form heterogenous oligomers with 1: stoichiometry in cytoplasm and 1:1 stoichiometry on , indicating that two Bcl-xl molecules primarily interact with four Mff molecules in cytoplasm, but with two Mff molecules on .© 2019 The Authors.

They commonly manifest myopathy with muscular pain and rhabdomyolysis, whose underlying mechanisms are poorly known. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effects of cis-5 and Myr on mitochondrial bioenergetics and Ca homeostasis in rat skeletal muscle. cis-5 and Myr decreased ADP-stimulated (state 3) and CCCP-stimulated (uncoupled) respiration, especially when  were supported by NADH-linked as compared to FADH-linked substrates. In contrast, these fatty acids increased resting respiration (state 4). Similar effects were observed in skeletal muscle fibers therefore validating the data obtained with isolated . Furthermore, cis-5 and Myr markedly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca retention capacity that were avoided by cyclosporin A plus ADP and ruthenium red, indicating that cis-5 and Myr induce mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Finally, docosanoic acid did not disturb mitochondrial homeostasis, indicating selective effects for Myr and cis-5. Taken together, our findings indicate that major long-chain fatty acids accumulating in VLCAD deficiency behave as metabolic inhibitors, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and MPT inducers. It is presumed that these pathomechanisms contribute to the muscular symptoms and rhabdomyolysis observed in patients affected by VLCAD deficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, Poldip2 deficiency induces metabolic reprograming with repressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity. Though homozygous deletion of Poldip2 is lethal, heterozygous mice are viable and show protection against aneurysm and injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia, diseases linked to loss of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that the metabolic reprograming induced by Poldip2 deficiency controls VSMC differentiation.  To determine the role of Poldip2-mediated metabolic reprograming in phenotypic modulation of VSMC.  We show that Poldip2 deficiency in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of the serum response factor (SRF), Myocardin, and MRTFA and dramatically represses KLF4. Consequently, Poldip2-deficient VSMC and mouse aorta express high levels of contractile proteins and, more significantly, these cells do not dedifferentiate nor acquire macrophage-like characteristics when exposed to Cholesterol or PDGF. Regarding the mechanism, we found that Poldip2 deficiency upregulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and OGT-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation. Increased protein glycosylation causes the inhibition of a nuclear UPS responsible for SRF stabilization and KLF4 repression and is required for the establishment of the differentiated phenotype in Poldip2-deficient cells.  Our data show that Poldip2 deficiency induces a highly differentiated phenotype in VSMCs through a mechanism that involves regulation of metabolism and proteostasis. Additionally, our study positions -initiated signaling as key element of the VSMC differentiation programs that can be targeted to modulate VSMC phenotype during vascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646322>Ferroptosis was involved in the oleic acid-induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ferroptosis in acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model induced by oleic acid (OA). ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry weight ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry weight ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the  of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626159>[Metabolic and ultrastructural adaptation mechanisms during the primary prophylactic action of low-intensity electromagnetic radiation under normal and radiation conditions].</a></h2><p>Experimental studies have established that that low-intensity ultrahigh frequency (UHF) electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has a preventive effect under the action of radiation and other pathogenic factors, which manifests itself in the accelerated development of adaptation, in the predominance of anabolic reactions over catabolic ones, and in the strengthening of the body' structural reserves. At the same time, from the standpoint of studying the mechanisms of primary prevention, it is very important not only to identify the overall adaptation effect, but also to have an idea on the specific contribution of a physical factor used in the development of adaptation.To identify metabolic and ultrastructural adaption parameters under the action of low-intensity UHF EMR on healthy animals and to determine their stability (safety), by using a model of radiation exposure.The experiments were carried on 42 mature male rats weighing 180-200g. All the rats were divided into 5 groups:  experimental groups of 8 animals each for the comparative study of the specific features of adaptation developed under the preliminary action of UHF EMR in healthy animals and under radiation;  control groups of 8 animals each, and one intact group of 10 animals. The lumbar region (the area of the projection of the adrenal glands) was exposed to UHF EMP for  min daily (a cycle of 10 sessions). The animals were once irradiated at  Gy Co gamma ray doses, by using an Agat-R apparatus. The investigation objects were the liver, adrenal glands, testes, and thymus. The investigators used biochemical assays (the levels of RNA and DNA, antioxidant activity, specific activity in the thymocyte genome), transmission electron microscopy of adrenocorticocytes in the adrenal bundle zone and Sertoli cells in the testis.  (number, average and total area, number of cristae) were morphometrically analyzed.The metabolic and ultrastructural adaption changes induced by UHF EMR in healthy animals were ascertained to be able to withstand the pathogenic effect of radiation and at the same time showed both stability (safety) and certain variability (plasticity) in their reactions. In this case, there were increases in the synthesis of nucleic acids and in the activity of the antioxidant system; there was also mitochondrial structural stability that was more manifested in the adrenocorticocytes in the adrenal bundle zone. At the same time, there was also a decrease in the intensity (magnitude) of a number of adaptive indicators, although by and large they were significantly higher than the level of control (the effect of radiation).Thus, the effect of UHF EMR on healthy animals contributed to the development of adaptive rearrangements in the organs studied. The essence of these changes was mainly the enhancement of synthetic reactions, as indicated by a larger amount of RNA and DNA, the activation of cellular and intracellular regeneration with the increased processes of hyperplasia of the mitochondrial cristae and the higher levels of ribosomes and polysomes. In addition, it can be assumed that the use of UHF EMR has laid the physicochemical foundations of its antioxidant action as conformational rearrangements in the membranes, which increased their structural stability. The findings are indicative of the increased level of morphofunctional reserves in the studied cells and tissues due to their increased bioenergetic and plastic potential.This study has provided new data that expand our understanding of the features of the development of adaptive mechanisms and the formation of the body's structural and functional reserves under the primary prophylactic action of low-intensity UHF EMR, by using the model of radiation exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603468>SubMito-XGBoost: predicting protein submitochondrial localization by fusing multiple feature information and eXtreme gradient boosting.</a></h2><p> are an essential organelle in most eukaryotes.

Franz first described this tumor as a "papillary tumor of the pancreas, benign or malignant." In 1996, the World Health Organization named this tumor as SPN of the pancreas. It has a female preponderance with a male-to-female ratio of 1:9. A 30-year-old female who is a known case of lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent F-fluoro--deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for initial staging which showed intense metabolic activity in bilateral enlarged cervical and splenic hilar lymph nodes.

This study characterizes the effects of metabolic flux inhibitors and activators on mitochondrial fusion dynamics in the neuronal cell culture model of differentiated PC12 cells. Using a real time confocal microscopy assay, it was found that the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI) inhibitor, etomoxir, reduced mitochondrial fusion dynamics in a time-dependent manner. Etomoxir also decreased JO, ΔΨ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rates. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) inhibitor, UK5099, reduced fusion dynamics and in combination with etomoxir these inhibitory effects were amplified. Use of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate, which is known to increase metabolic flux through PDH, reversed the etomoxir-induced effects on fusion dynamics, JO, ΔΨ but not ROS production rates. Dichloroacetate also partially reversed inhibition of mitochondrial fusion dynamics caused by the parkinsonian-inducing neurotoxin, MPP. These results suggest that dichloroacetate-induced activation of metabolic flux in the mitochondrion may be a mechanism to restore normal mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics in metabolically challenged cells.Copyright © 2019 O’Hara, Davis, Adlesic, Hayes and Davey.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646531>At the Crossing of ER Stress and MAMs: A Key Role of Sigma-1 Receptor?</a></h2><p>Calcium exchanges and homeostasis are finely regulated between cellular organelles and in response to physiological signals.

The Warburg effect describes the ability of cancer cells to consume larger amounts of glucose compared to normal tissues. We identified derivatives of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones to be active in CRPC and further synthetically modified them via glucose conjugation to increase selectivity by Warburg effect targeting. Mechanisms of action were examined by quantitative proteomics followed by bioinformatical analysis and target validation. Four synthesized molecules revealed the highest selectivity towards human CRPC cells, which correlated with higher GLUT-1 activity and expression. The compounds were able to induce pro-apoptotic signs and to inhibit the pro-survival processes and mechanisms of drug resistance (i.e., AR-signaling and autophagy). Proteome analysis suggested a disruption of the /oxidative phosphorylation, which was validated by further functional analysis: thus,  depolarization, elevated levels of cytotoxic ROS, an increase of Bax/Bcl- ratio as well as release of mitochondrial AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm were observed. In conclusion, glucose-conjugated 1,4-naphthoquinones show potent activity and selectivity in human CRPC exerted via mitochondrial targeting.

Palmitoylcarnitine increased mitochondrial respiration at physiological and maximal concentrations of ADP while lowering cellular lactate content in HepG2 cells, suggesting a switch to mitochondrial metabolism. HepG2 cell growth was associated with an early increase in HO emission by 10 minutes followed by a decrease in HO at 24hrs that corresponded with increased glutathione content, suggesting a redox-based compensatory mechanism. In contrast, abrogation of HT29 cell proliferation was related to decreased mitochondrial respiration (likely due to cell death) and decreased glutathione. Concurrent glutathione depletion with BSO prevented palmitoylcarnitine-induced growth in HepG2 cells indicating that glutathione was critical for promoting growth following palmitoylcarnitine. Inhibiting UCP2 with genipin sensitized HepG2 cells to palmitoylcarnitine, suggesting that activation of UCP2 may be a  redox-based mechanism conferring protection. These findings suggest that HepG2 cells possess inherent metabolic and redox flexibility relative to HT29 cells that confers protection from palmitoylcarnitine-induced stress via adaptive increases in mitochondrial respiratory control, glutathione buffering and induction of UCP2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640544>Mitochondrial genome in Hypsizygus marmoreus and its evolution in Dikarya.</a></h2><p>Hypsizygus marmoreus, a high value commercialized edible mushroom is widely cultivated in East Asia, and has become one of the most popular edible mushrooms because of its rich nutritional and medicinal value.  are vital organelles, and play various essential roles in eukaryotic cells.In this study, we provide the Hypsizygus marmoreus mitochondrial (mt) genome assembly: the circular sequence is 102,752 bp in size and contains 15 putative protein-coding genes,  ribosomal RNAs subunits and 28 tRNAs. We compared the mt genomes of the 27 fungal species in the Pezizomycotina and Basidiomycotina subphyla, with the results revealing that H. marmoreus is a sister to Tricholoma matsutake and the phylogenetic distribution of this fungus based on the mt genome. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Ascomycetes  started to diverge earlier than that of Basidiomycetes and supported the robustness of the hyper metric tree. The fungal sequences are highly polymorphic and gene order varies significantly in the dikarya data set, suggesting a correlation between the gene order and divergence time in the fungi mt genome. To detect the mt genome variations in H. marmoreus, we analyzed the mtDNA sequences of 48 strains. The phylogeny and variation sited type statistics of H. marmoreus provide clear-cut evidence for the existence of four well-defined cultivations isolated lineages, suggesting female ancestor origin of H. marmoreus. Furthermore, variations on two loci were further identified to be molecular markers for distinguishing the subgroup containing 32 strains of other strains. Fifteen conserved protein-coding genes of mtDNAs were analyzed, with fourteen revealed to be under purifying selection in the examined fungal species, suggesting the rapid evolution was caused by positive selection of this gene.Our studies have provided new reference mt genomes and comparisons between species and intraspecies with other strains, and provided future perspectives for assessing diversity and origin of H. marmoreus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595470>Expression Analysis of Important Genes Involved in Nitrogen Metabolism Under Hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia or anoxia condition can occurs during flooding or waterlogging and can cause intense damage to the plants. Since oxygen is important for active operation of electron transport chain in  to generate energy production (ATP) any drop in oxygen can cause an energy crisis during flooding/waterlogging. To cope with this energy crisis plants have developed various anatomical, physiological, and biochemical adaptations. Perception of signals and induction of genes are required for initiation of these adaptive responses. Various genes involved in nitrogen, carbon, and fermentative metabolism play a role in hypoxic tolerance. Regulation of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism also plays a role under hypoxia.

The 13 constituent respiratory chain proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome (namely, mtDNA) play essential roles. We found that in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, 11 of the 13 mtDNA-encoded genes exhibited decreased mRNA levels and 5 genes displayed decreased protein levels, including the cytochrome B (mt-CYB) and cytochrome C oxidase II (mt-CO2) genes. Mitochondrial gene sequencing revealed abnormalities in the levels of a large number of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs). MicroRNA-181a-5p (mir-181a-5p), which potentially targets genes encoding mt-CYB and mt-CO2 protein, was screened out from 549 downregulated mitomiRs via bioinformatic analysis. After overexpression of mitomiR-181a-5p, mt-CYB and mt-CO2 levels were reduced in HCC cells, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) maintained by the electron transport chain (ETC) was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of hexokinase  (HK2) and glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) was upregulated, accompanied by elevated glucose, lactic acid release, and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In vivo experiments confirmed that constitutive mitomiR-181a-5p expression caused reprogramming of glucose metabolism and promoted tumor growth and early lung metastasis in liver cancer. In summary, the present study reveals the important role of mitomiRs in glucose metabolism reprogramming in liver cancer, which is of considerable value in exploring new therapeutic targets for HCC.© The Author(s) 2019.

The goal of the present study was to determine if heart  from NMRs functionally differ from those of hypoxia-intolerant common laboratory mice (Mus musculus). We assessed heart mitochondrial respiratory flux, proton leak kinetics, responses to in vitro anoxia-recovery, and maximal complex enzyme activities. When investigated at their respective body temperatures (28 °C for NMR and 37 °C for mice), NMR heart  had lower respiratory fluxes relative to mice, particularly for state  and oligomycin-induced state 4 leak respiration rates. When leak respiration rates were standardized to the same membrane potential, NMR  had lower complex II-stimulated state  respiration rates than mice. Both mice and NMRs responded similarly to an in vitro anoxia-recovery challenge and decreased state 3 respiration rate post-anoxia. Finally, NMRs had overall lower maximal complex enzyme activities compared with mice, but the magnitude of the difference did not correspond with observed differences in respiratory fluxes. Overall, heart  from NMRs appear more coupled than those of mice, but in both species the heart appears equally susceptible to ischemic-reperfusion injury.Copyright © 2019.

The SRB assay showed that the maximum growth inhibition rate of AVEAF on MCF-7 cell was 27.12 at 100 µg/ml. Flow cytometry analysis observed that AVEAF induced the cell cycle arrest at the S phases and decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential on the MCF-7 cells. AVEAF elevated intracellular ROS level in the MCF-7 cells which were reversed with -acetycysteine ( mM) pretreatment indicating that AVEAF induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis via augmentation of intracellular ROS. Western blotting exhibited that AVEAF increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax while decreasing anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl- and Bcl-xL expression which promoted the cleavage of caspase-9, PARP1, RIPK 1, and RIPK 3. Additionally, AVEAF exerted anticancer effect on tumor-bearing rats and the tumor inhibition rate is 50%. Data of the study indicate that AVEAF exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo anticancer activities that associate with its ROS-mediated mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and necroptosis in MCF-7 cells and may serve as a potential against breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670806>Interleukin-6 confers radio-resistance by inducing Akt mediated glycolysis and reducing mitochondrial damage in cells.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced glycolysis and therapeutic resistance is reported in some cell systems; however the mechanism of IL-6 induced glycolysis in radio-resistance is un-explored. Therefore to investigate, we treated Raw264.7 cells with IL-6 (1hr prior to irradiation) and examined the glycolytic flux. Increased expression of mRNA and protein levels of key glycolytic enzymes was observed after IL-6 treatment, which conferred glycolysis dependent resistance from radiation induced cell death. We further established that IL-6 induced glycolysis is activated by Akt signaling and knocking down Akt or inhibition of pan Akt phosphorylation significantly abrogated the IL-6 induced radio-resistance. Moreover, reduction of IL-6 induced pAkt level suppressed the expression of Hexokinase- and its translocation to the , thereby inhibiting the glycolysis induced resistance to radiation. IL-6 induced glycolysis also minimized the radiation induced mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that IL-6 induced glycolysis observed in cells may be responsible for IL-6 mediated therapeutic radio-resistance in cancer cells, partly by activation of Akt signaling.© The Author(s) 2019.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented  but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2, suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into . Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that  harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590355>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Underlies Cardiomyocyte Remodeling in Experimental and Clinical Atrial Fibrillation.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common progressive tachyarrhythmia, results in structural remodeling which impairs electrical activation of the atria, rendering them increasingly permissive to the arrhythmia. Previously, we reported on endoplasmic reticulum stress and NAD depletion in AF, suggesting a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in AF progression. Here, we examined mitochondrial function in experimental model systems for AF (tachypaced HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and ) and validated findings in clinical AF. Tachypacing of HL-1 cardiomyocytes progressively induces mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by impairment of mitochondrial Ca-handling, upregulation of mitochondrial stress chaperones and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration and ATP production. Atrial biopsies from AF patients display mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by aberrant ATP levels, upregulation of a mitochondrial stress chaperone and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. The pathophysiological role of mitochondrial dysfunction is substantiated by the attenuation of AF remodeling by preventing an increased mitochondrial Ca-influx through partial blocking or downregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and by SS31, a compound that improves bioenergetics in . Together, these results show that conservation of the mitochondrial function protects against tachypacing-induced cardiomyocyte remodeling and identify this organelle as a potential novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647884>Sirt3-dependent deacetylation of COX-1 counteracts oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial complexes are prone to sirtuin (Sirt)3-mediated deacetylation modification, which may determine cellular response to stimuli, such as oxidative stress. In this study, we show that the cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-1, a core catalytic subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, was acetylated and deactivated both in ,'-azobis(-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride-treated NIH/3T3 cells and hydrogen peroxide-treated primary neuronal cells, correlating with apoptotic cell death induction by oxidative stress. Inhibition of Sirt3 by small interfering RNA or the inhibitor nicotinamide induced accumulation of acetylation of COX-1, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Sirt3 enhanced deacetylation of COX-1 and inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Significantly, rats treated with ischemia/reperfusion injury, a typical oxidative stress-related disease, presented an inhibition of Sirt3-induced hyperacetylation of COX-1 in the brain tissues. Furthermore, K13, K264, K319, and K481 were identified as the acetylation sits of COX-1 in response to oxidative stress.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Mtb H37Rv (Rv) infection induced mitofusin  (MFN2) degradation, leading to mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, Mtb H37Ra (Ra) infection induced significantly greater mitochondrial fragmentation than Rv infection. Mtb-mediated Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributed to the degradation of MFN2. To evaluate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the production of Parkin during Mtb infection, we analyzed Parkin production in 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)-pretreated macrophages. Pretreatment with 4-PBA reduced Parkin production in Mtb-infected macrophages. In contrast, the level of MFN2 production recovered to a level similar to that of the unstimulated control. In addition, Ra-infected macrophages had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) compared to those infected with Rv.

We analyzed 82 nuclear DNA (8 sarcomeric genes, 74 other HCM-associated genes) and mitochondrial DNA. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed in the 132 HCM patients.Average indexed AML was significantly longer for HCM than for controls (17. ± .3 vs. 13.3 ± 1.6 mm/m, P <  0.001). Average AML length correlated with body surface area (BSA), left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume (P <  0.001) and LV mass by CMR (P < 0.001). Average indexed AML by BSA of pure-apical HCM was significantly shorter than other typed HCM (16.6 ± .0 vs. 17.4 ± .4 mm/m, P = 0.025). Indexed AML was independently correlated with left atrial wall stress. The thin filament mutation group showed larger average AML (31.9 ± 3.8 vs. 29.6 ± 3.8 mm, P = 0.045), but this was not significant with the indexed value. No difference in AML size among subgroups was observed based on the presence of sarcomere protein or -related gene variants (P > 0.05).AML elongation was a unique finding of HCM.

Here we showed that CVB3 induced ER stress response and apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes. We found that Ca -calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was activated by ER stress-dependent intracellular Ca overload in the CVB3 infected H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Treatment with an inhibitor of ER stress, 4-PBA, attenuated intracellular Ca accumulation indirectly and reduced CaMKII activity. Inhibition of CaMKII with pharmacological inhibitor (KN-93) or shRNA reduced CVB3-induced H9c2 apoptosis and repressed cytochrome c release from  to cytoplasm. Whereas overexpression of the activated mutant of CaMKII (CaMKII-T287D) enhanced CVB3-induced H9c2 apoptosis and mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which could be alleviated by blocking of mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU) or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Further in vivo investigation revealed that blocking of CaMKII with KN-93 prevented cardiomyocytes apoptosis and improved cardiac contractile function in CVB3 infected mouse heart. Collectively, these findings provide a novel evidence that CaMKII plays a vital role in promotion of CVB3-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which links ER stress and mitochondrial Ca uptake.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) impair cellular function by oxidizing cell components containing proteins, lipids, and DNA. Tumor oxidant status is elevated due to high metabolic activity under influence of abnormal growth factors, cytokines and function ROS-producing enzymes, including nitric oxide synthases, cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases. Nuclear factor-erythroid -related factor  (NRF2) is a transcriptional master regulator element which is believed to recognize cellular oxidative stress followed by binding to promoter of cyto-protective and anti-oxidative genes to maintain cellular redox status through promoting antioxidant response participants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, ferritin, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1). However, Nrf2 signaling protects malignant cells from ROS damage against tumor growth and chemoresistance. In addition, Nrf2 is able to participate in differentiation of certain stem cells by modulating autophagy procedure, also NRF2 provokes DNA damage response and facilitates drug metabolism and drug resistance by controlling of downstream enzyme and transporter members.

The necessary factors regulating Nrf2 activity and stability during analgesic nephropathy are not fully understood. Our results suggest that acetaminophen produces nephrotoxicity in HK- cells by inhibiting keap1 degradation. APAP subsided Nrf2 nuclear accumulation by inhibition of keap1 degradation, thereby reducing the binding of Nrf2 to ARE, leading to the loss of expression of antioxidant proteins such as HO-1, inducing a series of oxidative stress and apoptosis events. Therefore, Nrf2/keap1/HO-1 signal transduction pathway has a poor prognosis during analgesic nephrotoxicity. Sika deer antler protein (SDAPR) significantly prevented APAP-induced HK- cell damage by constitutively stabilized Nrf2 nuclear retention. Excess APAP leads to a decrease in Nrf2 nuclear translocation, leading to severe oxidative stress, increasing the levels of GSH and MDA in HK- cells, and reducing the enzyme activities of SOD and CAT in HK- cells. Increased biomarker levels of acute kidney injury (AKI) in HK- cells, including kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C, decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential in HK- cells, and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, it also reduced the ratio of -associated apoptotic protein Bax/Bcl-, leading to cell apoptosis. SDAPR dose dependently accorded protection against acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, oxidative damage, and cell apoptosis by its molecular intervention with Nrf2/keap1/HO-1 pathway via keap1 degradation.

Dominant mutations in DNM2 result in tissue specific diseases affecting peripheral nerves (Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, CMT) or skeletal muscles (Centronuclear myopathy, CNM). However, the reason for this tissue specificity is unknown, and it remains unclear if these diseases share a common pathomechanism. To compare the disease pathophysiological mechanisms in skeletal muscle, we exogenously expressed wild-type DNM2 (WT-DNM2), the DNM2-CMT mutation K562E, or DNM2-CNM mutations R465W and S619L causing adult and neonatal forms respectively, by intramuscular adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections. All muscles expressing exogenous WT-DNM2 and CNM or CMT mutations exhibited reduced muscle force. However, only expression of CNM mutations and WT-DNM2 correlated with CNM-like histopathological hallmarks of nuclei centralization and reduced fiber size. The extent of alterations correlated with clinical severity in patients. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence analyses highlighted defects of the triads,  and costameres as major causes of the CNM phenotype. Despite the reduction in force upon expression of the DNM2-CMT mutation, muscle histology and ultrastructure were almost normal. However, the neuromuscular junction was affected in all DNM2 injected muscles, with the DNM2-CMT mutation inducing the most severe alterations, potentially explaining the reduction in force observed with this mutant. In conclusion, expression of WT and CNM mutants recreate a CNM-like phenotype, suggesting CNM mutations are gain-of-function. Histological, ultrastructural and molecular analyses pointed to key pathways uncovering the different pathomechanisms involved in centronuclear myopathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy linked to DNM2 mutations.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent studies have highlighted the unique metabolic properties of LSCs, which might represent opportunities for LSC-selective targeting. LSCs characteristically have low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which apparently result from a combination of low mitochondrial activity and high activity of ROS-removing pathways such as autophagy. Due to this low activity, LSCs are highly dependent on mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms. These include the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-, which also has crucial roles in regulating the mitochondrial membrane potential, and proteins involved in mitophagy. Here we review the different pathways that impact mitochondrial activity and redox-regulation, and highlight their relevance for the functionality of both HSCs and LSCs. Additionally, novel AML therapy strategies that are based on interference with those pathways, including the promising BCL- inhibitor Venetoclax, are summarized.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Mitochondrial metabolism is critical for insulin secretion. A sound understanding of the intermediary metabolism, electrophysiology, and cell signaling is essential for comprehension of the entire spectrum of the stimulus-secretion coupling. Depolarization brought about by inhibition of the ATP sensitive potassium channel, together with the inward depolarizing currents through the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, leads to electrical activities, opening of the voltage-gated calcium channels, and exocytosis of insulin. Calcium- and cAMP-signaling elicited by depolarization, and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the free fatty acid receptors, are intricately connected in the form of networks at different levels. Activation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor augments insulin secretion by amplifying calcium signals by calcium induced calcium release (CICR). In the treatment of type  diabetes, use of the sulfonylureas that act on the ATP sensitive potassium channel, damages the beta cells, which eventually fail; these drugs do not improve the cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, drugs acting through the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor protect the beta-cells, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. The use of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists is increasing and that of sulfonylurea is decreasing. A better understanding of the stimulus-secretion coupling may lead to the discovery of other molecular targets for development of drugs for the prevention and treatment of type  diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619044>Betulin attenuated liver damage by prevention of hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in rats with alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Betulin, a pentacyclic triterpene, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of liver  in hepatoprotection of betulin using a rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis induced by ethanol administration (4 g/kg, intragastric) for 8 weeks. The treatment with betulin (50 and 100 mg/kg b.w., intragastric) during this period attenuated the histological signs of steatohepatitis and lowered the serum and liver triglyceride contents, as well as the serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Betulin (100 mg/kg) decreased the liver/body weight ratio and inhibited the increase in the serum levels of TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and hyaluronic acid, demonstrating hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic potential. Betulin also inhibited the formation of superoxide anions in  and the end-products of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue, the amount of which was significantly increased in ethanol-treated rats. The disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and decreasing of mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities in rats with steatohepatitis, were reverted by betulin administration. The increased susceptibility of  to Ca-induced permeability transition pore formation in the hepatitis group was improved in rats treated with betulin. In conclusion, betulin, having antioxidant properties, exerts a beneficial effect in the rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis via prevention of liver  dysfunction, which may be attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614158>Antidepressant activity of crocin-I is associated with amelioration of neuroinflammation and attenuates oxidative damage induced by corticosterone in mice.</a></h2><p>Depression is the leading cause of mental health-related disease globally, and it affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide. However, its physiological causes are not fully understood. Since available antidepressants fail to achieve complete disease remission, treating diversification of depression may be a useful contribution. Crocin, one of the main glycosylated carotenoids of saffron, has been found to have numerous pharmacological activities and has been reported to be associated with neuroprotective effects. However, the biological action of crocin-I, a major member of the crocin family, on depression-like behavior, neuroinflammation and oxidative damage in depressed animals remains unclear. The present study showed that crocin-I exerts significant antidepressant effects in a model of chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression, as evidenced by the attenuation of depression-like behaviors in the open field test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test. The antidepressant activity of crocin-I was probably achieved through the suppression of neuroinflammation (IL-1β) and oxidative stress in the mouse hippocampus. Additionally, the oral administration of crocin-I at a dose of 40 mg/kg reduced the CORT-induced accumulation of nicotinamide in the liver of the mice to improve the synthesis of NAD, thereby stimulating the activity of SIRT3 deacetylase to elevate the activity of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase  and glutathione reductase. Moreover, crocin-I reduced the levels of oxidative damage markers (reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde) to rescue impaired mitochondrial function caused by CORT treatment, which was represented by electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation normality, and thus rescue ATP production to the level of that in wild-type mice. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism of action of crocin-I on depression-like behavior and oxidative stress in individuals stressed by perceived conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Based on this, we constructed a two-step precise targeting nanoplatform which can realize the drug release and drug action triggered by the microenvironment of lysosomes (endosomes) and , respectively. To begin with, the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were modified with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and loaded with ,'-azobis[-(-imidazolin--yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH). Then, folic acid (FA) targeted pH-sensitive liposomes containing docetaxel (Lipo/DTX-FA) were prepared by thin-film dispersion method, and the core-shell AIPH/MSN-TPP@Lipo/DTX-FA nanoparticles were constructed by self-assembly during the hydration of the liposomes. When this nanoplatform entered into the tumor cells through FA receptor-mediated endocytosis, the pH-sensitive liposomes were destabilized in the lysosomes, resulting in the release of DTX and AIPH/MSN-TPP nanoparticles. After that, AIPH was delivered to  by AIPH/MSN-TPP, and the alkyl radicals produced by AIPH under the high temperature environment can cause oxidative damage to . Not only that, the DTX could enhance the anti-tumor effect of AIPH by downregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl- protein. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that this delivery system could induce apoptosis based on organelles' s own microenvironment, which provides a new approach for tumor therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Accumulation of 7S DNA in iPD and LRRK2-PD fibroblasts was related with an increase in H-strand mtDNA transcription.These results show that 7S DNA accumulation, low mtDNA replication, high H-strand transcription, and low mtDNA release compose a pattern of mtDNA dysfunction shared by both iPD and LRRK2-PD fibroblasts. Moreover, these results suggest that the deregulation of the genetic switch formed by 7SDNA that alternates between mtDNA replication and transcription is a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism in both idiopathic and monogenic Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle  are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599941>Evidence of Neutral Evolution of Mitochondrial DNA in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Many studies have suggested that  and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) might be functionally associated with tumor genesis and development. Although the heterogeneity of tumors is well known, most studies were based on the analysis of a single tumor sample. The extent of mtDNA diversity in the same tumor is unclear, as is whether the diversity is influenced by selection pressure. Here, we analyzed the whole exon data from 1 nontumor sample and 23 tumor samples from different locations of one single tumor tissue from a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient. Among 18 heteroplasmic sites identified in the tumor, only  heteroplasmies were shared among all tumor samples. By investigating the correlations between the occurrence and frequency of heteroplasmy (Het) and sampling locations (Coordinate), relative mitochondrial copy numbers, and single-nucleotide variants in the nuclear genome, we found that the Coordinate was significantly correlated with Het, suggesting no strong purifying selection or positive selection acted on the mtDNA in HCC. By further investigating the allele frequency and proportion of nonsynonymous mutations in the tumor mtDNA, we found that mtDNA in HCC did not undergo extra selection compared with mtDNA in the adjacent nontumor tissue, and they both likely evolved under neutral selection.© The Author(s) 2019.

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, -targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1) is a mitochondrial porin involved in the cellular metabolism and apoptosis intrinsic pathway in many neuropathological processes. In spinal cord injury (SCI), after the primary cell death, a secondary response that comprises the release of pro-inflammatory molecules triggers apoptosis, inflammation, and demyelination, often leading to the loss of motor functions. Here, we investigated the functional role of VDAC1 in the neurodegeneration triggered by SCI. We first determined that in vitro targeted ablation of VDAC1 by specific morpholino antisense nucleotides (MOs) clearly promotes neurite retraction, whereas a pharmacological blocker of VDAC1 oligomerization (4, 4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-, '-disulfonic acid, DIDS), does not cause this effect. We next determined that, after SCI, VDAC1 undergoes conformational changes, including oligomerization and N-terminal exposition, which are important steps in the triggering of apoptotic signaling. Considering this, we investigated the effects of DIDS in vivo application after SCI. Interestingly, blockade of VDAC1 oligomerization decreases the number of apoptotic cells without interfering in the neuroinflammatory response. DIDS attenuates the massive oligodendrocyte cell death, subserving undisputable motor function recovery. Taken together, our results suggest that the prevention of VDAC1 oligomerization might be beneficial for the clinical treatment of SCI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597007>Electronation-dependent structural change at the proton exit side of cytochrome c oxidase as revealed by site-directed fluorescence labeling.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain of  and many aerobic prokaryotes that function as a redox-coupled proton pump, catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. As part of the respiratory chain, CcO contributes to the proton motive force driving ATP synthesis. While many aspects of the enzyme's catalytic mechanisms have been established, a clear picture of the proton exit pathway(s) remains elusive. Here, we aim to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of CcO through the development of a new homologous mutagenesis/expression system in Paracoccus denitrificans, which allows mutagenesis of CcO subunits 1, , and 3. Our system provides true single thiol-reactive CcO variants in a three-subunit base variant with unique labeling sites for the covalent attachment of reporter groups sensitive to nanoenvironmental factors like protonation, polarity, and hydration. To this end, we exchanged six residues on both membrane sides of CcO for cysteines. We show redox-dependent wetting changes at the proton uptake channel and increased polarity at the proton exit side of CcO upon electronation. We suggest an electronation-dependent conformational change to play a role in proton exit from CcO.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582422>A novel small molecule inhibits tumor growth and synergizes effects of enzalutamide on prostate cancer.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death for men in the United States. About 35% of PCa recurs and is often transformed to castrate-resistant PCa (CRPCa), the most deadly and aggressive form of PCa. However, the standard-of-care treatment for CRPCa (e.g., enzalutamide with abiraterone) usually has limited efficacy. Herein, we report a novel molecule (i.e., PAWI-) that inhibits cellular proliferation of androgen-sensitive (i.e., LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive (i.e., PC-3) cells. In vivo studies in a PC-3 xenograft model showed that PAWI- (20 mg/kg/day, 21 days, i.p.) inhibited tumor growth by 49% compared to vehicle-treated mice. PAWI- synergized currently clinically used enzalutamide in in vitro inhibition of PCa cell viability and re-sensitized inhibition of in vivo PC-3 tumor growth. Compared to vehicle-treated mice, PC-3 xenograft studies also showed that PAWI- (20 mg/kg/day, 21 days, i.p.) and enzalutamide (5 mg/kg/day, 21 days, i.p.) inhibited tumor growth by 63%. Synergism was mainly controlled by the imbalance of pro-survival factors (i.e., Bcl-, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) and anti-survival factors (i.e., Bax, Bak) induced by affecting mitochondrial membrane potential/ dynamics. Thus, PAWI- utilizes a distinct mechanism of action to inhibit PCa growth independently of androgen receptor signaling overcomes enzalutamide-resistant CRPCa. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CRPCa is the most aggressive human PCa but standard chemotherapies for CRPCa are largely ineffective. PAWI- potently inhibits PCa proliferation in vitro and in vivo regardless of AR status and uses a distinct mechanism of action. PAWI- has greater utility in treating CRPCa than standard of care therapy. PAWI- possesses promising therapeutic potency in low-dose combination therapy with a clinically used drug (i.e., enzalutamide).

More specifically, this is a major obstacle when measuring the mitochondrial [Ca] quantitatively using fura- analogs because the majority of NADH is in the . If the fluorescent dye concentration is the same, a certain excitation intensity should produce the same emission intensity. Therefore, the emission intensity ratio of two different excitation wavelengths should be constant. Based on this principle, a novel online correction method of NADH signal interference to measure [Ca] was developed, and the real signal intensity of NADH and fura- can be obtained. Further, a novel equation to calculate [Ca] was developed with isosbestic excitation or excitation at 400 nm. With this method, changes in mitochondrial [Ca] could be successfully measured. In addition, with a different set of the excitation and emission wavelengths, multiple parameters, including NADH, [Ca], and pH or mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm), could be simultaneously measured. Mitochondrial [Ca] and Ψm or pH were measured using fura--FF and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) or carboxy-seminaphtorhodafluor-1 (carboxy-SNARF-1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588872>Endurance training remodels skeletal muscle phospholipid composition and increases intrinsic mitochondrial respiration in men with type  diabetes.</a></h2><p>The effects of exercise training on the skeletal muscle (SKM) lipidome and mitochondrial function have not been thoroughly explored in individuals with type  diabetes (T2D). We hypothesize that 10 weeks of supervised endurance training improves SKM mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity that are related to alterations in lipid signatures within SKM of T2D (males =8). We employed integrated multi-omics data analyses including  lipidomics [MS/MS-shotgun] and transcriptomics [RNAseq]. From biopsies of SKM, tissue and primary myotubes mitochondrial respiration were quantified by high resolution respirometry. We also performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and blood draws before and after the training. The lipidomics analysis revealed that endurance training (>95% compliance) increased monolysocardiolipin by 68. % (MLCL, p ≤ 0.03), a putative marker of mitochondrial remodeling and reduced total sphingomyelin by 44.8 % (SM, p ≤ 0.05) and phosphatidylserine by 39.7 % (PS, ≤ 0.04), and tended to reduce ceramides lipid content by 19.8 %. Endurance training also improved intrinsic mitochondrial respiration in SKM of T2D without alterations in mitochondrial DNA copy number or cardiolipin content. RNAseq revealed 71 transcripts in SKM of T2D that were differentially regulated. Insulin sensitivity was unaffected and HbA1c levels moderately increased by 7.3 % despite an improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (VOpeak) following the training intervention. In summary, endurance training improves intrinsic and cell-autonomous SKM mitochondrial function and modifies lipid composition in men with T2D independent of alterations in insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586693>Jiang Gui Fang activated interscapular brown adipose tissue and induced epididymal white adipose tissue browning through the PPARγ/SIRT1-PGC1α pathway.</a></h2><p>Gui Zhi Tang, a well-known Chinese herbal formula recorded in the Eastern Han Dynasty, has been widely used to treat exogenous cold for thousands of years. Recent studies showed that Gui Zhi Tang has the effect of regulating the body temperature. In order to better exert the effect of heat production, and protect the vital organs of the body to avoid damage to the cold environment, Jiang Gui Fang (JG) was obtained from clinical utilization in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine at General Hospital of Northern Theater Command for many years and has exhibited favorable efficacy. This formula was an empirical formula that was developed based on the research of Gui Zhi Tang, the principles of traditional Chinese medicine and survey a large number of literature. The basis for compatibility of JG was that we selected dried ginger, cassia twig, and licorice in Gui Zhi Tang, which play a major role in the treatment of exogenous cold, and combined with other Chinese medicines, such as pueraria, spatholobus, acanthopanacis cortex, euodiae fructus, codonopsis pilosula.To promote the increase of core temperature of the body and prevent invasion of the major organs from cold environment. We studied the effect of JG on the core body temperature of mice, then explored its regulation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and the possible mechanism. Finally, we determine phytochemical compositions of JG that play a role in heat production.For in vivo studies, we performed a 4-week treatment of JG in acute cold environment at -20 °C and chronic cold exposure at 4 °C. The core temperature, adipose tissue weight, serum parameters, and morphological observation of adipocytes, liver and kidney were measured. Then we investigated the expression levels of adipogenic factors, thermogenic factors and lipoprotein. In vitro, we determined the lipid droplet content, ATP content, and the maximum oxygen consumption of .JG treatment promoted core temperature, inhibited eWAT weight, protected kidney, consumed glucose and lipids in Kunming (KM) mice. It also enhanced BAT-associated thermogenic factor uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-actived receptorγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α). The expressions of the lipogenic factor peroxisome proliferate-activator receptor gamma (PPARγ) and lipolytic protein hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase (HSL) in eWAT were elevated. H&E and immunohistochemistry showed that JG significantly reduced the size of iBAT and eWAT, elevated UCP1 expression levels. In vitro, JG lowered the content of lipid droplets and ATP in brown fat cells. Maximum oxygen consumption capacity of  and the expression levels of UCP1, PGC1α and silent mating type information regulation  homolog 1 (SIRT1) were enhanced after JG treatment.In vivo and in vitro studies showed that JG obviously increased the core temperature of mice by activating iBAT and inducing eWAT browning.

While most genes expressed "in the remaining" oligodendrocytes are downregulated in schizophrenia, only a few are upregulated. To the latter group belong prohibitin  and DISC 1, which were recently identified as -located mitophagy receptors. Their overexpression, together with greatly reduced numbers and densities of oligodendroglial  and the structurally "normal appearance of the remaining " in these cells as reported by Uranova's group (Uranova et al., 2001, 2004, 2018), point to enhanced mitophagy in oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia, which is possibly even cell protective by preventing apoptosis. Since massive loss of white matter oligodendrocytes is a characteristic feature of schizophrenia, we assume that increased mitophagy is a late event in the development and/or further progression of white matter pathologic changes. Moreover, altered oligodendroglial mitophagy might in part result from antipsychotic treatment. Further studies are clearly needed to substantiate our hypothesis on enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in schizophrenia, whereby the "drug-naïve state" and the possible influence of antipsychotic treatment could be elegantly simulated using animal models of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated  were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric acid and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase- activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric acid, triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased liver de novo lipogenesis program (fatty acid synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation).

The prevention at high concentrations is evidenced by the significant inhibition of mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca and phosphate; in this condition, AGM both prevents the release of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and enhances the release of other pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO. As these factors are released without MPT induction, the involvement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) could be hypothesized. Cyclosporin A (CsA), a powerful inhibitor of MPT, enhanced the AGM-mediated inhibition of swelling, and surprisingly, prevented the release of cyt c and Smac/DIABLO. In the presence of Ca, AGM also activated the Bcl- family protein Bax, a key factor in inducing MOMP, which is inactivated by CsA. Together with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Bax forms channels in the outer membrane further supporting the involvement of MOMP in the release of pro-apoptotic factors. In view of the fact that VDAC was inactivated by ruthenium red, which in turn inhibited the release of cyt c, it can be hypothesized that, on the one hand, AGM inhibits MPT induction and, on the other, it selectively permeabilizes the outer membrane via MOMP induction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654396>PTEN inhibition attenuates endothelial cell apoptosis in coronary heart disease via modulating the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major pathogenic factor in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and endothelial dysfunction (ED) plays a primary role in the occurrence and development of AS. In our study, we attempted to evaluate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in endothelial cell apoptosis under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) stimulation and identify the associated mechanisms. The results of our study demonstrated that ox-LDL induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) death via mitochondrial apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial potential, increased  permeability transition pore opening, cellular calcium overload, and caspase-9/-3 activation. In addition, ox-LDL also suppressed cellular energy production via downregulating the mitochondrial respiratory complex. Moreover, ox-LDL impaired HUVECs migration. Western blot analysis showed that PTEN expression was upregulated after exposure to ox-LDL and knockdown of PTEN could attenuate ox-LDL-mediated endothelial cell damage. Furthermore, we found that ox-LDL impaired mitophagy activity, whereas PTEN deletion could improve mitophagic flux and this effect relied on the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-Mitofusin- (Mfn2) axis. When the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2 pathway was inhibited, PTEN deletion-associated HUVECs protection was significantly reduced, suggesting that the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy axis is required for PTEN deletion-mediated endothelial cell survival under ox-LDL. Taken together, our results indicate that ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell damage is associated with PTEN overexpression, and inhibition of PTEN could promote endothelial survival via activating the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair.

To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy metabolism and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The ultrastructure of gastric mucosa was observed under the transmission electron microscope (TEM).Among 14 gastric mucosa samples, 8 of them were Hp positive (6 DHPW and  PQD), which were all accordance with the results screened by supermicro-pathological method. Under TEM, the normal gastric mucosa, with tidy microvilli and abundant in mucus granules,  and rough endoplasmic reticulum distributed evenly, and with smooth nucleus membrane. But in those specimens of DHPW with Hp infection, microvilli were presented with burr shape. Especially, those samples from dampness-heat syndrome with predominant heat type (DHSH) patients were more obvious, with microvilli damaged,  concentrated and distributed in disorder, secretory tubule extended. In dampness-heat syndrome with predominant dampness type (DHSD) patients, mucus granules aggregated obviously,  swelled and blurred, and rough endoplasmic reticulum crowded. For  samples of DHPW without Hp infection, their microvilli were intact, with  increased and gathered but well-distributed, and secretory tubule extended mildly. In  PQD patients with Hp positive, the specimens of microvilli were sparse, and their mucus granules and  were decreased, with fractured crests and vacuole, secretory tubules extension to nucleus membrane, and rough endoplasmic reticulum extension in a pool-like way, and nucleus condensed. The  samples from PQD patients without Hp infection were characterized with intact microvilli, decreased , fractured crest and extended rough endoplasmic reticulum in a pool-like way.It's obviously different in ultrastructure of DHPW and PQD patients under TEM, which may give a helpful hint for the microcosmic syndrome differentiation of HPCG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648556>Hydrogen sulfide signaling in  and disease.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide can signal through 3 distinct mechanisms: ) reduction and/or direct binding of metalloprotein heme centers, ) serving as a potent antioxidant through reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species scavenging, or ) post-translational modification of proteins by addition of a thiol (-SH) group onto reactive cysteine residues: a process known as persulfidation. Below toxic levels, hydrogen sulfide promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function, thereby conferring protection against cellular stress. For these reasons, increases in hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen sulfide-producing enzymes have been implicated in several human disease states. This review will first summarize our current understanding of hydrogen sulfide production and metabolism, as well as its signaling mechanisms; second, this work will detail the known mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide in the  and the implications of its mitochondrial-specific impacts in several pathologic conditions.-Murphy, B., Bhattacharya, R., Mukherjee, P.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in severely obese humans. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of RYGB surgery on glucose partitioning, mitochondrial network morphology, and the markers of mitochondrial dynamics skeletal muscle from severely obese humans.Human skeletal muscle cells were isolated from muscle biopsies obtained from RYGB patients (BMI = 48.0 ± .1, n = 7) prior to, 1 month and 7 months following surgery and lean control subjects (BMI = 22.4 ± 1.1, n = 7). Complete glucose oxidation, non-oxidized glycolysis rates, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mitochondrial network morphology, and the regulatory proteins of mitochondrial dynamics were determined in differentiated human myotubes.Myotubes derived from severely obese humans exhibited enhanced glucose oxidation (13.5%; 95% CI [7.6, 19.4], P = 0.043) and reduced non-oxidized glycolysis (-1.3%; 95% CI [-11.1, 8.6]) in response to insulin stimulation at 7 months after RYGB when compared with the presurgery state (-0.6%; 95% CI [-5., 4.0] and 19.5%; 95% CI [4.0, 35.0], P = 0.006), and were not different from the lean controls (16.7%; 95% CI [11.8, 21.5] and 1.9%; 95% CI [-1.6, 5.4], respectively). Further, the number of fragmented  and Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation were trended to reduce/reduced (0.0104, 95% CI [0.0085, 0.0126], P = 0.091 and 0.0085, 95% CI [0.0068, 0.0102], P = 0.05) in myotubes derived from severely obese humans at 7 months after RYGB surgery in comparison with the presurgery state. Finally, Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation was negatively correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (r = -0.49, P = 0.037).These data indicate that an intrinsic metabolic defect of glucose partitioning in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans is restored by RYGB surgery. The restoration of glucose partitioning may be regulated through reduced mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630771>Neurological disorders and .</a></h2><p>The brain is highly dependent on mitochondrial energy metabolism.
