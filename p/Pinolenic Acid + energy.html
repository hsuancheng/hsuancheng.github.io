These free-fatty  receptors include FFA2 and FFA3, which are agonized by short-chained FFA, as well as FFA1 and FFA4, which are agonized by medium-to-long chained FFA. Ligands for FFA1 and FFA4 comprise the family of long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids including α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), suggesting that many of the long-known beneficial effects of these fats may be receptor mediated. In this regard, FFA4 has gathered considerable interest due to its role in ameliorating inflammation, promoting insulin sensitization, and regulating  metabolism in response to FFA ligands. The goal of this review is to summarize the body of evidence in regard to FFA4 signal transduction, its mechanisms of regulation, and its functional role in a variety of tissues. In addition, recent endeavors toward discovery of small molecules that modulate FFA4 activity are also presented.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although some studies reported adverse effects, such as reproductive toxicity, further research needs to be done in order to assess its molecular effects and mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated metabolic perturbations in juvenile gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) exposed over 14 days via the water to oxybenzone (50 mg/L). The non-targeted analysis of brain, liver and plasma extracts was performed by means of UHPLC-qOrbitrap MS in positive and negative modes with both C18 and HILIC separation. Although there was no mortality or alterations in general physiological parameters during the experiment, and the metabolic profile of brain was not affected, the results of this study showed that oxybenzone could perturb both liver and plasma metabolome. The pathway enrichment suggested that different pathways in lipid metabolism (fatty  elongation, α- metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty  metabolism) were significantly altered, as well as metabolites involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and  metabolism modification. Therefore, this research indicates that oxybenzone has adverse effects beyond the commonly studied hormonal activity, and demonstrates the sensitivity of metabolomics to assess molecular-level effects of emerging contaminants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), synergistically with E, via hepatic cholesterol synthesis and clearance. Rats were fed a diet with either 0% n-3 PUFA or 1% ALA, EPA, or DHA, relative to total  consumption, for the entire 12-week study. After ovariectomy, rats were injected with either corn oil or E every 4 days for the last 3 weeks of the study. In combination with E, dietary supplementation with EPA or DHA increased the phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ratio and LDL receptor expression, and it decreased the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 in the liver. In addition, dietary supplementation with EPA or DHA increased hepatic expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, sterol 12α-hydroxylase, and sterol 27-hydroxylase. However, E decreased the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and sterol 12α-hydroxylase and increased the expression of estrogen receptor α and β in the liver. ALA had no significant effects on cholesterol metabolism. In conclusion, the present study suggests that dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA decreased LDL-C synthesis and increased bile  synthesis and LDL-C clearance by LDL receptor, synergistically with E.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of cooking oils depends on their fatty  composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of oleic  (OA) (50.93%) and α- (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight, liver weight, fat ratio, food intake and  intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612804>Increasing the concentration of  in diets fed to Jersey cows in late lactation does not affect methane production.</a></h2><p>Although the inclusion of fat has reduced methane production in ruminants, relatively little research has been conducted comparing the effects of source and profile of fatty acids on methane production in lactating dairy cows. A study using 8 multiparous (325 ± 17 DIM; mean ± SD) lactating Jersey cows was conducted to determine effects of feeding canola meal and lard versus extruded byproduct containing flaxseed as a high-C18:3 fat source on methane production and diet digestibility in late-lactation dairy cows. A crossover design with 32-d periods (28-d adaptation and 4-d collections) was used to compare 2 different fat sources. Diets contained approximately 50% forage mixture of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and brome hay; the concentrate mixture changed between diets to include either (1) a conventional diet of corn, soybean meal, and canola meal with lard (control) or (2) a conventional diet of corn and soybean meal with an extruded byproduct containing flaxseed (EXF) as the fat source. Diets were balanced to decrease corn, lard, and canola meal and replace them with soybean mean and EXF to increase the concentration of C18:3 (0.14 vs. 1.20% of DM). Methane production was measured using headbox-style indirect calorimeters. Cattle were restricted to 95% ad libitum feed intake during collections. Milk production (17.4 ± 1.04 kg/d) and dry matter intake (15.4 ± 0.71 kg/d) were similar among treatments. Milk fat (5.88 ± 0.25%) and protein (4.08 ± 0.14%) were not affected by treatment. For methane production, no difference was observed for total production (352.0 vs. 349.8 ± 16.43 L/d for control vs. EXF, respectively). Methane production per unit of dry matter intake was not affected and averaged 23.1 ± 0.57 L/kg. Similarly, methane production per unit of -corrected milk was not affected by fat source and averaged 15.5 ± 0.68 L/kg. Heat production was similar, averaging 21.1 ± 1.02 Mcal/d. Digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and crude protein was not affected by diet and averaged 69.9, 53.6, and 73.3%, respectively. Results indicated that increasing C18:3 may not affect methane production or digestibility of the diet in lactating dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In the adipose tissue of these SRD-fed rats, the present study analyzed the possible beneficial effects of dietary Salba (chia) seeds in improving or reversing the depletion of antioxidant defenses, changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production.Wistar rats were fed a SRD for 3 months. After that, half of the animals continued with the SRD until month 6, while in the other half, corn oil was replaced by chia seeds for 3 months (SRD + chia). A reference group consumed a control diet all the time.Compared with the SRD-fed rats, the animals fed a SRD + chia showed a reduction in epididymal fat pad weight; the activities of antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD and GPx returned to control values, while GR significantly improved; mRNA GPx increased, and both mRNA SOD and the redox state of glutathione returned to control values; a significant increase in the expression of Nrf2 was recorded. These results were accompanied by a decrease in XO activity and ROS contents as well as plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels. Chia seeds reversed the decrease in PPARγ protein mass level and increased the n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio of membrane phospholipids. Besides, dyslipidemia and insulin sensitivity were normalized.This study provides new information concerning some mechanisms related to the beneficial effects of dietary chia seeds in reversing adipose tissue oxidative stress and improving the adipose tissue dysfunction induced by a SRD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179543>Effects of Selenite on Unicellular Green Microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa: Bioaccumulation of Selenium, Enhancement of Photosynthetic Pigments, and Amino  Production.</a></h2><p>Microalgae were studied as function bioaccumulators of selenium (Se) for food and feed supplement. To investigate the bioaccumulation of Se and its effects on the unicellular green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa, the algal growth curve, fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, and fatty  and amino  profiles were examined. We found that Se at low concentrations (≤40 mg L) positively promoted algal growth and inhibited lipid peroxidation and intracellular reactive oxygen species. The antioxidative effect was associated with an increase in the levels of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, , and photosynthetic pigments. Meanwhile, a significant increase in amino  and organic Se content was also detected in the microalgae. In contrast, we found opposite effects in C. pyrenoidosa exposed to >60 mg L Se. The antioxidation and toxicity appeared to be correlated with the bioaccumulation of excess Se. These results provide a better understanding of the effect of Se on green microalgae, which may help in the development of new technological applications for the production of Se-enriched biomass from microalgae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29315384>Induction of Stress Signaling In Vitro and Suppression of Gonadotropin Secretion by Free Fatty Acids in Female Mouse Gonadotropes.</a></h2><p>An emerging body of evidence supports the concept that the pituitary is a site for integration of multiple physiological and metabolic signals that inform and modulate endocrine pathways. Multiple endocrine mediators of  balance and adiposity are known to impinge on the neuroendocrine axis regulating reproduction. Observations in humans show that obesity is correlated with decreased gonadotropin secretion, and studies have also suggested that pituitary sensitivity to stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is decreased in obese individuals. Free fatty acids are a potential mediator of adiposity and  balance, but their impact as an endocrine modulator of pituitary function has not been closely examined. We evaluated the impact of free fatty acids on a pituitary gonadotrope cell line and in primary pituitary cultures of female mice. We show that increasing physiologically relevant doses of the monounsaturated ω-9 fatty  oleate induces cellular stress and increases production of reactive oxygen species in a mouse gonadotrope cell line. In contrast, the unsaturated ω-3 α- and ω-6 linoleic fatty acids do not have this effect. Additionally, oleate can activate immediate-early gene expression independent of GnRH stimulation but has a negative impact on GnRH induction and expression of the gonadotropin subunit gene Lhb. Further, oleate suppresses gonadotropin secretion in response to pulsatile stimulation by GnRH. These results indicate that free fatty acids can directly alter gonadotropin gene expression and secretion in response to GnRH and may provide a link between  sensing and reproduction.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27269709>Dietary fat intake and red blood cell fatty  composition of children and women from three different geographical areas in South Africa.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat intake, particularly the type of fat, is reflected in the red blood cell (RBC) fatty  (FA) profile and is vital in growth, development and health maintenance. The FA profile (%wt/wt) of RBC membrane phospholipids (as determined by gas chromatography) and dietary intake (as determined by 24h recall) was assessed in 2-6y old South African children and their caregivers randomly selected from three communities, i.e. an urban Northern Cape community (urban-NC; n=104), an urban coastal Western Cape community (urban-WC; n=93) and a rural Limpopo Province community (rural-LP; n=102). Mean RBC FA values across groups were compared using ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test while controlling for age and gender (children); median dietary intake values were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Dietary intakes for total fat, saturated FAs and polyunsaturated FAs were higher in the two urban areas compared to the rural area. Total fat intake in rural-LP, and omega-3 FA dietary intake in all three areas were lower than the South African adopted guidelines. Dietary SFA intake in both urban areas was higher than recommended by South African guidelines; this was reflected in the RBC membrane FA profile. Rural-LP children had the lowest intake of omega-3 and omega-6 FAs yet presented with the highest RBC docosahexaenoic  (DHA) profile and highest arachidonic  percentage. Although differences observed in dietary fat intake between the two urban and the rural area were reflected in the RBC membrane total phospholipid FA profile, the lowest total fat and α- (ALA) intake by rural children that presented with the highest RBC DHA profile warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Steers were fed in confinement (forage:concentrate ratio of 50 : 50; DM basis) or with different levels of  supplementation (0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2% BW) at pasture (Avena strigosa Schreb and Lolium multiflorum L.). There were no differences between treatments for ADG (average=1.60 kg/day), hot carcass weight (HCW) (average=229 kg) and subcutaneous fat depth (average=3 mm). Dressing % (P=0.06; tendency) and carcass ADG (P=0.02) linearly increased with level of supplementation for pasture steers. No differences were observed between treatments for tenderness, marbling, pH, color b*, or cooking loss and drip loss in samples of Longissimus dorsi. However L* increased linearly (P=0.05) with level of supplementation. The concentrations of myristic, palmitic, estearic and linoleic FA did not differ among treatments. The concentration of n-3 FA increased (P<0.001) in steers at pasture compared with confinement, but n-6 FA concentrations did not differ between feeding system. Supplementation up to 0.4% BW increase (P<0.001) conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and  FA concentrations in intramuscular fat when compared with confinement. The level of supplementation on pasture linearly decreased (P<0.001) n-3 and CLA and linearly increased (P=0.001) the n-6 : n-3 ratio. Finishing of steers grazing winter pasture with  supplementation or in confinement fed a medium-concentrate diet did not affect meat quality (tenderness, marbling, parameter b* on the CIE L*a*b* scale, cooking and drip losses) except for a* and L*.

Significant negative association of plasma AA was found with plasma LA and ALA and significant positive association with serum ferritin. Plasma DHA associated, negatively with plasma LA and ALA. We showed that in a population with low intakes of LA and ALA, the proportions of phospholipid LA and ALA determines the relative proportions of AA and DHA and low iron status probably attenuates the conversion of LA to AA.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of LR on mice with CCl-induced acute liver injury through conventional assays and metabolomics analysis. This study consisted of male mice ( = 23) in four groups (i.e., control, model, positive control, and LR). The extract of whole plant of LR was used to treat mice in the LR group. Biochemical and histological assays (i.e., serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and histological changes of liver tissue) were used to evaluate LR efficacy, and metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS and LC-MS was conducted to reveal metabolic changes. The conventional analysis and metabolomic profiles both suggested that LR treatment could protect mice against CCl-induced acute liver injury. The affected metabolic pathways included linoleic  metabolism, α- metabolism, arachidonic  metabolism, CoA biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and purine metabolism. This study identified eight metabolites, including phosphopantothenic , succinic , AMP, choline, glycerol 3-phosphate, linoleic , arachidonic , and DHA, as potential biomarkers for evaluating hepatoprotective effect of LR.

food and/or medicines are an increasing epidemiological problem.
Intolerance to acetylsalicylic  is connected to the intake of
some drugs and food containing salicylic . People suffering
from this intolerance have to follow an elimination diet limiting
the intake of salicylates.
The elimination diet can lead to deficiencies in nutrients, and
therefore we decided to test whether a low salicylate diet of various
calorie content (1500, 2000, 2500 kcal) can pose such a risk.Research material consisted of 30 diets
(10 for each calorie content), prepared using nutrition software
Dieta 5, recommended by the National Food and Nutrition Institute
in Poland. Average nutrients’ contents were calculated and
compared to current dietary standards for adults.A low salicylate diet supplying 1500 kcal is, both
for males and females, the most deficient diet with respect
to nutrients’ contents. In the case of women aged 19–30 insufficient
intake can relate to such nutrients as: potassium, calcium,
iodine, vitamin D, dietary fibre and . In women
aged 31–65 it can additionally lead to magnesium deficiencies.
In men aged 19–65 a low salicylate diet providing 1500 kcal may
not cover daily requirements for nine nutrients: besides those
mentioned above, also vitamins E and C. However, low salicylate
2000 kcal and 2500 kcal diets do not pose a greater risk with
respect to nutrient deficiencies.Long-term use of a low salicylic 1500 kcal diet poses
the greatest threat of nutrient deficiencies. Along with increasing
the calorie content in a diet, the number of deficient nutrients
decreases, but too high an  intake may lead to subjects
becoming overweight or obese. A low salicylate and low caloric
diet requires consideration of additional supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804909>Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: Bringing to life dietary recommendations throughout the life span.</a></h2><p>Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with loss of function mutations of lipoprotein lipase resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and accumulation of chylomicrons in plasma, often leading to acute pancreatitis.

A sensitive and specific biomarker for assessing Zn status is still needed.The major aim of this study was to examine if the changes in the content of plasma phospholipid LA, DGLA and LA: DGLA ratio can be used to efficiently predict the dietary Zn intake and plasma Zn status of humans.The study was performed on healthy human volunteers, 25-55 years of age. The dietary Zn intake was assessed using 24 h recall questionnaires. Plasma phospholipid fatty  analysis was done by gas chromatography, and plasma analysis of minerals by atomic absorption spectrometry. Biochemical, anthropometrical and hematological parameters were assessed.No significant relationship was found between the dietary and plasma zinc status (r = 0.07; p = 0.6). There was a statistically significant correlation between DGLA and plasma Zn (r = 0.39, p = 0.00). No relationship was observed between the linoleic  and plasma Zn, while there was a significant negative correlation between LA: DGLA ratio and plasma Zn status (r = -0.35, p = 0.01). Similarly, there were statistically significant difference in DGLA status (p = 0.004) and LA: DGLA ratio (p = 0.042) between the Zn formed groups.This study is an initial step in evaluating LA: DGLA ratio as a biomarker of Zn status in humans. The results are encouraging as they show that concentration of DGLA is decreased and LA: DGLA ratio increased in people with lower dietary Zn intake.

In this study, we provide a systematic investigation of the biomass productivity, photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence and fatty  content of the four green microalgae. The strains were grown in two primary monochromatic light wavelengths [red and blue LEDs (light emitting diode)], and in white LED conditions, respectively. Among them, blue LED light was determined as the best light for growth rate, followed by red LED and white LED. The chlorophyll generation was more sensitive to the monochromatic blue light. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as α- (18:3), which were perfect for human nutrition supplementation, showed high concentrations in these algae strains under blue LED.

It is an indicator of a disease emerging though fuzzy, dynamic, complex, nonspecific and subjective. Ginseng is regarded as the king of herbs. It is famous for the function of replenishing qi in traditional Chinese medicine. It has treatment potential for DE caused by various reasons. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of ginseng treating symptom DE with the method of metabolomics.Thirty-five rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal control group, DE model group and ginseng treatment group. The DE model rats were administered daily with ginseng decoctiondecoctiondecoction intragastrically and others with water for 15 days. Urine was analyzed with ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were built to distinguish the three groups in this study and find potential biomarkers.The three groups are clearly separated and find out their metabolic distinction in PCA score plots. It showed that the metabolic profile of ginseng treatment group was changed to normal control group after administration of ginseng. Fifteen potential biomarkers are identified by OPLS-DA including Xanthurenic , kynurenic , Pantothenic , which are chiefly involved in tryptophan metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, citric  cycle, bile  biosynthesis,  and linoleic  metabolism. These biomarkers and the networks of their corresponding pathways will help to explain the mechanism of DE and ginseng treatment.The results of blood biochemical indicators routine and urinary metabonomic reveal that ginseng have good abilities to regulate the  metabolism, immune function and antioxidant activities. And UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based metabolomics can provide useful information for the understanding of metabolic changes in DE rats after administration of ginseng in urine. The biomarkers and their corresponding pathways will provide further information of the mechanisms of ginseng in treating DE.

Here, we studied the lipid composition of thylakoid membranes and chloroplast ultrastructure in isoprene-emitting (IE) and nonisoprene-emitting (NE) poplar (Populus × canescens). We demonstrated that the total amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, digalactosyldiacylglycerols, phospholipids, and fatty acids is reduced in chloroplasts when isoprene biosynthesis is blocked. A significantly lower amount of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly  in NE chloroplasts, was associated with the reduced fluidity of thylakoid membranes, which in turn negatively affects photosystem II photochemical efficiency. The low photosystem II photochemical efficiency in NE plants was negatively correlated with nonphotochemical quenching and the -dependent component of nonphotochemical quenching. Transmission electron microscopy revealed alterations in the chloroplast ultrastructure in NE compared with IE plants. NE chloroplasts were more rounded and contained fewer grana stacks and longer stroma thylakoids, more plastoglobules, and larger associative zones between chloroplasts and mitochondria. These results strongly support the idea that in IE species, the function of this molecule is closely associated with the structural organization and functioning of plastidic membranes.© 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Nevertheless, not much is known about the association between adipose tissue α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and insulin resistance.We determined the association between adipose tissue n-3 FAs (total n-3 FAs, ALA, and EPA plus DHA) and insulin resistance in healthy adults.In this cross-sectional study, multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between adipose tissue FAs (ALA, EPA plus DHA, and total n-3 FAs) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in a subset of adult participants (n= 716; mean age: 58 y) from the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort.Compared with the lowest tertile, the third tertile (β = -0.13; 95% CI: -0.24, -0.01) of adipose tissue ALA was inversely associated with the HOMA-IR. When stratified by waist circumference, ALA continued to be inversely associated [third tertile: β = -0.17 (95% CI: -0.31, -0.02)] with the HOMA-IR in subjects with a waist circumference ≤88 cm in women or ≤102 cm in men but not in those with a larger waist circumference. No significant association was noted between adipose tissue EPA plus DHA and HOMA-IR.Higher adipose tissue ALA was inversely associated with insulin resistance in this cohort of healthy adult men and women. This finding appears to be more pronounced in individuals with a normal waist circumference.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453116>Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic fraction obtained from stranded driftwood feedstocks for lipid production by .</a></h2><p>Stranded driftwood feedstocks may represent, after pretreatment with steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis, a cheap C-source for producing biochemicals and biofuels using oleaginous yeasts. The hydrolysis was optimized using a response surface methodology (RSM). The solid loading (SL) and the dosage of enzyme cocktail (ED) were variated following a central composite design (CCD) aimed at optimizing the conversion of carbohydrates into lipids (Y) by the yeast  DBVPG 5870. A second-order polynomial equation was computed for describing the effect of ED and SL on Y. The best combination (ED = 3.10%; SL = 22.07%) for releasing the optimal concentration of carbohydrates which gave the highest predicted Y (27.32%) was then validated by a new hydrolysis. The resulting value of Y (25.26%) was close to the theoretical maximum value.

We have previously found that female offspring of rat dams that consumed a lard-based high-fat (HF) diet (60% fat-derived ) during pregnancy, or during pregnancy and lactation, were at a reduced risk of developing mammary cancer. To better understand the unexpected protective effects of early life lard exposure, we have applied lipidomics and nutrigenomics approaches to investigate the fatty  profile and global gene expression patterns in the mammary tissue of the female offspring. Consumption of this HF diet during gestation had few effects on the mammary tissue fatty acids profile of young adult offspring, while exposure from gestation throughout nursing promoted significant alterations in the fatty acids profile. Major differences were related to decreases in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and increases in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and conjugated  (CLA) concentrations. In addition several differences in gene expression patterns by microarray analysis between the control and in utero or in utero and during lactation HF exposed offspring were identified. Differential dependency network (DDN) analysis indicated that many of the genes exhibited unique connections to other genes only in the HF offspring. These unique connections included Hrh1-Ythdf1 and Repin1-Elavl2 in the in utero HF offspring, and Rnf213-Htr3b and Klf5-Chrna4 in the in utero and lactation HF offspring, compared with the control offspring. We conclude that an exposure to a lard-based HF diet during early life changes the fatty  profile and transcriptional network in mammary gland in young adult rats, and these changes appear to be consistent with reduced mammary cancer risk observed in our previous study.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we showed that overexpressing microRNA167A (miR167OE) in camelina (Camelina sativa) under a seed-specific promoter changed fatty  composition and increased seed size. Specifically, the miR167OE seeds had a lower α- with a concomitantly higher linoleic  content than the wild-type. This decreased level of fatty  desaturation corresponded to a decreased transcriptional expression of the camelina fatty  desaturase3 (CsFAD3) in developing seeds. MiR167 targeted the transcription factor auxin response factor (CsARF8) in camelina, as had been reported previously in Arabidopsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments combined with transcriptome analysis indicated that CsARF8 bound to promoters of camelina bZIP67 and ABI3 genes. These transcription factors directly or through the ABI3-bZIP12 pathway regulate CsFAD3 expression and affect α- accumulation. In addition, to decipher the miR167A-CsARF8 mediated transcriptional cascade for CsFAD3 suppression, transcriptome analysis was conducted to implicate mechanisms that regulate seed size in camelina. Expression levels of many genes were altered in miR167OE, including orthologs that have previously been identified to affect seed size in other plants. Most notably, genes for seed coat development such as suberin and lignin biosynthesis were down-regulated. This study provides valuable insights into the regulatory mechanism of fatty  metabolism and seed size determination, and suggests possible approaches to improve these important traits in camelina.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268073>[CONSENSUS ON FATS AND OILS IN THE DIET OF S ISH ADULTS; POSITION PAPER OF THE SPANISH FEDERATION OF FOOD, NUTRITION AND DIETETICS SOCIETIES].</a></h2><p>The quality of dietary fat critically influences health. In this consensus document the scientific evidence relating effects of dietary fat quantity and quality on cardiovascular risk is reviewed and recommendations for the Spanish adult population are issued. As a novelty in nutrition guidelines, emphasis is made more on parent foods than on fatty acids per se. In summary, replacing saturated fatty acids (SFA) for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces cardiovascular risk. Recent data suggest that SFA proper may be harmful or not depending on the parent food, a reason why an intake threshold is not established, but consumption of foods containing excess SFA, such as butter, some processed meats, and commercial confectionery and fried foods is discouraged. The established threshold of <1 % of  intake as trans FA, well known to be harmful for cardiovascular risk, is fulfilled in Spain due in part to its present low levels in margarines. MUFA are beneficial or neutral for cardiovascular risk depending on their dietary sources (virgin olive oil versus other fats), and no intake limitations are established.n-6 PUFA are cardioprotective and recommended intakes (5-10 % of ) are not always fulfilled in the Spanish population, thus increased consumption of their vegetable food sources (seeds, derived oils, and margarines)is encouraged. Marine n-3 PUFA are also cardioprotective and the recommendation stands to eat fatty fish≥2 servings/weeks to reach intake levels of at least 250 mg/day. Increasing evidence suggests that  (ALA), the vegetable n-3 PUFA, is also cardioprotective,but the parent foods (walnuts, soy products,green-leaf vegetables) may provide benefits beyond ALA itself. Finally, low-fat (high carbohydrate, particularly when having a high glycemic index) diets appear to lack cardiovascular preventive effects, while high-fat,high-vegetable fat dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, are protective, a reason why no upper limit on fat intake is established for the Spanish population.This position statement targets dietitians, nutritionists and other health professionals involved in dietary counsel so they can deliver it rightly and according to the last scientific evidence.Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

The culture media composition plays a crucial role in biomass and lipid production and productivity.The photosynthetic green microalga C. vulgaris was studied in three distinct cultivation experiments each for 22 days, using BG11 and f/2 culture media to investigate the effects of different levels of nitrogen and culture media replacement on cell growth, lipid production and productivity.In f/2 culture medium, the total lipid production reached was 0.246 g L-1 (41.55%) which was 147% higher than its counterpart in BG11 medium (0.298 g L-1). On the other hand, the highest biomass (1.492 g L-1) was attained in BG11-3 medium with 6.00 g nitrate L-1 and this was correlated with higher total chlorophyll content (15.189 mg L-1) and cell number (3.812 × 106 cell mL-1). A fatty  profile, composed of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was detected and included stearic , oleic , α- and γ- which have nutritional or combustion importance.These data suggest that this C. vulgaris strain may be considered as a robust source for biomass, lipid and green  production.

Nitrogen (N) deficiency is a common strategy to trigger the lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms. Although a simple pathway from N depletion in the medium to lipid accumulation has been elucidated at the enzymatic level, global changes at protein levels upon N depletion have not been investigated. In this study, we have systematically analyzed the changes at the levels of protein expression in M. circinelloides WJ11, a high lipid-producing strain (36 %, lipid/cell dry weight), during lipid accumulation.Proteomic analysis demonstrated that N depletion increased the expression of glutamine synthetase, involved in ammonia assimilation, for the supply of cellular nitrogen but decreased the metabolism of amino acids. Upon N deficiency, many proteins (e.g., fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase) involved in glycolytic pathway were up-regulated while proteins involved in the tricarboxylic  cycle (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA ligase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase) were down-regulated, indicating this activity was retarded thereby leading to a greater flux of carbon into fatty  biosynthesis. Moreover, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transaldolase and transketolase, which participate in the pentose phosphate pathway, were up-regulated, leading to the increased production of NADPH, the reducing power for fatty  biosynthesis. Furthermore, protein and nucleic  metabolism were down-regulated and some proteins involved in  metabolism, signal transduction, molecular chaperone and redox homeostasis were up-regulated upon N depletion, which may be the cellular response to the stress produced by the onset of N deficiency.N limitation increased those expressions of the proteins involved in ammonia assimilation but decreased that involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids. Upon N deprivation, the glycolytic pathway was up-regulated, while the activity of the tricarboxylic  cycle was retarded, thus, leading more carbon flux to fatty  biosynthesis. Moreover, the pentose phosphate pathway was up-regulated, then this would increase the production of NADPH. Together, coordinated regulation of central carbon metabolism upon N limitation, provides more carbon flux to acetyl-CoA and NADPH for fatty  biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26041673>Dietary α- and Total ω-3 Fatty Acids Are Inversely Associated with Abdominal Aortic Calcification in Older Women, but Not in Older Men.</a></h2><p>Associations of α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus decosahexaenoic  (DHA), and total omega-3 (n-3) fatty  (FA) intakes with abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) are not well understood.This study explored the associations between baseline and long-term changes in ω-3 FA consumption and AAC severity among community-dwelling older men and women.The present study used a subset of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study in which participants were interviewed in 1990-1994 and again in 2010-2011. Dietary intake was evaluated at both baseline and follow-up with use of food-frequency questionnaires. AAC severity was assessed by both lateral thoraco-lumbar radiography and dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at follow-up.A total of 312 participants aged 45-64 y old at baseline were followed for a duration of (mean ± SD) 18 ± 1 y. Baseline -adjusted ALA intake tended to be inversely associated with AAC severity by radiography [OR (95% CI) for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: 0.49 (0.23, 1.02), P-trend: 0.06] and was inversely associated with AAC severity by DXA [OR (95% CI) for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: 0.37 (0.16, 0.83)] in women, after adjustment for confounders. Women in the third tertile of total ω-3 FA intake had significantly lower AAC severity by radiography [OR (95% CI): 0.33 (0.16, 0.71)] and DXA [OR (95% CI): 0.27 (0.12, 0.62)] than those in the first tertile. Changes in tertile of ω-3 FA intake over 18 y were not found to be associated with AAC severity in either men or women.The results of our study suggest that dietary ALA and total ω-3 FA intakes are both important predictors of the development of AAC in older women, but not in older men.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452961>Relationship of the Reported Intakes of Fat and Fatty Acids to Body Weight in US Adults.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat composition may modulate  expenditure and body weight. Little is known about the relationship between fatty  intake and body weight at a population level. The purposes of this study were to compare intakes of , macronutrients, and individual fatty acids across BMI categories (1) for the US adult population and, (2) by sociodemographic groups. Reported dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and What We Eat in America (WWEIA) surveys in the years 2005-2012 were analyzed. Overall, we found that the reported intake of carbohydrate, protein, total fat, total saturated fat (as well as long-chain saturated fatty acids 14:0-18:0), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were positively associated with BMI; while lauric  (a medium-chain saturated fatty , 12:0) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (as well as all individual PUFAs) were not associated with BMI. Non-Hispanic black individuals demonstrated a negative association between BMI and  intake and a positive association between total PUFAs, linoleic  (LA), α- (ALA) and BMI. Individuals with less than a high school education showed a negative association between BMI and DHA. Mexican-Americans reported intakes with no association between BMI and , any macronutrient, or individual fatty acids. These findings support those of experimental studies demonstrating fatty -dependent associations between dietary fatty  composition and body weight.

We tested the hypothesis that a high SFA diet, compared to a high MUFA (oleic  18:1n-9) diet, reduces ALA conversion to long chain n-3 fatty acids. Mice were fed for 12 weeks on three diets: (1) a control, 16 % fat  diet consisting of similar levels of SFA and MUFA (2) a 50 % fat  high MUFA  diet (35 % MUFA and 7 % SFA) or (3) a 50 % fat , high SFA  diet (34 % SFA, 8 % MUFA). ALA and LNA content remained constant. Analysis of hepatic lipids demonstrated a selective reduction (40 %) in ALA but not LNA and a 35 % reduction in eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3) in the high MUFA mice compared to the other groups. Lower content of ALA was reflected in the neutral lipid fraction, while smaller levels of phospholipid esterified EPA and docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5n-3) were evident. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) content was elevated by the high SFA diet. Expression of Fads1 (Δ5 desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6 desaturase) was elevated by the high MUFA and reduced by the high SFA diet. These data indicate that a high MUFA diet, but not a high SFA diet, reduces ALA metabolism and point to selective hepatic disposition of ALA versus LNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27706704>Chemical and genetic diversity of high-seed-yield sorghum (Sorghum bicolor M.) germplasms.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the chemical and genetic diversity of high-seed-yield sorghum germplasms from Korea, the United States, and South Africa. We identified significant differences in the chemical contents of whole plants at the heading stage in all cultivars, including differences in crude protein, fat, fiber, ash, neutral detergent fiber,  detergent fiber, mineral, and fatty  contents. Our results suggest that Banwoldang is the most appropriate cultivar for roughage because of its high protein yield. We identified significant differences in the tannin, flavonoid, amylose, mineral, crude fat, fatty , and 3-deoxyanthocyanin contents in the whole grain from all cultivars, but not in the mineral or crude fat contents. Tannin levels were generally low. IS645 contained the highest levels of flavonoids and  compounds, and Moktak had the highest amylose and deoxyanthocyanidin content in the grain. To assess genetic diversity, we used 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer sets to identify 38 alleles with 3-8 alleles per locus. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the SSR markers, the sorghum cultivars were divided into three major groups. Comparison of clusters based on chemical compositions with those based on SSRs showed that the groups formed by the three native Korean cultivars clustered similarly in molecular dendrograms. Association analysis was conducted for the 10 SSR marker; 48 chemical and growth traits were present for two marker traits (seed color and whole plant fatty  content) with significant marker-trait associations. These markers could be used to select sorghum cultivars for breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923750>Delta-6-desaturase (FADS2) inhibition and omega-3 fatty acids in skeletal muscle protein turnover.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential dietary components. They are not only used for , but also act as signaling molecules. The delta-6 desaturase (D6D) enzyme, encoded by the FADS2 gene, is one of two rate limiting enzymes that convert the PUFA precursors - α- (n-3) and linoleic  (n-6) to their respective metabolites. Alterations in the D6D enzyme activity alters fatty  profiles and are associated with metabolic and inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Omega-3 PUFAs, specifically its constituent fatty acids DHA and EPA, are known for their anti-inflammatory ability and are also beneficial in the prevention of skeletal muscle wasting, however the mechanism for muscle preservation is not well understood. Moreover, little is known of the effects of altering the n-6/n-3 ratio in the context of a high-fat diet, which is known to downregulate protein synthesis. Twenty C57BL6 male mice were fed a high-fat lard (HFL, 45% fat (mostly lard), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 13:1) diet for 6 weeks. Mice were then divided into 4 groups (n = 5 per group): HFL- , high-fat oil- (HFO, 45% fat (mostly Menhaden oil), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 1:3), HFL+ (HFL diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100 mg/kg/day), and HFO+ (HFO diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100 mg/kg/day). After 2 weeks on their respective diets and treatments, animals were sacrificed and gastrocnemius muscle harvested. Protein turnover signaling were analyzed via Western Blot. 4-EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 expression were measured. A two-way ANOVA revealed no significant change in the phosphorylation of both 4EBP-1 and ribosomal protein S6 with diet or inhibitor. There was a significant reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation with the inhibition of FADS2 (p = 0.03). Additionally, we measured markers of protein degradation through levels of FOXO phosphorylation, ubiquitin, and LC3B expression; there was a trend towards increased phosphorylation of FOXO (p = 0.08) and ubiquitinated proteins (p = 0.05) with FADS2 inhibition. LC3B expression, a marker of autophagy, was significantly higher in the HFL plus FADS2 inhibition group from all other comparisons. Lastly, we analyzed activation of mitochondrial biogenesis which is closely linked with protein synthesis through PGC1-α and Cytochrome-C expression, however no significant differences were associated with either marker across all groups. Collectively, these data suggest that the protective effects of muscle mass by omega-3 fatty acids are from inhibition of protein degradation. Our aim was to determine the role of PUFA metabolites, DHA and EPA, in skeletal muscle protein turnover and assess the effects of n-3s independently. We observed that by inhibiting the FADS2 enzyme, the protective effect of n-3s on protein synthesis and proliferation was lost; concomitantly, protein degradation was increased with FADS2 inhibition regardless of diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824732>Intake of essential fatty acids in Indonesian children: secondary analysis of data from a nationally representative survey.</a></h2><p>Essential fatty acids (EFA) such as α- (ALA) and linoleic  (LA) are needed for healthy growth and development of children. Worldwide, reliable intake data of EFA are often lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate dietary intake of EFA in Indonesian children. Dietary intake data of 4-12-year-old children (n 45,821) from a nationally representative Indonesian survey were used to estimate median intake and distribution of population fatty  intake. Missing data on individual fatty acids in the Indonesian food composition table were complemented through chemical analyses of national representative food samples and imputation of data from the US nutrient database. Nutrient adequacy ratios were calculated as a percentage of FAO/WHO intake recommendations. The medians of total fat intake of the children was 26·7 (10th-90th percentile 11·2-40·0) percentage of total daily  (%E). Intakes of fatty acids were 4·05 (10th-90th percentile 1·83-7·22) %E for total PUFA, 3·36 (10th-90th percentile 1·14-6·29) %E for LA and 0·20 (10th-90th percentile 0·07-0·66) %E for ALA. Median intake of PUFA was 67 % and that of ALA 40 % of the minimum amounts recommended by FAO/WHO. These data indicate that a majority of Indonesian children has intakes of PUFA and specifically ALA that are lower than recommended intake levels. Total fat and LA intakes may be suboptimal for a smaller yet considerable proportion of children. Public health initiatives should provide practical guidelines to promote consumption of PUFA-rich foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649756>Transcriptional effects of phospholipid fatty  profile on rainbow trout liver cells exposed to methylmercury.</a></h2><p>Lipids, and their constitutive fatty acids, are key nutrients for fish health as they provide , maintain cell structure, are precursors of signalling molecules and act as nuclear receptor ligands. These specific roles may be of crucial importance in a context of exposure to pollutants. We recently showed that the fatty  profile of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids modulates sensitivity to an acute methylmercury challenge. In order to investigate mechanisms of effects, we herein tested whether specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may protect cells from methylmercury through decreasing intracellular mercury accumulation and/or enhancing cellular defences (e.g. via modulation of gene expression patterns). We also investigated the inverse relationship and assessed the impact of methylmercury on cellular fatty  metabolism. To do so, the fatty  composition of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids was first modified by incubating them in a medium enriched in a specific PUFA from either the n-3 family (, ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or the n-6 family (linoleic , LA; arachidonic , AA). Cells were then exposed to methylmercury (0.15 or 0.50 μM) for 24 h and sampled thereafter for assessing phospholipid fatty  profile, intracellular total mercury burden, and expression pattern of genes involved in fatty  metabolism, synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that cells incorporated the given PUFA and some biotransformation products in their phospholipids. Methylmercury had few impacts on this cellular phospholipid composition. None of the PUFA enrichments affected the cellular mercury burden, suggesting that the previously observed cytoprotection conferred by ALA and EPA was not linked to a global decrease in cellular accumulation of mercury. Fatty  enrichments and methylmercury exposure both modulated gene expression patterns. Genes involved in the synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules, in stress response and the orphan cytochrome P450 20A1 were identified as possible sites of interaction between fatty acids and methylmercury in rainbow trout liver cells.Copyright © 2018.

Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Plasma fatty  composition was analyzed in a subset of mothers ( = 41). Newborn body composition was assessed using air-displacement plethysmography. All analyses were adjusted for gestational age, sex, physical activity, and total  intake.Dietary fatty  intakes were positively associated with plasma phospholipid fatty acids for total omega-3 fatty acids (= 0.452, = 0.003), ALA (= 0.339, = 0.03), linoleic  (= 0.353, = 0.03), eicosapentaenoic  (= 0.407, = 0.009), and docosahexaenoic  (= 0.388, = 0.01). Higher maternal intake of ALA (% total fat) was associated with higher offspring birth weight [189.7-g increase per 1% higher ALA (95% CI: 14, 365 g); = .04], although individually neither newborn fat mass nor fat-free mass was significant. Birth weight increased across tertiles of maternal ALA intake ( = 0.05), with birth weight being 221 g (95% CI: 12, 429 g) higher in those with the highest maternal ALA intake compared with those with the lowest intake (= 0.04). Mothers of infants born small for gestational age ( = 32) had a lower ALA intake than those born appropriate for gestational age ( = 162) or large for gestational age [( = 21); = 0.05].In otherwise healthy women giving birth at a major tertiary hospital in Australia, intake of ALA during pregnancy is associated with higher offspring birth weight.

The objective of this study was to assess the modulatory effect of PSO on lipid metabolism. Lard oil, safflower oil (SFO), and PSO were fed to wistar rats with 1% cholesterol in the diet for 60 d. Serum and liver lipids showed significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in PSO fed rats compared to lard oil and SFO fed rats. ALA, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), contents were significantly increased, whereas linoleic  (LA), arachidonic  (AA) levels decreased in serum and liver of PSO fed rats.

Seventy-two 23-week-old laying hens (Tetra-SL) divided into six experimental diets (four replicates and three birds per replication) in a completely randomized design for nine weeks. Experimental diets were included: 1) control (no oil), 2) 3.00% fish oil, 3) 3.00% olive oil, 4) 3.00% grape seed oil, 5) 3.00% canola oil, and 6) 3.00% soybean oil. The diets were similar in terms of  and protein. Egg production, egg mass, egg weight, feed intake, feed conversion ratio and fatty  composition of egg yolk were determined at the end of the trial. The results indicated that the performance parameters were not significantly different between treatments in the entire period (p > 0.05). However, fatty acids profiles of yolk were affected by experimental diets (p < 0.05). Fish oil significantly reduced omega-6 fatty acids and increased docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) in egg yolk. Also canola oil increased  content in the egg yolk. In conclusion, fish oil increased omega-3 long-chain fatty acids and decreased omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in eggs which may have beneficial effects on human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436911>Seed traits, fatty  profile and genetic diversity assessment in Pongamia pinnata (L.)

Out of these, fatty  profiles of 38 accessions selected based on their high and low oil content was analyzed. Fatty  profile revealed high variability in stearic, oleic and linoleic  which varied from 0.42 to 10.61 %, 34.34 to 74.58 %, and 7.00 to 31.28 % respectively. Variations in palmitic and  were small. Iodine value, saponification number and cetane number (CN) of fatty  methyl esters (FAME) of seed oil ranges from 186.99 to 201.25, 81.13 to 108.19 and 46.16 to 56.47 respectively. Fatty  compositions, degree of unsaturation and CN are the important parameters, which are used to determine quality of FAME were used as biodiesel. Some of the Pongamia accessions identified were higher in oil content while some accessions showed higher degree of unsaturation and a few of them had CN values higher than 55. Genetic diversity analysis with six TE-AFLP primers generated a total of 334 bands out of which 174 (52.10 %) were polymorphic. The genetic similarity ranged from 0.11 to 0.47. These findings clearly showed high level of genetic diversity and all economically desirable traits were not present in a single genotype of Pongamia. All these traits could be selected from these CPTs and transfer to a single elite variety through selection and breeding programme and could be utilized for large scale multiplication and plantation to produce high quantity and quality biodiesel in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29526089>Fatty  Profile and the sn-2 Position Distribution in Triacylglycerols of Breast Milk during Different Lactation Stages.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) is the major  resource in breast milk, which is important for infant development. FAs profiles with sn-2 positional preference were an important part of triacylglycerols due to their better availability. This profile is still not replicated in artificial formulas. This study quantified the FAs profile of total and sn-2 position in human breast milk samples from 103 healthy volunteers during colostrum, transitional, and mature stages. Multicomponent analysis showed significant differences in FAs profiles of different lactation periods, due to that with relative percentage less than 1%. Linoleic  (LA), mostly located at the sn-1,3 positions of TAGs, was more common in the milk of Chinese women than in western women. The majority of the breast milk did not meet the standard for the ratio of LA/α- for infant formula. FAs related to brain development, mainly at sn-2 in TAGs, were enriched in colostrum. Capric and lauric acids were enriched in transitional and mature breast milk, and capric  showed sn-1,3 selectivity in TAGs. This study will aid the development of infant formula containing TAGs more similar to human breast milk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554540>Plasma unbound free fatty  profiles in premature infants before and after intralipid infusion.</a></h2><p>Unbound free fatty acids (FFAu) are the bioactive fraction of plasma free fatty acids (FFA). Most plasma FFA are bound to albumin. Only when FFA dissociate from albumin, do they become biologically active.To measure the first FFAu profiles in human infants and to measure these profiles before and during intravenous administration of the soybean lipid, intralipid (IL).The study population was 16 premature infants, from a parent study of 130 infants with birth weights 500-2000 g and gestational age 23-34 weeks. The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound oleic, myristic, and  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of lipid metabolism in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of arachidonic from linoleic  may tend to promote patency. The high levels of unbound myristate may be needed for immediate neonatal  needs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29878554>Controversies in the Use of Lipid Injectable Emulsion in Hospitalized Patients.</a></h2><p>Soybean oil-based lipid injectable emulsion (SO-based ILE) is an 18-carbon, ω-6 macronutrient providing a concentrated source of calories, which can be administered in or with parenteral nutrition to patients unable to tolerate or consume adequate enteral nutrition.

A suboptimal maternal diet during pregnancy might lead to fetal cardiometabolic adaptations with persistent consequences in the offspring.We examined the associations of maternal PUFA concentrations during pregnancy with childhood general and abdominal fat-distribution measures.In a population-based, prospective cohort study of 4830 mothers and their children, we measured maternal second-trimester plasma n-3 (ω-3) and n-6 (ω-6) PUFA concentrations. At the median age of 6.0 y (95% range: 5.6, 7.9 y), we measured childhood body mass index (BMI), the fat mass percentage, and the android:gynoid fat ratio with the use of dual- X-ray absorptiometry and measured the preperitoneal abdominal fat area with the use of ultrasound. Analyses were adjusted for maternal and childhood sociodemographic- and lifestyle-related characteristics.We observed that higher maternal total n-3 PUFA concentrations, and specifically those of eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic , were associated with a lower childhood total-body fat percentage and a lower android:gynoid fat mass ratio (P< 0.05) but not with childhood BMI and the abdominal preperitoneal fat mass area. Higher maternal total n-6 PUFA concentrations, and specifically those of dihomo-γ-, were associated with a higher childhood total-body fat percentage, android:gynoid fat mass ratio, and abdominal preperitoneal fat mass area (P< 0.05) but not with childhood BMI. In line with these findings, a higher maternal n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was associated with higher childhood total-body and abdominal fat mass.Lower maternal n-3 PUFA concentrations and higher n-6 PUFA concentrations during pregnancy are associated with higher body fat and abdominal fat in childhood. Additional studies are needed to replicate these observations and to explore the causality, the underlying pathways, and the long-term cardiometabolic consequences.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937492>Fat Loss in Continuous Enteral Feeding of the Preterm Infant: How Much, What and When Is It Lost?</a></h2><p>Human milk fat is a concentrated source of  and provides essential and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. According to previous experiments, human milk fat is partially lost during continuous enteral nutrition. However, these experiments were done over relatively short infusion times, and a complete profile of the lost fatty acids was never measured. Whether this loss happens considering longer infusion times or if some fatty acids are lost more than others remain unknown. Pooled breast milk was infused through a feeding tube by a peristaltic pump over a period of 30 min and 4, 12 and 24 h at 2 mL/h. Adsorbed fat was extracted from the tubes, and the fatty  composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total fat loss (average fatty  loss) after 24 h was 0.6 ± 0.1%. Total fat loss after 24 h infusion was 0.6 ± 0.1% of the total fat infused, although the highest losses occur in the first 30 min of infusion (13.0 ± 1.6%). Short-medium chain (0.7%,  = 0.15), long chain (0.6%,  = 0.56), saturated (0.7%,  = 0.4), monounsaturated (0.5%,  = 0.15), polyunsaturated fatty (0.7%,  = 0.15), linoleic (0.7%,  = 0.25), and docosahexaenoic acids (0.6%,  = 0.56) were not selectively adsorbed to the tube. However, very long chain fatty (0.9%,  = 0.04),  (1.6%,  = 0.02) and arachidonic acids (1%,  = 0.02) were selectively adsorbed and, therefore, lost in a greater proportion than other fatty acids.

The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% fat), FO diet (NY, 10% fat), HFD (60% fat), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% fat) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without palmitic  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness,  absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281230>Identifying the Interaction of Vancomycin With Novel pH-Responsive Lipids as Antibacterial Biomaterials Via Accelerated Molecular Dynamics and Binding Free  Calculations.</a></h2><p>Nano-drug delivery systems have proven to be an efficient formulation tool to overcome the challenges with current antibiotics therapy and resistance. A series of pH-responsive lipid molecules were designed and synthesized for future liposomal formulation as a nano-drug delivery system for vancomycin at the infection site. The structures of these lipids differ from each other in respect of hydrocarbon tails: Lipid1, 2, 3 and 4 have stearic, oleic, linoleic, and  hydrocarbon chains, respectively. The impact of variation in the hydrocarbon chain in the lipid structure on drug encapsulation and release profile, as well as mode of drug interaction, was investigated using molecular modeling analyses. A wide range of computational tools, including accelerated molecular dynamics, normal molecular dynamics, binding free  calculations and principle component analysis, were applied to provide comprehensive insight into the interaction landscape between vancomycin and the designed lipid molecules. Interestingly, both MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA binding affinity calculations using normal molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics trajectories showed a very consistent trend, where the order of binding affinity towards vancomycin was lipid4 > lipid1 > lipid2 > lipid3. From both normal molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics, the interaction of lipid3 with vancomycin is demonstrated to be the weakest (∆G = -2.17 and -11.57, for normal molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics, respectively) when compared to other complexes. We believe that the degree of unsaturation of the hydrocarbon chain in the lipid molecules may impact on the overall conformational behavior, interaction mode and encapsulation (wrapping) of the lipid molecules around the vancomycin molecule. This thorough computational analysis prior to the experimental investigation is a valuable approach to guide for predicting the encapsulation ability, drug release and further development of novel liposome-based pH-responsive nano-drug delivery system with refined structural and chemical features of potential lipid molecule for formulation development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27169831>Dietary intake and adipose tissue content of α- and risk of myocardial infarction: a Danish cohort study.</a></h2><p>Intake of the plant-derived ω-3 (n-3) fatty  α- (ALA, 18:3; n-3) may reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but the results of previous studies have been inconsistent.We aimed to investigate the association between dietary intake of ALA, adipose tissue content of ALA, and risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI).A total of 57,053 participants, aged 50-64 y, were enrolled in the prospective Danish cohort study Diet, Cancer and Health between 1993 and 1997. Dietary intake of ALA was assessed with the use of a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire in the full cohort, whereas the adipose tissue content of ALA was determined with the use of gas chromatography in all incident MI cases and in a random sex-stratified sample of the total cohort (n = 3500).During a median of 17 y of follow-up, we identified 2177 male and 912 female cases of MI. After appropriate exclusions, we included 2124 men and 854 women for analyses of dietary intake of ALA, whereas 1994 men and 770 women were included in the analysis of the adipose tissue content of ALA. In multivariate analyses that were conducted with the use of restricted cubic splines and adjusted for established CHD risk factors, weak positive associations in men and weak U-shaped associations in women were shown between both dietary intake and the adipose tissue content of ALA and risk of MI, but these associations were not statistically significant. Additional adjustments for dietary factors did not influence the observed associations numerically.This study suggests that ALA has no appreciable association with risk of incident MI in either men or women.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29048374>Brain and Hepatic Mt mRNA Is Reduced in Response to Mild  Restriction and n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty  Deficiency in Juvenile Rats.</a></h2><p>Metallothioneins (MTs) perform important regulatory and cytoprotective functions in tissues including the brain.

Over 50% of fatty acids in Arabidopsis () seed oil have a cis-double bond on an even-numbered carbon. Degradation of these substrates requires peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation plus additional enzyme activities. Such auxiliary enzymes, including the enoyl-CoA hydratase ECH2, convert (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates to the core β-oxidation substrate (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. ECH2 was suggested to function in the peroxisomal conversion of indole-3-butyric  (IBA) to indole-3-acetic , because  seedlings have altered IBA responses. The underlying mechanism connecting ECH2 activity and IBA metabolism is unclear. Here, we show that  seedlings have reduced root length, smaller cotyledons, and arrested pavement cell expansion. At the cellular level, reduced oil body mobilization and enlarged peroxisomes suggest compromised β-oxidation.  seedlings accumulate 3-hydroxyoctenoate (C8:1-OH) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C8:0-OH), putative hydrolysis products of catabolic intermediates for α- and linoleic , respectively. Wild-type seedlings treated with 3-hydroxyoctanoate have like growth defects and altered IBA responses.  phenotypes are not rescued by Suc or auxin application. However,  phenotypes are suppressed in combination with the core β-oxidation mutants  or , and  seedlings accumulate less C8:1-OH and C8:0-OH than  seedlings. These results indicate that  phenotypes require efficient core β-oxidation. Our findings suggest that low ECH2 activity causes metabolic alterations through a toxic effect of the accumulating intermediates. These effects manifest in altered lipid metabolism and IBA responses leading to disrupted seedling development.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and  metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and oleic acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies.

The mean (SD) age at death was 89.9 (6.1) years, 67% (193) were women, and the mean (SD) educational attainment was 14.6 (2.7) years.Seafood intake was first measured by a food frequency questionnaire at a mean of 4.5 years before death.Dementia-related pathologies assessed were Alzheimer disease, Lewy bodies, and the number of macroinfarcts and microinfarcts. Dietary consumption of seafood and n-3 fatty acids was annually assessed by a food frequency questionnaire in the years before death. Tissue concentrations of mercury and selenium were measured using instrumental neutron activation analyses.Among the 286 autopsied brains of 544 participants, brain mercury levels were positively correlated with the number of seafood meals consumed per week (ρ = 0.16; P = .02). In models adjusted for age, sex, education, and total  intake, seafood consumption (≥ 1 meal[s]/week) was significantly correlated with less Alzheimer disease pathology including lower density of neuritic plaques (β = -0.69 score units [95% CI, -1.34 to -0.04]), less severe and widespread neurofibrillary tangles (β = -0.77 score units [95% CI, -1.52 to -0.02]), and lower neuropathologically defined Alzheimer disease (β = -0.53 score units [95% CI, -0.96 to -0.10]) but only among apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) carriers. Higher intake levels of α- (18:3 n-3) were correlated with lower odds of cerebral macroinfarctions (odds ratio for tertiles 3 vs 1, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.94]). Fish oil supplementation had no statistically significant correlation with any neuropathologic marker. Higher brain concentrations of mercury were not significantly correlated with increased levels of brain neuropathology.In cross-sectional analyses, moderate seafood consumption was correlated with lesser Alzheimer disease neuropathology. Although seafood consumption was also correlated with higher brain levels of mercury, these levels were not correlated with brain neuropathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27430386>-enriched Diacylglycerol Enhances Postprandial Fat Oxidation in Healthy Subjects: A Randomized Double-blind Controlled Trail.</a></h2><p>-enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG) reduces visceral fat area and body fat in rodents and humans compared to conventional triacylglycerol (TAG). Although ALA-DAG increases dietary fat utilization as  in rodents, its effects in humans are not known. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover intervention trial performed to clarify the effect of ALA-DAG on postprandial  metabolism in humans. Nineteen healthy subjects participated in this study, and postprandial  metabolism was evaluated using indirect calorimetry followed by 14-d repeated pre-consumption of TAG (rapeseed oil) as a control or ALA-DAG. As a primary outcome, ALA-DAG induced significantly higher postprandial fat oxidation than TAG. As a secondary outcome, carbohydrate oxidation tended to be decreased. In addition, postprandial  expenditure was significantly increased by ALA-DAG compared to TAG. These findings suggest that daily ALA-DAG consumption stimulates dietary fat utilization as  after a meal, as well as greater diet induced thermogenesis in healthy humans. In conclusion, repeated consumption of ALA-DAG enhanced postprandial fat metabolism after a meal, which may partially explain its visceral fat area-reducing effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474397>Thymol feed supplementation in quail alters the percentages of nutritionally relevant egg yolk fatty acids: effects throughout incubation.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are crucial components of egg yolk and particularly prone to oxidative damage, generating losses of nutrients for embryonic development and influencing the quality of eggs for human consumption. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dietary thymol (a natural antioxidant) is related to changes in quail egg yolk total (T), triglyceride (TG) and phospholipid (PL) fatty  composition at different stages of embryo development. Thus female Japanese quail (100 days of age) were assigned to one of two dietary treatments (12 individuals each): CON (basal diet) or THY (0.0016 mol thymol day per bird). After 2 weeks of supplementation, eggs were incubated and samples were obtained at 0, 4 and 16 days of embryonic development.In 0 day THY eggs, α- and n-3 PUFA in T and TG, docosahexaenoic  and PUFA in T and arachidonic  in TG were increased, while saturated fatty acids (SFA) in T were reduced. From 4 days on, PUFA, n-3 PUFA and SFA from T and TG in THY eggs were found to be similar to those of CON eggs. The changes in PL throughout incubation were similar in both dietary treatments.Thymol would provide the embryo with PUFA for synthesis/deposition in membranes and/or assign to supply . Additionally, thymol supplementation would be advisable for the production of healthier table eggs. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371981>A liposome-based formulation containing equol, dihomo-γ- and propionyl-l-carnitine to prevent and treat hair loss: A prospective investigation.</a></h2><p>Hair loss is a common aesthetic disorder that can be triggered by genetic, inflammatory, hormonal, and environmental factors acting on hair follicles and their life cycle. There are several types of hair loss that differ in causes, symptoms, and spatial and temporal progression. Androgenic alopecia, a common form of hair loss, is the consequence of a decreased microcirculation of the scalp as well as the toxic action of elevated dihydrotestosterone levels on the hair bulbs. In the present study, the lotions TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Uomo and TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Donna, containing dihomo-γ- (DGLA), S-equol, and propionyl-l-carnitine, were tested on 30 men and 30 women (mean age of men was 46.6 ± 6.4 years; mean age of women was 49.5 ± 9.0) with signs of androgenic alopecia, respectively. DGLA is a precursor of the prostaglandin PGE1, which acts by improving microcirculation; S-equol inhibits 5α-reductases, thus preventing the transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone; and propionyl-l-carnitine promotes lipid metabolism, stimulating  production. These three molecules are loaded into liposomes for their effective transdermal delivery. Daily topical applications of the lotions resulted in a hair count that significantly increased for women and marginally increased for men after 6 months of treatment. Furthermore, significant increase in anagen hair and a significant decrease in telogen hair were observed starting from 3 months in male and 1 month in female patients. Thus, the formulations under investigation were effective in attenuating androgenic alopecia-related hair loss in men and women.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25975007>Dietary fatty acids affect lipid metabolism and estrogen receptor expression in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced rat mammary cancer model.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could affect the expression of serum fatty  binding protein 5 (FABP5) and CD36 levels and also fatty  synthase (FAS), and estrogen receptor (ER) expressions in breast cancer cells.A rat mammary cancer model was induced by injection i.p., with 50 mg MNU/kg body weight. Low (13.8% ) or high-fat (42.5% ) diets composed mainly of n-6 or n-3 PUFAs originating either from linoleic  or , respectively, were given for eight weeks. After sacrifice at week 8, serum FABP5 level was examined and immunostainings of CD36, FAS, and ER of breast cancer tissue were observed.By week 8, there was no statistical difference of tumor formation rate between each group. The level of serum FABP5 in the high n-3 group was significantly lower than the low n-6 and high n-6 groups. Immunohistochemistry results showed that there was a significant difference of CD36 expression between the low n-3 group and high n-6 group (p < 0.05). Although the high n-3 group had the most inhibition on FAS and ER expression, there was no statistical difference between each group.Our study showed that different dietary PUFAs may affect lipid metabolism in breast cancer tissues by altering the expression of FABP5, CD-36, FAS, and ER, which may change treatment response and even prognosis of breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164694>APOE ε4 and the associations of seafood and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids with cognitive decline.</a></h2><p>To examine the association between consumption of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty acids with change in 5 cognitive domains over an average of 4.9 years.From an ongoing longitudinal, community-based epidemiologic study of aging and dementia (the Rush Memory and Aging Project), we included 915 participants (age 81.4 ± 7.2 years, 25% men) who had completed at least one follow-up cognitive assessment and dietary data. Diet was assessed by semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Scores for global cognitive function and 5 cognitive domains (episodic, semantic, and working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability) were assessed using 19 cognitive tests. Mixed models adjusted for multiple risk factors of cognitive change were used to assess the associations.Consumption of seafood was associated with slower decline in semantic memory (β = 0.024; p = 0.03) and perceptual speed (β = 0.020; p = 0.05) in separate models adjusted for age, sex, education, participation in cognitive activities, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and total  intake. In secondary analyses, APOE ε4 carriers demonstrated slower rates of decline in global cognition and in multiple cognitive domains with weekly seafood consumption and with moderate to high long-chain n-3 fatty  intake from food. These associations were not present in APOE ε4 noncarriers. Higher intake levels of α- were associated with slower global cognitive decline, but also only in APOE ε4 carriers.These results suggest protective relations of one meal per week of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty acids against decline in multiple cognitive domains.

Four clusters were identified, each with a distinct fatty  profile. Cluster 1 included high proportions of linoleic  (LA) and low proportions of stearic  (SA); cluster 2 was higher in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and SA; the profile of cluster 3 was higher in very-long-chain saturated fatty  (VLCSFA) and lower in α- (ALA) (cluster 3); while cluster 4 was higher in fatty acids related to de novo lipogenesis and 20:3n-6 and lower in LA (cluster 4). In general, cluster 4 was associated with adverse metabolic profile and higher metabolic risk (p < 0.033). Clusters 2 and 3 were associated with healthier and protective phenotypes (p < 0.033).Distinct fatty  patterns were identified which were related to demographics, dietary habits, and metabolic profile.

However, the molecular pathogenesis of COPD remains unknown. Here, we explored the molecular effects of cigarette smoke and bacterial infection in lung tissues of COPD rats. We also investigated therapeutic effects of aminophylline (APL) on the COPD rats and integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data for a global view of molecular mechanisms of COPD progression. Using molecular function and pathway analyses, the genes and proteins regulated in COPD and APL-treated rats were mainly attributed to oxidoreductase, antioxidant activity,  and fatty  metabolism. Furthermore, we identified hub proteins such as Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), Pkm (pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2), and Sod1 (superoxide dismutase 1), included in  metabolism and oxidative stress. Then, we identified the significantly regulated metabolic pathways in lung tissues of COPD- and APL-treated rats, such as arachidonic , linoleic , and α- metabolism, which belong to the lipid metabolism. In particular, we picked the arachidonic  metabolism for a more detailed pathway analysis of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. We could observe an increase in metabolites and genes involved in arachidonic  metabolism in COPD rats and the decrease in these in APL-treated rats, suggesting that inflammatory responses were up-regulated in COPD rats and down-regulated in APL-treated rats. In conclusion, these system-wide results suggested that COPD progression and its treatment might be associated with oxidative stress, lipid and  metabolism disturbance. Additionally, we demonstrated the power of integrated omics for the elucidation of genes, proteins, and metabolites' changes and disorders that were associated with COPD.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795377>Comparison of the fatty  profile of Spanish infant formulas and Galician women breast milk.</a></h2><p>The importance of dietary lipids during childhood is evident, as they are necessary for correct growth and development of the newborn. When breastfeeding is not possible, infant formulas are designed to mimic human milk as much as possible to fulfill infant's requirements. However, the composition of these dairy products is relatively constant, while human milk is not a uniform bio-fluid and changes according to the requirements of the baby. In this study, breast milk samples were donated by 24 Spanish mothers in different lactation stages and different infant formulas were purchased in supermarkets and pharmacies. Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection was used for the fatty  determination. Compared to breast milk, first-stage formulas are apparently very similar in composition; however, no major differences were observed in the fatty  profiles between formulas of different lactation stages. The Galician women breast milk has a fatty  profile rich in oleic , linoleic , arachidonic , and docosahexaenoic . When comparing human milk with formulas, it becomes evident that the manufacturers tend to enrich the formulas with essential fatty acids (especially with α-), but arachidonic and docosahexaenoic  levels are lower than in breast milk. Additionally, the obtained results demonstrated that after 1 year of lactation, human milk is still a good source of , essential fatty acids, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for the baby.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29298969>[Dietetary recommendation for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease in the developed world. Nowadays, in the adult population of Europe it is estimated at 14% to 21%. Its most important risk factors are obesity and metabolic syndrome. Introducing lifestyle changes such as: dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the first-line treatment and are intended to support not only NAFLD but also associated diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Dietary management focuses on weight reduction of overweight or obese people by decreasing  in diet. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Instead, it is important to increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty  diets, mainly from the n-3 family, which exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It is also beneficial to eat nuts, despite their high  value, as a source of , which lowers LDL cholesterol. It is important to increase the share of vegetable protein (eg. soya) and limit the intake of fat meat, milk and the dairy products. A key role in the treatment and prevention of NAFLD is also a reduction of simple sugars and total exclusion of added sugar in the diet. The rise of NAFLD in developed countries is analogous to the increase of fructose consumption, which high intake is directly indicated as the main cause of the disease. Choosing foods with high fiber content, low glycemic index and meals composed with low glycemic load, is conducive to weight reduction. An important role in supporting NAFLD treatment is also attributed to vitamin D, C and E supplementation and some probiotic bacteria, as well as cinnamon and turmeric, which improve insulin sensitivity. Daily physical activity is strongly recommended as the supplement of healthy lifestyle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31006418>Intake of α- is not consistently associated with a lower risk of peripheral artery disease: results from a Danish cohort study.</a></h2><p>Intake of the plant-derived n-3 fatty  α- (ALA) has been associated with anti-atherosclerotic properties.

In this follow-up study, we investigated the association between dietary intake of ALA and the rate of PAD among middle-aged Danish men and women enrolled into the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort between 1993 and 1997. Incident PAD cases were identified through the Danish National Patient Register. Intake of ALA was assessed using a validated FFQ. Statistical analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression allowing for separate baseline hazards among sexes and adjusted for established risk factors for PAD. During a median of 13·6 years of follow-up, we identified 950 valid cases of PAD with complete information on covariates. The median -adjusted ALA intake within the cohort was 1·76 g/d (95 % central range: 0·94-3·28). In multivariable analyses, we found no statistically significant association between intake of ALA and the rate of PAD (P = 0·339). Also, no statistically significant associations were observed in analyses including additional adjustment for co-morbidities and in sex-specific analyses. In supplemental analyses with additional adjustment for potential dietary risk factors, we found a weak inverse association of PAD with ALA intake above the median, but the association was not statistically significant (P = 0·314).

On the other hand, a working group of IARC recently classified processed meat as 'carcinogenic to humans' and red meat as 'probably carcinogenic to humans' for colorectal cancer, appealing to critically consider the future role of meat in a healthy diet. This manuscript first evaluates the contribution of meat consumption to the supply of important micronutrients in the human food chain, and the extent to which this can be improved by primary production strategies, and impacts on human health. Secondly, the IARC hazard analysis of the carcinogenicity of red and processed meat consumption is discussed, arguing that having more insight in the mechanisms of the association offers opportunities for mitigation. It is advocated that the benefits and risks associated with red and processed meat consumption should not necessarily cause dilemmas, if these meats are consumed in moderate amounts as part of balanced diets.Copyright © 2016.

Discrepancies between studies may be due to differences in study population, as subjects with increased baseline BP levels may be more responsive. Therefore, we examined specifically the effects of ALA on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in (pre-)hypertensive subjects. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel study, fifty-nine overweight and obese adults (forty males and nineteen females) with (pre-)hypertension (mean age of 60 (sd 8) years) received daily 10 g refined cold-pressed flaxseed oil, providing 4·7 g (approximately 2 % of ) ALA (n 29) or 10 g of high-oleic sunflower oil as control (n 30) for 12 weeks. Compliance was excellent as indicated by vial count and plasma phospholipid fatty- composition. Compared with control, the changes of -1·4 mmHg in mean arterial pressure (MAP; 24 h ABP) after flaxseed oil intake (95 % CI -4·8, 2·0 mmHg, P=0·40) of -1·5 mmHg in systolic BP (95 % CI -6·0, 3·0 mmHg, P=0·51) and of -1·4 mmHg in diastolic BP (95 % CI -4·2, 1·4 mmHg, P=0·31) were not statistically significant. Also, no effects were found for office BP and for MAP, systolic BP, and diastolic BP when daytime and night-time BP were analysed separately and for night-time dipping. In conclusion, high intake of ALA, about 3-5 times recommended daily intakes, for 12 weeks does not significantly affect BP in subjects with (pre-)hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27314385>Influence of Maternal Obesity and Gestational Weight Gain on Maternal and Foetal Lipid Profile.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are fundamental for a foetus's growth, serving as an  source, structural constituents of cellular membranes and precursors of bioactive molecules, as well as being essential for cell signalling. Long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) are pivotal in brain and visual development. It is of interest to investigate whether and how specific pregnancy conditions, which alter fatty  metabolism (excessive pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain (GWG)), affect lipid supply to the foetus. For this purpose, we evaluated the erythrocyte FAs of mothers and offspring (cord-blood) at birth, in relation to pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG. A total of 435 mothers and their offspring (237 males, 51%) were included in the study. Distribution of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA), and their metabolites, arachidonic , dihomogamma linoleic (DGLA) and ecosapentanoic , was significantly different in maternal and foetal erythrocytes. Pre-pregnancy BMI was significantly associated with maternal percentage of MUFAs (Coeff: -0.112; p = 0.021), LA (Coeff: -0.033; p = 0.044) and DHA (Coeff. = 0.055; p = 0.0016); inadequate GWG with DPA (Coeff: 0.637; p = 0.001); excessive GWG with docosaexahenoic  (DHA) (Coeff. = -0.714; p = 0.004).

In this study, the efficacy of a yeast mating approach with Yarrowia lipolytica that can combine a previously engineering and evolved xylose phenotype with a metabolite overproduction phenotype is demonstrated. Specifically, several engineered Y. lipolytica strains that produce α- (ALA), riboflavin, and triacetic  lactone (TAL) with an engineered and adapted xylose-utilizing strain to obtain three diploid strains that rapidly produce these molecules directly from xylose are mated. Titers of 0.52 g L ALA, 96.6 mg L riboflavin, and 2.9 g L TAL, are obtained from xylose in flask cultures and 1.42 g L production of ALA is obtained using bioreactor condition. This total production level is generally on par or higher than the parental strain cultivated on glucose, although specific productivities decreased as a result of improved overall cell growth by the diploid strains. In the case of ALA, this lipid content reached similar levels to that of flaxseed oil. This result showcases the first study using strain mating in Y. lipolytica for producing biomolecules from xylose, and thus demonstrates the utility of this approach as a routine tool for metabolic engineering.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These disorders are also associated with deficits in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) which accumulates in mitochondrial and synaptic membranes. The present study investigated the effects of dietary-induced alterations in brain DHA accrual during adolescence on phospholipid metabolism and bioenergetics in the adult rat brain using P MRS. During the peri-adolescent period (P21-P90), male rats were fed a diet with no n-3 fatty acids (Deficient, DEF, n = 20), a diet fortified with preformed DHA (fish oil, FO, n = 20), or a control diet fortified with  (18:3n-3, n = 20). On P90, P MRS was performed under isoflurane anesthetic using a 7 T Bruker Biospec system. Compared with controls, brain DHA levels were significantly lower in adult rats fed the DEF diet (-17%, p ≤ 0.0001) and significantly higher in rats fed the FO diet (+14%, p ≤ 0.0001). There were no significant group differences for indices of bioenergetics, including adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine levels, or indices of membrane phospholipid metabolism including phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters. Therefore, the present P MRS data suggest that rat brain DHA levels are not a significant predictor of mitochondrial bioenergetics or membrane phospholipid metabolism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Intakes of total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) were assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and correlated with birthweight and incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) infants.This is a population that traditionally consumes diets that are low in SFA and n-3 PUFA, but high in linoleic  (LA, 18:2 n-6). The data show that consumption of low SFA was associated with decreased birthweight and an increased risk of SGA [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.1). Similar results were seen with n-3 PUFA: low intakes of  (ALNA, 18:3 n-3) as well as low intakes of long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA were associated with increased risk of SGA (AOR 1.70; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6, and AOR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1, respectively). Increased intakes of SFA and ALNA were predominantly associated with lower intakes of cereals and higher intakes of milk and milk products.These findings show that higher intakes of SFA and n-3 PUFA in early stages of pregnancy are associated with increased birthweight and reduced incidence of SGA in a South Indian population.© The Author 2016; all rights reserved.

The increasing inclusion of crude glycerin in the diets did not affect the chemical composition of the Longissimus muscle (P > 0.10). A quadratic effect was observed when levels of crude glycerin were increased, on the concentration of pentadecanoic, palmitoleic and eicosenoic fatty acids in meat (P < 0.05), and on the activity of the delta-9 desaturase 16 and delta-9 desaturase 18 enzymes (P < 0.05). The addition of crude glycerin increased the gamma  fatty  concentration (P < 0.01), and altered the monounsaturated fatty acids in Longissimus muscle of animals (Pquad. < 0.05). Crude glycerin decreased cholesterol content in meat (P < 0.05), and promoted higher flavor score and greasy intensity perception of the meat (P < 0.01). The inclusion of up to 30% crude glycerin in Nellore cattle bulls`diets (DM basis) improves meat cholesterol and sensory attributes, such as flavor, without affecting significantly the physical traits, the main fatty  concentrations and the chemical composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601449>Fatty  profile of goat milk in diets supplemented with chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.).</a></h2><p>Chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.) is the greatest known plant source of n-3 α-. The present study evaluated the effects of 3 inclusion levels of chia seed [zero (control); low, 2.7% (CLow); and high, 5.5% (CHigh)] in diets of dairy goats on milk yield and fatty  profile. Nine Saanen dairy goats in the last third of lactation period, live weight 38 ± 8.7 kg, housed in metabolic cages, were fed iso-proteic and iso-energetic (160 g of crude protein/d and 11 MJ of metabolizable /d) diets. Gas chromatography was used to analyze fatty  profile and total conjugated linoleic  (CLA). Silver ion HPLC was used to analyze the isomeric profile of CLA. The results were subjected to variance analysis using a Latin square design repeated 3 × 3. The CHigh treatment was higher for dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, and  detergent fiber intake compared with CLow and control diets. Digestibility was not affected by the inclusion of chia seeds. The CHigh diet improved N intake with respect to the control and CLow diet. Milk yield and chemical composition were not affected by the treatment. The milk fatty  profile of C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C:20 was higher for CHigh than the other treatments. The in vitro gas production (mL of gas/g of dry matter) was lower in CHigh than the control diet. In conclusion, the addition of chia seeds at the CHigh level in dairy goat diets negatively affected in vitro rumen fermentation, but increased the milk fatty  profile of C18:0, C18:1n-9 cis, and C:20, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The total CLA content increased from 0.33 to 0.73% with the supplementation of chia to the diet, as well as the isomers cis-9,trans-11, trans-7,cis-9, trans-11,cis-13, and trans-12,trans-14.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Pesticides may, however, negatively affect their behavior, physiology, and survival. To assess this, a 42-day-lasting bioassay was conducted, during which damselfly larvae (Ischnura graellsii; n = 20) were repeatedly exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin (3 days at; 0, 10, 50, 250, 1250, and 6250ng LCH L), followed by recovery phases (4 days) in pesticide-free medium for six weeks. This exposure design was used to simulate frequent runoff events in the field. Variables related to the behavior (strikes against prey and capture success), growth, physiology (lipid content and fatty  composition), as well as mortality were assessed throughout the experiment. The two highest LCH concentrations induced 100% mortality within the first 48h, whereas 85% of the test organisms survived 28 days under control conditions. The number of strikes against prey was not affected by LCH. In contrast, prey capture success decreased significantly (up to ~50% at 250ng LCH L, for instance, after the third pulse exposure) following LCH-exposures compared to the control. This difference was not observed after recovery phases, however, which did not counteract the enhanced  demand for detoxification and defense mechanisms indicated by a lower growth rate (up to ~20%) and lipid content (up to ~30%) of damselflies at 50 and 250ng LCH L. In addition, two essential fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic  and arachidonic ) and two precursors ( and α-) decreased in their concentrations upon exposure towards 250ng LCH L. Thus the results of this study indicate that long-term exposure towards LCH pulses can affect damselfly behavior, physiology and survival. Given the essential role of damselflies in food web dynamics, these effects may potentially translate into local population impairments with subsequent bottom-up directed effects within and across ecosystem boundaries.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, CLA isomers are not the only group of potentially bioactive conjugated fatty acids currently undergoing study. In this regard, isomers of conjugated α-, conjugated nonadecadienoic  and conjugated eicosapentaenoic , to name but a few, have undergone experimental assessment. These studies have indicated many of these conjugated fatty  isomers commonly possess anti-carcinogenic, anti-adipogenic, anti-inflammatory and immune modulating properties, a number of which will be discussed in this review. The mechanisms through which these bioactivities are mediated have not yet been fully elucidated. However, existing evidence indicates that these fatty acids may play a role in modulating the expression of several oncogenes, cell cycle regulators, and genes associated with  metabolism. Despite such bioactive potential, interest in these conjugated fatty acids has remained low relative to the CLA isomers. This may be partly attributed to the relatively recent emergence of these fatty acids as bioactives, but also due to a lack of awareness regarding sources from which they can be produced. In this review, we will also highlight the common sources of these conjugated fatty acids, including plants, algae, microbes and chemosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950142>Survey of duckweed diversity in Lake Chao and total fatty , triacylglycerol, profiles of representative strains.</a></h2><p>Lemnaceae (duckweeds) are widely distributed aquatic flowering plants. Their high growth rate, starch content and suitability for bioremediation make them potential feedstock for biofuels. However, few natural duckweed resources have been investigated in China, and there is no information about total fatty  (TFA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) composition of duckweeds from China. Here, the genetic diversity of a natural duckweed population collected from Lake Chao, China, was investigated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The 54 strains were categorised into four species in four genera, representing 12 distinct sequence types. Strains representing Lemna aequinoctialis and Spirodela polyrhiza were predominant. Interestingly, a surprisingly high degree of genetic diversification within L. aequinoctialis was observed. The four duckweed species revealed a uniform fatty  composition, with three fatty acids, palmitic , linoleic  and , accounting for more than 80% of the TFA. The TFA in biomass varied among species, ranging from 1.05% (of dry weight, DW) for L. punctata and S. polyrhiza to 1.62% for Wolffia globosa. The four duckweed species contained similar TAG contents, 0.02% mg · DW(-1). The fatty  profiles of TAG were different from those of TFA, and also varied among the four species. The survey investigated the genetic diversity of duckweeds from Lake Chao, and provides an initial insight into TFA and TAG of four duckweed species, indicating that intraspecific and interspecific variations exist in the content and composition of both TFA and TAG in comparison with other studies.© 2015 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646568>Fish Consumption, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease.</a></h2><p>Data on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in relation to cardiovascular disease are limited in women.

A total of 39,876 women who were aged ≥45 years and free of cardiovascular disease at baseline provided dietary data on food frequency questionnaires. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between fish and -adjusted omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  intake and the risk of major cardiovascular disease, defined as a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, in 38,392 women in the final analytic sample (96%).During 713,559 person years of follow-up, 1,941 cases of incident major cardiovascular disease were confirmed. Tuna and dark fish intake was not associated with the risk of incident major cardiovascular disease (p-trend >0.05). Neither α- nor marine omega-3 fatty  intake was associated with major cardiovascular disease or with individual cardiovascular outcomes (all p-trend >0.05). There was no effect modification by age, BMI, or baseline history of hypertension.In this cohort of women without history of cardiovascular disease, intakes of tuna and dark fish, α-, and marine omega-3 fatty acids were not associated with risk of major cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The results showed that BBPs have high dietary fiber (57.46%), carbohydrate (18.93%) and protein (13.81%) content versus low fat content (<1%) contributing to a low  value of 139.24 kcal per 100 g. Profiling of fatty acids showed an abundance of the essential polyunsaturated α- and linoleic acids, exhibiting an excellent nutritional quality as revealed by their low atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and their hypocholesterolemic properties. The methanol extract which exhibited the highest total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents was found to be the most active extract in terms of antimicrobial and anti-radical activities. In alloxan-induced diabetic mice, the oral administration of a methanol extract (500 mg per kg bw) attenuated the elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase activities, and urea, uric , and creatinine. It effectively normalized the status of lipid profiles, mitigated oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPx and SOD), and alleviated oxidative stress-mediated histopathological changes in the pancreas, liver, kidney and testis. Compositional analysis by HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS revealed the presence of flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin and their derivatives), flavones (apigenin derivatives) and flavonols (glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol), among others.

For fatty  compositions, saturated fatty , in particular palmitic  (16:0) was dominantly increased in OX strains whereas slight increases of unsaturated fatty acids were observed, specifically linoleic  (18:2) and  (18:3). The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high lipid content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by acetate induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under acetate treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher lipid contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of lipid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26477381>N-3PUFA differentially modulate palmitate-induced lipotoxicity through alterations of its metabolism in C2C12 muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Excessive  intake leads to fat overload and the formation of lipotoxic compounds mainly derived from the saturated fatty  palmitate (PAL), thus promoting insulin resistance (IR) in skeletal muscle. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) may prevent lipotoxicity and IR. The purpose of this study was to examine the differential effects of n-3PUFA on fatty  metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with 500 μM of PAL without or with 50 μM of  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) for 16 h. PAL decreased insulin-dependent AKT activation and glucose uptake and increased the synthesis of ceramides and diglycerides (DG) derivatives, leading to protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA, but not ALA, prevented PAL-decreased AKT activation but glucose uptake was restored to control values by all n-3PUFA vs. PAL. Total DG and ceramide contents were decreased by all n-3PUFA, but only EPA and DHA increased PAL β-oxidation, decreased PAL incorporation into DG and reduced protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA emerge as better candidates than ALA to improve fatty  metabolism in skeletal muscle cells, notably via their ability to increase mitochondrial β-oxidation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an -restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid oleic  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk -restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion.

Our objective was to compare and evaluate the reported intake of current smokers with that of nonsmokers among participants of a study evaluating stress and smoking. We hypothesized (1) that overall  and nutrient intake would be reduced in smokers compared with nonsmokers and (2) that smokers would have increased noncompliance with Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Men and women (smokers n=138, nonsmokers n=46) completed a 3-day diet record at baseline. Mean  and nutrient intakes were stratified by smoking status and compared with DRI levels. The mean body mass index was 28.3±0.5kg/m for smokers and 27.2±1.0kg/m for nonsmokers. Compared with nonsmokers, the smokers reported lower intakes of , total polyunsaturated fatty acids, , docosahexaenoic , total sugars, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, vitamin C, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic , vitamin B6, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin E. Smokers reported reduced compliance with the DRIs for iron, phosphorus, vitamin C, riboflavin, and folate compared with nonsmokers. Unlike other evaluations of smokers vs nonsmokers, we observed no difference in body weight between groups. Smokers and nonsmokers alike reported dietary intakes lower than the DRIs for many nutrients. However, the reported nutrient intake of the smokers was substantially lower than nonsmokers for key nutrients, and they were more likely to not comply with the DRIs for essential nutrients, placing them at increased risk of chronic disease.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25805397>Cooking with soyabean oil increases whole-blood α- in school-aged children: results from a randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Supply of essential n-3 PUFA is limited worldwide.

High SFA intakes have been associated with increased CVD and type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk, due to alterations in cholesterol homoeostasis and adipose tissue inflammation. PUFA, in particular EPA and DHA, have been associated with health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects. It is well established that dietary fat composition plays an important role in biological processes. A recent review of evidence suggests that replacement of SFA with PUFA has potential to reduce risk of CVD and T2D. The public health and molecular impact of EPA and DHA have been well-characterised, while less is known of effects of α- (ALA). The current dietary guideline for ALA is 0·5% TE; however evidence from supplementation trials suggests that benefit is observed at levels greater than 2 g/d (0·6-1% TE).

Five Nordic Red cows fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square with five 28-d periods. Treatments comprised total mixed rations based on grass silage with a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 60:40 supplemented with no lipid (CO) or 50 g/kg of diet dry matter (DM) of myristic  (MA), rapeseed oil (RO), safflower oil (SO), or linseed oil (LO). Feeding MA resulted in the lowest DM intake, and feeding RO reduced DM intake compared with CO. Feeding MA reduced the yields of milk, milk constituents, and -corrected milk. Plant oils did not influence yields of milk and milk constituents, but reduced milk protein content compared with CO. Treatments had no effect on rumen fermentation characteristics, other than an increase in ammonia-N concentration due to feeding MA, RO, and SO compared with CO. Lipid supplements reduced daily ruminal CH emission; however, the response was to some extent a result of lower feed intake. Lipids modified microbial community structure without affecting total counts of bacteria, archaea, and ciliate protozoa. Dietary treatments had no effect on the apparent total tract digestibility of organic matter, fiber, and gross . Treatments did not affect either  secreted in milk as a proportion of  intake or efficiency of dietary N utilization. All lipids lowered de novo fatty  synthesis in the mammary gland. Plant oils increased proportions of milk fat 18:0, cis 18:1, trans and monounsaturated fatty acids, and decreased saturated fatty acids compared with CO and MA. Both SO and LO increased the proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids, total conjugated , and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic . Feeding MA clearly increased the Δ desaturation of fatty acids. Our results provide compelling evidence that plant oils supplemented to a grass silage-based diet reduce ruminal CH emission and milk saturated fatty acids, and increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and total conjugated linoleic  while not interfering with digestibility, rumen fermentation, rumen microbial quantities, or milk production.The Authors.

However, limited information is available regarding the effect of ground flaxseed on dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal fermentation, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows. Twenty multiparous Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 111 ± 49 d in milk in the beginning of the study were used in a randomized complete block design to investigate the effects of supplementing herbage (i.e., grazed forage) with ground corn-soybean meal mix (control diet = CTRL) or ground flaxseed (flaxseed diet = FLX) on animal production, milk FA, ruminal metabolism, and nutrient digestibility. The study was conducted from June to September 2013, with data and sample collection taking place on wk 4, 8, 12, and 16. Cows were fed a diet formulated to yield a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio consisting of (dry matter basis): 40% cool-season perennial herbage, 50% partial total mixed ration, and 10% of ground corn-soybean meal mix or 10% ground flaxseed. However, estimated herbage DMI averaged 5.59 kg/d or 34% of the total DMI. Significant treatment by week interactions were observed for milk and blood urea N, and several milk FA (e.g., trans-10 18:1). No significant differences between treatments were observed for herbage and total DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, concentrations and yields of milk components, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Total-tract digestibility of organic matter decreased, whereas that of neutral detergent fiber increased with feeding FLX versus CTRL. No treatment effects were observed for ruminal concentrations of total volatile FA and NH-N, and ruminal proportions of acetate and propionate. Ruminal butyrate tended to decrease, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio decreased in the FLX diet. Most saturated and unsaturated FA in milk fat were changed. Specifically, milk proportion of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3, Σn-3 FA, and Σ18C FA increased, whereas that of cis-9,cis-12 18:2, Σn-6 FA, Σ odd-chain FA, Σ<16C FA, and Σ16C FA decreased with feeding FLX versus the CTRL diet. In conclusion, feeding FLX did not change yields of milk and milk components, but increased milk n-3 FA. Therefore, costs and industry adoption of premiums for n-3-enriched milk will determine the adoption of ground flaxseed in pasture-based dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

It is unclear whether ALA is beneficial in a background of high marine ω-3 fatty acids (long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) intake. In persons at high cardiovascular risk from Spain, a country in which fish consumption is customarily high, we investigated whether meeting the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids recommendation for dietary ALA (0.7% of total ) at baseline was related to all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. We also examined the effect of meeting the society's recommendation for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (≥500 mg/day).We longitudinally evaluated 7202 participants in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios. ALA intake correlated to walnut consumption (r=0.94). During a 5.9-y follow-up, 431 deaths occurred (104 cardiovascular disease, 55 coronary heart disease, 32 sudden cardiac death, 25 stroke). The hazard ratios for meeting ALA recommendation (n=1615, 22.4%) were 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.92) for all-cause mortality and 0.95 (95% CI 0.58-1.57) for fatal cardiovascular disease. The hazard ratios for meeting the recommendation for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n=5452, 75.7%) were 0.84 (95% CI 0.67-1.05) for all-cause mortality, 0.61 (95% CI 0.39-0.96) for fatal cardiovascular disease, 0.54 (95% CI 0.29-0.99) for fatal coronary heart disease, and 0.49 (95% CI 0.22-1.01) for sudden cardiac death. The highest reduction in all-cause mortality occurred in participants meeting both recommendations (hazard ratio 0.63 [95% CI 0.45-0.87]).In participants without prior cardiovascular disease and high fish consumption, dietary ALA, supplied mainly by walnuts and olive oil, relates inversely to all-cause mortality, whereas protection from cardiac mortality is limited to fish-derived long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.URL: http://www.Controlled-trials.com/.

The selected mutant lines had  contents that were 33.9% to 67.7% higher than those of the original cultivars and exhibited increased fatty  desaturase (FAD) gene expression levels during seed development. We also identified nucleotide polymorphisms of FAD genes in the four mutant lines.The present study found that  content is related to significantly increased expression levels of the FAD3C and FAD3D genes in the endoplasmic reticulum, which was uncovered by radiation mutation breeding of soybean. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26504583>Metabolic changes upon flower bud break in Japanese apricot are enhanced by exogenous GA4.</a></h2><p>Gibberellin (GA4) has a significant effect on promoting dormancy release in flower buds of Japanese apricot (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc). The transcriptomic and proteomic changes that occur after GA4 treatment have been reported previously; however, the metabolic changes brought about by GA4 remain unknown. The present study was undertaken to assess changes in metabolites in response to GA4 treatment, as determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and principal component analysis. Fifty-five metabolites that exhibited more than two-fold differences in abundance (P < 0.05) between samples collected over time after a given treatment or between samples exposed to different treatments were studied further. These metabolites were categorized into six main groups: amino acids and their isoforms (10), amino  derivatives (7), sugars and polyols (14), organic acids (12), fatty acids (4), and others (8). All of these groups are involved in various metabolic pathways, in particular galactose metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. These results suggested that  metabolism is important at the metabolic level in dormancy release following GA4 treatment. We also found that more than 10-fold differences in abundance were observed for many metabolites, including sucrose, proline, linoleic , and , which might play important roles during the dormancy process. The current research extends our understanding of the mechanisms involved in budburst and dormancy release in response to GA4 and provides a theoretical basis for applying GA4 to release dormancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636521>Dietary Fats in Relation to Total and Cause-Specific Mortality in a Prospective Cohort of 521 120 Individuals With 16 Years of Follow-Up.</a></h2><p>Evidence linking saturated fat intake with cardiovascular health is controversial. The associations of unsaturated fats with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality remain inconsistent, and data about non-CVD mortality are limited.To assess dietary fat intake in relation to total and cause-specific mortality.We analyzed data of 521 120 participants aged 50 to 71 years from the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study with 16 years of follow-up. Intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans-fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were assessed via food frequency questionnaires. Hazard ratios and 95%CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Overall, 129 328 deaths were documented during 7.3 million person-years of follow-up. In the replacement of carbohydrates, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of total mortality comparing extreme quintiles were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.25-1.33) for SFAs, 1.03 (1.00-1.05) for trans-fatty acids, 0.98 (0.94-1.02) for MUFAs, 1.09 (1.06-1.13) for animal MUFAs, 0.94 (0.91-0.97) for plant MUFAs, 0.93 (0.91-0.95) for PUFAs, 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for marine omega-3 PUFAs, 1.06 (1.03-1.09) for α-, 0.88 (0.86-0.91) for linoleic , and 1.10 (1.08-1.13) for arachidonic . CVD mortality was inversely associated with marine omega-3 PUFA intake ( P trend <0.0001), whereas it was positively associated with SFA, trans-fatty , and arachidonic  intake. Isocalorically replacing 5% of the  from SFAs with plant MUFAs was associated with 15%, 10%, 11%, and 30% lower total mortality, CVD, cancer, and respiratory disease mortality, respectively. Isocaloric replacement of SFA with linoleic  (2%) was associated with lower total (8%), CVD (6%), cancer (8%), respiratory disease (11%), and diabetes mellitus (9%) mortality.Intakes of SFAs, trans-fatty acids, animal MUFAs, α-, and arachidonic  were associated with higher mortality. Dietary intake of marine omega-3 PUFAs and replacing SFAs with plant MUFAs or linoleic  were associated with lower total, CVD, and certain cause-specific mortality.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

In both cases, some lipid molecules can be involved as signaling agents in the regulation of metabolism and protective or damaging pathways in responses to harmful stimuli. These events could affect in particular the liver, because of its central role in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis. Lipids have been demonstrated to fluoresce, contributing to the overall emission signal of the liver tissue along with other endogenous fluorophores, relatable to  metabolism and oxidative events. The mere estimation of the fluorescing lipid fraction in parallel with the other endogenous fluorophores, and with the common biochemical and histochemical biomarkers of tissue injury has been exploited to investigate the liver morpho-functional conditions in experimental hepatology. More interestingly, the fluorescing lipid fraction is greatly relatable to free fatty acids such as arachidonic, linoleic and , which are deserving increasing attention as precursors of products involved in several and complex signaling pathways. On these bases, the ability of autofluorescence to detect directly arachidonic  and its balance with other unsaturated fatty acids may be exploited in the diagnosis and follow-up of fatty livers, helping to improve the personalization of the metabolic/lipidomic profiling. This could also contribute to elucidate the role of the injuring factors in the choice of suitable donors, and in the set-up of preservation procedures in liver transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316924>Effect of nutrients and exhaustive exercise on brain function.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that health-oriented eating habits are associated with maintaining optimal cognitive ability.

Therefore, this review focuses on recent evidence that explains how nutrients and prolonged exercise can affect nervous system pathways that are associated with improving brain function. The results revealed that frequent consumption of polyphenols and n-3 PUFAs could modify gastrointestinal environment with beneficial microorganisms. It may suggest a new hypothesis that gastrointestinal microbiome could influence cognitive function in addition to the traditional etiological pathway.

The present study examined egg consumption and associations with nutrient intakes, markers of growth and weight-related measures in infants 6⁻24 months of age ( = 561) compared to infant egg non-consumers ( = 2129). Egg consumers were defined as those infants consuming eggs (i.e., with the exclusion of mixed dishes) during a 24-h dietary recall. Associations with nutrient intakes and markers of growth variables were evaluated using data from What We Eat in America, the dietary component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001⁻2012. Mean  and nutrient intakes were adjusted for the sample design using appropriate survey parameters and sample weights. Egg consumption was associated with greater  intake compared to infants not consuming eggs (1265 ± 27 vs. 1190 ± 14 kcal/day;  = 0.01). Infant consumers of eggs also had greater protein (48 ± 0.7 vs. 41 ± 0.4 g/day), total choline (281 ± 6 vs. 163 ± 2 mg/day), lutein + zeaxanthin (788 ± 64 vs. 533 ± 23 mcg/day), α- (0.87 ± 0.02 vs. 0.82 ± 0.01 g/day), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (0.04 ± 0.02 vs. 0.02 ± 0.001 g/day), vitamin B12 (4.2 ± 0.1 vs. 3.7 ± 0.1 mcg/day), phosphorus (977 ± 15 vs. 903 ± 8 mg/day), and selenium (67 ± 1 vs. 52 ± 0.6 mcg/day; all -values < 0.05). Egg consumers also had greater consumption of total fat (50 ± 0.7 vs. 45 ± 0.3 g/day), monounsaturated fat (17 ± 0.3 vs. 15 ± 0.1 g/day), saturated fat (20 ± 0.4 vs. 18 ± 0.2 g/day), and sodium (1663 ± 36 vs. 1418 ± 19 mg/day), with lower added sugar (4.7 ± 0.3 vs. 6.1 ± 0.2 tsp eq/day), and total sugar (87 ± 2 vs. 99 ± 1 g/day; all -values < 0.05) vs. non-consumers of eggs. Egg consumption was also associated with lower intake of dietary folate, iron, magnesium and niacin relative to non-consumers of eggs. Egg consumption in infants was associated with longer recumbent length when compared to non-consumers of eggs (79.2 ± 0.2 vs. 78.7 ± 0.1 cm;  = 0.03). No associations were observed when comparing body weight. When compared to non-consumers of eggs and regardless of food security, poverty-income-ratio and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition status, egg consumption was associated with greater lutein + zeaxanthin intake per day. The current analyzes show that consumption of eggs in infant 6⁻24 months of age is linked with several nutrient intakes, including higher protein, lutein + zeaxanthin, choline, B12, selenium and phosphorus; and lower added and total sugars relative to non-consumers. Egg consumers also have less of several nutrients to be encouraged and a higher intake of nutrients to limit, thus presenting opportunities for educational strategies to potentially increase consumption of nutrient-dense foods in combination with eggs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891784>Dietary Conjugated Linoleic -Enriched Cheeses Influence the Levels of Circulating n-3 Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids in Humans.</a></h2><p>n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFA) directly and indirectly regulate lipid metabolism,  balance and the inflammatory response. We investigated changes to the n-3 HUFA score of healthy adults, induced by different types and amounts of conjugated linoleic  (CLA)-enriched (ENCH) cheeses consumed for different periods of time, compared to dietary fish oil (FO) pills (500 mg, each containing 100 mg of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids—EPA+DHA) or α- (ALA)-rich linseed oil (4 g, containing 2 g of ALA). A significant increase in the n-3 HUFA score was observed, in a dose-dependent manner, after administration of the FO supplement. In terms of the impact on the n-3 HUFA score, the intake of ENCH cheese (90 g/day) for two or four weeks was equivalent to the administration of one or two FO pills, respectively. Conversely, the linseed oil intake did not significantly impact the n-3 HUFA score. Feeding ENCH cheeses from different sources (bovine, ovine and caprine) for two months improved the n-3 HUFA score by increasing plasma DHA, and the effect was proportional to the CLA content in the cheese. We suggest that the improved n-3 HUFA score resulting from ENCH cheese intake may be attributed to increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) activity. This study demonstrates that natural ENCH cheese is an alternative nutritional source of n-3 HUFA in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946103>Macronutrients Intake and Incident Frailty in Older Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Only a few studies have assessed the association between protein intake and frailty incidence and have obtained inconsistent results. This study examined the association of protein and other macronutrient intake with the risk of frailty in older adults.A prospective cohort of 1,822 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 and older was recruited in 2008-2010 and followed-up through 2012. At baseline, food consumption was assessed with a validated, computerized face-to-face diet history. In 2012, individuals were contacted again to ascertain incident frailty, defined as the presence of at least three of the five Fried criteria: low physical activity, slowness, unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, and exhaustion. Analyses were performed using logistic regression and adjusted for the main confounders, including total  intake.During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, 132 persons with incident frailty were identified. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of frailty across increasing quartiles of total protein were 1.00, 0.55 (0.32-0.93), 0.45 (0.26-0.78), and 0.41 (0.23-0.72); p trend: .001. The corresponding figures for animal protein intake were 1.00, 0.68 (0.40-1.17), 0.56 (0.32-0.97), and 0.48 (0.26-0.87), p trend: .011. And for intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), the results were 1.00, 0.66 (0.37-1.20), 0.54 (0.28-1.02), and 0.50 (0.26-0.96); p trend: .038. No association was found between intake of vegetable protein, saturated fats, long-chain ω-3 fatty acids, α-, linoleic , simple sugars, or polysaccharides and the risk of frailty.Intake of total protein, animal protein, and MUFAs was inversely associated with incident frailty. Promoting the intake of these nutrients might reduce frailty.© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different sources of FA supplementation on apparent total tract nutrient digestibility, milk yield and composition, and  balance (EB) of cows during the transition period and early lactation. We compared diets rich in C18:2 and C18:3 FA. Multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to receive one of the four diets: control (n=11); whole flaxseed (WF, n=10), 60 and 80 g/kg (diet dry matter (DM) basis) of WF during the prepartum and postpartum periods, respectively; whole raw soybeans (WS, n=10), 120 and 160 g/kg (diet DM basis) of WS during the prepartum and postpartum periods, respectively; and calcium salts of unsaturated fatty acids (CSFA, n=11), 24 and 32 g/kg (diet DM basis) of CSFA during the prepartum and postpartum periods, respectively. Dry cows fed WF had higher DM and net  of lactation (NEL) intake than those fed WS or CSFA. The FA supplementation did not alter DM and NDF apparent total tract digestibility, dry cows fed WF exhibited greater NDF total tract digestion than cows fed WS or CSFA. Feeding WS instead of CSFA did not alter NEL intake and total tract digestion of nutrients, but increased milk fat yield and concentration. Calculated efficiency of milk yield was not altered by diets. FA supplementation increased EB during the postpartum period. Experimental diets increased long-chain FA (saturated and unsaturated FA) in milk. In addition, cows fed WS and CSFA had higher C18:1 trans-11 FA and C18:2 cis, and lower C18:3 FA in milk than those fed WF. Furthermore, cows fed CSFA had higher C18:1 trans-11 and cis-9, trans-11 FA than cows fed WS. Although supplemental C18:2 and C18:3 FA did not influence the milk yield of cows, they positively affected EB and increased unsaturated long-chain FA in milk fat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27489005>Consumption of Walnuts in Combination with Other Whole Foods Produces Physiologic, Metabolic, and Gene Expression Changes in Obese C57BL/6J High-Fat-Fed Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Although a reductionist approach has sought to understand the roles of individual nutrients and biochemicals in foods, it has become apparent that there can be differences when studying food components in isolation or within the natural matrix of a whole food.The objective of this study was to determine the ability of whole-food intake to modulate the development of obesity and other metabolic dysfunction in mice fed a high-fat (HF), Western-style obesogenic diet. To test the hypothesis that an n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty -rich food could synergize with other, largely polyphenol-rich foods by producing greater reductions in metabolic disease conditions, the intake of English walnuts was evaluated in combination with 9 other whole foods.Eight-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed low-fat (LF; 10% fat) and HF control diets, along with an HF diet with 8.6% (wt:wt) added walnuts for 9 wk. The HF control diet contained 46% fat with added sucrose (10.9%, wt:wt) and cholesterol (1%, wt:wt); the added sucrose and cholesterol were not present in the LF diet. Other groups were provided the walnut diet with a second whole food-raspberries, apples, cranberries, tart cherries, broccoli sprouts, olive oil, soy protein, or green tea. All of the -containing whole foods were added at an  level equivalent to 1.5 servings/d. Body weights, food intake, and glucose tolerance were determined. Postmortem, serum lipids and inflammatory markers, hepatic fat, gene expression, and the relative concentrations of 594 biochemicals were measured.The addition of walnuts with either raspberries, apples, or green tea reduced glucose area under the curve compared with the HF diet alone (-93%, -64%, and -54%, respectively, P < 0.05). Compared with HF-fed mice, mice fed walnuts with either broccoli sprouts or green tea (-49% and -61%, respectively, P < 0.05) had reduced hepatic fat concentrations. There were differences in global gene expression patterns related to whole-food content, with many examples of differences in LF- and HF-fed mice, HF- and walnut-fed mice, and mice fed walnuts and walnuts plus other foods. The mean ± SEM increase in relative hepatic concentrations of the n-3 fatty acids α-, eicosapentanoic , and docosapentanoic  in all walnut-fed groups was 124% ± 13%, 159% ± 11%, and 114% ± 10%, respectively (P < 0.0001), compared with LF- and HF-fed mice not consuming walnuts.In obese male mice, walnut consumption with an HF Western-style diet caused changes in hepatic fat concentrations, gene expression patterns, and fatty  concentrations. The addition of a second whole food in combination with walnuts produced other changes in metabolite concentrations and gene expression patterns and other physiologic markers. Importantly, these substantial changes occurred in mice fed typical amounts of intake, representing only 1.5 servings each food/d.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108778>Exploring the interactions between serum free fatty acids and fecal microbiota in obesity through a machine learning algorithm.</a></h2><p>Serum free fatty acids (FFA) are generally elevated in obesity. The gut microbiota is involved in the host  metabolism through the regulation of body fat storage, and a link between diet, FFA and the intestinal microbiota seems to exist. Our aim was to explore the interaction among serum FFA levels, gut microbiota, diet and obesity through a model regression tree in 66 subjects (age 52.7 ± 11.2 y) classified according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Total and individual FFA were analyzed by colorimetric enzymatic assay and methyl-tert-butylether-based extraction protocol (MTBE), respectively. Microbiota was determined by qPCR and diet through a food frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, and predictive factors for obesity were obtained via classification by decision trees using machine learning methods. An obese-linked FFA profile was characterized by decreased eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and increased linoleic, gamma- and palmitic acids levels simultaneously. Serum EPA and gender were identified as the most significant variables with 100% and 80% of importance, respectively. Palmitic , Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium explained >30%, followed by Bacteroides group with 20% and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) almost with 15% of importance. Also, the regression tree model obtained for predicting obesity, showed a non-obese-linked profile, independently of gender, with serum EPA > 0.235 μg/mL and Bacteroides > 9.055 log n° cells per g of feces. Moreover, Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium seemed to play an important role by complementing the levels of FFA in predicting obesity in males and females, respectively.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Exploring new food items with improved dietary nutrition factors may, therefore, help to decrease the mortality rate in the poor countries like Bangladesh. Accordingly, the present study was a proximate composition and fatty  analysis of  seed-a legume seed which is given no careful attention locally, though it might be a good source of valuable nutrition factors for both animals and humans. The purpose of the study was, therefore, to generate awareness that  could also act as a good source of food components essential for good health. Proximate analysis revealed that the seed powder contained 8.47 ± 0.52% moisture; 3.50 ± 0.0.07% ash; 1.02 ± 0.06% total fat; 23.95 ± 0.15% total protein; 1.21 ± 0.16% total dietary fiber; 61.86 ± 0.70% total carbohydrate and 352.4 ± 2.66 kcal/100 g .

Monounsaturated palmitoleic  (0.006 ± 0.0), docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5, ω-3) and nervonic  (0.002 ± 0.0) were present in trace amounts. Arachidonic  (AA, C20:4, ω-6), eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5, ω-3), and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6, ω-3) were not detected. The fatty  profile, thus, suggests that essential omega-6 fatty  linoleic  (C18:3, ω-6) and omega-3  (C18:3, ω-3) were the major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in  seed.

Therefore, we investigated the independent and combined effects of α- (ALA) supplementation and exercise training on whole-body glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics within the WAT and skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats.We randomly assigned obese Zucker rats to receive a control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and to remain sedentary or undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (CON-Sed, ALA-Sed, CON-Ex and ALA-Ex groups). Whole-body glucose tolerance was determined in response to a glucose load. Mitochondrial content and bioenergetics were examined in skeletal muscle and epididymal WAT (eWAT). Insulin sensitivity and cellular stress were assessed by western blot.Exercise training independently improved whole-body glucose tolerance as well as insulin-induced signalling in muscle and WAT. However, the consumption of ALA during exercise training prevented exercise-mediated improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance. ALA consumption did not influence exercise-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, within eWAT, ALA supplementation attenuated insulin signalling, decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased the fraction of electron leak to reactive oxygen species (ROS).These findings indicate that, in an obese rodent model, consumption of ALA attenuates the favourable adaptive changes of exercise training within eWAT, which consequently impacts whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Cycle stage was determined by visual evaluation of the ovary and measurement of plasma progesterone. No major effect of cycle stage on the FA profile was observed. However, the composition of FA was different between BP and both OF and UF. While linoleic, stearic, oleic and palmitic  were the four most prevalent FA in both BP and reproductive fluids, the latter contained higher concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and dihomo-γ-.

It has very high caloric content, and a technological protocol was developed for producing a reduced-fat type and fortifying it with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of vegetable origin. A satisfactory reduced-fat prototype was obtained by using a 14% fat cream, which was specifically developed by diluting double cream with a suspension of carob seed flour. The composition of the new cheese changed with respect to the control, but the sensory characteristics were not impaired. Moisture increased from 62·6 to 68·4%, fat on dry matter decreased from 59·1 to 34·7%, and the caloric content decreased from 1060·8 to 718 J/100 g. Proteolysis and lipolysis were not affected by the technological modifications: after 7 d storage, the electrophoretic pattern of caseins and the free fatty acids profile of experimental and control cheeses were not significantly different. Fortification of reduced-fat Burrata with PUFA was obtained by using two commercial formulates available at a compatible price with the current economic values of the cheese. The two formulates derived from flaxseeds and Carthamus tinctorius oil and allowed enrichment in C18 :3 : n3 (α-, ALA), and 9cis,11trans- and 10trans,12cis- conjugated linoleic  (CLA), respectively. Fortification was easy to perform under a technical point of view, but the negative sensory impact limited fortification at a maximum of 7·0 mg g-1 fat ALA and 6·8 g-1 fat CLA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26492257>Effect of Solvent System on Extractability of Lipidic Components of Scenedesmus obliquus (M2-1) and Gloeothece sp. on Antioxidant Scavenging Capacity Thereof.</a></h2><p>Microalgae are well known for their biotechnological potential, namely with regard to bioactive lipidic components-especially carotenoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), well-known for therapeutic applications based on their antioxidant capacity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of four distinct food-grade solvents upon extractability of specific lipidic components, and on the antioxidant capacity exhibited against both synthetic (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH(•)) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic  (ABTS(+•))) and biological reactive species (O₂(•)⁻ and (•)NO⁻). A eukaryotic microalga (Scenedesmus obliquus (M2-1)) and a prokaryotic one (Gloeothece sp.) were used as case studies. Concerning total antioxidant capacity, the hexane:isopropanol (3:2) and acetone extracts of Sc. obliquus (M2-1) were the most effective against DPPH(•) and ABTS(+•), respectively. Gloeothece sp. ethanol extracts were the most interesting scavengers of O₂(•)⁻, probably due the high content of . On the other hand, acetone and hexane:isopropanol (3:2) extracts were the most interesting ones in (•)NO⁻ assay. Acetone extract exhibited the best results for the ABTS assay, likely associated to its content of carotenoids, in both microalgae. Otherwise, ethanol stood out in PUFA extraction. Therefore, profiles of lipidic components extracted are critical for evaluating the antioxidant performance-which appears to hinge, in particular, on the balance between carotenoids and PUFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642838>Effect of poly and mono-unsaturated fatty acids on stability and structure of recombinant S100A8/A9.</a></h2><p>Recombinant pET 15b vectors containing the coding sequences S100A8 and S100A9 are expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The structural changes of S100A8/A9 complex are analyzed upon interaction with poly/mono-unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The thermodynamic values, Gibbs free  and the protein melting point, are obtained through thermal denaturation of protein both with and without UFAs by thermal scanning of protein emission using the fluorescence spectroscopy technique. The far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra show that all studied unsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic, linoleic,  and oleic acids, induce changes in the secondary structure of S100A8/A9 by reducing the α-helix and β-sheet structures. The tertiary structure of S100A8/A9 has fluctuations in the fluorescence emission spectra after the incubation of protein with UFAs. The blue-shift of emission maximum wavelength and the increase in fluorescence intensity of anilino naphthalene-8-sulfonic  confirm that the partial unfolding is caused by the conformational changes in the tertiary structure in the presence of UFAs. The structural changes in S100A8/A9 and its lower stability in the presence of UFAs may be necessary for S100A8/A9 to play a biological role in the inflammatory milieu.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, an eco-friendly solvent combination of ethyl acetate and ethanol (EA/E) was proposed and tested for lipid extraction from Chlorella sp. cultivated in outdoor raceway ponds and effect of extraction variables on lipid yield were intensively studied. Results indicated that lipid extraction yield was increased with solvent to biomass ratio but did not vary significantly when the value exceeded 20:1. Lipid yield was found to be strongly dependent on extraction temperature and time. Finally, fatty  profiles of lipid were determined and results indicated that the major components were octadecanoic , palmitic , linoleic  and , demonstrating that the lipid extracted from the Chlorella sp. cultivated in outdoor raceway ponds by EA/E was suitable feedstock for biodiesel production.Copyright © 2015.

There are scant data regarding how the content of non-essential fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impact the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that obesogenic diets enriched in oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9) reduce polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels vs an obesogenic diet enriched in SFAs. Adult male mice were fed for eight weeks either (1) a control 16% fat  (en) diet with 5.7% en OA and 4.4% en SFA, (2) a 50% fat en diet with 33% en OA and 9.9% en SFA, or (3) a 50% en diet with a high SFA diet with 33% en SFA and 9.1% en OA. Dietary levels and intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) and α- (ALA; 18:3n-3) were constant between the experimental groups. Several peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, and adipose) were analyzed for lipid composition and oxylipin analysis was performed for liver and adipose. Our data demonstrate that a high OA diet reduced tissue content of LA and ALA (≥30%) in phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions, reduced the content of some LA-derived and ALA-derived oxylipins in liver and adipose, and conversely, elevated hepatic content of PGF. In all tissues examined, except for adipose, levels of arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) were either elevated or unaffected by the obesogenic diets. Our data indicate that the non-essential fatty content of obesogenic diets impacts PUFA content in peripheral tissues and influences the levels of bioactive oxylipins.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639737>Body adiposity and bone parameters of male rats from mothers fed diet containing flaxseed flour during lactation.</a></h2><p>Obesity and osteoporosis may have their origins in early postnatal life. This study was designed to evaluate whether flaxseed flour use during lactation period bears effect on body adiposity and skeletal structure of male rat pups at weaning. At birth, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control and experimental (FF) groups, whose dams were treated with control or flaxseed flour diet, respectively, during lactation. At 21 days of age, pups were weaned to assess body mass, length and composition by dual- X-ray absorptiometry. The animals were then sacrificed to carry out analysis of serum profile, intra-abdominal adipocyte morphology and femur characteristics. Differences were considered significant when P&lt;0.05. The FF group displayed the following characteristics (P&lt;0.05): higher body mass, length, bone mineral content, bone area and concentrations of osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; higher levels of stearic, α-, eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids and lower levels of arachidonic  and cholesterol; smaller adipocyte area; and higher mass, epiphysis distance, diaphysis width, maximal load, break load, resilience and stiffness of femur.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the Chia oil- or HxT-enriched-RP effect on the lipoprotein profile of aged rats fed high-fat, high-, and cholesterol-enriched diets. RP samples were prepared by mixing lean pork and lard with or without Chia oil (152.2 g/kg fresh matter) or HxT (3.6 g/kg fresh matter). Diets were prepared by mixing a semisynthetic diet with freeze-dried RP. Groups of 1-year male Wistar rats were fed the following experimental diets for 8 weeks: C, control-RP diet; HC, cholesterol-enriched-RP diet; and Chia oil-RP (CHIA) and HxT, Chia oil- or hydroxytyrosol-RP, cholesterol-enriched diet. Plasma lipid, lipoprotein profile, SREBP-1c protein, and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor gene () expressions were evaluated. Compared to C diet, the HC diet increased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, total lipids, and SREBP-1c expression, but reduced  expression and significantly modified the lipoprotein profile, giving rise to the presence of high levels of atherogenic cholesterol-enriched very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles. Compared to the HC diet, the HxT diet did not produce significant changes in feed intake but it reduced the body weight. Chia oil and HxT partially arrested the negative effects of the high-fat, high-, and cholesterol-enriched meat-based diets on lipemia and lipoproteinemia, mostly by reducing the amount of cholesterol content in VLDL (60% and 74% less in CHIA and HxT vs. HC, respectively) and the VLDL total mass (59% and 63% less in CHIA and HxT vs. HC, respectively). Free fatty acids (FFA) significantly correlated with adipose tissue weight and VLDL total mass (both  < 0.05), and plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, total lipids, and SREBP-1c (all  < 0.001), suggesting the important role of FFA in lipoprotein metabolism. Results support the recommendation to include these ingredients in pork products addressed to reduce the presence of increased atherogenic particles in aged people at CVD risk consuming large amounts of pork.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562938>iTRAQ-Based Comparative Proteomic Analysis of the Roots of TWO Winter Turnip Rapes ( L.) with Different Freezing-Tolerance.</a></h2><p>The freezing tolerance of roots is crucial for winter turnip rape ( L.) survival in the winter in Northwest China. Cold acclimation (CA) can alleviate the root damage caused by freezing stress. To acknowledge the molecular mechanisms of freezing tolerance in winter turnip rape, two  genotypes, freezing stressed after the induction of cold acclimation, were used to compare the proteomic profiles of roots by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Under freezing stress (-4 °C) for 8 h, 139 and 96 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified in the roots of "Longyou7" (freezing-tolerant) and "Tianyou4" (freezing-sensitive), respectively. Among these DAPs, 91 and 48 proteins were up- and down-accumulated in "Longyou7", respectively, and 46 and 50 proteins were up- and down-accumulated in "Tianyou4", respectively. Under freezing stress, 174 DAPs of two varieties were identified, including 9 proteins related to ribosome, 19 DAPs related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (e.g., phenylpropanoid and the lignin pathway), and 22 down-accumulated DAPs enriched in oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, fructose and mannose metabolism,  metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. The expressional pattern of the genes encoding the 15 significant DAPs were consistent with the iTRAQ data. This work indicates that protein biosynthesis, lignin synthesis, the reduction of  consumption and a higher  content contribute to the freezing tolerance of winter turnip rape.

Especially dietary intake of n-3 PUFA and a lowered n-6:n-3 ratio are highly encouraged due to beneficial and diminishing effects on basal cortisol secretions. However, the time of such effects to occur and how plasma PUFA patterns affect cortisol concentrations in the short-term was rarely investigated. In order to address this, we supplemented forty male and forty female guinea pigs with diets high in the essential PUFA α- (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) and linoleic  (LA, 18 : 2n-6) for 20 d. Saliva cortisol concentrations in relation to altering plasma PUFA patterns during this time span were analysed in a repeated measurement design both during basal conditions (individual housing) in 5-d intervals and during stressful social confrontations. We detected very fast plasma PUFA accumulation rates, corresponding to the major dietary PUFA, which resulted in plasma PUFA plateau phases after 10 d. ALA negatively and LA positively affected saliva cortisol concentrations throughout the study. A positive effect of the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio on saliva cortisol concentrations was detected during peak plasma PUFA accumulations and social confrontations, while no effects were detected in relation to plasma PUFA plateau phases. These results suggest that the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio diminishes HPA axis activity during altered physiological conditions only and highlights the importance of altering plasma PUFA patterns for HPA axis functions and the control of  balance and physiological stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27586532>Isolation and Proteomic Analysis of a  Mutant with Enhanced Lipid Production by the Gamma Irradiation Method.</a></h2><p>In this study, an enhanced lipid-producing mutant strain of the microalga  was developed by gamma irradiation.

Autoimmunity may have a pathogenic role in a subgroup of autistic children. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between serum levels of anti-myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) brain-specific auto-antibodies and reduced plasma levels of PUFAs in autistic children. Plasma levels of PUFAs (including linoleic, alphalinolenic, arachidonic "AA" and docosahexaenoic "DHA" acids) and serum anti-MBP were measured in 80 autistic children, aged between 4 and 12 years, and 80 healthy-matched children. Autistic patients had significantly lower plasma levels of PUFAs than healthy children. On the other hand, ω6/ω3 ratio (AA/DHA) was significantly higher in autistic patients than healthy children. Low plasma DHA, AA,  and linoleic acids were found in 67.5%, 50%, 40% and 35%, respectively of autistic children. On the other hand, 70% of autistic patients had elevated ω6/ω3 ratio. Autistic patients with increased serum levels of anti-MBP auto-antibodies (75%) had significantly lower plasma DHA (P<0.5) and significantly higher ω6/ω3 ratio (P<0.5) than patients who were seronegative for these antibodies. In conclusions, some autistic children have a significant positive association between reduced levels of plasma DHA and increased serum levels of anti-MBP brain-specific auto-antibodies. However, replication studies of larger samples are recommended to validate whether reduced levels of plasma PUFAs are a mere association or have a role in the induction of the production of anti-MBP in some autistic children.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is a novel, natural, low-kilojoule, cost-effective texture-modifying ingredient in functional food products. Yet, the cultivar with the most optimal nutrient content and the preferred harvest times are as yet unknown. For this reason, mucilage from three  (Algerian, Morado and Gymno-Carpo) and one  (Robusta) cultivar were investigated to determine their nutrient content over six months. Nutrients that contribute  (10.2 kJ/g) were low. The mineral content was high (ash 17.7/100 g), particularly calcium (3.0 g/100 g) and phosphorous (109.5 mg/kg). Low insoluble -detergent fibre (1.4 g/kg) and neutral-detergent fibre (2.1 g/kg) values indicated that mucilage was mostly soluble fibre. Calcium oxalate crystals were not detected in dried mucilage.  powders had higher protein, extractable fat and potassium content, while  mucilage powders had higher polyunsaturated (Linoleic and α-) fat content.  Robusta mucilage, harvested after the fruit harvest (February) had the lowest  content and the highest mineral and protein content. Mucilage powders were highly soluble, low-kilojoule and mineral-rich.

Total mortality is inversely associated with the amount of total fat consumed. In contrast, trans fatty acids or SFA intake is positively related to mortality while the inverse is observed with consumption of MUFA or PUFA. Among PUFA, long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA have many beneficial effects. Dietary intake of some types of fatty acids is specific to Africa.  from saturated fat does not exceed 14% and  from n-6 PUFA does not exceed 8% of total  intake. Dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA is less than 100 mg/d whereas international recommendations promote 250-500 mg/d. Consumption of plant n-3 PUFA mainly α- (ALA) is highly variable depending on the country. Both fish and ALA availability are low in several African countries. The prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular events remain very low in Africa, partly explained by the fact that the whole dietary pattern is globally the best of all continents. One objective of 'fat for Africa' could be to increase, as much as possible, the dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA by promoting sustainable aquaculture and to maintain as much as possible traditional dietary pattern by preventing a tendency to westernisation, provided that the amount of  and protein is sufficient to fight against wasting and stunting where it still exists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27178023>NO synthesis from arginine is favored by α- in mice fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Alterations in NO availability and signaling play a pivotal role at early stages of the metabolic syndrome (MetSynd). We hypothesized that dietary α- (ALA, 18:3 n-3) favors NO availability by modulating amino  metabolism, with a specific impact on the arginine-NO pathway. Mice were fed a hyperlipidic diet (285 g lipid/kg, 51.1 % ), rich in either saturated fatty acids (SFA, provided by palm oil, PALM group) or ALA (provided by linseed oil, LIN group). We measured whole-body NO synthesis and systemic arginine hydrolysis with a tracer-based method, plasma concentration of related metabolites, and hepatic mRNA level of related enzymes, and the study was completed by a transcriptomic analysis in the liver. As expected with this model, hyperlipidic diets resulted in increased adiposity and glycemia after 5 weeks. As compared to PALM mice, LIN mice had a higher plasma nitrite and nitrate concentration, a higher whole-body conversion of arginine into NO vs urea, and a similar plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), despite a higher expression of the liver dimethylargininase-1. In LIN mice, there was a higher expression of genes involved in PPARα signaling, but a little impact on gene expression related to amino acids and arginine metabolism. This effect cannot be directly ascribed to changes in arginase activity in the liver or ADMA metabolism, nor to direct regulation of the related target genes. In conclusion, dietary ALA favors NO synthesis, which could contribute to rescue NO availability when jeopardized by the nutritional conditions in relation with the initiation of the MetSynd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043053>The isolation and identification of new microalgal strains producing oil and carotenoid simultaneously with biofuel potential.</a></h2><p>Taxonomy and phylogeny of twenty two microalgal isolates were examined using both universal and newly designed molecular primers.

To compare the discrepancies in the observed intake levels with the French recommended levels, a weighted fat adherence score was built combining intakes of the different FA. Individual scores were computed in relation to official recommendations, and potential explanatory factors were identified. These data show that SFA intakes are persistently higher than national recommendations, combined with low intakes of MUFA and PUFA, particularly long-chain n-3 FA. Only 14·6 % of the French population met DHA intake recommendation, 7·8 % for EPA and 21·6 % for SFA. This situation remains unfavourable in terms of primary prevention of CVD.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64%  (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased arachidonic  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell  homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved. As some of these bacteria have shown modulation of lipid metabolism , further research to be focused on this topic may help us to understand the role of the gut microbiota in human health.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769946>Next-Generation Sequencing Identifies Polyunsaturated Fatty  Responsive Genes in the Juvenile Rat Cerebellum.</a></h2><p>Dietary -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influence postnatal brain growth and development. However, little data exist regarding the impacts of dietary -3 PUFA in juvenile animals post weaning, which is a time of rapid growth. We tested the hypothesis that depleting dietary -3 PUFA would result in modifications to the cerebellar transcriptome of juvenile rats. To test this hypothesis, three week old male rats (an age that roughly corresponds to an 11 month old child in brain development) were fed diets containing either soybean oil (SO) providing 1.1%  from α- (ALA; 18:3-3; ALA-sufficient) or corn oil (CO) providing 0.13%  from ALA (ALA-deficient) for four weeks. Fatty acids (FAs) in the cerebellum were analyzed and revealed a 4-fold increase in n-6 docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5-6), increases in arachidonic  (AA; 20:4-6) and docosatetraenoic  (DTA; 22:4-6), but no decrease in docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6-3), in animals fed CO versus SO. Transcript abundance was then characterized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two diets. Upper quartile (UQ) scaling and transcripts per million (TPM) data normalization identified 100 and 107 DEGs, respectively. Comparison of DEGs from the two normalization methods identified 70 genes that overlapped, with 90% having abundance differences less than 2-fold. , a transcriptional activator that plays roles in neuroprotection and learning, was elevated over 2-fold from the CO diet. These data indicate that expression of  in the juvenile rat cerebellum is responsive to dietary -3 PUFA, but additional studies are needed clarify the neurodevelopmental relationships between -3 PUFA and  and the resulting impacts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820744>Chemical composition, in vitro gas production, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silage (Brassica napus) with four levels of molasses.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of four levels of molasses on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silages. A canola (Brassica napus var. Monty) crop was established in a small-scale agricultural farm and harvested 148 days after sowing. Four levels of molasses were tested with respect to the fresh weight (1.5 kg); these were 1% (CS-1), 2% (CS-2), 3% (CS-3) and 4% (CS-4) molasses, and 0% molasses (CS-0) was included as a control. A total of 45 microsilages were prepared using PVC pipes (4 in. of diameter × 20 cm of length), and the forage was compressed using a manual press. The effects of control and treatments were tested using the general linear model Y = μ + T + E. The  (C18:3n3), palmitic  (C16:0) and linoleic  methyl ester (C18:2n6c) accounted for 30%, 21% and 10.5% of total fatty acids, respectively; the fermentation parameters and in vitro methane production were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments; in vitro digestibility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) as the level of molasses increased. It was concluded that CS-4 improved the DM content by 9% and showed high content of  methyl ester. The gross  of canola silages could favour the oleic  methyl ester.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993180>Intake of n-3 fatty acids and long-term outcome in renal transplant recipients: a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>Supplementation with n-3 fatty acids may improve long-term outcomes of renal transplant recipients (RTR). Recent evidence suggests that EPA and DHA have different outcomes compared with α- (ALA). We examined the prospective associations of EPA-DHA and ALA intakes with graft failure and all-cause mortality in 637 RTR. During 3·1 years (interquartile range 2·7, 3·8) of follow-up, forty-one developed graft failure and sixty-seven died. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, EPA-DHA and ALA intakes were not associated with graft failure. EPA-DHA intake was not significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0·79; 95% CI 0·54, 1·15 per 0·1 % difference). ALA intake was significantly associated with mortality (HR 1·17; 95% CI 1·04, 1·31 per 0·1 % difference). This association remained following adjustments for BMI, proteinuria and intakes of fat, carbohydrate and protein. RTR in the highest tertile of ALA intake exhibited about 2-fold higher mortality risk (HR 2·21; 95% CI 1·23, 3·97) compared with the lowest tertile. In conclusion, ALA intake may be associated with increased mortality in RTR. Future RCT are needed to confirm these results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27813582>Genome-wide expression analysis of a rice mutant line under salt stress.</a></h2><p>Salinity is a major environmental stress to plants. In this study, the ability of plants to tolerate salt was investigated by studying growth, physiological characteristics, and expression levels of genes related to the salt-stress response in the salt-tolerant rice mutant (Till-II-877), which was derived from γ-ray irradiation. Compared to plants grown under normal conditions, the height and root length of wild type (WT) were reduced by approximately 40 and 29% following exposure to salt stress for 3 weeks, whereas Till-II-877 line showed 29 and 23% reductions in plant height and root length, respectively. No significant changes were observed in total chlorophyll content, and the malondialdehyde content of the mutant increased less than that of the WT under salt treatment. Gene expression was compared between the WT and mutant lines using microarray analysis. An unbiased analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways involved in salt-stress responses. Among the most significantly affected pathways, changes in gene expression were observed in α- and linoleic  metabolism (in lipid metabolism), fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (in carbohydrate metabolism), cysteine and methionine metabolism (in amino  metabolism), and carbon fixation (in the  metabolism of photosynthetic organisms) under salt stress. These results show that the differential response of plants subjected to salt stress was due to changes in multiple metabolic pathways. These findings increase our understanding of the effects of salt stress in rice and may aid in the development of salt-tolerant rice cultivars.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28156186>Polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk of multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Results from previous studies on polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) intake and multiple sclerosis (MS) risk are conflicting.To prospectively investigate the association between dietary intake of PUFA and MS risk.We followed 80,920 women from Nurses' Health Study (1984-2004) and 94,511 women from Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2009) who reported on diet using a validated food frequency questionnaire every 4 years and identified 479 incident MS cases during follow-up. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the effect of PUFA intake on MS risk adjusting for age, latitude of residence at age 15, ancestry, cigarette smoking, supplemental vitamin D intake, body mass index, and total  intake.Higher intake of total PUFA at baseline was associated with a lower risk of MS (HR top vs bottom quintile: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.90, p trend = 0.01). Among the specific types of PUFA, only α- (ALA) was inversely associated with MS risk (HR top vs bottom quintile: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45-0.83, p trend = 0.001). The long-chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were not associated with MS risk.Low dietary PUFA intake may be another modifiable risk factor for MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282298>Regulation of rat plasma and cerebral cortex oxylipin concentrations with increasing levels of dietary linoleic .</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) is the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty  in the North American diet and is a precursor to circulating bioactive fatty  metabolites implicated in brain disorders. This exploratory study tested the effects of increasing dietary LA on plasma and cerebral cortex metabolites derived from LA, its elongation-desaturation products dihomo-gamma  (DGLA, 20:3n-6)  and arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6), as well as omega-3  (α-LNA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3). Plasma and cortex were obtained from rats fed a 0.4%, 5.2% or 10.5%  LA diet for 15 weeks and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Total oxylipin concentrations, representing the esterified and unesterified pool, and unesterified oxylipins derived from LA and AA were significantly increased and EPA metabolites decreased in plasma at 5.2% or 10.5%  LA compared to 0.4%  LA. Unesterified plasma DHA metabolites also decreased at 10.5%  LA. In cortex, total and unesterified LA and AA metabolites increased and unesterified EPA metabolites decreased at 5.2% or 10.5% LA. DGLA and α-LNA metabolites did not significantly change in plasma or cortex. Dietary LA lowering represents a feasible approach for targeting plasma and brain LA, AA, EPA or DHA-derived metabolite concentrations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study describes dietary intakes and food sources of fat and fatty acids in 1051 Irish adults (aged 18-90 years), using data from the 2011 national food consumption survey, the National Adult Nutrition Survey. It also compares current intakes for 18-64-year-olds with those reported in the last such survey in 2001, the North/South Ireland Food Consumption Survey. Dietary fat intakes were estimated using data from 4-d semi-weighed (2011) and 7-d estimated (2001) food diaries. In 2011, intakes for 18-64-year-olds were as follows: total fat, 34·1 (sd 6·1) % total  (%TE); SFA, 13·3 (sd 3·3) %TE; MUFA, 12·5 (sd 2·6) %TE; PUFA, 6·1 (sd 2·2) %TE; and trans-fat, 0·511 (sd 0·282) %TE. Apart from MUFA, intakes decreased (P65 years had the highest intakes of SFA; however, intakes were typically higher than UK-recommended values for all groups. In contrast, intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids were lowest in younger age groups. Intakes of trans-fat were well within UK-recommended levels. Although there have been some improvements in the profile of intakes since 2001, imbalances persist in the quantity and quality of dietary fat consumed by Irish adults, most notably for total and SFA and for younger age groups for long-chain n-3 fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28679464>Linoleic (LA) and  (ALA)  concentrations in follicular fluid of prepubertal goats and their effect on oocyte in vitro maturation and embryo development.</a></h2><p>In this study we assessed the concentration of linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) in follicular fluid of prepubertal goats according to follicle size (<3mm or ≥3mm) by gas chromatography and tested the addition of different LA and ALA (LA:ALA) concentration ratios (50:50, 100:50 and 200:50µM) to the IVM medium on embryo development, mitochondrial activity, ATP concentration and relative gene expression (RPL19, ribosomal protein L19; SLC2A1, facilitated glucose transporter 1; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; GPX1, glutathione peroxidase 1; HSPA5, heat-shock protein family A 70 kDa; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase 1; GCLC, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; SOD1, superoxide dismutase 1). Oocytes were in vitro matured, fertilised or parthenogenetically activated and zygotes were cultured following conventional protocols. LA concentration ranged from 247 to 319µM and ALA concentration from 8.39 to 41.19µM without any effect of follicle size. Blastocyst production from the different groups was: control FCS (22.33%) and BSA (19.63%), treatments 50:50 (22.58%), 100:50 (21.01%) and 200:50 (9.60%). Oocytes from the 200:50 group presented higher polyspermy and mitochondrial activity compared with controls and the rest of the treatment groups. No differences were observed in ATP concentration or relative expression of the genes measured between treatment groups. In conclusion, the low number of blastocysts obtained in the 200:50 group was caused by a high number of polyspermic zygotes, which could suggest that high LA concentration impairs oocyte membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255325>A UPLC/MS/MS method for comprehensive profiling and quantification of fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are recently discovered lipids with antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. We have developed an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) method for comprehensive profiling and quantification of FAHFAs. Through optimization of the chromatographic conditions, most FAHFA isomers can be efficiently separated and quantified in 29 min with excellent peak shape and good robustness. UPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS was used for identification of FAHFAs based on the high-resolution m/z values and the fragmentation rules. Sixty-four FAHFAs, belonging to 17 different families, were identified in white adipose tissue (WAT) of golden hamsters. Nine of the 17 FAHFA family members were newly discovered in this work, and linoleic  and  were newly found fatty  moieties of FAHFAs. The total number of FAHFAs identified from WAT in this work is far larger than that in any previously reported work. The parameters (precursor ions, product ions, and collision ) of the 64 FAHFAs identified in golden hamster WAT by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS were further used in UPLC coupled with triple-quadrupole (QQQ) MS for quantification in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Finally, this newly developed UPLC/QQQ-MS method was used for the quantification of FAHFAs in hamster WAT attached to epididymis, kidney, intestine, and inguen to explore the disturbance of the levels of WAT FAHFAs in the pathological state of hyperlipidemia. The regulation effects of fenofibrate on the levels of WAT FAHFAs were also investigated. The results show that fenofibrate therapy can increase the concentration of FAHFAs in WAT.

In the first years of life, epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that common causative foods of a child's diet are: cow's milk, hen's eggs, wheat and soya. Children with AD being treated with elimination diets are at risk of nutritional deficiencies that include those nutrients required for ensuring proper skin structure and function.The aim of the study was to assess dietary intake of nutrients which affect skin condition in children with AD being treated with a milk-free diet.Subjects were 25 children aged 4-6 years with AD undergoing the milk exclusion diet and 25 age-matched healthy controls. The  and nutritional value of diets were evaluated that included those components affecting skin condition; ie. vitamins A, D, E, B2 and C; minerals iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn); polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The Dieta 5.0 programme was used for dietary assessment and outcomes were then related to dietary recommendations.There were no significant differences between groups in mean  values and mean intakes of protein, fats and carbohydrates (p>0.05). The percentage of subjects with low  value were 44% and 36% in respectively Groups I and II. Deficiencies of fat intake were observed in 60% in Group I and 44% in Group II. There were however no risks in the dietary intakes of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins A, B2 and C nor of Fe and Zn. Deficiencies of dietary intakes were observed in respectively Groups I and II in the following; vitamin E (24% vs 64%), vitamin D (36% vs 92%), linoleic  (36% vs 72%), α- (36% vs 40%) and long chain PUFAs (96% in both groups).Ensuring recommended dietary supply of those nutrients affecting skin condition is required for both groups of children. Children with AD had better balanced diets in respect of the studied nutrients that may reflect the influence of continuous healthcare received from physicians and dieticians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116231>Insulin resistance by TNF-α is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is ameliorated by punicic , a PPARγ agonist.</a></h2><p>Punicic  (PA), a poly unsaturated fatty  found abundantly in pomegranate seed oil is reported to have PPARγ agonist property. TNF-α mediated insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and is associated with severe mitochondrial impairment. In this study, PA was evaluated for its ability to ameliorate TNF-α induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For this, we examined the alterations in mitochondrial energetics, biogenesis, transmembrane potential and dynamics in TNF-α induced insulin resistant model of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PA improved glucose uptake, ROS accumulation, mitochondrial biogenesis and energetics in TNF-α treated cells. In addition, treatment with PA was found to ameliorate TNF-α induced alterations in proteins associated with mitochondrial dynamics like FIS1 and OPA1. These findings suggest that PA can be considered as an active lead for the management of insulin resistance and associated mitochondrial dysfunctions.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Lung tissue has a low glucose stock. Fatty acids are the main  producer of type II pneumocytes, which use them in order to form phospholipids, essential for surfactant whose creation and release decrease in acute lung injury (ALI). Glutamine is a good substratum for endocrine cells and type II pneumocytes. Due to high nutritional risk, it is important its assessments in disorders as COPD and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). Indirect calorimetry values the effect of ventilation and nutritional support, avoiding overfeeding. Hypophosphatemia and refeeding syndrome are frequent and need to be avoided because of their morbidity. In critically ill patients, malnutrition can lead to respiratory failure and increasing mechanical ventilation time. To avoid hypercapnia in weaning, glucose levels should be controlled. High lipids/carbohydrates ratio do not show usefulness in COPD neither mechanical ventilation removal. ALI patients beneficiate from an early start and the volume administered. Enteral nutrition with high fatty acids ratio (EPA, DHA and γ-) and antioxidants do not show any superiority. Omega-3 fatty  in parenteral nutrition could modulate infl ammation and immunosuppression in a positive manner.

Twenty-eight Holstein cows were blocked for similar calving date 4wk before expected parturition to compare the effects of feeding sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on milk production and composition, plasma metabolites, and liver parameters. Cows within each block were assigned to 1 of 3 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets: control with a source of calcium salts of palm oil (MEG; 1.1 and 2.6% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively); n-3 fatty acids supplied as whole flaxseed (WFL; 4.8 and 7.7% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively); and n-6 fatty acids supplied as whole linola (WLO; 4.8 and 7.7% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively). Diets were fed until wk 14 of lactation. Contrasts of WFL versus WLO and polyunsaturated fatty acids versus MEG were compared. Cows fed polyunsaturated fatty acids increased dry matter intake over time at a greater extent than those fed MEG, which resulted in enhanced  balance. Cows fed MEG produced more milk compared with those fed polyunsaturated fatty acids, and there was no difference between those fed WFL and WLO. We found no effect on body condition score and body weight. Plasma concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, and BHB were similar among diets. There was no effect of diet on concentration of glycogen and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the liver. We observed higher concentrations of hepatic lipids and triacylglycerol in cows fed MEG compared with those fed polyunsaturated fatty acids, and no difference between WFL and WLO. Hepatic catalase activity tended to be higher on wk 4 after calving for cows supplemented with WFL compared with those fed WLO. Feeding linoleic and  acids as unprotected oilseeds increased dry matter intake over time at a greater extent for cows fed MEG, improved the  status, and lowered hepatic lipids and triacylglycerol contents, which may contribute to enhance the health status of transition dairy cows.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Daily milk yield and composition were determined weekly over a 34-day lactation period. Within each litter, one piglet at birth and four piglets on day 35 of life were slaughtered. Milk intake per piglet tended to be greater in trial 2 (832 v. 893 g/day; P=0.066), but piglets grew at 168±3.3 g/day, irrespective of the trial. In the IB sow milk, the linoleic (LA) :  (LNA)  ratio averaged 14.6 and 15.2 in trial 1 and trial 2, respectively. A fivefold increase in piglet body fat content was observed over lactation (P<0.001). Most of this fat (81.4%) was present in the carcass. After 34 days of lactation, whole-body relative content of palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids were very close to those in the milk consumed, suggesting direct deposition. Daily deposition of LA derivatives and of LNA and its derivatives was found to be extremely low (<0.02 g, on average). Moreover, some of the arachidonic  (ARA) in tissues of the IB piglet at birth disappeared throughout the lactating period. An overall fractional deposition for total fatty acids (FA) was 0.409. Fractional oxidation (disappearance) rates were 0.939 and 0.926 for n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FA. The overall rate of disappearance for the major non-essential FA (myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids), estimated as 1-the overall fractional deposition rate, was 0.546. It is concluded that the high degree of FA unsaturation, high oxidation rate of LA and LNA, and poor synthesis of ARA from LA and of docosahexaenoic  from LNA found in the suckling piglet might increase the  cost of whole-body fat accretion, a contributor to the observed low efficiency of use of milk  for growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559699>Chemical Composition and Medicinal Value of Fruiting Bodies and Submerged Cultured Mycelia of Caterpillar Medicinal Fungus Cordyceps militaris CBS-132098 (Ascomycetes).</a></h2><p>In this paper, we report the results of a proximate analysis (i.e., moisture, ash, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and ); a bioactive compounds analysis (i.e., cordycepin and ergothioneine); fatty and amino  analysis; and analyses of vitamin content, macro- and microelement composition of fruiting body (FB), and mycelial biomass (MB) of medicinal caterpillar fungus Cordyceps militaris strain CBS-132098. These results demonstrate that the FB and MB of C. militaris are good sources of proteins: 59.8% protein content in the FB and 39.5% in the MB.

In the FB of C. militaris, the total amino  content was 57.39 mg/g and in the MB it was 24.98 mg/g. The quantification of the identified fatty acids indicated that palmitic , oleic , linoleic , and  were the major fatty acids. The micro- and macroelement compositions were studied. The highest results were calcium (797 mg/kg FB; 11 mg/kg MB); potassium (15,938 mg/kg FB 12,183 mg/kg MB); magnesium (4,227 mg/kg FB; 3,414 mg/kg MB); sodium (171 mg/kg FB; 1,567 mg/kg MB); phosphorus (7,196 mg/kg FB; 14,293 mg/kg MB); and sulfur (5,088 mg/kg FB; 2,558 mg/kg MB). The vitamin composition was studied, and the most abundant vitamins were vitamin A, vitamin B3, and vitamin E. The bioactive components were cordycepin, cordycepic  (D-mannitol), and ergothioneine. There were differences in cordycepin and ergothioneine contents between the FB and the MB. The cordycepin concentration was 0.11% in the FB and 0.182% in the MB, the cordycepic  was 4.7 mg/100g in the FB and 5.2 mg/100 g in the MB, and the ergothioneine content was 782.37 mg/kg in the FB and 130.65 mg/kg in the MB.

Effects on the prepartum performance of the dam and birth weight of the progeny1.</a></h2><p>A 2-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effects of level and source of fat in the diet of gestating beef cows on their prepartum performance and birth weight of progeny. Each year, 75 multiparous (≥3 calving) pregnant Angus cows were stratified by BW (663 ± 21.5 kg) and BCS (2.6 ± 0.12; 1 to 5 scale) and randomly assigned to 1 of 15 outdoor pens. Subsequently, each pen was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 (n = 5) treatments: a low-fat diet (LF; 1.4 ± 0.12% EE) consisting of grass-legume hay, barley straw, and barley grain, or 1 of 2 high-fat diets (HF; 3.3 ± 0.20% EE) that included either a canola seed (CAN) or a flaxseed (FLX) based pelleted feed. Diets were formulated to meet the requirements of pregnant beef cows during the last 2 trimesters of gestation (0.183 ± 4.8 d), adjusted for changes in environmental conditions, and offered such that each pen on average received similar daily amounts of DE (31.2 ± 2.8 Mcal/cow), CP (1.36 ± 0.13 kg/cow), and DM (12.9 ± 1.0 kg/cow). Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with contrasts to separate the effects of level (LF vs. HF) and source (CAN vs. FLX) of fat. After 160 d on trial, conceptus corrected-BW (CC-BW) of LF cows (708 kg) and the proportion of overconditioned cows (13.2%) were greater (P ≤ 0.04) than those of HF, with no difference (P ≥ 0.84) between CAN and FLX for CC-BW (697 kg) and proportion of overconditioned cows (3.6% vs. 2.9%). Feeding FLX diet during gestation resulted in cows with a greater (P ≤ 0.01) concentration of conjugated  (0.12% vs. 0.05%) and n-3 (0.58% vs. 0.37%) fatty acids, and a tendency (P = 0.09) for conjugated linoleic  concentration (1.05% vs. 0.88%) to be greater in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) when compared with cows fed the CAN diet. By the end of gestation, serum NEFA concentration of LF cows (592 µEq/L) was lower (P < 0.01) than that of HF cows, and FLX cows had greater (P < 0.01) serum NEFA concentration than CAN cows (636 vs. 961 µEq/L). Cows receiving the LF diet during gestation gave birth to lighter (P < 0.01) calves compared with those receiving the HF diets (40.2 vs. 42.9 kg), with no difference (P = 0.24) between calves born to CAN (42.4 kg) and FLX (43.3 kg) cows. In conclusion, these results suggest a partitioning of the ME in pregnant beef cows that is dependent on the type of dietary , resulting in heavier calves at birth for cows fed high-fat diets. Also, the type of fatty  in the diet of gestating beef cows affected the fatty  profile in SCAT and serum NEFA concentration.© The Author(s) 2019.

To test our hypothesis, mice were separated into three groups. The first group received a high-fat diet containing fresh flaxseed oil (CONT-), the second was fed the same diet prepared using heated flaxseed oil (OXID), and the third group received the same diet containing fresh flaxseed oil and had diabetes induced by streptozotocin (CONT+). Oxidative stress, aortic parameters and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were assessed. After 3 months, plasma lipid profile, glucose levels, body weight,  intake and dietary intake did not differ among groups. Likewise, oxidative stress, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic MDA expressed as nmol/mg portion (ptn) and antioxidant enzymes did not differ among the groups. Hepatic linoleic , α-, arachidonic  and EPA  declined in the OXID and CONT+ groups. Aortic wall thickness, lumen and diameter increased only in the OXID group. OXID and CONT+ groups exhibited higher concentrations of MDA, expressed as μmol/mg ptn per %PUFA, when compared with the CONT- group. Our results suggest that ingestion of oxidised flaxseed oil increases hepatic MDA concentration and is potentially pro-atherogenic. In addition, the mean MDA value observed in all groups was similar to those reported in other studies that used xenobiotics as oxidative stress inducers. Thus, the diet applied in this study represents an interesting model for further research involving antioxidants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915388>EPA and DHA, but not ALA, have antidepressant effects with 17β-estradiol injection via regulation of a neurobiological system in ovariectomized rats.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies found that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and estrogen had synergistic antidepressant-like effects. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that three major n-3 PUFAs, α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), individually had antidepressant effects combined with 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (E) through a neurobiological pathway in ovariectomized rats. Rats were fed a modified American Institute of Nutrition-93G diet with 0% n-3 PUFAs and 1% ALA, EPA and DHA relative to total  intake for 12 weeks and were injected with corn oil or E every 4 days during the last 3 weeks. Supplementation of EPA, DHA and E increased serum concentrations of serotonin and climbing behavior, and decreased immobility during a forced swimming test. Supplementation with EPA, DHA and E also decreased hippocampal expressions of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and increased cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and estrogen receptor-α. Immunofluorescence staining consistently showed elevated expressions of BDNF. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that E increased glucose and decreased glutamate, glutamine and myo-inositol concentrations regardless of n-3 PUFA supplementation. In addition, supplementation with EPA, DHA and E decreased levels of nitrite and nitrate. However, ALA had no antidepressant effect. The present study suggested that the antidepressant-like effects of EPA and DHA supplementation and E injection could be due to the regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission and inflammatory cytokines rather than due to the antioxidative system. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA and E had the additional function of modulating neurometabolites in the hippocampus.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Western diet provides low ALA and DHA, which is reflected in low DHA in maternal milk. Chia oil extracted from chia (Salvia hispanica L.), a plant native to some Latin American countries, is high in ALA (up to 60%) and thereby is an alternative to provide ALA with the aim to reduce DHA deficits. We evaluated the modification of the fatty  profile of milk obtained from Chilean mothers who received chia oil during gestation and nursing. Forty healthy pregnant women (22-35 years old) tabulated for food consumption, were randomly separated into two groups: a control group with normal feeding (n = 21) and a chia group (n = 19), which received 16 mL chia oil daily from the third trimester of pregnancy until the first six months of nursing. The fatty  profile of erythrocyte phospholipids, measured at six months of pregnancy, at time of delivery and at six months of nursing, and the fatty  profile of the milk collected during the first six months of nursing were assessed by gas-chromatography. The chia group, compared to the control group, showed (i) a significant increase in ALA ingestion and a significant reduction of linoleic  (LA) ingestion, no showing modification of arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and DHA; (ii) a significant increase of erythrocyte ALA and EPA and a reduction of LA. AA and DHA were not modified; (iii) a increased milk content of ALA during the six months of nursing, whereas LA showed a decrease. AA and EPA were not modified, however DHA increased only during the first three months of nursing. Consumption of chia oil during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first three months of nursing transiently increases the milk content of DHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832159>A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Delta-5 Desaturase Lowers Insulin Resistance and Reduces Body Weight in Diet-Induced Obese C57BL/6J Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is now recognized as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and is called as metabolic inflammation. Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to arachidonic  (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti-obesity effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily  expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D5D selective inhibitor, compound-326, will be a new class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388801>Microalgae Characterization for Consolidated and New Application in Human Food, Animal Feed and Nutraceuticals.</a></h2><p>The exploration of new food sources and natural products is the result of the increase in world population as well as the need for a healthier diet; in this context, microalgae are undoubtedly an interesting solution. With the intent to enhance their value in new commercial applications, this paper aims to characterize microalgae that have already been recognized as safe or authorized as additives for humans and animals (, , , ) as well as those that have not yet been marketed ( and  sp.). In this scope, the content of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, total dietary fiber, humidity, ash, and carotenoids has been measured via standard methods. In addition, individual carotenoids (beta-carotene, astaxanthin, and lutein) as well as individual saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been identified and quantified chromatographically. The results confirm the prerogative of some species to produce certain products such as carotenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and proteins, but also show how their cellular content is rich and diverse.  green and red phases, and  sp., in addition to producing astaxanthin and omega-3, contain about 25⁻33% / proteins on a dry basis.  is rich in beta-carotene (3.45% / on a dry basis),  is a source of lutein (0.30% / on a dry basis), and the  species is a protein-based microalgae (45% / on a dry basis). All, however, can also produce important fatty acids such as palmitic , γ-, and oleic . Considering their varied composition, these microalgae can find applications in multiple sectors. This is true for microalgae already on the market as well as for promising new sources of bioproducts such as  and  sp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170643>Acute effects of diets rich in almonds and walnuts on endothelial function.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, especially  (ALA), which are present in nuts may reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, by changing vascular inflammation and improving endothelial dysfunction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the acute effects of two different diets, one containing walnuts and the other almonds on endothelial function.Twenty-seven overweight volunteers underwent a randomized 2-period, crossover, controlled intervention study. The subjects were given either walnut or almond diets which varied in monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) content. The walnut diet provided 23.1%  from PUFA and the almond diet provided 7.6%  from PUFA. Endothelial function was assessed physiologically by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and biochemically by sVCAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules).The walnut diet significantly improved FMD (p=0.004) and decreased sVCAM (p=0.009) whereas the almond diet tended to improve FMD (p=0.06) and significantly decreased sVCAM (p=0.004).Both walnut and almond diets improved FMD and sVCAM and there was no significant difference in physiological and biochemical markers between the two diets.Copyright © 2018.

Participants consumed a standardized high calorie meal (~1330 kcal). Blood glucose and insulin were measured at fasting, and 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min postprandially. Additional blood samples were collected for the targeted analysis of amino acids (AAs) and derivatives, and fatty acids (FAs).The postprandial response (i.e., area under the curve, AUC) for serum glucose and insulin were similar between MHO and LH individuals, and significantly lower than MUO individuals (p < 0.05). Minor differences were found in postprandial responses for AAs between MHO and MUO individuals, while three polyunsaturated FAs (linoleic , γ-, arachidonic ) showed smaller changes in serum after the meal in MHO individuals compared to MUO. Fasting levels for various AAs (notably branched-chain AA) and FAs (e.g., saturated myristic and palmitic acids) were found to correlate with glucose and insulin AUC.MHO individuals show preserved insulin sensitivity and a greater ability to adapt to a caloric challenge compared to MUO individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25688288>Simultaneous improvement in production of microalgal biodiesel and high-value  by a single regulator acetylcholine.</a></h2><p>Photoautotrophic microalgae are a promising avenue for sustained biodiesel production, but are compromised by low yields of biomass and lipids at present. We are developing a chemical approach to improve microalgal accumulation of feedstock lipids as well as high-value  which in turn might provide a driving force for biodiesel production.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the small bioactive molecule "acetylcholine" on accumulation of biomass, total lipids, and  in Chlorella sorokiniana.

Moreover, the precursor and analogs of acetylcholine display increased effectiveness at higher applied doses, with maximal increases by 126, 80, and 60% over controls for biomass, total lipids, and , respectively. Production of calculated biodiesel was also improved by the precursor and analogs of acetylcholine. The biodiesel quality affected by changes in microalgal fatty  composition was addressed.The chemical approach described here could improve the lipid yield and biodiesel production of photoautotrophic microalgae if combined with current genetic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26230115>The European Hare (Lepus europaeus): A Picky Herbivore Searching for Plant Parts Rich in Fat.</a></h2><p>European hares of both sexes rely on fat reserves, particularly during the reproduc-tive season. Therefore, hares should select dietary plants rich in fat and . However, hares also require essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) to reproduce and survive. Although hares are able to absorb PUFA selectively in their gastrointestinal tract, it is unknown whether this mechanism is sufficient to guarantee PUFA supply. Thus, diet selection may involve a trade-off between a preference for  versus a preference for crucial nutrients, namely PUFA. We compared plant and nutrient availability and use by hares in an arable landscape in Austria over three years. We found that European hares selected their diet for high  content (crude fat and crude protein), and avoided crude fibre. There was no evidence of a preference for plants rich in LA and ALA. We conclude that fat is the limiting resource for this herbivorous mammal, whereas levels of LA and ALA in forage are sufficiently high to meet daily requirements, especially since their uptake is enhanced by physiological mechanisms. Animals selected several plant taxa all year round, and preferences did not simply correlate with crude fat content. Hence, European hares might not only select for plant taxa rich in fat, but also for high-fat parts of preferred plant taxa. As hares preferred weeds/grasses and various crop types while avoiding cereals, we suggest that promoting heterogeneous habitats with high crop diversity and set-asides may help stop the decline of European hares throughout Europe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512534>Chilliness in Japanese middle-aged women is associated with anxiety and low n-3 fatty  intake.</a></h2><p> This cross-sectional study investigated chilliness, which is the most prevalent sexual-vasomotor symptom in middle-aged Japanese women.  First-visit records of 475 Japanese women (age 40-65 years) enrolled in the health and nutrition education program at a menopause clinic were analyzed. Chilliness was estimated based on responses to the Menopausal Symptom Scale. Effects of age, menopausal status, body composition, cardiovascular parameters, resting  expenditure, physical fitness, menopausal symptoms, lifestyle, and estimated daily intake of nutrients were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Severe chilliness was found in 28.4% of women. It was not related to age, menopausal status, body mass index, or body fat percentage. The anxiety subscale score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was the sole background characteristic independently associated with severe chilliness (adjusted odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.15 per point). Daily intakes of vitamin D and n-3 fatty acids were significantly lower in women with severe chilliness. Daily intake of n-3 fatty acids was negatively associated with severe chilliness after adjustment (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.95 per g/1000 kcal intake).

PPARγ receptor is found to play a crucial role in the modulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis. Its commotion has been reported to play a significant role in a broad spectrum of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and in some cancers. Hence, PPARγ is an important therapeutic target. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites (henceforth referred to as bioactive lipids) are known to function as agonists of PPARγ. However, agonistic binding modes and affinity of these ligands to PPARγ are yet to be deciphered.In this study, we performed a comparative molecular docking, binding free  calculation and molecular dynamics simulation to infer and rank bioactive lipids based on the binding affinities with the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPARγ.The results inferred affinity in the order of resolvin E1 > neuroprotectin D1 > hydroxy-linoleic  > docosahexaenoic  > lipoxin A4 > gamma-, arachidonic  >  > eicosapentaenoic  > linoleic . Of all the bioactive lipids studied, resolvin E1, neuroprotectin D1 and hydroxy-linoleic  showed significant affinity comparable to proven PPARγ agonist namely, rosiglitazone, in terms of Glide XP docking score, H-bond formation with the key residues, binding free  and stable complex formation with LBD favouring co-activator binding, as inferred through Molecular Dynamics trajectory analysis.Hence, these three bioactive lipids (resolvin E1, neuroprotectin D1 and hydroxy-linoleic ) may be favourably considered as ideal drug candidates in therapeutic modulation of clinical conditions such as type 2 DM, Alzheimer's disease and other instances where PPARγ is a key player.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103929>Intra-individual variability of long-chain fatty acids (C12-C24) in plasma and red blood cells.</a></h2><p>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) play key roles in mammalian cells as sources of , structural components and signaling molecules. Given their importance in numerous physiological processes, the roles of LCFAs in health and disease have been extensively investigated. In the majority of studies, correlations are established using a single measurement in plasma or red blood cells (RBCs). Although a few studies have reported on reproducibility of individual fatty  measurements, the comprehensive analysis of intra-individual LCFA variability has not been performed. Therefore, our goal was to determine intra-individual variability for the 22 most abundant LCFAs in both plasma and RBC samples collected from healthy individuals on a regular diet after overnight fasting. The measurements of LCFAs in RBCs were consistent throughout the course of study reflecting long-term nutritional status. In contrast, the results in plasma showed considerable LCFA intra-individual variability, even between fatty acids of the same type. Plasma intra-individual variability for omega-3  and eicosapentaenoic acids in some participants were >40% whereas the variability of docosahexaenoic  was consistently <12.8%. Omega-6 linoleic and arachidonic acids also showed low variability in plasma. The results suggest that some LCFAs have less variability and would be more reliable as biomarkers. Reliability of biomarkers can have a profound impact on the research outcomes. Intra-individual variability of LCFAs should be taken into consideration in designing, conducting and interpreting results of clinical studies.Copyright © 2018.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100% oxygen inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs: palmitic  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05),  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Human milk composition among lactating women in Latvia, as well as the maternal diet during lactation, has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this research was to assess dietary habits and macronutrient intake among lactating women in Latvia and to examine the effect of diet on human milk composition. : Research was conducted between November 2016 and December 2017. Mature human milk samples ( = 61) along with a 72h food diary, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a questionnaire about maternal and infant characteristics were obtained from voluntary women who were recruited via an invitation published in a social media member group for nursing mothers. Fat content in human milk was determined by LVS ISO 2446:2008, protein content was determined by LVS EN ISO 8968-1:2014, lactose was determined by ISO 22662:2007, and the fatty  profile was analyzed using gas chromatography. Dietary data were evaluated using the Finnish food composition database Fineli, release 19 (3 March 2018). : Median values for fat, protein, and lactose in mature human milk were 4.40%, 1.08%, and 6.52%, respectively. Predominant fatty acids in human milk were oleic  (C18:1 n9), palmitic  (C16:0), and linoleic  (C18:2 n6) at 34.60%, 24.00%, and 11.00% of total fatty acids, respectively. The  elaidic  (C18:1 n9) level was <0.10% in all human milk samples. Significant, positive associations ( < 0.05) were found between maternal dietary intake of linoleic, α-, docosahexaenoic, total -monounsaturated, total -polyunsaturated, and total n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the ratio of n-6/n-3, and the level of these fatty acids in human milk. Total  and carbohydrate intake among participants were lower, but total fat, saturated fat, and sugar intake were higher than recommended. Protein, linoleic , and α- intake were adequate, but docosahexaenoic  intake was noticeably lower than recommended. Women should be supported with information regarding their nutritional needs during lactation and the possible impact of diet on human milk composition. : Macronutrient (fat, protein, and lactose) content in human milk is not affected by maternal diet. Conversely, the human milk fatty  profile is affected by the immediate diet consumed by the mother.

After multivariate adjustment, intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was associated with a lower cardiovascular disease mortality, compared with total carbohydrates: hazard ratios comparing the highest with the lowest quarter were 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.99; P for trend=0.03) for total PUFAs, 0.69 (0.52 to 0.90; P=0.007) for marine n-3 PUFAs, 1.13 (0.85 to 1.51) for α-, and 0.75 (0.56 to 1.01) for linoleic . Inverse associations with total mortality were also observed for intakes of total PUFAs, n-3 PUFAs, and linoleic , whereas monounsaturated fatty acids of animal, but not plant, origin were associated with a higher total mortality. In models that examined the theoretical effects of substituting PUFAs for other fats, isocalorically replacing 2% of  from saturated fatty acids with total PUFAs or linoleic  was associated with 13% (hazard ratio 0.87, 0.77 to 0.99) or 15% (0.85, 0.73 to 0.99) lower cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively. A 2% replacement of  from saturated fatty acids with total PUFAs was associated with 12% (hazard ratio 0.88, 0.83 to 0.94) lower total mortality.In patients with type 2 diabetes, higher intake of PUFAs, in comparison with carbohydrates or saturated fatty acids, is associated with lower total mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality. These findings highlight the important role of quality of dietary fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and total mortality among adults with type 2 diabetes.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Glycolysis provides both cellular  and the intermediates for other biosynthetic processes. However, nothing was known about the molecular basis of the glycolytic pathway in E. ulmoides kernels. The purposes of this study were to identify novel genes of E. ulmoides related to glycolytic metabolism and to analyze the expression patterns of selected genes in the kernels. Transcriptome sequencing based on the Illumina platform generated 96,469 unigenes in four cDNA libraries constructed using RNAs from 70 and 160 days after flowering kernels of both low- and high-ALA varieties. We identified and characterized the digital expression of 120 unigenes coding for 24 protein families involved in kernel glycolytic pathway. The expression levels of glycolytic genes were generally higher in younger kernels than in more mature kernels. Importantly, several unigenes from kernels of the high-ALA variety were expressed more than those from the low-ALA variety. The expression of 10 unigenes encoding key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway was validated by qPCR using RNAs from six kernel stages of each variety. The qPCR data were well consistent with their digital expression in transcriptomic analyses. This study identified a comprehensive set of genes for glycolytic metabolism and suggests that several glycolytic genes may play key roles in ALA accumulation in the kernels of E. ulmoides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822538>Effects of diet containing flaxseed flour (Linum usitatissimum) on body adiposity and bone health in young male rats.</a></h2><p>Flaxseed flour has been described as an excellent  source. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of flaxseed flour on body adiposity and bone health in rats fed a flaxseed flour diet during lactation until 90 days. At birth, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control (C) and experimental (FF) groups, whose dams were treated with a control or flaxseed flour diet, respectively, during lactation. At 21 days, pups were weaned and fed a control and experimental diet until 90 days. Food intake, body mass and length were evaluated during a 21-90 day period. At 90 days, composition by dual- X-ray absorptiometry, serum hormonal profile, intra-abdominal fat mass, and lumbar vertebra and femur analyses was determined. Differences were deemed significant at p < 0.05. The FF group displayed the following (P < 0.05): a higher total lean mass (+7%), a lower total (-16%) and intra-abdominal (-24%) fat mass, a smaller adipocyte area (-30%), a higher femoral mass (+5%), bone mineral density (+5%) and radiodensity (+20%), and a higher maximum force (+10%) and breaking strength (+11%). The flaxseed flour diet displayed functional properties related to body growth maintenance associated with a lower risk of developing metabolic alterations, obesity and bone fragility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423734>Higher Intakes of Fruits and Vegetables, β-Carotene, Vitamin C, α-Tocopherol, EPA, and DHA Are Positively Associated with Periodontal Healing after Nonsurgical Periodontal Therapy in Nonsmokers but Not in Smokers.</a></h2><p>Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and a significant risk factor for tooth loss. Although a link between diet and periodontal health exists, the relation between diet and healing after periodontal therapy has yet to be investigated.The objective was to determine whether higher intakes of fruits and vegetables or nutrients with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity are associated with greater healing, measured as reduced probing depth (PD), after scaling and root planing (SRP), a cost-effective treatment to manage periodontal disease and prevent tooth loss.Patients (63 nonsmokers, 23 smokers) with chronic generalized periodontitis who were undergoing SRP participated. Healing was evaluated based on PD, assessed at baseline and 8-16 wk after SRP. Intakes of fruits, vegetables, β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol, α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were estimated using the Block 2005 food frequency questionnaire and a supplement questionnaire. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were also measured. PD (% sites >3 mm) was modeled in multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance by tertile of intake and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), baseline PD, examiner, gingival bleeding, and study duration.In nonsmokers, PD was associated with fruit and vegetable, β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol, EPA, and DHA intakes (P < 0.05). PD was not significantly associated with ALA intake or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Significant associations that included supplements (β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol) were attenuated or lost, depending on the statistical model used. There were no significant associations within the group of smokers.Dietary intakes of fruits and vegetables, β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol, EPA, and DHA are associated with reduced PD after SRP in nonsmokers, but not smokers, with chronic generalized periodontitis. These findings may lead to the development of dietary strategies to optimize healing after periodontal procedures.

Walnuts are a sustainable source of -3 PUFA. We investigated whether inclusion of walnuts (15% of ) in the diet for 2 years would maintain LTL in cognitively healthy elders (63⁻79 years old) compared to a control group (habitual diet, abstaining from walnuts). This opportunistic sub-study was conducted within the Walnuts and Healthy Aging study, a dual-centre (Barcelona, Spain and Loma Linda University, California) parallel trial. A sub-set of the Barcelona site participants were randomly assigned to the walnut ( = 80) or control group ( = 69). We assessed LTL at baseline and at 2 years and we conducted repeated-measures ANCOVA with 2 factors: time (baseline, 2 years) and group (control, walnut) and their interaction. Adjusted means (95% confidence interval) of LTL (in kb) in controls were 7.360 (7.084,7.636) at baseline and 7.061 (6.835,7.288) after 2 years; corresponding values in the walnut group were 7.064 (6.807,7.320) and 7.074 (6.864,7.284). The time × intervention interaction was nearly significant ( = 0.079), suggestive of a trend of walnut consumption in preserving LTL. This exploratory research finding should be confirmed in trials with adequate statistical power.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26275932>Fish oil and flax seed oil supplemented diets increase FFAR4 expression in the rat colon.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, such as α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that have long been associated with anti-inflammatory activity and general benefit toward human health. Over the last decade, the identification of a family of cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors that bind and are activated by free-fatty acids, including omega-3 fatty acids, suggest that many effects of PUFA are receptor-mediated. One such receptor, free-fatty  receptor-4 (FFAR4), previously described as GPR120, has been shown to modulate anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects in response to PUFA such as ALA and DHA. Additionally, FFAR4 stimulates secretion of the insulin secretagogue glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the GI tract and acts as a dietary sensor to regulate  availability. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of dietary omega-3 fatty  supplementation on FFAR4 expression in the rat colon.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed control soybean oil diets or alternatively, diets supplemented with either fish oil, which is enriched in DHA and EPA, or flaxseed oil, which is enriched in ALA, for 7 weeks. GLP-1 and blood glucose levels were monitored weekly and at the end of the study period, expression of FFAR4 and the inflammatory marker TNF-α was assessed.Our findings indicate that GLP-1 and blood glucose levels were unaffected by omega-3 fatty  supplementation, however, animals that were fed fish or flaxseed oil-supplemented diets had significantly heightened colonic FFAR4 and actin expression, and reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α compared to animals fed control diets.These results suggest that similar to ingestion of other fats, dietary-intake of omega-3 fatty acids can alter FFAR4 expression within the colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27288598>The fatty  profile of rainbow trout liver cells modulates their tolerance to methylmercury and cadmium.</a></h2><p>The polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) composition of fish tissues, which generally reflects that of the diet, affects various cellular properties such as membrane structure and fluidity,  metabolism and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Since these cellular parameters can play an important role in the cellular response to organic and inorganic pollutants, a variation of the PUFA supply might modify the toxicity induced by such xenobiotics. In this work, we investigated whether the cellular fatty  profile has an impact on the in vitro cell sensitivity to two environmental pollutants: methylmercury and cadmium. Firstly, the fatty  composition of the rainbow trout liver cell line RTL-W1 was modified by enriching the growth medium with either  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6), arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6) or docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-6). These modified cells and their control (no PUFA enrichment) were then challenged for 24h with increasing concentrations of methylmercury or cadmium. We observed that (i) the phospholipid composition of the RTL-W1 cells was profoundly modulated by changing the PUFA content of the growth medium: major modifications were a high incorporation of the supplemented PUFA in the cellular phospholipids, the appearance of direct elongation and desaturation metabolites in the cellular phospholipids as well as a change in the gross phospholipid composition (PUFA and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) levels and n-3/n-6 ratio); (ii) ALA, EPA and DPA enrichment significantly protected the RTL-W1 cells against both methylmercury and cadmium; (iv) DHA enrichment significantly protected the cells against cadmium but not methylmercury; (v) AA and LA enrichment had no impact on the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium; (vi) the abundance of 20:3n-6, a metabolite of the n-6 biotransformation pathway, in phospholipids was negatively correlated to the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium. Overall, our results highlighted the importance of the fatty  supply on the tolerance of fish liver cells to methylmercury and cadmium.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Regrettably, dietary variety and quality are known to decline with advancing age. We conducted a 2-year prospective, randomised, dietary intervention trial where we asked free-living elderly subjects (63-79 years) on self-selected habitual diets to incorporate walnuts daily into their diet (15 % ). We then compared their nutrient intake with that of a similar group of concurrent participants on self-selected habitual diets but abstaining from walnut consumption (control). No recipes or advice on use of nuts were provided. Dietary intake was assessed by multiple unannounced 24-h telephone dietary recalls. On average, walnut supplement consumption was 43 g/d or 1171·5 kJ (281 kcal). The mean daily  intake was 954 kJ (228 kcal) higher in the walnut group than in the control group (P<0·001). Compared with control, participants in the walnut group reported significantly higher intake of total protein, vegetable protein, total PUFA and n-3 and n-6 PUFA; and significantly lower intake of total carbohydrate, animal protein, SFA, and Na. An estimated 19 % of total  and 25 % of total fat from other food sources was displaced. Displacement of MUFA and total PUFA was 21 and 16 %, respectively. Thus adding a daily supplement of walnuts to an ad libitum diet of older adults can induce favourable modifications to the nutrient profile in a way that addresses declining nutrient intake associated with aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882592>Polyunsaturated fatty acids induce ovarian cancer cell death through ROS-dependent MAP kinase activation.</a></h2><p>Free fatty acids not only play a role in cell membrane construction and  production but also exert diverse cellular effects through receptor and non-receptor mechanisms. Moreover, epidemiological and clinical studies have so far suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could have health benefits and the advantage as therapeutic use in cancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms of PUFA-induced cellular effects remained to be cleared. Here, we examined the effects of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs on cell death in ovarian cancer cell lines. ω-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and ω-6 PUFA, γ- (γ-LNA) induced cell death in KF28 cells at the levels of physiological concentrations, but not HAC2 cells. Pharmacological and biochemical analyses demonstrated that cell death induced by DHA and γ-LNA was correlated with activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinases, and further an upstream MAP kinase kinase, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, which is stimulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, an antioxidant vitamin E attenuated PUFA-induced cell death and MAP kinase activation. These findings indicate that PUFA-induced cell death involves ROS-dependent MAP kinase activation and is a cell type-specific action. A further study of the underlying mechanisms for ROS-dependent cell death induced by PUFAs will lead to the discovery of a new target for cancer therapy or diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on insulin sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during  restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (oleic , OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-, ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then  restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v. insulin injection. All -restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by  restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively). RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation levels increased in the LC-R group (+70 %), together with insulin receptor mRNA (+50 %). The ALA-R group showed the same overall activation pattern as the LC-R group, although to a lesser extent. In conclusion, dietary n-3 PUFA prevent the loss of muscle mass associated with  restriction, probably by an improvement in the insulin-signalling pathway activation, in relation to enrichment of plasma membranes in n-3 LC-PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871233>Fat Quantity and Quality, as Part of a Low-Fat, Vegan Diet, Are Associated with Changes in Body Composition, Insulin Resistance, and Insulin Secretion. A 16-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Macronutrient composition of the diet influences the development of obesity and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the role of dietary fat quantity and fatty  composition in body composition, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. An open parallel randomized trial design was used. Overweight participants ( = 75) were randomized to follow a low-fat vegan ( = 38) or control diet ( = 37) for 16 weeks. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure body composition. Insulin resistance was assessed with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index. Insulin secretion was assessed after stimulation with a liquid breakfast (Boost Plus, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland). Self-reported 3-day diet records were used to assess dietary intake. A linear regression model was used to test the relationship between fat intake and body composition, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. Changes in fat intake expressed as percent of total  consumed correlated positively with changes in fat mass ( = 0.52;  < 0.001; and 0.347;  = 0.006, respectively), even after adjustment for changes in body-mass index (BMI) and  intake (0.33;  = 0.01). Decreased intakes of C18:0 ( = 0.37,  = 0.004) and CLA-trans-10-cis12 ( = 0.40,  = 0.002), but increased intake of C18:2 ( = -0.40,  = 0.002) and C18:3 ( = -0.36,  = 0.006), were associated with a decrease in HOMA-IR, independent on changes in BMI and  intake. The main fatty acids associated with changes in fasting insulin secretion were C12:0 ( = -0.31,  = 0.03), and TRANS 16:1 ( = -0.33,  = 0.02), both independent on changes in BMI and  intake. Our findings demonstrate that, in the context of a low-fat vegan diet, decreased intake of saturated and trans fats and increased relative content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic and α- acids, are associated with decreased fat mass and insulin resistance, and enhanced insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29522430>-Protein Supplementation and Lactation Affect Fatty  Profile of Liver and Adipose Tissue of Dairy Cows.</a></h2><p>This article addresses the hypothesis that lactation stage, parity and -protein feed additive affect fatty  composition of blood, liver and adipose tissue of cows. The experiment was conducted on 24 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows divided into two feeding groups. One group of cows was fed solely a total mixed ration, while the other group was fed a ration with the addition of 2 kg of -protein supplement per cow/day. During the experiment, the samples of liver, adipose tissue and blood were taken and their fatty  compositions were determined. Analysis of variance was applied to fatty  relative weight percentage to determine the effect of the stage of lactation, parity, and -protein supplement on the fatty  composition of the tissues. Stage of lactation had a significant impact on the content of many fatty acids in all examined tissues. We found that parity had no effect on fatty  composition of blood, whereas it significantly affected C16:1 9 in liver, and C16:1 9 and C18:0 in adipose tissue. -protein supplement significantly affected the content of most fatty acids in blood (e.g., C18:1 11 and C18:3 n-3) and liver (C18:3 n-3, both isomers of conjugated  and n-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil), but it did not affect the profile of the adipose tissue of cows. According to our best knowledge, this is the first study showing the relationship between parity, stage of lactation and the composition of fatty acids in blood, liver and adipose tissue of cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25787691>Dietary linoleic  requirements in the presence of α- are lower than the historical 2 % of  intake value, study in rats.</a></h2><p>Previous studies on rats and human subjects have established that the linoleic  (LA) requirement is 2 % of the total  intake (en%), but is obtained in the absence of α- (ALA) and consequently appear to be overestimated. This raises questions since a recent study including ALA has suggested to divide the historical value by four. However, this recent study has remained inconclusive because the animals used were not totally LA-deficient animals. For the first time, the present study was especially designed using physiological and biochemical markers and performed in two steps: (1) to achieve a specific n-6 fatty  deficiency model using growing male rats fed either a 0 en% from LA/0 en% from ALA (0LA/0ALA), 0LA/0·5ALA or 2LA/0·5ALA diet, born from female rats fed a 0LA/0·5ALA diet; and (2) to refine the required level of LA in the presence of ALA using rats fed either a 0LA/0ALA, 0·5LA/0·5ALA, 1LA/0·5ALA, 1·5LA/0·5ALA diet, born from female rats fed a 0LA/0·5ALA diet. The first step shows that the best LA deficiency model was obtained using rats fed the 0LA/0ALA diet, born from female rats fed the 0LA/0·5ALA diet. The second step demonstrates that in growing rats, LA deficiency was corrected with an intake of 1-1·5 en% from LA and 0·5 en% from ALA. These data suggest that the requirements in humans should be revisited, considering the presence of ALA to set up the recommendation for LA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034953>Anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of Dan-Lou tablets in the treatment of coronary heart disease revealed by metabolomics integrated with molecular mechanism studies.</a></h2><p>The Dan-Lou tablet (DLT), a well-known Chinese prescription, has definitive clinical efficacy in the treatment of precordial discomfort and pain caused by coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the pharmacological mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD has not been clearly elucidated and needs to be further explored.We aimed to identify relevant biological pathways by assessing changes in biomarkers in response to DLT intervention in CHD to reveal the potential biological mechanism of DLT treatment for CHD.The major chemical components in DLT were qualitatively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), and a model of CHD in rats was subsequently established with a high-fat diet and left anterior coronary artery ligation (LADCA) followed by DLT intervention. Next, the metabolic profile of rat serum samples was analyzed using nontargeted metabolomics, wherein changes in the metabolites in serum samples before and after DLT administration were measured by PLS-DA, and two pathways of DLT treatment for CHD were predicted. Finally, predicted metabolomic pathways were verified by detecting and analyzing tissues from the rat model, revealing the mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD.Forty-five major chemical components were identified by the chemical characterization of DLT. In terms of metabolism, 17 biomarkers of CHD in rats were identified. Among these biomarkers, linoleic , γ- and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were found to play an important role in  metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Protein analysis revealed that EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in CHD rats after DLT treatment, which lowered the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP9, decreased the expression levels of ox-LDL and MDA, and increased the expression of SOD.The mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD involves inhibiting the expression of EGFR and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism (LPCs) and  metabolism (linoleic  and γ-). Therefore, inflammation-related (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9) and oxidative stress-related (ox-LDL, MDA, SOD) indicators are affected, leading to the regulation of the oxidative stress state and anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we employed metabolomics to determine the serum metabolites in the baseline associated with an increased risk of PD.Two hundred and nine elderly hip-fracture patients who had undergone hemiarthroplasty and had completed our assessments were selected. Fasting venous blood was collected at 7:00 on the morning of surgery and a serum sample bank was created for analysis. On the first 3 postoperative days, the patients were assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method - Chinese Revision. Ultimately, 43 patients were diagnosed with PD, who comprised the PD group. Meanwhile, 43 matched non-PD patients were selected based on age, sex, and body mass index. Serum samples from the two groups were analyzed by gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.The demographic characteristics of the groups were matched. Four metabolites associated with an increased risk of PD were identified, including S-methylcysteine, , eicosapentaenoic , and linoleic .Multiple metabolic pathways in the PD group altered before surgery, including deficiency of ω3 and ω6 fatty acids,  metabolism and oxidative stress with interactions between hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction, in addition to glutamate-glutamine cycle dysfunction. These metabolic abnormalities could possibly increase the fragility of the brain and then contribute to PD.© The Author 2017.

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) provides the staple food with serving as main source of  and protein. Germination of sorghum generally increases the nutritive value of seeds and the effects of germination on lipids composition of seeds vary greatly with processing conditions. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the effect of emerging processing techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) on fatty acids composition and oil yield of sorghum seeds before and after germination.Initially sorghum grains were soaked with 5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) for surface sterilization. Afterwards, grains were soaked in excess water for 22 h at room temperature and were divided into four portions. The first portion (100 g grains) was subjected to germination without applying any microwave and ultrasonic treatment (T). Second portion was further divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and grains were subjected to ultrasonic treatments using two different ultrasonic intensities (US: 40%; US: 60%) within range of 0-100% and with two different time durations (t: 5 min; t: 10 min) at constant temperature. Third portion was also divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and exposed to microwave treatments at two different power levels (MW: 450 watt; MW: 700 watt) within the range of 100-900 W for two different time durations (t: 15 s; t: 30s). Similarly, fourth portion was divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group). Each group was exposed to both MW (MW, MW) (100-900 watt power) & US (US, US) (0-100% intensity) treatments at two different time levels (t, t). Then, germination was carried out and pre-treated raw and pre-treated germinated sorghum grains were analyzed for total oil yield, fatty  composition and unsaturated fatty acids (Un-SFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio by gas chromatography.The results revealed that oil yield in sorghum before and after germination ranged from 6.55 to 7.84% and 6.28 to 7.57%, respectively. All the microwave and ultrasound processed samples showed significant difference in oil yield than the raw sorghum grains. The highest tested yield was 7.84 ± 0.31% when combination of microwave power (700 W) and ultrasound intensity (60%) was applied for 30s and 10 min, respectively. The results further demonstrate that the raw sorghum contained palmitic (13.73 ± 0.10%), palmitoleic (0.43 ± 0.02%), stearic (1.07 ± 0.04%), oleic (37.15 ± 0.10%), linoleic (43.33 ± 0.21%),  (1.55 ± 0.04%), arachidic  (0.13 ± 0.01%) and eicosenoic  (0.37 ± 0.02%), respectively. The highest fatty  percentage for palmitic, stearic and arachidic  was 13.75 ± 0.07%, 1.11 ± 0.09% and 0.15 ± 0.03% at 60% US intensity for 10 min (T), respectively. Maximum amount observed was 1.60 ± 0.09% of  while amount of eicosenoic  decreased from 0.37 ± 0.02% to 0.31 ± 0.01% after processing. In case of applying combination of microwave and sonication treatments, the change in eicosenoic  increased from 0.35 ± 0.02% to 0.40 ± 0.04% while there was no significant change in other fatty acids. The ungerminated sorghum oil possessed 14.93-15.05% and 82.83-83.12% of SFA and Un-SFA, respectively. After germination, percentage of saturated fatty acids increased (16.4-16.55%) while decreased for unsaturated fatty acids (80.13-80.56%) were noted.The results of the present study conclude that the yield of oil from sorghum grains increased by emerging processing. Fatty  analysis of sorghum oil suggested that pre-treatment strategies will not affect the quality of the oil with respect to essential fatty acids content. Overall, the composition of saturated fatty  in germinated grain is improved than ungerminated grains after processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658332>Microalgal lipids production and nutrients recovery from landfill leachate using membrane photobioreactor.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to realize high-efficiency nutrients recovery from landfill leachate (LL) for microalgal lipids production. Negative effects of LL on microalgal lipid synthesis was revealed and a scalable membrane-based tubular photobioreactor (SM-PBR) was proposed to offset these negative effects. Microalgal biomass concentration was improved from 0 g/L in the traditional PBR to 2.13 g/L in the SM-PBR. Major operating conditions were optimized to enhance nutrients recovery and lipid productivity. The maximum N recovery efficiency of 74.31% and the maximum daily lipid production of 404.98 mg/d were obtained under the volume ratio of 5:3 (microalgae culture/LL stream) and phosphate feeding concentration of 50 mg/L. The obtained lipid was convinced to have a good combustion and anti-degradation property, with high cetane number (>52%) and low  content (<12%).

The current meta-analysis and meta-regression was undertaken to assess the overall effect of different forms of flax, as a source of trienoic (cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3) fatty acids (FA), on lactation performance and on transfer efficiency of its constituent n-3 FA from diet to milk fat. Comparisons were first conducted with nonsupplemented controls or with diets containing either saturated (mainly 16:0 or 18:0 or both), monoenoic (mainly cis-9 18:1), or dienoic (mainly cis-9,cis-12 18:2) FA. Results indicate that supplementing flax seed and oil decreased dry matter intake, as well as actual and -corrected milk yield without affecting the efficiency of utilization of dietary dry matter or  as compared with nonsupplemented iso-energetic controls. When compared with the other 3 types of dietary fat evaluated, flax rich in trienoic FA supported a yield of -corrected milk similar to supplements rich in saturated, monoenoic, or dienoic FA. Greater milk fat concentration and feed efficiency were observed with saturated supplements. However, milk fat concentration and yield were lower with dienoic FA than with flax supplements. Further analyses were conducted to compare the effect of different forms of flax oil, seed, or fractions of seed. Among the 6 categories evaluated, mechanically processed whole seed (rolled or ground) allowed the greatest yield of -corrected milk and the best feed efficiency when compared with free oil, intact or extruded whole seed, protected flax, and flax hulls. Feeding protected flax and flax hulls allowed the greatest milk fat concentration of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3. Moreover, the greatest transfer efficiencies of this fatty  from diet to milk were recorded with the same 2 treatments, plus the mechanically processed whole seed. These results make this last category the most suitable treatment, among the 6 flax forms evaluated, to combine optimum lactation performance and protection of flax constituent cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3.The Authors.

While evidence suggests that high PUFA intake can impact hypothalamic activity, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulated by essential dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA (i.e., linoleic  and α-, respectively) remain poorly described in this brain region. To differentiate the roles of essential dietary PUFA on hypothalamic function, we fed male rats high-fat diets (35% kcal/d) containing either safflower (linoleic ) or flaxseed (α-) oil for 2 months. Control rats were fed a low-fat (16% kcal/d) diet containing soybean oil. Hypothalamic fatty acids and gene expression were investigated by gas chromatography and microarray, respectively. Safflower-fed rats had higher total n-6 PUFA content due to increases in linoleic , arachidonic , and osbond  compared to the other diet groups, while flaxseed-fed rats had higher total n-3 content due to increases in α-, eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . Safflower-fed rats showed augmented expression of genes related to hypothalamic insulin signalling compared to controls. This was mirrored by significant increases in phosphorylated AKT and AKT levels; indicative of increased PI(3)K/AKT pathway activity. These changes were not observed in the hypothalamus of flaxseed-fed rats. Our findings provide new molecular insights into how essential fatty acids influence the hypothalamus and, potentially, whole-body  homeostasis. This work also provides new knowledge to better understand the impact of essential fatty acids on metabolic and behavioral phenotypes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, we examined whether polymorphisms of FADS1 and FADS2 are associated with these changes.Postmenopausal women (the mean age: 60.5 ± 5.0 y) were randomized for 16 weeks to two different calorie-restricted diets: a Central European diet (CED) or a Mediterranean diet (MED).After the intervention, levels of most FAs in red blood cells decreased in both groups. The delta values for the 20:1n-9 and the 20:2n-6 levels differed between the CED and the MED (-1.55 ± 4.02 μg/mL vs 0.39 ± 4.11 μg/mL and -0.62 ± 10.93 μg/mL vs 3.06 ± 8.75 μg/mL; P < 0.05). Women in the CED group with at least one minor allele of FADS genes had greater decreases of α-, dihomo-γ-, total n-6, and total PUFA (by approximately 70%, 40%, 35%, and 35%, respectively) than did women with the major alleles. After the intervention, the change in the lipid accumulation product index was -28.28 ± 27.84 and -32.00 ± 78.55 in the CED and the MED group, respectively.The effect of the dietary intervention on FA metabolism seems to depend mostly on calorie restriction, but not on type of diet.

Concerns about high intake of n - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are based on the premise that endogenous conversion from linoleic  (LA; 18:2 n - 6) is an important source of AA, but few population-based studies have investigated dietary determinants of AA status. In this study, we examined habitual food consumption in relation to plasma concentrations of AA and other PUFAs in population-based studies. We used cross-sectional data from 269 healthy, ethnic Chinese participants (25-80 years old) with contrasting intakes of fish and red meat from the Singapore Prospective Study Program and 769 healthy participants (44-74 years old) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study as a validation set. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine PUFA intake (% ) and food sources of PUFA (fish, red meat, poultry, soy and cooking oils) in relation to plasma PUFAs (AA, LA, dihomo-gamma- (DGLA; 20:3 n - 6),  (ALA; 18:3 n - 3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5 n - 3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 n - 3)) concentrations. Higher intake of red meat was associated with higher plasma AA concentrations. High intake of PUFA or PUFA-rich oils was associated with higher plasma ALA but not with plasma AA. Higher intakes of soy were associated with higher ALA and fish with higher DHA and EPA concentrations. These associations were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in both studies. Red meat consumption, but not PUFA or PUFA-rich cooking oil, was associated with circulating AA suggesting that intake of pre-formed AA rather than LA is an important determinant of AA status. A diet high in fish, soy products and polyunsaturated cooking oil, and low in red meat may be associated with an optimal plasma profile of PUFA in this Chinese population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304057>Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  dietary intake is positively associated with bone mineral density in normal and osteopenic Spanish women.</a></h2><p>The regular consumption of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCO3-PUFAs) results in general health benefits. The intake of LCO3-PUFAs has been reported to contribute to bone metabolism. We aimed to investigate the relationships between dietary intakes of LCO3-PUFAs and bone mineral density (BMD) in Spanish women aged 20-79 years old. A total of 1865 female subjects (20-79 years old) were enrolled, and lumbar (L2, L3, L3 and total spine), hip (femoral neck (FN), femoral trochanter (FT) and Ward's triangle (WT)) bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Dietary intakes of total , calcium, vitamin D,  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and n-6 fatty acids (linoleic  (LA) and arachidonic  (AA)) were assessed by a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Spearman's rank correlations between LCO3-PUFAs and BMD were estimated. Partial correlations controlling for age, weight, height, dietary calcium, vitamin D, menopausal status and  were calculated. A multiple regression analysis was computed to assess significant associations with BMD in this population. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, there were positive correlations between ALA, EPA and DHA intake and BMD. According to the WHO diagnosis criteria for osteoporosis, in this population of normal and osteopenic women, the dietary intake of ALA was also significantly associated with BMD at the hip. In normal women, the dietary intake of DHA was also significantly associated with BMD at the lumbar spine. No significant associations between LCO3-PUFAs and BMD were detected in the lumbar spine of osteopenic or osteoporotic women. The dietary intake of LCO3-PUFAs was positively associated with BMD in Spanish women at both the hips and the lumbar spine. We highlight that the intake of LCO3-PUFAs is not significantly associated with BMD in osteoporotic women; however, the intake of LCO3-PUFAs seems to be positively associated with BMD at both the hips and the lumbar spine in normal and osteopenic women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108729>Comparative omega-3 fatty  enrichment of egg yolks from first-cycle laying hens fed flaxseed oil or ground flaxseed.</a></h2><p>When laying hen diets are enriched with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to generate value-added eggs for human consumption markets, concentrations of  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) in the yolk can reach 250 mg/50 g whole egg. Flaxseed, a rich source of ALA, is commonly used for omega-3 enrichment; however, the impact of dietary flaxseed source (extracted oil vs. milled seed) on fatty  transfer to egg yolk in laying hens is unknown. Therefore, transfer of ALA, EPA, and DHA into egg yolk from extracted flaxseed oil or milled flaxseed was evaluated in Hy-Line W-36 laying hens over an 8-week feeding period (25 to 33 wk old). Hens (n = 132) were randomly housed with 3 birds/cage (4 replicates/treatment) for each of the 11 treatment groups. Diets were isocaloric and consisted of a control diet, 5 flaxseed oil diets (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 5.0% flaxseed oil), and 5 milled flaxseed diets (calculated flaxseed oil concentration from milled flaxseed 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0%). Increasing dietary concentrations of flaxseed oil and milled flaxseed resulted in increased ALA, EPA, and DHA concentration in egg yolk, and fatty  deposition from flaxseed oil was 2 times greater compared to milled flaxseed when fed at the same dietary inclusions (P < 0.01). Egg yolk EPA and DHA concentrations were not different due to oil or milled source (P = 0.21); however, increasing dietary inclusion rates of flaxseed oil from either source increased yolk EPA and DHA (P < 0.01). Hens fed either flaxseed oil or milled flaxseed resulted in reduced BW change as dietary concentrations increased (P = 0.02). Feed efficiency increased as flaxseed oil increased in concentration, while feeding milled flaxseed decreased feed efficiency (P = 0.01). Analysis of the nitrogen corrected apparent metabolizable  of flaxseed oil resulted in 7,488 kcal/kg on an as-fed basis. Dietary flaxseed oil improved feed efficiency and increased ALA deposition into yolk compared to a milled source, demonstrating flaxseed oil to be a viable alternative for ALA egg enrichment.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29384333>Intake ratio and major food sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in Korea: a study based on the sixth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey (2013-2014).</a></h2><p>In addition to the intake ratio of omega 6 (n-6) to omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids, their intake amount has an effect on health. This study evaluated the n-6:n-3 intake ratio as well as the food sources and association of these fatty acids with demographic characteristics based on sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data.This study included 13,937 participants from the survey. The weighted mean intake and major food groups of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were determined. The 10 chief food sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty  were expressed as percent contribution to total intake.α-  constituted approximately 80% of total n-3 intake, followed by docosahexaenoic  (10.5%) and eicosapentaenoic  (6.1%). Linoleic  constituted 97% of total n-6 intake. After adjustment for cofactors (age, sex, and  intake), education level (p<0.01), alcohol consumption frequency (p<0.05) and monthly income (p<0.01) were significant variables determining n-3 and n-6 FA intake by Korean people. The average n- 6:n-3 intake ratio was 7.49:1. The major source of α- and linoleic  was soybean oil, whereas that of docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  was mackerel. Pork (70.0%) and egg (38.7%) were the major food sources of arachidonic  and dihomo-γ-, respectively.Monthly income, alcohol consumption frequency, and education level significantly affected n-3 FA intake. The dietary n-6: n-3 intake ratio in Korea is 7.49:1; however, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  intake remains inadequate (0.27 g/day).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27274395>Optimizing dietary lipid use to improve essential fatty  status and reproductive performance of the modern lactating sow: a review.</a></h2><p>Dietary lipid supplementation benefits the prolific and high-producing modern lactating sow. A comprehensive review of recent studies showed that lipid supplementation increases average daily  intake, which is partitioned for lactation as indicated by greater milk fat output and improved litter growth rate. Recent compelling findings showed that addition of particular lipids during lactation improved the subsequent reproductive outcome of sows. Such benefits were related to the level of dietary essential fatty acids (EFA, linoleic , C18:2n-6; and α-, C18:3n-3) during lactation. Lactation diets without supplemental EFA resulted in a pronounced negative balance (intake minus milk output) of linoleic (-25.49 g/d) and α- (-2.75 g/d); which compromised sow fertility (farrowing rate < 75 % and culling rates > 25 % of weaned sows). This phenomenon seems to be increasingly important with advancing sow age because of a progressive reduction of body EFA pool over successive lactations. The net effect of supplemental EFA during lactation was to create a positive EFA balance, which improved the subsequent reproduction of sows. Adequate linoleic  intake improved the proportion of sows that farrowed in the subsequent cycle (Farrowing rate (%) = [(-1.5 × 10(-3) × linoleic  intake (g/d)(2)) + (0.53 × linoleic  intake (g/d)) + (45.2)]; quadratic P = 0.002, R(2) = 0.997, RMSE = 0.031). In addition, increasing linoleic  intake increased the number of pigs born in the subsequent cycle (total pigs born (n) = [(9.4 × 10(-5) × linoleic  intake (g/d)(2)) + (0.04 × linoleic  intake (g/d)) + (10.94)]; quadratic P = 0.002, R(2) = 0.997, RMSE = 0.031). Supplemental α- resulted in a rapid return to estrus (sows bred: sows weaned = 94.2 %; wean-to-estrus interval = 4.0 d) and achieved a high retention of pregnancy (sows pregnant: sows bred = 98 %). Collectively, we conclude that a minimum dietary intake of 10 g/d of α-, simultaneous with a minimum of 125 g/d of linoleic  should be provided to ≥ 95 % of the sows; thereby, achieving a maximum sow reproductive efficiency through multiple mechanisms that include rapid return to estrus, high maintenance of pregnancy and large subsequent litter size in mature sows, that appear to be susceptible to EFA deficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150350>Nutrient intakes and compliance with nutrient recommendations in children aged 1-4 years in Ireland.</a></h2><p>The early childhood years represent a period of rapid growth and development characterised by unique requirements for  and individual nutrients.The present study uses data from the National Pre-School Nutrition Survey, a nationally representative sample of Irish children (1-4 years) (n = 500), aiming to estimate  and nutrient intakes across age and compliance with recommendations (UK and European). A 4-day weighed food-record was used to collect dietary data and statistical modelling (National Cancer Institute method) was applied to estimate usual nutrient intakes.Intakes of carbohydrate [48-50%  (E)], protein (15-16%E), total fat (32-34%E), dietary fibre (2.5 g MJ ), α- (0.45%E) and most micronutrients were in good compliance with recommendations. However, intakes of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) (65-80 mg) were low and significant proportions of children had inadequate intakes (< estimated average requirement) of vitamin D and iron. Small proportions of children with intakes exceeding the upper level for retinol, folic , zinc, copper and iodine, are unlikely to give rise to adverse health effects. Mean intakes of free sugars (12%E) and salt (3.1 g day ) exceeded recommendations and increased with age, whereas mean intake of saturated fat (15%E) decreased with age. By the age of 4 years, patterns established for intakes of salt, saturated fat and free sugars were unfavourable and similar to those observed in the diets of older children.Further research is needed to identify dietary strategies that improve the quality of the diet in young children, particularly in relation to excess of saturated fat, free sugars and salt, as well as inadequacy of iron, vitamin D and LCPUFA.© 2017 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25723496>Nutritional evaluation of Australian microalgae as potential human health supplements.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the biochemical suitability of Australian native microalgal species Scenedesmus sp., Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaliella sp., and a chlorophytic polyculture as nutritional supplements for human health. The four microalgal cultures were harvested during exponential growth, lyophilized, and analysed for proximate composition (moisture, ash, lipid, carbohydrates, and protein), pigments, and amino  and fatty  profiles. The resulting nutritional value, based on biochemical composition, was compared to commercial Spirulina and Chlorella products. The Australian native microalgae exhibited similar, and in several cases superior, organic nutritional properties relative to the assessed commercial products, with biochemical profiles rich in high-quality protein, nutritious polyunsaturated fats (such as α-, arachidonic , and eicosapentaenoic ), and antioxidant pigments.

In vertebrates, phospholipase A (PLA) releases arachidonic  (AA) from phospholipids (PLs) for biosynthesis of various eicosanoids. However, little AA is found in PLs of lepidopteran insects. Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect, is known to use eicosanoids to mediate immunity. Although AA was not detected in PLs of hemocytes and fat body (two immune tissues) of naïve larvae, it was detected at small but significant level after bacterial infection, suggesting induction of AA biosynthesis for immunity. Based on a mammalian AA biosynthetic pathway, this study hypothesizes that AA is synthesized from C18 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) precursor by subsequent desaturation and elongation reactions because PLs of S. exigua larvae are rich in linoleic . After inhibiting PLA activity to prevent release of free fatty acids, different PUFA precursors were injected to S. exigua larvae followed by assessment of eicosanoid-mediated cellular immune response. ω-6 PUFAs were effective in inducing immune response whereas α- (an ω-3 PUFA) was not. Several fatty acyl desaturases (SeDESs) have been predicted from S. exigua transcriptomes. Specific inhibitors against Δ5 or Δ6 DESs inhibited eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) specific to Δ5 or Δ6 DES genes significantly suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Four very long chain fatty  elongase genes (SeEloV-A ∼ SeEloV-D) were predicted. Among respective RNAi treatments of these genes, only one RNAi treatment specific to type 5 elongase (SeEloV-B) suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune response. These results suggest that S. exigua larvae can synthesize AA from linoleic  via Δ5- and Δ6-desaturations by SeDESs along with chain elongation by SeEloV-B. Finally, this study showed significant fitness cost of uncontrolled AA biosynthesis. AA injection alone without bacterial challenge significantly induced both cellular and humoral immune responses. This unnecessary  expense due to free AA resulted in reduced pupal size and decreased adult egg production. The detrimental effect of free AA explains physiological significance of little AA content in lepidopteran insects except for life-or-death situation such as pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Negative values of Gibbs free  of mixing (ΔG ) were obtained throughout the investigated ranges of the unsaturated C18 fatty- (L1, L2 and L3) mixed systems, indicating that very strong attractions occurred between molecules in the monolayers. The bend and kink effects from the cis-double bond(s) in the hydrocarbon chain affected the membrane fluidity and molecular packing in the monolayers, which resulted in a greater interaction between unsaturated C18 fatty acids and DP. The most thermodynamically stable mole composition of unsaturated C18 fatty acids to DP was observed at 50:1; this ratio is suggested to be the best mole ratio and will be subsequently used to prepare DP-C18 fatty- nanoliposomes. The presence of cis-double bonds in both hydrocarbon chains of DOPE in DP also created an imperfection in the membrane structure of lipid-drug delivery systems, which is expected to enhance lipid-based systems for antibody conjugation and drug encapsulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437488>Prenatal oxidative balance and risk of asthma and allergic disease in adolescence.</a></h2><p>Fetal oxidative balance (achieved when protective prenatal factors counteract sources of oxidative stress) might be critical for preventing asthma and allergic disease.We examined prenatal intakes of hypothesized protective nutrients (including antioxidants) in conjunction with potential sources of oxidative stress in models of adolescent asthma and allergic disease.We used data from 996 mother-child pairs in Project Viva. Exposures of interest were maternal prepregnancy body mass index and prenatal nutrients (-adjusted intakes of vitamins D, C, and E; β-carotene; folate; choline; and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs]), air pollutant exposures (residence-specific third-trimester black carbon or particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm [PM]), acetaminophen, and smoking. Outcomes were offspring's current asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergen sensitization at a median age of 12.9 years. We performed logistic regression. Continuous exposures were log-transformed and modeled as z scores.We observed protective associations for vitamin D (odds ratio [OR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.89] for allergic rhinitis), the sum of the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66-0.99] for current asthma), and the n-3 PUFA α- (OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.95] for allergen sensitization and OR, 0.80 [95% CI 0.65-0.99] for current asthma). Black carbon and PM were associated with an approximately 30% increased risk for allergen sensitization. No multiplicative interactions were observed for protective nutrient intakes with sources of oxidative stress.We identified potential protective prenatal nutrients (vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs), as well as adverse prenatal pro-oxidant exposures that might alter the risk of asthma and allergic disease into adolescence.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

This work was aimed at evaluating the effect of heat-drying (HD) and freeze-drying (FD) on the phytochemical and fatty  profiles of alfalfa and flax sprouts, as compared to fresh material.Both FD and HD reduced the phytochemical contents compared to fresh sprouts. FD better preserved phytoestrogens, phytosterols and total tocols compared to HD. However, phytoestrogen and tocol content remained quite high also in HD. The fatty  profile was affected only by sprouts species, with higher amounts of α- in flax and linoleic  in alfalfa sprouts.This work demonstrates that drying does not severely compromise the nutritional value of sprouts and provides a valid support for the choice of the drying method depending on the compound to be preserved, and taking into consideration the different cost of the methods. In addition, sprout powder is easy to handle and, due to its low volume, does not imply a decrease of feed consumption and  intake, which is relevant in its use as a supplement in human and animal feeding. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583073>Does the presence of cardiovascular disease risk factors or established disease influence the dietary intake of affected adults and their children residing in the same household? A secondary analysis of the Australian Health Survey (2011-2013).</a></h2><p>Diet is an important contributor to risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and integral in management and delaying progression. Little is known however about whether increased CVD risk or established CVD has any influence on dietary intakes of Australian adults or children residing in the same household. This study aimed to determine whether the presence of CVD or CVD risk factors influences dietary intake of Australian adults and if the presence of an adult with increased CVD risk influences the dietary intake of a child living in the same household.Data were sourced from the 2011-2013 Australian Health Survey for: (1) adults ≥18 years with risk factors or established CVD and (2) children 2-17 years residing in the same household as adults with CVD risk factors or established CVD. Selected nutrient intakes (total fat, saturated fat plus trans fat, , total long chain omega 3 fatty acids, fibre and sodium) collected by repeated 24 h recalls were compared to national dietary recommendations and to the intakes of all other adults and children surveyed. Standard errors of the estimates were calculated using the replicate weights method, and an alpha value of <0.05 considered statistically significant.Six thousand two hundred sixty five of 9435 adults surveyed were identified as having CVD risk factors or established disease and of these 1609 had a child in the same household that also contributed data in this survey. No differences were observed in adjusted mean dietary intakes between those without risk factors or established CVD and those with, except for total  and sodium which were significantly lower in the adults with CVD risk factors and/or established disease. However sodium intakes across both groups were higher than recommended targets. There were no differences for selected nutrients between children residing with affected adults and other children surveyed.While intakes of Australian adults with CVD risk factors or established disease were favourable for sodium, compared to unaffected adults, there is still scope for improvement as many Australian adults, despite CVD risk, are unable to achieve targets for selected nutrients.

Their biotransmission through the food chain constitutes a potential risk for human health. Plants as principal actors in the food chain can play a determinant role in removing dioxins from the environment. Due to the lack of data on dioxin/plant research, this study sets out to determine few responsive reactions adopted by Arabidopsis plant towards 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most toxic congener of dioxins.Using a high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis plant uptakes TCDD by the roots and accumulates it in the vegetative parts in a tissue-specific manner. TCDD mainly accumulated in rosette leaves and mature seeds and less in stem, flowers and immature siliques. Moreover, we observed that plants exposed to high doses of TCDD exhibited a delay in flowering and yielded fewer seeds of a reduced oil content with a low vitality. A particular focus on the plant fatty  metabolism showed that TCDD caused a significant reduction in C18-unsaturated fatty  level in plant tissues. Simultaneously, TCDD induced the expression of 9-LOX and 13-LOX genes and the formation of their corresponding hydroperoxides, 9- and 13-HPOD as well as 9- or 13-HPOT, derived from linoleic and  acids, respectively.The current work highlights a side of toxicological effects resulting in the administration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD on the Arabidopsis plant. Similarly to animals, it seems that plants may accumulate TCDD in their lipids by involving few of the FA-metabolizing enzymes for sculpting a specific oxylipins "signature" typified to plant TCDD-tolerance. Together, our results uncover novel responses of Arabidopsis to dioxin, possibly emerging to overcome its toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217628>Conversion efficiency of α- to omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in aerial insectivore chicks.</a></h2><p>Food availability and quality are both critical for growing young animals. In nature, swallows () and other aerial insectivores feed on both aquatic insects, which are rich in omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), and terrestrial insects, which contain considerably lower amounts of omega-3 HUFAs. Carnivorous mammals and fishes must obtain omega-3 HUFAs from their diet, as they have lost the capacity to convert the precursor omega-3 α- (ALA) into omega-3 HUFAs. Thus, the relative value of aquatic versus terrestrial insects depends not only on the fatty  composition of the prey but also on the capacity of consumers to convert ALA into omega-3 HUFAs. We used a combination of stable-isotope-labeled fatty  tracers to ask whether, and how efficiently, tree swallows can deposit newly synthesized omega-3 HUFAs into tissue. Our data show for the first time that tree swallows can convert ALA into omega-3 HUFAs deposited in liver and skeletal muscle. However, high tree swallow demand for omega-3 HUFAs combined with low ALA availability in natural terrestrial foods may strain their modest conversion ability. This suggests that while tree swallows can synthesize omega-3 HUFAs , omega-3 HUFAs are ecologically essential nutrients in natural systems. Our findings thus provide mechanistic support for our previous findings and the importance of omega-3 HUFA-rich aquatic insects for tree swallows and most likely other aerial insectivores with similar niches.© 2018.

The main advantage of using cyanobacteria over other organisms is their ability to capture  from sunlight and to transform CO into products of interest by photosynthesis, such as fatty acids. Fatty  synthesis is a ubiquitous and well-characterized pathway in most bacteria. However, the activity of the enzymes involved in this pathway in cyanobacteria remains poorly explored.To characterize the function of some enzymes involved in the saturated fatty  synthesis in cyanobacteria, we genetically engineered  PCC 7942 by overexpressing or deleting genes encoding enzymes of the fatty  synthase system and tested the lipid profile of the mutants. These modifications were in turn used to improve  production in this cyanobacterium. The mutant resulting from  overexpression and  deletion, combined with the overexpression of  and  desaturase genes from  sp. PCC 7002, produced the highest levels of this omega-3 fatty .The fatty  composition of  PCC 7942 can be significantly modified by genetically engineering the expression of genes coding for the enzymes involved in the first reactions of fatty  synthesis pathway. Variations in fatty  composition of  PCC 7942 mutants did not follow the pattern observed in  derivatives. Some of these modifications can be used to improve omega-3 fatty  production. This work provides new insights into the saturated fatty  synthesis pathway and new strategies that might be used to manipulate the fatty  content of cyanobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28190013>Systematic Review on N-3 and N-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty  Intake in European Countries in Light of the Current Recommendations - Focus on Specific Population Groups.</a></h2><p>Earlier reviews indicated that in many countries adults, children and adolescents consume on an average less polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) than recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation.The intake of total and individual n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in European infants, children, adolescents, elderly and pregnant/lactating women was evaluated systematically.The evaluations were done against recommendations of the European Food Safety Authority. Key Messages: Fifty-three studies from 17 different European countries reported an intake of total n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and/or individual n-3 or n-6 PUFAs in at least one of the specific population groups: 10 in pregnant women, 4 in lactating women, 3 in infants 6-12 months, 6 in children 1-3 years, 11 in children 4-9 years, 8 in adolescents 10-18 years and 11 in elderly >65 years. Mean linoleic  intake was within the recommendation (4  percentage [E%]) in 52% of the countries, with inadequate intakes more likely in lactating women, adolescents and elderly. Mean α- intake was within the recommendation (0.5 E%) in 77% of the countries. In 26% of the countries, mean eicosapentaenoic  and/or docosahexaenoic  intake was as recommended. These results indicate that intake of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs may be suboptimal in specific population groups in Europe.© 2017 S.

Average fish consumption (frequency) and intakes (as  percentages) of total fat, saturated, mono unsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic, docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic, and a- (ALA), and cholesterol were averaged over baseline and follow-up. Intakes were studied in relation to 5-year change in global cognitive function, memory, information processing speed, and cognitive flexibility, using ANCOVA and multivariate linear regression analyses.No consistent association between (fatty) fish consumption and cognitive decline was observed. Higher cholesterol intake was associated with faster cognitive decline (p < 0.05). Higher n-3 PUFA (especially ALA) intake was associated with slower decline in global cognitive function and memory (p < 0.01). Intakes of other fatty acids were not associated with cognitive decline.Higher cholesterol intake was detrimental, while higher ALA intake was beneficial for maintaining cognitive function with ageing, already at middle age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664691>Influence of protein deficient diet, vitamin B[sub]2[/sub] supplementation and physical training on serum composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in rats.</a></h2><p>[b]Introduction[/b].

Two groups were fed the diet enriched with vitamin B2. The two groups of tested animals were trained for 5 days a week. [b]Results.[/b] LP diet caused a decrease in α- (ALA) after 30 days, and a decrease in docosahexaenoic  (DHA) after 60 days of experiment, compared with rats fed the control diet. After 60 and 90 days of the experiment, a significant decrease was noted in arachidonic  (AA) in serum of trained rats, compared with sedentary rats fed the LP diet. Physical activity increased LA (mainly on day 30), EPA (on day 90) and reduced AA content (on day 90) in serum of rats fed the LP diet. B2 supplementation in the trained LP group did not change the EPA and AA dependence; however, there was a decrease in LA content in comparison to the non-supplemented trained group. [b]Conclusions.

Edible fats and oils are used in for pan- and deep-frying, and in salad dressing, mayonnaise and processed foods such as chocolates and cream. The physical and chemical properties of edible fats and oils can affect the quality of oil foods and hence must be evaluated in detail. The physical characteristics of edible fats and oils include color, specific gravity, refractive index, melting point, congeal point, smoke point, flash point, fire point, and viscosity, while the chemical characteristics include  value, saponification value, iodine value, fatty  composition, trans isomers, triacylglycerol composition, unsaponifiable matters (sterols, tocopherols) and minor components (phospholipids, chlorophyll pigments, glycidyl fatty  esters). Peroxide value, p-anisidine value, carbonyl value, polar compounds and polymerized triacylglycerols are indexes of the deterioration of edible fats and oils. This review describes the analytical methods to evaluate the quality of edible fats and oils, especially the Standard Methods for Analysis of Fats, Oils and Related Materials edited by Japan Oil Chemists' Society (the JOCS standard methods) and advanced methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27482299>Effect of a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids on the pig liver transcriptome.</a></h2><p>The optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is important for keeping the homeostasis of biological processes and metabolism, yet the underlying biological mechanism is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to identify changes in the pig liver transcriptome induced by a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and to characterize the biological mechanisms related to PUFA metabolism. Polish Landrace pigs (n = 12) were fed diet enriched with linoleic  (LA, omega-6) and α- (ALA, omega-3) or standard diet as a control. The fatty  profiling was assayed in order to verify how feeding influenced the fatty  content in the liver, and subsequently next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between transcriptomes between dietary groups. The biological mechanisms and pathway interaction networks were identified using DAVID and Cytoscape tools. Fatty  profile analysis indicated a higher contribution of PUFAs in the liver for LA- and ALA-enriched diet group, particularly for the omega-3 fatty  family, but not omega-6. Next-generation sequencing identified 3565 DEG, 1484 of which were induced and 2081 were suppressed by PUFA supplementation. A low ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids resulted in the modulation of fatty  metabolism pathways and over-representation of genes involved in  metabolism, signal transduction, and immune response pathways. In conclusion, a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids altered the transcriptomic profile of the pig liver and would influence animal health status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043014>Borago officinalis seed oil (BSO), a natural source of omega-6 fatty acids, attenuates fat accumulation by activating peroxisomal beta-oxidation both in C. elegans and in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a medical condition with increasing prevalence, characterized by an accumulation of excess fat that could be improved using some bioactive compounds. However, many of these compounds with in vitro activity fail to respond in vivo, probably due to the sophistication of the physiological  regulatory networks. In this context, C. elegans has emerged as a plausible model for the identification and characterization of the effect of such compounds on fat storage in a complete organism. However, the results obtained in such a simple model are not easily extrapolated to more complex organisms such as mammals, which hinders its application in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain new experimental data about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of fat loss between worms and mammals. Previously, we found that some omega-6 fatty acids promote fat loss in C. elegans by up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation in an omega-3 independent manner. In this work, we prove that the omega-6 fatty acids' effects on worms are also seen when they are supplemented with a natural omega-6 source (borage seed oil, BSO). Additionally, we explore the anti-obesity effects of two doses of BSO in a diet-induced obesity rat model, validating the up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation. The supplementation with BSO significantly reduces body weight gain and  efficiency and prevents white adipose tissue accumulation without affecting food intake. Moreover, BSO also increases serum HDL-cholesterol levels, improves insulin resistance and promotes the down-regulation of Cebpa, an adipogenesis-related gene. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids are highly conserved between worms and obesity-induced mammals, so these compounds could be considered to treat or prevent obesity-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28083898>Engineering the production of conjugated fatty acids in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves.</a></h2><p>The seeds of many nondomesticated plant species synthesize oils containing high amounts of a single unusual fatty , many of which have potential usage in industry. Despite the identification of enzymes for unusual oxidized fatty  synthesis, the production of these fatty acids in engineered seeds remains low and is often hampered by their inefficient exclusion from phospholipids. Recent studies have established the feasibility of increasing triacylglycerol content in plant leaves, which provides a novel approach for increasing  density of biomass crops. Here, we determined whether the fatty  composition of leaf oil could be engineered to accumulate unusual fatty acids. Eleostearic  (ESA) is a conjugated fatty  produced in seeds of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii) and has both industrial and nutritional end-uses. Arabidopsis thaliana lines with elevated leaf oil were first generated by transforming wild-type, cgi-58 or pxa1 mutants (the latter two of which contain mutations disrupting fatty  breakdown) with the diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 or DGAT2) and/or oleosin genes from tung. High-leaf-oil plant lines were then transformed with tung FADX, which encodes the fatty  desaturase/conjugase responsible for ESA synthesis. Analysis of lipids in leaves revealed that ESA was efficiently excluded from phospholipids, and co-expression of tung FADX and DGAT2 promoted a synergistic increase in leaf oil content and ESA accumulation. Taken together, these results provide a new approach for increasing leaf oil content that is coupled with accumulation of unusual fatty acids. Implications for production of biofuels, bioproducts, and plant-pest interactions are discussed.© 2017 The Authors.

Volatile components in vine tea were also identified by GC-MS. The changes of flavonoid, tea polyphenols and polysaccharides in fermented vine tea were evaluated. Flavonoid and polyphenols in vine tea were remained unchanged even after biotransformation, but content of polysaccharides increased to 3.9-fold than that of unfermented vine tea. Antioxidant activity such as DPPH free radical scavenging capacity (SR) was determined that there was a positive correlation between SR and content of polysaccharides in vine tea.
