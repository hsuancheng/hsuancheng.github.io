Validated disease activity measurement instruments were identified. Data regarding app characteristics, including the presence of validated disease activity measurement, were extracted. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to review the apps for user experience.A total of 1253 apps were identified in the app stores, and  apps met the criteria and were further analyzed. Moreover, 2 apps (MySpA and Group for Research and Assessment of  and Psoriatic Arthritis App) contained some of the validated disease activity monitoring instruments for specific spondyloarthritis subtypes. These 2 apps were also rated good on the MARS (with total mean scores ≥4 out of ), whereas the other apps scored poorly in comparison.There are 2 high-quality spondyloarthritis disease activity monitoring apps publicly available, but they only target 2 spondyloarthritis subtypes-ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. There is a lack of high-quality apps that can measure disease activity for other spondyloarthritis subtypes, and no app that consolidates all validated disease activity instruments across subtypes was available.©Yu Heng Kwan, Wei Jie Ong, Mengfei Xiong, Ying Ying Leung, Jie Kie Phang, Charmaine Tze May Wang, Warren Fong.

To optimize outcomes and reduce costs, dose adjustment informed by measurement of circulating drug levels has been shown to be effective in various settings. However, limited evidence exists for this approach with the interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 inhibitor ustekinumab.To evaluate clinical utility of therapeutic drug monitoring for ustekinumab in patients with .A prospective observational cohort of 491 adults with  was recruited to the multicenter Biomarkers of Systemic Treatment Outcomes in  study within the British Association of Dermatologists Biologic and Immunomodulators Register from June 2009 to December 2017; samples from some patients were taken between 2009 and 2011 as part of a pilot study with the same inclusion criteria.Serum ustekinumab level measured at any point during the dosing cycle using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Disease activity measured using the  Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Treatment response outcomes were PASI75 (75% reduction in PASI score from baseline [primary outcome]), PASI90 (90% reduction of PASI score from baseline), and absolute PASI score of 1. or less.A total of 491 patients (171 women and 320 men; mean [SD] age, 45.7 [12.8] years) had 1 or more serum samples (total, 853 samples obtained 0-56 weeks from start of treatment) and 1 or more PASI scores within the first year of treatment. Antidrug antibodies were detected in only 17 of 490 patients (3.%). Early measured drug levels (1-12 weeks after starting treatment) were associated with PASI75 response 6 months after starting treatment (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.11-1.71) when adjusted for baseline PASI score, age, and ustekinumab dose. However, this finding was not consistent across the other PASI outcomes (PASI90 and PASI score of ≤1.).This real-world study provides evidence that measurement of early serum ustekinumab levels could be useful to direct the treatment strategy for . Adequate drug exposure early in the treatment cycle may be particularly important in determining clinical outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262226>Prevalence and economic burden of comorbid anxiety and depression among patients with moderate-to-severe .</a></h2><p> To describe the prevalence and costs of anxiety and depression among moderate-to-severe  (PsO) patients in a commercially-insured US population.  The IBM MarketScan Commercial database was used to select adults with moderate-to-severe PsO (≥1 PsO diagnosis and ≥1 systemic or biologic medication) within each calendar year from 2014 to 2016. Adults with no diagnosis of PsO or similar disorders were randomly selected (2014-2016) and matched 1:1 to PsO patients to compare the prevalence of anxiety and depression each year. Moderate-to-severe PsO patients identified in 2014 with continuous enrollment through 2015 were stratified into those with treated anxiety and/or depression (≥1 anxiety or depression diagnosis plus any anxiolytics, antidepressants, or antipsychotics within 30 days) vs those without anxiety/depression, and then matched 1:1 to determine the incremental burden of treated anxiety/depression among PsO patients. All-cause and PsO-related healthcare costs were compared between the matched cohorts using generalized linear models.  In total, 69,644 matched PsO and non-PsO patients were identified in 2014, 61,478 in 2015, and 66,880 in 2016. The prevalence of anxiety/depression among PsO patients increased more than for matched controls, from 18.2% vs 12.2% in 2014 ( < 0.01) to 19.6% vs 13.1% in 2016 ( < 0.01). Prevalence of treated anxiety/depression followed the same trend, with increases from 14.% vs 8.9% in 2014 ( < 0.01) to 15.9% vs 9.9% in 2016 ( < 0.01). For patients with moderate-to-severe PsO, unadjusted incremental all-cause healthcare costs associated with treated anxiety/depression were $8,077 ( < 0.01); 91% was due to utilization of medical services such as hospitalizations, ER visits, office visits, and other outpatient services (all  < 0.01).  The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is higher among PsO patients than the general population, and the incremental burden of treated anxiety/depression is substantial. Further research is needed, but PsO treatments that improve psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety/depression may benefit patients and reduce their economic burden.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267570>Increased risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in 17 018 patients while under treatment with anti-TNFα agents, particularly etanercept, for autoimmune diseases other than inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Anti-TNFα agents have revolutionised management of chronic inflammatory diseases. Paradoxically, these agents might provoke development of de novo autoimmune diseases.To examine whether there is an increased risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) while under treatment with anti-TNFα agents for diseases other than inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) METHODS: A nationwide cohort study, based on Danish health registries, of all patients who utilised anti-TNFα agents for non-IBD indications. Included were patients, who had diseases for which anti-TNFα agent is indicated (rheumatoid arthritis, /psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, others). The observation period for development of de novo IBD started from 2004. Exposed patients had received at least one dose of anti-TNFα.In total 17 018 individuals with autoimmune diseases were exposed to anti-TNFα (the vast majority had infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab), and 63 308 individuals were not. Patients treated with etanercept had an increased risk of being diagnosed with CD and UC while under treatment, adjusted hazard ratio 2.0 [95% CI: 1.4-2.8] and 2.0 [95% CI: 1.-2.8], respectively. The corresponding hazards ratios for infliximab were 1.3 [95% CI: 0.8-2.2] and 1.0 [95% CI:0.6-1.6], and for adalimumab 1.2 [95% CI: 0.8-1.8] and 0.6 [95% CI: 0.3-1.0].Patients treated for autoimmune diseases with anti-TNFα had an increased risk of being diagnosed with CD or UC while under treatment with etanercept. The nature of this association is uncertain. This finding has relevance to clinical care and insights into common mechanisms of the pathophysiology of these diseases.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638283>Ustekinumab treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa.</a></h2><p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a follicular occlusive inflammatory skin disease that occurs in the axilla, groin, buttocks and vulval region. Control of the intractable inflammation is a primary goal of HS treatments. Benefit of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies against HS have been reported, and adalimumab has been approved for HS in Europe, the USA and Japan. However, the alternative therapies for anti-TNF antibodies have not been established yet. We experienced a case of HS which developed during the infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) and was well managed by ustekinumab (UST). We reviewed the articles relating to ustekinumab treatments for HS. Twenty-four HS patients, 16 women and eight men, have been treated with ustekinumab. The average age was 35.7 ± 10.8 years (mean ± SD). All were of Hurley stage II or III. Ten (10/24, 41.6%) had received anti-TNF drugs including infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept prior to UST treatment for HS. Although the initial doses varied from 45 mg s.c. to 390 mg i.v., all cases were treated with 45 or 90 mg s.c. every 8 or 12 weeks at the regular dose, by following the regimen for  or CD. HS in most of the cases started to improve after 3- months of UST initiation, and some achieved complete remission. To our knowledge, our case is the first Asian HS patient improved by UST. Overall, UST is useful for HS and could be an alternative treatment if HS patients do not respond to other medications including anti-TNF drugs.© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629629>Multi-omics study in monozygotic twins confirm the contribution of de novo mutation to .</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified over 120 risk loci for . However, most of the variations are located in non-coding region with high frequency and small effect size. Pathogenetic variants are rarely reported except HLA-C*0602 with the odds ratio being approximately 4.0 in Chinese population. Although rare variations still account for a small proportion of phenotypic variances in complex diseases, their effect on phenotypes is large. Recently, more and more studies focus on the low-frequency functional variants and have achieved a certain amount of success.Whole genome sequencing and sanger sequencing was performed on 8 MZ twin pairs discordant for  to scan and verified the de novo mutations (DNMs). Additionally, 665 individuals with about 20 years' medical history versus 2054 healthy controls and two published large population studies which had about 8 years' medical history (including 10,727 cases versus 10,582 controls) were applied to validate the enrichment of rare damaging mutations in two DNMs genes. Besides, to verify the pathogenicity of candidate DNM in C3, RNA-sequencing for CD4, CD8 T cells of twins and lesion, non-lesion skin of  patients were carried out. Meanwhile, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect the level of C3, C3b in the supernatant of peripheral blood.A total of 27 DNMs between co-twins were identified. We found six of eight twins carry HLA-C∗0602 allele which have large effects on . And it is interesting that a missense mutation in SPRED1 and a splice region mutation in C3 are found in the  individuals in the other two MZ twin pairs without carrying HLA-C*0602 allele. In the replication stage, we found 2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants of C3 only in 665 cases with about 20 years' medical history and gene-wise analysis in 665 cases and 2054 controls showed that the rare missense mutations in C3 were enriched in cases (OR = 1.91, P = 0.0028). We further scanned the LOF mutations of C3 in two published studies (about 8 years' medical history), and found one LOF mutation in the case without carrying HLA-C*0602. In the individual with DNM in C3, RNA sequencing showed the expression level of C3 in skin was significant higher than healthy samples in public database (TPM fold change = 1.40, P = 0.000181) and ELISA showed protein C3 in peripheral blood was higher (~2.2-fold difference) than the other samples of twins without DNM in C3.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that DNM in C3 is the likely pathological mutations, and it provided a better understanding of the genetic etiology of  and additional treatments for this disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

For all three diseases an early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is crucial. The proof of concept network study "Rheuma-VOR" is a further developed version of the predecessor project ADAPTHERA and was extended to several federal states. The aim of this prospective study is to improve the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondylarthritis and thus positively impact the quality of care for patients with the help of multidisciplinary coordinating centers. To date 3710 disease-specific questionnaires from patients with the suspected diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or axial spondylarthritis from 1298 different primary care providers were registered in the multidisciplinary coordination centers. A total of 1958 appointments were made with 1 of the 53 participating rheumatology specialists. In 876 patients, 1 of the 3 rheumatic diseases was diagnosed in an early stage. The waiting period was on average 42. days depending on the federal state, which is well below the nationwide average. It should also be noted that the coordinated cooperation and risk stratification of the Rheuma-VOR coordination centers relieved the capacity of rheumatology specialists by 1281 appointments (34.%). In addition, the 2‑week Rheuma Bus Tour and the accompanying initiatives in Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheuma-VOR screening app and the triage consultation) are showing first promising positive results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31441276>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of  Treatment Modalities in Malaysia.</a></h2><p>There is limited evidence detailing the cost-effectiveness of  treatments in the Asian region. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3  treatments tailored for moderate to severe , namely topical and phototherapy (TP), topical and systemic (TS), and topical and biologic (TB) regimens, respectively.This has been achieved by the participation of a prospective cohort involving a total of 90 moderate to severe  patients, which has been conducted at  public hospitals in Malaysia. The main outcome measures have been evaluated via cost and effectiveness  area severity index (PASI)-75 and/or body surface area (BSA) < and/or dermatology life quality index (DLQI) ≤), estimated from the societal perspective over a 6-months duration. All costs are based on 2015's recorded Malaysian Ringgit (RM) currency.Consequently, TS has been found to be the most cost-effective treatment with the lowest cost/PASI-75/and/or BSA < and/or DLQI ≤, valued at RM9034.56 (US$2582.55). This is followed by TP, which is valued at RM28 080.71 (US$8026.93) and TB, valued at RM54 287.02 (US$15 518.06). Furthermore, one-way sensitivity analysis has highlighted the cost of medication as the most sensitive parameter.Thus, the input from this study is helpful for policy-makers in determining the first line treatment for moderate to severe  with consideration of the costs and its effectiveness in Malaysia. This will consequently allow hospitals to justify and provide the essential resources for further research and development, as well as the adoption of better treatment options.© 2019 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

Tyrosinase (Tyr) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) are the primary regulators of melanogenesis. Furthermore, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) modulate various pathobiologic processes including inflammation, melanogenesis and melanomagenesis. To determine the association between  and melanogenesis, psoriatic lesional skin was screened through gene expression, immunohistochemistry, immunogold staining and melanin content assays. The present study detected a decreased expression of Tyr, MITF and BMP-4 in psoriatic lesional skin compared with healthy skin. Tyr, BMP-4 and melanin content were also evaluated in the psoriatic lesional skin of patients receiving adalimumab therapy, before and after 16 weeks of treatment. TNF-α blockade modulated the Tyr, BMP-4 and melanin content of the patient skin lesions, which supported the hypothesis that hyper-pigmentation may occur in areas of psoriatic plaque after biological treatment.

All participants were evaluated for depression and anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and for low self-esteem using the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Questionnaire. Sexual function was assessed in females using the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire and in males using the International Index of Erectile Function and its abbreviated -item version. For male patients suffering from erectile dysfunction, hormonal assessment and penile duplex ultrasound were added.The main outcome measures were frequency of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and sexual dysfunction in  vulgaris patients, partners, and controls; the domains of sexual function affected in the studied groups; and the etiology of erectile dysfunction in affected psoriatic males.Frequency of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem were significantly higher in  patients of both sexes compared with controls. Sexual dysfunction followed the same trend of being significantly higher in cases when compared to controls. Females had a significantly higher frequency of sexual dysfunction than males. Sexual dysfunction in both sexes involved multiple domains of the sexual response cycle, with depression and genital affection by  being risk factors in both sexes and disease severity being an additional risk factor in females. Erectile dysfunction was mainly psychogenic in origin in male patients.Assessment of psychopathological and sexual comorbidities in  patients and partners should be an integral part of the management plan and should be added to the guidelines of the disease.This study is of sufficient power to draw solid conclusions. Assessment of the partners and determination of the sexual domains affected by the disease and nature of erectile dysfunction in males are points of novelty.

Besides these, a substantial number of patients with FMF present with a variety of other inflammatory diseases; however, this issue has not been systematically studied previously. Hence, we aimed to investigate the frequency of inflammatory comorbid diseases in a large FMF cohort. All patients were recruited from "FMF in Central Anatolia (FiCA) Cohort", comprising 971 (mean age 35.3 ± 12 years, 61.% female) adult subjects. All patients fulfilled Tel Hashomer criteria. Demographic data, FMF disease characteristics, MEFV gene mutations, and comorbid inflammatory diseases were meticulously questioned, and laboratory features and genotype data were retrieved from hospital records. There were comorbid inflammatory diseases in 205 (21.1%) patients. The most common inflammatory disease was spondyloarthritis (12.9%). Other remarkable inflammatory disorders were , immunoglobulin A vasculitis/Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Behçet's disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is a newly defined entity in our cohort which is seemed to be associated with FMF (0.3%). Number of patients with persistent inflammation was higher in those with comorbid diseases (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that FMF is commonly associated with other inflammatory diseases.

Patients with no response to a first induction treatment are typically switched to another, and some patients require several treatments before they see an improvement.To determine the most cost-effective sequence of induction treatment through a comparative time-effectiveness analysis of different systemic treatment sequences currently licensed in Germany for moderate to severe plaque .This time-effectiveness analysis used a decision-analytic model set in the German health care system. The population simulated to receive the treatment sequences consisted of adult men and women with  vulgaris or plaque type  eligible for systemic treatment. Systematic reviews were performed to generate model input values. Data were collected from November 1 through December 15, 2017, and analyzed from January through August 2018.Five treatment sequences frequently used in Germany, identified through an online expert survey (response rate, 10 of 15 [66.7%]), and 4 theoretical sequences starting with a biological agent. Treatments included methotrexate sodium (MTX), cyclosporine (CSA), fumaric acid esters (FAE), adalimumab (ADA), ixekizumab (IXE), infliximab (INF), and secukinumab (SEC).Two health states were defined: responder (patients achieving a  Area Severity Index [PASI] ≥75) and nonresponder (PASI <75). Probability values were defined as response rates of PASI-75. Treatment effects were determined by the mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score. Time until onset of action was assessed as weeks until 25% of patients reach PASI-75. Individual time-effectiveness ratios were calculated per treatment sequence as time until onset of action (in weeks) per minimally important difference (MID) in DLQI and were subsequently ranked.Treatment sequences starting with a biological agent, including IXE-INF-SEC (1.4 weeks per DLQI-MID), INF-IXE-SEC (2.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), SEC-IXE-ADA (2.1 weeks per DLQI-MID), and ADA-IXE-SEC (2.8 weeks per DLQI-MID) were more time-effective than frequently used treatment sequences, including MTX-SEC-ADA (6.8 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-IXE (7.0 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-SEC (7.2 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-FAE-ADA (10.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), and FAE-MTX-CSA (11. weeks per DLQI-MID).

The MEASURE 2 study, a phase 3 clinical trial in patients with AS, was used to assess improvement in spine symptoms at Week 16.Treatment with secukinumab demonstrated robust and consistent efficacy across all GRAPPA-OMERACT PsA core domains, with secukinumab 300 mg showing the greatest response rates across most PsA core domains compared with placebo at Week 16. Notably, among patients treated with secukinumab 300 mg, 34.3% and 19.% achieved complete resolution of swollen and tender joint counts, respectively, 53.2% and 61.% achieved complete resolution of enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively, and 33.2% achieved 100% improvement in  Area and Severity Index (all P < 0.05 vs placebo); similar improvements were shown for all other core domains.This analysis suggests that secukinumab can benefit people with PsA across the clinical phenotypic spectrum commonly encountered in this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398160>Clinical and metabolic analysis of disorders in psoriatic patients.</a></h2><p>Introduction: Elucidation of the primary nature of biochemical shifts in psoriatic disease and prediction of interconnected subsequent changes in metabolic and inflammatory processes are important in foreseeing the dynamic development of pathological process and the choice of individual treatment. The aim of the research was to assess the disorders and correlations between main indicators of protein, fat, hydrocarbon and pigment metabolism and specifics of inflammatory processes in psoriatic patients against the clinical course of dermatosis.Materials and methods: We analysed the results of clinical and laboratory examinations conducted in 62 psoriatic patients. All these patients have been analysed as per their age,sex, prevalence and the type of skin rash as well as per the clinical disease form. Biochemical examinations were conducted using appropriate sets of reagents. To establish the possible correlation between the indicators of biochemical blood analysis, we calculated the correlation coefficient, which determines the nature of correlation between the studied variables.Results: The analysis of results received upon examining psoriatic patients indicated that microbial-viral associations, stress factors and genetic predisposition were the most frequent trigger factors of psoriatic disease, which corresponds to the data from literary sources. We detected that the duration of psoriaric disease up to  years was the most common, and relapses were manifested in its limited form against the background of the disease advanced stage; the prevalent  was more common at the hospital stage. Our study justifies that metabolic changes occurred in the overwhelming majority of examined patients of different age groups. At that, abnormalities of a number of indicators of protein, lipid, hydrocarbon and enzyme metabolism have been established. In addition, the expressiveness of corresponding changes correlated with the prevalence of skin psoriatic process and the duration of dermatosis course as well as the presence of pathology of a number of internal organs, in particular of gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary and cardiovascular systems, that suggest the presence of systemic disorders at .Conclusions: The identification of independent mechanisms existing between some changes in metabolic process parameters in  has a theoretical and practical significance in dermatology, which involves the use of medications to regulate the detected disorders, the possibility to restore correlations, and it will inevitably contribute to the achievement of clinical and preventive effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350056>Different risk profiles of biologic agents for new-onset  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>To investigate rates and risk factors for incident and recurrent  in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with different biologic (b) and conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).RA patients enrolled in the German biologics register RABBIT without (n = 14,525) or with a history of  (n = 375) were analyzed separately. All first events of  reported until October 2017 were assigned to the treatments prescribed in the previous 3 months. Crude incidence rates (IR) of  were calculated per 1000 patient-years. To investigate risk factors for , cox regressions with and without inverse probability weights were applied to adjust for confounding by indication.117 incident and 37 recurrent psoriatic events were reported. Patients exposed to TNFi had a significantly higher incidence rate (IR = 3.04/1,000 PY) than those exposed to csDMARDs only (IR = 0.65), whereas IRs for abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab did not differ significantly from csDMARDs. Adjusted Cox regression confirmed a higher risk for TNFi. Female sex (HR: 1.7) and smoking (HR: 2.1) were significantly associated with incident  while methotrexate decreased the risk (HR: 0.). For recurrent , IRs for TNFi, abatacept and rituximab were significantly higher than for csDMARDs.Our data confirm a previously observed increased risk of incident  in patients exposed to TNFi compared to csDMARDs. However, the overall risk is low and the event is usually non-serious. Comedication of TNFi with methotrexate seems to lower the risk of incident .

This study aimed to assess the impact of this disease on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work productivity, and direct and indirect costs from a societal perspective among Brazilian patients.This is a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study, enrolling patients with moderate to severe plaque  according to physician evaluation. Data collection was performed from December 2015 to November 2016 through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire and five standardized patient-reported outcomes instruments. Direct costs were estimated by multiplying the amount of resources used (12-month recall period) by the corresponding unit cost. Indirect costs were grouped in two time horizons: annual costs (income reduction and absenteeism) and lifetime costs (demission and early retirement).A total of 188 patients with moderate to severe plaque  were included, with mean age of 48.0 (SD 13.1). "Anxiety and depression" and "pain and discomfort" were the most impaired dimensions, according to the EuroQol Five-Dimension-Three-Level (EQ-5D-3L). The highest effect was found for "symptoms and feelings" [mean (SD) 2.4 (1.7)] Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) subscale. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) presence and biologic-naïve status were associated with worse HRQoL. Presenteeism was more frequent than absenteeism, according to the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire-General Health (WPAI-GH) [17.4% vs. 6.3%], while physical demands and time management were the most affected Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) subscales [means (SD) 23. (28.) and 17.7 (24.9), respectively]. The estimated annual cost per patient was USD 4034. Direct medical costs accounted for 87.7% of this estimate, direct non-medical costs for 2.4%, and indirect costs for 9.9%.Results evidenced that moderate to severe plaque  imposes substantial costs to society. Our data showed that this disease negatively affects both work productivity and HRQoL of Brazilian patients. Subgroups with PsA and biologic-naïve patients presented lower HRQoL, showing the impact of this comorbidity and the relevance of biologics in  treatment.Novartis Biociências S.A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414705>One stone, two birds: Improvement of early-onset vitiligo under apremilast in a patient with plaque .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421033>Composite Measures of Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis: Comparative Instrument Performance Based on the Efficacy of Guselkumab in an Interventional Phase 2 Trial.</a></h2><p>Assess performance of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) composite indices and evaluate guselkumab's effect on achieving low disease activity or remission.In this Phase 2 trial, patients with active PsA (≥3 tender and ≥3 swollen joints, C-reactive protein ≥0.3 mg/dL, ≥3% body-surface-area  involvement) were randomized 2:1 to subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg (N=100) or placebo (N=49) at Week 0, Week 4 and q8w through Week44. At Week 16, patients with <% improvement in swollen and tender joints could early escape (EE) to open-label ustekinumab. Patients continuing placebo crossed-over to receive guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 24, 28, 36, and 44 (placebo→guselkumab). PsA composite indices (Psoriatic ArthritiS Disease Activity Score [PASDAS], GRAppa Composite scorE [GRACE], modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index [mCPDAI], Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis [DAPSA]) were analyzed as secondary outcomes (last-observation-carried-forward for missing/post-EE data through Week 24; observed data post-Week 24). Instrument performance was assessed.Baseline PASDAS, GRACE, mCPDAI, and DAPSA scores indicated moderate-to-high disease activity. At Week 24, mean changes in each of these composite indices demonstrated significant improvement with guselkumab (-2.50, -2.73, -3.8, -23.08, respectively) vs. placebo (-0.49, 0.35, -0.8, -4.98; all p<0.001). Significantly more guselkumab-treated patients achieved low (or very-low/remission) disease activity state(s) per PASDAS (very-low+low 35.0% vs. 4.1%; p<0.001), GRACE (29.6% vs. 2.1%; p<0.001), mCPDAI (45.9% vs. 10.4%, p<0.001), and DAPSA (remission+low 40.0% vs. 12.2%; p<0.001); 12% of guselkumab-treated vs. no placebo-treated patients achieved DAPSA remission (p<0.01). The PASDAS and GRACE instruments were more sensitive than the mCPDAI and DAPSA tools in detecting treatment effect. Residual skin disease and enthesitis were marginally more prominent in patients achieving DAPSA low disease activity versus other indices.Guselkumab demonstrated efficacy in achieving low disease activity/remission based on all PsA composite indices assessed.

The onset of  is bimodal, with one incidence peak (15-30 years) that coincides with the prime reproductive age for women, which poses specific challenges for their treatment. However, well-established guidelines for the treatment of women of childbearing age are lacking. Many women experience stabilization (21%) or improvement (55%) of their skin during pregnancy, but up to a quarter can experience disease worsening, and postpartum flares are common (> 50%). Therefore, balancing the risk of treatment with the risk of uncontrolled disease is important. Because half of pregnancies are unplanned, the implications of therapeutic options must be considered for all women with  who are sexually active, irrespective of intentions to start a family. Timely initiation of these discussions by health care professionals is paramount to prevent unintentional toxicity to the developing fetus. For example, acitretin, methotrexate, and oral psoralen/ultraviolet A are all contraindicated in pregnancy. Reassuringly, safety data for other  treatments during pregnancy are increasingly available, particularly for anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies. Despite encouraging data from pregnancy exposure registries and clinical studies now being included in anti-tumor necrosis factor drug labels, comfort with prescribing these therapies to pregnant women remains low (U.S. dermatologists: 21%; EU- dermatologists: 10%).

Lifestyle changes may improve .To assess the effects of lifestyle changes for , including weight reduction, alcohol abstinence, smoking cessation, dietary modification, exercise, and other lifestyle change interventions.We searched the following databases up to July 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Airiti Library, and five trials registers up to July 2018. We checked the references of included trials for further relevant trials, and we asked the authors of the included trials if they were aware of any relevant unpublished data.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lifestyle changes (either alone or in combination) for treating  in people diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Treatment had to be given for at least 12 weeks. Eligible comparisons were no lifestyle changes or another active intervention.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 'Severity of ' and 'Adherence to the intervention'. Secondary outcomes were 'Quality of life', 'Time to relapse', and 'Reduction in comorbidities'. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.We included 10 RCTs with 1163 participants (mean age: 43 to 61 years; 656 men and 478 women were reported). Six trials examined the effects of dietary intervention (low-calorie diet) in 499 obese participants (mean age: 44.3 to 61 years; where reported, 395 had moderate-to-severe ). One trial assessed a combined dietary intervention and exercise programme in 303 obese participants with moderate-to-severe  who had started a systemic therapy for  and had not achieved clearance after four weeks of continuous treatment (median age: 53 years). Another trial assessed a walking exercise and continuous health education in 200 participants (mean age: 43.1 years, severity not reported). Finally, two trials included education programmes promoting a healthy lifestyle in 161 participants (aged 18 to 78 years), with one trial on mild  and the other trial not reporting severity.Comparisons included information only; no intervention; medical therapy alone; and usual care (such as continuing healthy eating).All trials were conducted in hospitals and treated participants for between 12 weeks and three years. One trial did not report the treatment period. Seven trials measured the outcomes at the end of treatment and there was no additional follow-up. In two trials, there was follow-up after the treatment ended. Five trials had a high risk of performance bias, and four trials had a high risk of attrition bias.We found no trials assessing interventions for alcohol abstinence or smoking cessation. No trials assessed time to relapse. Only two trials assessed adverse events; in one trial these were caused by the add-on therapy ciclosporin (given in both groups). The trial comparing two dietary interventions to a no-treatment group observed no adverse events.The results presented in this abstract are based on trials of obese participants.Outcomes for dietary interventions versus usual care were measured 24 weeks to six months from baseline. Compared to usual care, dietary intervention (strict caloric restriction) may lead to 75% or greater improvement from baseline in the  Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.58; 2 trials, 323 participants; low-quality evidence). Adherence to the intervention may be greater with the dietary intervention than usual care, but the 95% CI indicates that the dietary intervention might also make little or no difference (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.09; 2 trials, 105 participants; low-quality evidence). Dietary intervention probably achieves a greater improvement in dermatology quality-of-life index (DLQI) score compared to usual care (MD -12.20, 95% CI -13.92 to -10.48; 1 trial, 36 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and probably reduces the BMI compared to usual care (MD -4.65, 95% CI -.93 to -3.36; 2 trials, 78 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Outcomes for dietary interventions plus exercise programme were measured 16 weeks from baseline and are based on one trial (303 participants). Compared to information only (on reducing weight to improve ), combined dietary intervention and exercise programme (dietetic plan and physical activities) probably improves  severity, but the 95% CI indicates that the intervention might make little or no difference (PASI 75: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.98). This combined intervention probably results in a greater reduction in BMI (median change -1.10 kg/m², P = 0.002), but there is probably no difference in adherence (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01; 137/151 and 145/152 participants adhered in the treatment and control group, respectively). There were no data on quality of life. These outcomes are based on moderate-quality evidence.Dietary intervention may reduce the severity of  (low-quality evidence) and probably improves quality of life and reduces BMI (moderate-quality evidence) in obese people when compared with usual care, while combined dietary intervention and exercise programme probably improves  severity and BMI when compared with information only (moderate-quality evidence). None of the trials measured quality of life.We did not detect a clear difference in treatment adherence between those in the combined dietary intervention and exercise programme group and those given information only (moderate-quality evidence). Adherence may be improved through dietary intervention compared with usual care (low-quality evidence). Participants generally adhered well to the lifestyle interventions assessed in the review.No trials assessed the time to relapse. Trial limitations included unblinded participants and high dropout rate.Future trials should reduce dropouts and include comprehensive outcome measures; they should examine whether dietary intervention with or without an exercise programme is effective in non-obese people with , whether an additional exercise programme is more effective than dietary intervention alone, whether the time to relapse prolongs in people who receive dietary intervention with or without exercise programme, and whether smoking cessation and alcohol abstinence are effective in treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622222>Formulation and evaluation of polyherbal cream and lotion to treat -induced secondary infections.</a></h2><p> is one of the most common skin diseases in human and affected a major population worldwide. <P> Aim: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of selected polyherbal formulations against -induced secondary infections. <P> Methods: Samples were collected from the scalp, behind the ears, chest and back of the patients.

For high degree malignant skin tumors, if not detected in time, they can do serious harm to patients' health. However, in clinical practice, identifying malignant degree requires biopsy and pathological examination which is time costly. Furthermore, in many areas, due to the severe shortage of dermatologists, it's inconvenient for patients to go to hospital for examination. Therefore, an easy to access screening method of malignant skin tumors is needed urgently. Firstly, we spend  years to build a dataset which includes 4,500 images of 10 kinds of skin tumors. All instances are verified pathologically thus trustworthy; Secondly, we label each instance to be either low-risk, high-risk or dangerous in which Junctional nevus, Intradermal nevus, Dermatofibroma, Lipoma and Seborrheic keratosis are low-risk, Basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and Actinic keratosis are high-risk, Squamous cell carcinoma and Malignant melanoma are dangerous; Thirdly, we apply the Xception architecture to build the risk degree classifier. The area under the curve (AUC) for three risk degrees reach 0.959, 0.919 and 0.947 respectively. To further evaluate the validity of the proposed risk degree classifier, we conduct a competition with 20 professional dermatologists. The results showed the proposed classifier outperforms dermatologists. Our system is helpful to patients in preliminary screening. It can identify the patients who are at risk and alert them to go to hospital for further examination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544068>Oral Tofacitinib: Contemporary Appraisal of Its Role in Dermatology.</a></h2><p>Tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor (Jakinib), is an emerging treatment modality whose well-established efficacy in systemic inflammatory diseases is now being actively explored for cutaneous disorders (arising due to the patient's dysimmune responses) that are not responding to and/or sustaining intolerable adverse effects with the classical immunosuppressives and other targeted therapies such as the biologics.

For  patients, current recommendations are to avoid having a tattoo if the disease is active and they are receiving immunosuppressive treatments. Although scientific data supporting these recommendations are lacking, dermatologists are often reluctant to advocate tattooing in  patients.We aimed to evaluate the frequency of tattoo complications in patients with  and determine whether the occurrence of complications was associated with  status and treatments received at the time of tattooing.We performed a multicentre cross-sectional study. Adults with  were consecutively included and classified as tattooed or non-tattooed. Prevalence of complications associated with tattoos was then evaluated according to  onset and treatments. The study was divided into three parts, in which data were collected through a series of questionnaires filled in by the dermatologist. Complications included pruritus, oedema, allergic reaction/eczema, infection/superinfection, granuloma, lichenification, photosensitivity, Koebner phenomenon and  flare after tattooing. Diagnosis of complications was made retrospectively.We included 2053 psoriatic patients, 20.2% had 894 tattoos. Amongst non-tattooed patients, 15.4% had wished to be tattooed, with  being stated as a reason for not having a tattoo by 44.0% and .7% indicating that they planned to have a tattoo in the future. Local complications, such as oedema, pruritus, allergy and Koebner phenomenon, were reported in tattoos in 6.6%, most frequently in patients with  requiring treatment at the time of tattooing (P < 0.0001). No severe complications were reported.The rate of tattoo complications in  patients was low. Although the risk of complications was highest amongst patients with  requiring treatment at the time of tattooing, all the complications observed were benign.

Despite constant progress in therapy of these diseases, affected people often do not consult an office-based dermatologist.The aim of this study was to estimate which proportion of affected individuals with severe forms of these diseases receive treatment by an office-based dermatologist in Bavaria.All dermatologists listed in the database of the Bavarian Association of Panel Doctors (KVB; Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Bayern; n = 499) were invited to participate in a paper-based cross-sectional study. The stated number of patients by each dermatologist were set in relation with the literature-based 1‑year prevalence, as well as data on population and data of the KVB. Estimations were based on three approaches (conservative, medium, and progressive estimation method).Overall, 137 dermatologists participated (38.7% women; mean age: 53.2 ± 8. years). Conservative estimation indicated that 56.% of individuals with moderate to severe , 57.3% of individuals with moderate to severe atopic eczema and 71.9% of those suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria are not seen by an office-based dermatologist.Many affected individuals seem not to seek an office-based dermatologist when affected by a severe skin condition.

This study was designed to investigate the role and related mechanisms of matrine alone and in combination with acitretin in the treatment of  in vitro and in vivo.HaCaT cells were treated with matrine at different concentrations of 0 (blank control), 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/mL for 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)--(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium cell viability assay was used to assess the growth and proliferation of HaCaT cells. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Expression of protein was detected by Western blotting. Autophagy was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Then HaCaT cells were assigned to normal saline (NS) control group, matrine (0.4 mg/mL) group, acitretin (10 μmol/L) group, and matrine plus acitretin group, and the above methods were repeated. In animal experiments, the cumulative score (erythema, scaling, thickening) as a measure of the severity of inflammation was used to measure the skin performance of mice after treated with matrine 50 mg/kg, acitretin 4. mg/kg or combination of the two drugs on the -like mouse models, respectively. Pathological findings of the lesions were observed, and the protein expressions in the lesions were detected by immunohistochemistry.Cell proliferation inhibition was seen in HaCaT cells with treatment of matrine in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.01, respectively). Cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest was observed in a dose-dependent way (P < 0.01). The expression of p21 (P < 0.05), LC3II/I (P < 0.01), and Beclin 1 (P < 0.01) increased and the expression of cyclin D1 (P < 0.05) decreased with increasing doses of matrine. Compared with the blank control, more autophagosomes were seen in HaCaT cells treated with matrine at 0.4 mg/mL by transmission electron microscopy (2.667 ± 1.202 vs. 21.33 ± 1.453, t = 9.899, P < 0.01). Cell proliferation inhibition and degree of the G0/G1 phase arrest was significantly higher in matrine plus acitretin group than those in matrine, acitretin, or the NS control group (P < 0.01, respectively). Compared with matrine or acitretin group, the expression of p21 (P < 0.05, P < 0.05) and LC3II/I (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) in matrine plus acitretin group increased significantly and the expression of cyclin D1 (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and p62 (P < 0.05, P < 0.05) was reduced significantly. Compared with matrine or acitretin, matrine plus acitretin significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (P < 0.05) and its downstream p-p70S6K (P < 0.05).

The primary objective was to evaluate whether IXE was superior to ADA at week 24 for simultaneous achievement of a ≥50% improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) and a 100% improvement from baseline in the  Area and Severity Index (PASI100). Major secondary objectives, also at week 24, were to evaluate whether IXE was: (1) non-inferior to ADA for achievement of ACR50 and (2) superior to ADA for PASI100 response. Additional PsA, skin, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcome measures were assessed at week 24.The primary efficacy endpoint was met (IXE: 36%, ADA: 28%; p=0.036). IXE was non-inferior for ACR50 response (IXE: 51%, ADA: 47%; treatment difference: 3.9%) and superior for PASI100 response (IXE: 60%, ADA: 47%; p=0.001). IXE had greater response versus ADA in additional PsA, skin, nail, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcomes.

Patient characteristics associated with higher treatment response were analysed by regression analyses. Improvements in absolute PASI, DLQI and EQ-5D were assessed in different PASI percentage response levels.High PASI percentage response was associated with higher PASI before switch and lower body mass index. DLQI and EQ-5D improved within all responder groups (P < 0·001). The magnitude of improvements in DLQI (P = 0·02) differed between responder groups. The mean (SD) DLQI improvements for PASI 75<90 responders, PASI 90<100 responders and patients achieving complete skin clearance (PASI 100) were 9·9 (7·4), 11· (7·0) and 8·0 (6·1), respectively.PASI percentage change is largely dependent on absolute PASI before switch. Patients in clinical practice lack 'baseline' PASI values as they may switch directly from one treatment to another or stay successfully treated for a longer time period. Treatment goals such as PASI 90 are thus not suitable for treatment guidelines or for follow-up in clinical practice. What's already known about this topic? Randomized clinical trials of biologics as well as treatment guidelines include treatment goals based on a percentage improvement compared with baseline  Area and Severity Index (PASI), such as PASI 75 or PASI 90. Few studies have assessed which factors are associated with high skin clearance rates, or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improvements associated with different levels of skin clearance in clinical practice. What does this study add? A high absolute PASI before switch to biologics and low body mass index are associated with higher PASI percentage response. Few patients with baseline PASI >30 achieved complete skin clearance (CSC). All responder groups achieved significant HRQoL improvements. Patients achieving CSC (PASI 100) had lower absolute PASI before switch and lower improvements in absolute PASI and HRQoL than patients with almost cleared skin. What are the clinical implications of this work? Relative measures based on PASI percentage, such as PASI 75 or PASI 90, are not suitable for treatment guidelines or for follow-up in clinical practice.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301682>Atopic dermatitis shows significant cutaneous comorbidity: results from large-scale investigations in the working population.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases of the skin.

Multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression analysis demonstrated that predictors for a longer relapse-free duration were baseline PASI, PASI improvement, biologic naivety, and early biologic intervention. Patients who received early biologic intervention, who achieved PASI 90, and who were biologic naive showed significantly higher relapse-free rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank test.Systemic treatment was required in 86.1% of patients within 12 months after biologic withdrawal and biologics were reinitiated in 77.1% of patients after 3 years.

The optimal technique to provide an adequate and acceptable skin dose as well as its feasibility were evaluated by an end-to-end exercise using a perspex finger phantom. The accuracy and reliability of MOSFET dose measurement was explored with a thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD) before being used  to monitor skin doses during treatment delivery for each BT fraction.Using custom-made surface mold (2.4 mm Med-Tec thermoplastic mask for hand fixation and  applicators attached to each finger for dose delivery), the optimal skin dose on the phantom was obtained without the need for additional bolus to increase thickness of applicator. We acquired mean skin doses at different skin depths from various dose-volume parameters of no-bolus and 3 mm-added bolus plans. They were 125% and 110% (1 mm), 120% and 108% (2 mm), and 114% and 106% (3 mm), respectively. There was excellent agreement between MOSFET and TLD for Ir HDR-BT within ±3% (mean 2.65%, SD = 2.05%). With no energy correction, MOSFET overestimated the Acuros BV surface doses by up to 7% in the phantom study and in the clinical case.We demonstrated achievable HDR-BT for our first case of nail bed . The end-to-end exercise was an efficient methodology to evaluate new feasibility for this technique.

Erianin, a bibenzyl compound extracted from , has displayed antitumor and anti-angiogenesis effects. However, the effects of erianin on a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) are not fully understood. In the present study, we explored the effect of erianin on proliferation and apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Our results indicated that treatment with erianin ranging from 12. nM to 50 nM inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HaCaT cells. In addition, erianin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger -acetyl-cysteine (NAC) attenuated this elevation. Moreover, treatment with erianin induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling pathway and suppressed the protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, while pretreatment with NAC also reversed these effects. Collectively, these data demonstrated that erianin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HaCaT cells through ROS-mediated JNK/c-Jun and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.

In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying sudachitin-induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Sudachitin activated p38MAPK and inhibited ERK1/2, whereas another polymethoxyflavone, nobiletin (,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone), activated ERK1/2. The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 significantly attenuated sudachitin-induced heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation, downstream of p38MAPK, and subsequent apoptosis, indicating that sudachitin induces apoptosis via the p38MAPK pathway. Additionally, sudachitin inhibited serum- and EGF-stimulated Raf-1-ERK1/2 activation, and blocked EGF-induced cell migration and proliferation in HaCaT cells. These results suggest that small structural differences in polymethoxyflavones can induce different cellular responses by altering the regulation of MAPK activities and that sudachitin may be a potential candidate for developing new drugs for skin diseases such as .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It was originally used to indicate religious beliefs, tribal affiliation, loyalty to a leader, or had a therapeutic function. Adverse reactions from tattooing are common, and cutaneous reactions to red pigment have been widely reported (1,2). Herein we report a case of a 30-year-old female patient admitted to our Department of Dermatology for a reaction to a tattoo localized at the violet and black areas of the tattoo on the upper part of her left leg. The patient reported that the tattoo had been made two years earlier, but the cutaneous alterations appeared after she decided to change the color from pink to violet. On physical examination, multiple erythematous nodular itching lesions were present at the areas of the tattoo in which the violet and black color were used (Figure 1). She had undergone antibiotic therapy without resolution after which topical corticosteroids were applied with temporary remission of signs and symptoms. Personal and familial medical history were negative. The patient reported a jewelry allergy that had never been investigated. Based on the suspicion of an allergic reaction we decided to execute a patch test SIDAPA series and patch test special tattoo series (copper sulfate 1% water, dimetilaminoazobenzene-p 1%, aminoazotoluene-o 1%, blue scattered 3 1%, blue scattered 124 1%, yellow scattered 3 1%, orange scattered 3 1%, red scattered 1 1%, gentian violet 2%, cadmium chloride 1% in water, nickel sulphate %, iron chloride 2% in water, potassium dichromate 0.%, chromium trichloride 2%, aminoazobenzene-p 0.25%, cobalt chloride 1%, aluminum chloride 2%, titanium dioxide 0.1%, zinc 2.%, mercury chloride 0.05% in water, kathon cg 0.01% in water, phenol 0.%, ethylenediamine hydrochloride1%, phenylenediamine base-p 1%, formaldehyde 1% in water, phthalic anhydride 1%, rosin 20%, dibutyl phthalate %, hexamethylenetetramine 1%, benzophenone %). Both series of patch test showed positivity for nickel sulfate % at 48 hours (++) and 72 hours (+++). We then performed a 4 mm punch biopsy of the nodular lesions localized at the black and violet areas. The histological examination revealed dermal sclerosis characterized by inflammatory reaction with lympho-mononuclear infiltration in the perivasal zone. Macrophages with red and black pigment were present. The histological pattern was compatible with a granulomatous reaction. Tattooing can result in a wide variety of complications, whose prevalence and incidence still remain unclear. Some authors (3) classify such cutaneous complications in various ways, such as according to: - the length of their evolution: acute and chronic reactions; - the delay of onset after tattooing: early - during the healing phase - or delayed - after tattoo healing; - the type of reaction: infection, hypersensitivity reaction, etc. The practice of tattooing may have local or systemic complications. Dermatoses such as , systemic erythematous lupus, sarcoidosis, lichen planus, and pseudo-epitheliomatous hyperplasia can be localized in the area of the tattoo, but allergic sensitivity to one of the pigments is the most frequent cause of dermatological reactions in the site of tattoo (4,). In fact, adverse reactions to tattoo pigments, especially the red one, are well-described in literature. Furthermore, these compounds frequently contain components which are not systematically characterized. In our case, the granulomatous reaction did not correspond to an allergic reaction to the pigment. In fact, the patch test was negative for all pigments investigated, only showing a positive result for nickel sulfate. However, the specific and well-defined localization of the nodular lesions on the black and violet areas led us to hypothesize that the tattoo pigments in these areas contained some unknown component causing the reaction. In our opinion, a possible explanation could be that the new pigment that had been used contained a small amount of nickel sulfate, which caused the granulomatous reaction. In conclusion, we presented this clinical case to emphasize the widespread incidence of tattoo-related adverse effects, which are mostly caused by red pigment. Dermatologists should constantly strive familiarize themselves with current research on this practice and its complications. On the other hand, people with potential risk factors for adverse reactions should refer to a specialist before getting tattoos. Tattooists should use a checklist and informed consent to screen people with such potential risk factors. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform additional studies concerning ink and pigment components, with the aim of systemically characterizing the substances used in tattoos. Lastly, as emphasized by our case, patients at risk should referred to the dermatologist not only before getting a new tattoo but also in case of color changes in a pre-existing tattoo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504363>Global prevalence and bidirectional association between  and inflammatory bowel disease - A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies have established an association between  and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), i.e. ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) but results are inconsistent.

These two cohorts were compared with two adult cohorts recruited from the PsA clinic: axPsA (radiographic sacroiliitis: ⩾bilateral grade 2 or unilateral grade 3 or 4); and Peripheral PsA. All patients were followed prospectively according to the same protocol. The demographic, clinical and radiographic variables were compared. Adjusted means were used to account for varying intervals between visits. A logistic regression was performed and adjusted for follow-up duration.There were 477 axPsA patients, 826 peripheral PsA, 675 AS and 91 ASP patients included. AS patients were younger (P < 0.001), more male and HLA-B*27 positive (76%, 72% vs 64%, P ⩽ 0.001, 82%, 75%, vs 19%, P = 0.001). They had more back pain at presentation (90%, 92% vs 19%, P = 0.001), worse axial disease activity scores (bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index: 4.1, 3.9 vs 3. P = 0.017), worse back metrology (bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index: 2.9, 2.2 vs 1.8, P < 0.001), worse physician global assessments (2.4, 2.2 vs 2.1, P < 0.001), were treated more with biologics (29%, 21% vs 7%, P = 0.001) and had a higher grade of sacroiliitis (90%, 84% vs 51%, P < 0.001). Similar differences were detected in the comparison of ASP to axPsA and in a regression model.AS patients, with or without , seem to be different demographically, genetically, clinically and radiographically from axPsA patients. axPsA seems to be a distinct entity.© The Author(s) 2019.

To answer this question, we develop a method for computing similarities between empirical, statistical distributions of high-dimensional, low-sample datasets, and apply it on hundreds of -omics studies. The similarities lead to dataset-to-dataset networks visualizing the landscape of a large portion of biological data. Potentially interesting similarities connecting studies of different diseases are assembled in a disease-to-disease network. Exploring it, we discover numerous non-trivial connections between Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, asthma and , or liver cancer and obesity, to name a few. We then present a method that identifies the molecular quantities and pathways that contribute the most to the identified similarities and could point to novel drug targets or provide biological insights.

By inducing glycosuria, SGLT2i predispose to genital infections. In addition, rare occurrence of Fournier's gangrene (FG) has been reported. We aimed to investigate such association through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event (AE) reporting system (FAERS).We mined the FAERS up to 2018q3 (before FDA warning about SGLT2i-associated FG) to retrieve reports including FG as an AE and SGLT2i as suspect or concomitant drugs, and calculated proportional reporting ratios (PRR).We retrieved 47 cases of FG and 17 cases of other severe AEs of the genital area associated with SGLT2i. Patients with FG were ~10 years older than those with other severe genital AEs. Overall, 77% occurred in men. Three patients were concomitantly treated with systemic immunosuppressive drugs. Increased reporting frequency emerged for SGLT2i compared with other drugs, with a PRR ranging from  to 10. The disproportional reporting of FG with SGLT2i remained robust and consistently significant when restricting to the period when SGLT2i were available, to reports filed for glucose-lowering medications or for drugs with the diabetes indication, and after refining the definition of FG. FG was disproportionally associated with  and with the combination of immunosuppressants and SGLT2i.Although causality cannot be demonstrated, SGLT2i may predispose to FG and other severe genital AEs. Since the use of SGLT2i is expected to increase significantly, clinicians should be aware of these severe, although rare, AEs and their predisposing factors.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Recent discoveries highlighted that an appropriate diagnostic workup is fundamental to identify an underlying immune dysregulation such as primary immunodeficiencies or a rheumatological disease. We hereby describe clinical features and laboratory results of 12 pediatric patients affected by ES referred to the Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit of Bologna. Patients experienced a median of four acute episodes of cytopenia with 9 years as median age at the onset of symptoms. In 8/12 (67%) patients an underlying etiology, primary immunodeficiencies, or rheumatological disease was identified. In 4/12 children, other immune manifestations were associated (Thyroiditis, Celiac disease, , Vitiligo, Myositis, Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis). ES remained the primary diagnosis in four patients (33%). At a median follow-up time of 4 years, /12 (42%) patients revealed a chronic ITP, partially responsive to second line therapy. Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy (IRT) was effective with a good hematological values control in three patients with a secondary ES (ALPS, CVID, and a patient with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome and a progressive severe B cell deficiency with hypogammaglobulinemia). Our experience highlights that, in pediatric patients, ES is often only the first manifestation of an immunological or rheumatological disease, especially when cytopenias are persistent or resistant to therapy, with an early-onset or when are associated with lymphadenopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389366>Judicial precedents on medicolegal disputes arising from  treatment in South Korea.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594178>[Fecal microbiota transplantation as a novel therapy for severe ].</a></h2><p>To explore the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe .

The nonradiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis diseases' activity has a comparable impact on the patients' quality of life and from the practical point of view the approach to treatment of each of them is the same. The aim: The attempt to identify the reasons of diagnostic delays of AS among patients hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases Department in Lublin and to suggest the ways of improving the accuracy of diagnostic track among other healthcare providers than rheumatologists.Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of 82 patients' with the established diagnosis of AS, hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases Department in Lublin in 2000-2019, and of 45 years of age and older.Results: From among 82 patients (28 women and 54 men) the diagnosis of AS after 45 years of age was established in 25 patients (10 women and 15 men) - group t, and in the other 57 patients (group n) the diagnosis was established before 45 years of age. On average the age at the time of diagnosis in the whole group (t+n) was 40,7±10,2 (18-76) years, the age at the beginning of inflammatory back pain (age of axial symptoms) was 30,9±8, (13-51) years and the diagnostic delay (period between first axial symptoms and diagnosis establishment) was 9,75±9, (0-46) years. We did not find any statistically significant associations between sex and age at the moment of diagnosis, age of the beginning of axial symptoms and the time of diagnostic delay. There was no significant difference of incidence of enthesitis, uveitis, arthritis, prevalence of family history of spondyloarthritis and CRP level between group t and n. Antigen HLA B27 was more frequently present in group t.Conclusions: Instead of the recognition progress and worldwide popularization of knowledge about axSpA, the diagnostic delays in this field are still estimated to last many years, the patients are looking for other specialists' help, and they can be not knowledgeable of the inflammatory back pain criteria. Currently, HLA B27 antigen and C-reactive protein are the two most commonly used biomarkers for diagnostic and disease activity monitoring purposes of axSpA and magnetic resonance is the only "imaging biomarker".

Expression levels of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in skin biopsy materials of 40 AOSD patients, 10 patients with eczema, or 10 , and 10 HC skin were evaluated with immunohistochemistry.The serum CXCL12 levels in patients with AOSD (2,452±1,531 pg/mL) were higher than those in HC (1,708±1,322 pg/mL, p=0.017). The serum sCXCR4 levels in patients with AOSD (14,449±16,627 pg/mL) were higher than those in HC (3,046±2,554 pg/mL, p<0.001). Serum CXCL12 levels correlated positively with counts of leukocytes and neutrophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Serum sCXCR4 levels correlated positively with systemic scores, platelet counts, and CRP levels.

Correspondingly, several monoclonal antibodies against IL-23 are either in development or approved for autoimmune indications such as . Despite being a clinical validated target, IL-23 pharmacokinetics (e.g., IL-23 synthesis and elimination rates) and the degree of target suppression (i.e., decrease in free "active" IL-23) associated with clinical efficacy are not well understood, primarily due to its ultra-low circulating levels and the lack of sensitive and accurate measurement methods. In the current work, this issue was overcome by using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to measure the concentration and pharmacokinetics of human recombinant [C]-IL-23 following an intravenous trace-dose in cynomolgus monkeys. IL-23 pharmacokinetic parameters along with clinical drug exposure and IL-23 binding affinities from four different anti-IL-23 antibodies (ustekinumab, tildrakizumab, guselkumab, and risankizumab) were used to build a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model to assess the time course of free IL-23 over one year in  patients following different dosing regimens.

Serine protease activities are tightly regulated by serine proteases such as kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and serine protease inhibitors such as lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI). For a better understating of diseases' pathogenesis, the regulation mechanism of serine proteases and the inhibitors' expression in epidermal keratinocytes must be clarified.To investigate the effects of the cytokines on the expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes.Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were stimulated with panels of inflammatory cytokines. The expression of serine protease inhibitors was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. LEKTI expression in normal human skin and lesions from  or atopic dermatitis (AD) were analyzed by immunohistochemically and tape-stripping. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine protease activities in culture supernatants were measured by using specific substrates.TNF-α and IL-17A significantly induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The immunohistochemical and tape-stripping analysis revealed that psoriatic skin lesions had higher LEKTI expression compared to normal skin and AD lesions. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease activities in the culture media were upregulated 3- days later but attenuated 6-7 days later period by these cytokines.In epidermal keratinocytes, the Th1&Th17 cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A induce the expression of serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, and it might occur to suppress the increase in the serine protease activities under inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

We also determined the rate of the expression of a NFKBIZ transcript lacking exon 10 relative to the normal transcript in 60 patients (27 non-responders). In addition, because the intron indel could affect RNA splicing, we investigated whether the level of the alternative transcript was related to the intronic genotype.The NFKBIZ polymorphism was associated with adalimumab response, with carriers of the deletion allele significantly more frequent among responders (odds ratio = 2.76, 95% confidence interval 1.19-6.43; p = 0.015). The presence of the HLA-CW6 allele was also associated with a positive response in our cohort (p = 0.018). The alternative transcript was amplified in all the samples.

Because patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are also important, we aimed to achieve consensus on a PROM for clinical practice.Patients and providers participated in a consensus-building study using a modified-Delphi technique. Voting focused on identifying: (i)minimal set of assessments for clinical practice; (ii)patient-global assessments (PtGAs); (iii)Skindex instruments; and (iv)final instrument selection for quality improvement.Among 53 stakeholders, >70% agreed that identification of patient goals, assessment of treatment harm and assessment of the adequacy of treatment response were the minimal assessments for clinical practice. The most preferred PtGA was a -point PtGA (0=clear to 4=severe) with an optional check-box: "worst ever". A new metric assessing change since treatment initiation called "trajectory measure" was proposed. Stakeholders preferred Skindex instruments over PtGAs and a trajectory measure for clinical practice.PtGAs as standalone measures do not adequately capture the patient's assessment of disease severity or impact of care.

PTSD has been observed in patients with sudden-onset, life-altering or life-threatening health conditions ranging from cancer and asthma to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, but has not been evaluated in chronic, relapsing inflammatory dermatologic diseases such as autoimmune bullous disease. PTSD may also directly impact immune function and a wide range of immune based disorders; previous studies of PTSD patients have reported a higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders, such as ..© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488208>The use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of nail disease among patients with  and psoriatic arthritis: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Nail involvement has been described as a key clinical feature for both  (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and is an important risk factor in PsA. Thus, early diagnosis of nail involvement may be essential for better management of PsO and PsA. Ultrasonography is considered a highly promising method to visualize nail disease. The main aim of this review was to evaluate the use of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of nail disease in patients with PsO and PsA by reviewing ultrasound parameters with the best diagnostic accuracy. Main body of the abstract: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE via the PubMed and LILACS databases. Conference proceedings of relevant rheumatology scientific meetings were also screened.After applying eligibility criteria, only 13 articles and  abstracts were included in this review. The selected studies showed a huge variability in evaluation methods (and therefore in the results) and were mainly focused on the assessment of nails ultrasound parameters that may differ among patients and healthy controls, especially the morphological aspects in B-mode ultrasonography and vascularization of the nail bed by Doppler ultrasonography. Our research indicated that the evaluation of nail disease in PsO and PsA is still underrepresented in the literature, probably reflecting a restricted use in clinical practice, despite the widespread use of ultrasonography in the management of chronic arthritis.Despite the potential relevance of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of nail disease, additional studies are needed to determine which features are more reliable and clinically pertinent to ensure accuracy in the evaluation of nail involvement in PsO and PsA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385013>Association of aortic vascular uptake of FDG by PET/CT and aortic wall thickness by MRI in : a prospective observational study.</a></h2><p>The contribution of inflammation to the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been increasingly recognized in recent years. We investigated the relationship of aortic vascular uptake of 18F-FDG by PET/CT and aortic wall thickness (AWT) by MRI in , a chronic inflammatory disease with increased incidence of CVD. One hundred sixty-five patients with plaque  participated in an ongoing longitudinal cohort study. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed as aortic uptake of 18F-FDG by PET/CT reported as target-to-background ratio (TBR) and AWT by MRI reported as maximal thickness.Patients with  were middle aged, predominantly male, and had mild CV risk by traditional risk factors.  severity as measured by PASI score was a notable determinant of AWT (ρ = 0.20, p = 0.01). Moreover, aortic vascular uptake of 18F-FDG associated with AWT by MRI at baseline in unadjusted analysis (β = 0.27 p = 0.001) and following adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, waist-to-hip ratio, and statin use (β = 0.21 p = 0.01). Finally, following 1 year of  treatment, a decrease in aortic vascular uptake of 18F-FDG was associated with a reduction in AWT in fully adjusted models (β = 0.33, p = 0.02).In conclusion, we demonstrate that  severity and aortic vascular uptake of 18F-FDG in the aorta were associated with AWT. Following treatment of , a decrease in aortic vascular uptake of 18F-FDG was associated with a reduction in AWT at 1 year. These findings suggest that aortic vascular uptake of 18F-FDG is associated with early evidence of vascular disease assessed by aortic wall thickness. Prospective studies in larger populations including other inflammatory diseases are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538737>Fluorescence optical imaging for the detection of potential psoriatic arthritis in comparison to musculoskeletal ultrasound.</a></h2><p>Comparison of fluorescence optical imaging (FOI) with grayscale (GS) and power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) to detect joint inflammation in patients with confirmed or suspected psoriatic arthritis (PsA).Patients (n = 60) with  and tenderness and/or swelling of joints were separated into two groups: diagnosis confirmed by the treating dermatologist before the start of the study (n = 26), and suspected PsA (n = 34). GS/PDUS of the hand most clinically affected was performed with a dorsal/palmar view (wrist, MCP, PIP, DIP2-). FOI examination was carried out in a standardized manner by analyzing the predefined Phases 1-3.FOI was found to be more sensitive than ultrasound (US) for detection of inflammation in PIP/DIP joints (p = 0.035). Confirmed PsA patients showed more findings in FOI P2 and P3, while suspected PsA patients showed more findings in P1. In the confirmed PsA group, most involved joints were MCP joints, while in the suspected PsA group, more involved wrist joints and DIP joints (p = 0.006) were detected with FOI.The differences between the confirmed and suspected groups indicate that FOI is helpful in the detection of early PsA since P1 may correspond to acute inflammation, whereas P2 and P3 enhancement reflect chronic inflammation. Fluorescence optical imaging might therefore be a novel diagnostic tool for early PsA diagnosis.© 2019 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG).

We then harvested the ears and subjected them to toluidine blue staining and real-time PCR.Topical application of imiquimod increased the  Area and Severity Index score as well as the frequency and duration of self-scratching. Regarding internal factors, increases in mast cells number and mRNA expression of NGF and endogenous pruritogenic peptide precursor were confirmed.Self-scratching behavior is accompanied by increased number of mast cells and expression of NGF and endogenous pruritogenic peptides in our imiquimod-induced  model. The expression of these factors was consistent with the features in patients with pruritic , suggesting that our model reflects at least some of the precipitating factors of pruritus found in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469020>Outcomes of prolonged and low-dose ciclosporin in an Asian population.</a></h2><p> Ciclosporin is used in dermatology for a variety of conditions. Existing guidelines commonly recommend a starting dose of 3- mg/kg/day.  We sought to assess response in our cohort of patients in whom lower doses of ciclosporin were used, and compare the efficacy and side effect profile with existing literature.  We retrospectively studied the use of ciclosporin (cyclosporine A) in our dermatological center. Ciclosporin dose trajectories and changes in disease severity were analyzed.  92 patients were studied (64 with eczema, 17 with ). Mean initiation ciclosporin dose was relatively low at 1.53 mg/kg/day, with an increase to a mean of 2.61 mg/kg/day at 6 months. The median duration of treatment was 180 days (range 3-2160 days, IQR 383). The response was seen as early as 2 weeks, with greatest control of disease at 6 months. 32 patients were on ciclosporin for a period of 1 year or longer, of whom only 1 had a greater than 30% increase in creatinine that crossed the upper limit of normal.  In our population, a lower dose likely resulted in a slower peak to greatest control, but was well tolerated with minimal renal impairment despite a relatively long average period of use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606265>Effects of Interleukin 17A Inhibition on Myocardial Deformation and Vascular Function in .</a></h2><p>Interleukin (IL)-17A activity is implicated in .

At baseline and after 4 and 12 months of treatment, we measured (1) LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), GLS rate (GLSR), GLSR at early diastole, LV twisting, and untwisting; (2) coronary flow reserve (CFR); (3) pulse wave velocity (PWV); and (4) malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl as markers of oxidative stress.Compared with cyclosporine and methotrexate, anti-IL-17A treatment resulted in a greater increase in GLS at 4 and 12 months after treatment (10% and 14% with anti-IL-17A vs 2% and 2% with cyclosporine vs 4% and 4% with methotrexate, respectively), GLSR, GLSR at early diastole (45% and 41% vs % and 4% vs 7% and 9%, respectively), and LV twisting (32% and 28% vs 6% and 8% vs 7% and 6%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Anti-IL-17A treatment resulted in greater improvement of CFR and PWV than cyclosporine or methotrexate (P < 0.05). PWV increased after cyclosporine treatment (+11% at 4 and +14% and 12 months) (P < 0.05). Markers of oxidative stress were reduced only after anti-IL-17A treatment (P < 0.05). Changes of myocardial deformation markers and CFR after anti-IL-17A treatment correlated with a concomitant reduction of oxidative stress.In , inhibition of IL-17A results in a greater improvement of vascular and myocardial function compared with cyclosporine or methotrexate treatment, indicating a beneficial effect on overall cardiovascular function.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

However, the downstream inflammatory effect of LL-37 and KLK- is not as well-studied. In addition, there is little high-quality evidence for the treatment of LL-37- and KLK--mediated inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effect of SOD3 on LL-37- or KLK--induced skin inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and its underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Our data showed that SOD3 significantly reduced both LL-37- and KLK--induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and suppressed the activation of EGFR, PAR2, NLRP3, and p38/ERK signaling pathways in human keratinocytes. Moreover, SOD3 suppressed LL-37-induced expression of inflammatory mediators, ROS production and p38/ERK activation in mast cells. In addition, subcutaneous injection of KLK- in SOD3 knock-out (KO) mice exhibited erythema with increased epidermal thickness, mast cell and neutrophil infiltration, expression of inflammatory mediators and activation of EGFR, PAR2, NLRP3, and downstream MAP kinase pathways. However, treatment with SOD3 in SOD3 KO mice rescued KLK--induced inflammatory cascades. Similarly, KLK--induced inflammations in wild-type mice were also ameliorated when treated with SOD3. Taken together, our data suggest that SOD3 is a potentially effective therapy for both LL-37-and KLK--induced skin inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is important to recognize the different specific cutaneous lesions in SLE (e.g., "butterfly" rash in acute, annular or psoriasiform photosensitive lesions in the subacute form, and discoid lesions in the chronic form) for an early diagnosis and to estimate the associated risks of internal disease, whereas nonspecific lesions (exanthema, vasculitis, and alopecia) can be part of SLE flares. Cutaneous lesions in DM (Gottron's papules and sign, heliotrope rash, dystrophic cuticles, and nailfold capillary abnormalities) may occur before any clinically evident muscular or systemic organ involvement and are of utmost importance for early diagnosis. The pattern of cutaneous lesions and associated autoantibodies also allow the distinction of different phenotypes, either more prone to life-threatening interstitial lung disease (MDA-) or with higher risk for neoplasia (TIF1-γ). Many other skin lesions, although not specific, require further investigation to look for a possible underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease: non-pruritic urticarial lesions in anti-C1q-associated urticarial vasculitis, Still's disease or hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes, transient macular purpura of vasculitis in Sjögren's syndrome, Behçet's disease, or RA, Raynaud's phenomenon in SSc and mixed connective tissue disease, erythema nodosum or other panniculitis in RA, Behçet's disease and SLE, pustular eruptions in Behçet's disease, , and hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes. After reviewing in detail the cutaneous manifestations of the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, we describe a topographic and morphological approach to skin rashes, calling attention to facial rashes, hand involvement, scalp, nail, or leg lesions or to some morphological aspects of skin lesions (annular, pustular, urticarial, or exanthematous) that may be the initial manifestations of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The importance of skin lesions is confirmed by their presence as part of the classification criteria of many inflammatory rheumatic diseases. They also contribute to early diagnosis, to characterize disease phenotypes, to aid in effective patient management, and, ultimately, to impact on disease prognosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although MTX toxicity causes nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, pulmonary fibrosis, and gastrointestinal damage, previous studies have not addressed splenic toxicity. This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of infliximab (INF) against MTX-induced toxicity in splenic tissues via the regulation of CD3, CD68, and C200R. We investigated the effects of MTX on macrophages and T lymphocytes in the spleen at the molecular level and examined the protective potential of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonist INF against MTX toxicity. Three groups of rats were set up. Group 1 received saline solution only, group 2 a single dose of MTX (20 mg/kg), and group 3 INF (7 mg/kg) before administration of a single dose of MTX (20 mg/kg). All injections were given intraperitoneally. Spleen tissues were removed  days after MTX administration and evaluated for CD3, CD68, and CD200R using immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the mean numerical density of CD3+, CD68+, and CD200R+ cells was estimated by a histopathologist using StereoInvestigator 8. MTX increased the numerical densities of CD3+, CD68+, and CD200R+ cells (p < 0.05). We also observed that INF reduced the numerical densities of these cells following MTX administration (p < 0.05). INF may, therefore, be a promising candidate for the prevention of the deleterious effects on spleen tissue of MTX, used in the treatment of RA and cancer.© 2019 S.

Recently data were reported on the use of halobetasol propionate (HP) 0.01% lotion in moderate or severe localized plaque , once-daily for 8 weeks. In addition, a 2-week label-restricted study reported comparable efficacy to HP 0.05% cream. Data evaluating efficacy in specific locations has not been reported and while  commonly affects lower extremities treatment can be more problematic and burden of disease heightened.To investigate the efficacy of a once-daily application of HP 0.01% lotion in comparison with its vehicle in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  of the lower extremities.A post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies in moderate or severe . Subjects (N=234) where the leg was identified as the target lesion were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive HP 0.01% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline) in each individual sign of  (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion (leg) and overall treatment outcomes including at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, and ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’, improvement in Body Surface Area (BSA) and reduction in IGAxBSA. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline, week 4, 8, and 12.At the end of the 8-week treatment period, more than half of subjects had achieved treatment success, with 52.1%, 55.%, and 58.2% of subjects achieving at least a 2-grade reduction in erythema, plaque elevation and scaling severity on the leg, compared with 15.7% and 22.9%, and 22.2% of those treated with vehicle (P<0.001). In addition, overall treatment success (IGA) was achieved in 37.1% of these subjects who had been treated with HP 0.01% lotion compared with 8.4% treated with vehicle (P<0.001); with a corresponding 34.2% reduction in baseline BSA and 50.% change in mean baseline IGAxBSA (both P<0.001 versus vehicle). Overall, a clinically relevant improvement in QoL was achieved by week 4; by week 8 37.7% of subjects where the leg was the target lesion had a clinically meaningful improvement in disease severity (IGAxBSA-75).In conclusion, halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion provides statistically significant efficacy following 8 weeks’ therapy compared with vehicle in subjects where the leg was identified as the target lesion, with clinically relevant improvements in QoL and more than a third of subjects achieving a clinically meaningful result.

Recent literature suggested the use of high doses of biotin for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis. We present four cases that show a misleading increase in thyroid function tests toward a false diagnosis of Grave's disease after the administration of 20-30 mg biotin for different periods. All the four cases are free of the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and all of their results returned to baseline values within 24-48 hours after biotin withdrawal. The assemblage of these cases, thyroid assay results, and biotin doses had occurred by chance, with no selection bias, and they represented all cases of biotin interference with thyroid assays in our center during this year. The first case is a 23-year-old female who was diagnosed with Grave's disease during a routine checkup after she ingested a prescribed 20 mg biotin per day for three months for excessive hair fall. The second case is a 19-year-old female with hair and nail problems associated with iron deficiency anemia. She administered a self-prescribed biotin dose of 20 mg a day for a month. She asked an endocrinologist's opinion about a recent increase in her thyroid function tests, with no signs of hyperthyroidism. The third case is a 45-year-old man with near-total thyroidectomy for retrosternal multinodular goiter with compressive symptoms. His usual levothyroxine dose had been decreased from 100 to 50 microgram per day, after which he felt unwell and gained four kilograms, with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. His investigations were consistent with hyperthyroidism while his signs were of hypothyroidism, which was illogical. He was administered 30 mg medically prescribed biotin for nail changes due to recently diagnosed . The fourth case is that of one of the authors who volunteered to take 30 mg of biotin daily for one week.

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of risankizumab with adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque .IMMvent was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled trial completed at 66 clinics in 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque . Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using interactive response technology to receive 150 mg risankizumab subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 or 80 mg adalimumab subcutaneously at randomisation, then 40 mg at weeks 1, 3, , and every other week thereafter during a 16-week double-blind treatment period (part A). For weeks 16-44 (part B), adalimumab intermediate responders were re-randomised 1:1 to continue 40 mg adalimumab or switch to 150 mg risankizumab. In part A, participants and investigators were masked to study treatment. Randomisation was stratified by weight and previous tumour necrosis factor inhibitor exposure. Co-primary endpoints in part A were a 90% improvement from baseline (PASI 90) and a static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 at week 16, and for part B was PASI 90 at week 44 (non-responder imputation). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in the safety population (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between March 31, 2016, and Aug 24, 2017, 605 patients were randomly assigned to receive either risankizumab (n=301, 50%) or adalimumab (n=304, 50%). 294 (98%) of patients in the risankizumab group and 291 (96%) in the adalimumab group completed part A, and 51 (96%) of 53 patients re-randomised to risankizumab and 51 (91%) of 56 patients re-randomised to continue adalimumab completed part B. At week 16, PASI 90 was achieved in 218 (72%) of 301 patients given risankizumab and 144 (47%) of 304 patients given adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 24·9% [95% CI 17·-32·4]; p<0·0001), and sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were achieved in 252 (84%) patients given risankizumab and 252 (60%) patients given adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 23·3% [16·6-30·1]; p<0·0001). In part B, among adalimumab intermediate responders, PASI 90 was achieved by 35 (66%) of 53 patients switched to risankizumab and 12 (21%) of 56 patients continuing adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 45·0% [28·9-61·1]; p<0·0001) at week 44. Adverse events were reported in 168 (56%) of 301 patients given risankizumab and 179 (57%) of 304 patients given adalimumab in part A, and among adalimumab intermediate responders, adverse events were reported in 40 (75%) of 53 patients who switched to risankizumab and 37 (66%) of 56 patients who continued adalimumab in part B.Risankizumab showed significantly greater efficacy than adalimumab in providing skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque . No additional safety concerns were identified for patients who switched from adalimumab to risankizumab.

Although  is a hyper-proliferative skin disorder, the possible role of amino acid transporters has remained unexplored.To investigate the role of the essential amino acid transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5) in .LAT1 floxed mice were crossed to Cre-expressing mouse strains under the control of Keratin , CD4 and RORγt. We produced models of skin inflammation induced by Imiquimod and IL-23, and tested the effect of inhibiting LAT1 (JPH203) and mTOR (Rapamycin).LAT1 expression is increased in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating lymphocytes of psoriatic lesions in humans and mice. LAT1 deletion in keratinocytes does not dampen the inflammatory response or their proliferation, which could be maintained by increased expression of alternative amino acid transporter LAT2 and LAT3. Specific deletion of LAT1 in γδ and CD4 T cells controls the inflammatory response induced by Imiquimod. LAT1 deletion or inhibition blocks the expansion of IL-17-secreting γ4δ4 T cells and CD4 T cells and dampens the release of IL-1β, IL-17, and IL-22 in the Imiquimod-induced model. Moreover, inhibition of LAT1 blocks the expansion of human γδ T cells and IL-17 secretion by human CD4 T cells. IL-23 and IL-1β stimulation upregulates LAT1 expression and induce mTOR activation in IL-17 γδ and Th17 cells. Deletion or inhibition of LAT1 efficiently controls IL-23 and IL-1β-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, independent of TCR-signaling.Targeting LAT1-mediated amino acid uptake is a potentially useful immunosuppressive strategy to control skin inflammation mediated by IL-23/IL-1β/IL-17 axis.Copyright © 2019.

The therapeutic management of a patient with  and infection with the HBV is a challenge as the classical systemic treatment (methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine) shows a high risk of immunosuppression and/or hepatic toxicity and the biological therapy is endangered by the possibility of HBV reactivation. We present the case of a patient with moderate-severe  and chronic hepatitis B for whom we assessed the risk-benefit relation and considered useful to initiate the anti-TNF therapy concomitantly with the antiviral therapy with entecavir. The therapeutic algorithm included initiation of anti-TNF therapy with etanercept 2×50 mg/week combined with entecavir, an antiviral treatment administered continuously since the diagnosis of the HBV hepatitis, with hepatic function and viral load monitoring. After 3 months of therapy with etanercept the patient was given a dose of etanercept of 50 mg/week combined with entecavir 0. mg/day which he continued until week 36 when psoriatic lesions had cleared (PASI=0.6; DLQI=0). No adverse effects were registered and there was no evidence of HBV viral replication or changes in viral markers. We wish to emphasize that the use of etanercept in a patient with  and hepatitis B is a successful therapeutic alternative which may be safely used concomitantly with entecavir, with regular monitoring of viral load and hepatic function tests.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374004>Obesity and dyslipidemia in patients with : A case-control study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the association between  and abnormal lipid metabolism.The case-control study included 222 psoriatic patients and 445 non-psoriatic control patients matched for age and gender. Clinical parameters included age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Serum lipid levels were recorded and included cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), phospholipids (PLIP), free fatty acids (FFA), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and apolipoproteins (apoA1, apoB, and apoE). Statistical analysis was carried out through the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Studies version 23.0.Compared with controls, levels of BMI and the prevalence of obesity were significantly higher in psoriatic patients.

However, little is known about systemic effects of the pro-inflammatory state of severe acne. We analyzed data of 85 patients at Lipid Outpatient Clinics (UNIFESP/EPM) who were treated for metabolic syndrome (MS). Medical history and physical examinations were performed in order to search characteristics of acne scars.Patients' electronic records were accessed for one year. The ones presenting MS were evaluated by clinical examination in order to detect presence of acne scars. Clinical analysis comprised anamnesis, measurement of abdominal circumference, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). Laboratory tests included fasting glucose, CBC, serum levels of insulin, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine. Statistical analysis consisted of prevalence (95% CI) of acne history/scars among patients treated at the Lipid Outpatient Clinics. The χ2 test, Pearson's test, or Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association of social and demographic data, clinical and lab exams with the presence of MS or acne scars. Statistical % significance level was adopted.Fifty-two patients confirmed having a medical history of acne, and 33 denied. Acne scars were found in 61.17%. There was no statistical difference between the groups according to medium value of BMI, hypertension, abdominal circumference, and serum levels of hemoglobin, leucocytes, platelets, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, AST, ALT, glycemia, creatinine, and urea. Twenty-seven out of the 52 patients with acne history presented acne scars, which symbolizes a 31.76% prevalence. This equals a 51.92% prevalence among all patients with acne history. There was no statistical difference among groups according to mean (±SD) in data such as family history, weight, BMI, hypertension, abdominal circumference, serum levels of hemoglobin, leucocytes, platelets, LDL, HDL, AST, ALT, glycemia, creatinine, and urea. A statistical difference in the triglyceride level was present, being elevated in patients with acne scars.Apart from the limitation (small sample size), a correlation between acne and MS could be suggested. The high prevalence of acne history/scars in patients treated for MS may indicate a possible correlation with any type of acne. This hypothesis may raise discussion about an association like the already proven risk of metabolic alterations in other inflammatory chronic dermatoses, such as  or rosacea, regardless of acne severity. We highlight the importance of early treatment and follow-up for patients with MS that could be observed in this study, as clinical and laboratory criteria were all within normal levels among patients from that specific outpatient clinic. Results can draw attention to evaluation of clinical and laboratory investigation related to risk of MS. It corroborates to early diagnosis and prevention of complications of MS.

Histology shows acanthosis and inflammation with neutrophils and lymphocytes, which are rich in activated T cells. The etiology of  is not well defined, but it appears to be an autoimmune condition or a disease of immune dysregulation. The therapy of  ranges from topical ointments and oral therapies to intravenously or subcutaneously administered biologics. Milder cases can be managed by topical ointments, corticosteroids and vitamin D and retinoid derivatives. Systemic therapy is used for more severe disease or extensive skin involvement. Agents used include psoralen with ultraviolet light, methotrexate, acitretin, phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors (apremilast), cyclosporine or other immunomodulatory agents and, most recently, antitumor necrosis factor agents and monoclonal antibodies directed at activated T cells or their proinflammatory cytokines (secukinumab, ustekinumab). Psoriatic arthritis is typically treated similarly as rheumatoid arthritis.

The current therapeutic arsenal includes local treatments, phototherapies and systemic treatments (conventional systemic therapy and biotherapy), which, in most cases, are sufficient to control this skin disease. Subsequent management of these children should focus on maintaining therapeutic efficacy and preventing relapse by reducing any treatment-related toxicity in order to improve their quality of life. It would therefore appear useful to adopt a "proactive" attitude. To be proactive is to anticipate disease progression in order to limit both the severity and the incidence of new flare-ups. This approach must be distinguished from reactive support. Based on our experience of atopic dermatitis and data on adult , in the absence of publications specific to childhood-onset , herein we propose to provide an overview of this proactive approach in paediatric . This proactive management approach concerns four key precepts: therapeutic education: explanation of the disease, its pathophysiology and the various possible therapeutic approaches; prevention of factors triggering flare-ups or worsening psoriatic infections, such as stress, trauma, diet (mainly reduction of obesity); a proactive approach to topical therapy: skin hygiene and use of emollients, but also limitation of active therapies, use of dosing intervals and "weekend therapy" to reduce the risk of relapse; a proactive approach to systemic therapies: improved therapeutic safety, reduced cumulative doses, through reduced doses, use of dosing intervals and weekend therapy. Care for children with  must be comprehensive and include their environment. The concept of "proactive" treatment in childhood-onset  can help limit the duration and severity of flare-ups while improving quality of life. Simple measures can in fact ensure effective maintenance of treatments over the long term.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here we review the metabolic effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), focusing on the effects of phototherapies (that administer UVR), and advice to increase sun exposure in individuals enrolled in clinical trials and intervention studies. We identified 25 studies in which the effects of UVR on metabolic outcomes were examined, including: narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (nbUVB, n = 12); psoralen ultraviolet A phototherapy (n = 4); other types of UVR phototherapy (n = ); and sun exposure advice (n = ). Most studies recruited a small number of participants (≤100), who were middle-aged individuals undergoing treatment for  flare, with phototherapy or sun exposure advice administered for ≤12 weeks. Data obtained at baseline were usually compared with an endpoint following treatment with UVR, for a limited number of outcomes. There were few studies in which markers of glucose metabolism were assessed, with some beneficial effects of sun exposure (but not phototherapy) reported. LDL-cholesterol levels were lower in individuals receiving sun exposure advice, while treatment with nbUVB reduced blood concentrations of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). Future studies should focus on determining whether the effects of these interventions change with time, and if they are dependent on the source of UVR (i.e. phototherapy or sun exposure) and wavelength(s) of light administered. Furthermore, studies need to measure a variety of (clinical) markers of glucose metabolism, adiposity and inflammation, control for factors such as skin type and sex, and stratify participants for metabolic disease diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533077>Musa acuminata and its bioactive metabolite -Hydroxymethylfurfural mitigates quorum sensing (las and rhl) mediated biofilm and virulence production of nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro.</a></h2><p>Musa acuminata, a tropical plant belongs to the family Musaceae.

Moreover, M. acuminata peels have been well known for its anti-healing and antiseptic properties and most commonly used for healing wounds and heat burns in South Asian and African traditional medicines.To evaluate the QS-mediated antibiofilm and antivirulence potential of M. acuminata, and its bioactive metabolites -Hydroxymethylfurfural (5HMF) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The M. acuminata peel methanol extract (MAM) was evaluated for its antibiofilm potential against P. aeruginosa with increasing concentration. Besides, biofilm related phenomenon's such as total biofilm proteins, microcolony formation exopolysaccharides (EPS) and cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) productions were also examined to support the antibiofilm potential of MAM. Further, MAM was evaluated for its antivirulence efficacy against P. aeruginosa by assessing the protease, LasA protease, LasB elastase, pyocyanin, alginate and rhamnolipid productions at 400 μg ml concentration. Transcriptional analysis of QS regulated virulence genes expression level was also done by real-time PCR analysis. Then, the MAM was subjected to column chromatography for further fractions and the bioactive compounds present in MAM were identified by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry analysis. Further, the major compounds such as -hydroxymethylfurfural, vaccenic acid and pentanoic acid identified from active fraction of MAM were evaluated for their antibiofilm and antivirulence potential against P. aeruginosa.MAM significantly inhibited the biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa at 400 μg ml concentration which also inhibited the production of biofilm proteins, biofilm adherence, EPS and CSH productions to the level of 79%, 82% and 77% respectively. Further, the antivirulence potential was confirmed through numerous virulence inhibition assays. The MAM at 400 μg ml concentration inhibited the QS-mediated virulence production such as protease, LasA protease, LasB elastase, pyocyanin, alginate and rhamnolipid productions to the level of 77%, 75%, 68%, 80%, 78% and 69% respectively. Moreover, the results of qPCR analysis confirmed the downregulation of QS regulated virulence genes expression upon treatment with MAM. The chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of -Hydroxymethylfurfural (5HMF), vaccenic acid and pentanoic acid in MAM and the potential bioactive compounds with antibiofilm and antivirulence was identified as -hydroxymethylfurfural, without exerting any growth inhibition in P. aeruginosa.This study investigated the ideal antibiofilm and antivirulence potential of MAM and its bioactive compound 5HMF, and confirms the ethnopharmacological value of these peels against P. aeruginosa infections.Copyright © 2019.

Inhibition of cell proliferation is explained through its role in blocking DNA/RNA synthesis, by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, necessary for the production of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. An anticancer effect can be related to α-oxoaldehyde metabolism (MTX increases methylglyoxal levels). Its anti-inflammatory property is based on the inhibition of -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, thus increasing intracellular and extracellular adenosine, a purine nucleoside with anti-inflammatory effect. This drug can limit inflammation by scavenging free radicals and decreasing malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde protein-adduct production. Moreover, the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects can also be related to inhibition of the DNA methylation pathway, thus inhibiting methionine formation. The aim of the present study was to report various dermatological cases from our daily practice that demonstrate the efficacy of MTX in the treatment of cutaneous diseases, highlighting different mechanisms of action: its anti-inflammatory effect in  and its anti-proliferative, and anti-neoplastic effect in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma or in keratoacanthoma.

The effectiveness and sub-acute toxicity of these topical formulations were investigated in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced  in a mouse model (IMQP). The particle sizes of formulations were around 100 nm with a mean zeta potential of -72.87 mV. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of MTX in liposomal formulations were more than 85%. Franz cell permeability studies indicated that permeation of MTX through the healthy BALB/c mice skin is very low; however, in the inflammatory skin, which was induced by IMQ it was significant (50%). Liposomal MTX (LM 0.05 and 0.1%) caused significant reduction of thickness score dose-dependently in IMQP compared to the injected MTX. Moreover, investigation of the inflammatory factor and pathological examinations of skin proved the superiority of the LM treating group. Pathological examinations also showed there are no toxicity in organs of the mice that received the LM. Blood cell count test didn't show any abnormality.

Topicals are considered first-line therapy for mild disease and are having an increasing role in moderate or severe  as an integral part of combination therapy. Halobetasol has been shown be effective in moderate or severe localized plaque , and tazarotene affords important effects on epidermal hyperproliferation that may be important in more severe disease.To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a once-daily application of a fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in comparison with its vehicle in patients with severe localized plaque  (as defined by an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of 4 and Body Surface Area (BSA) of 3%-12%.Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Sixty-two patients with severe localized  (mean BSA 7.4) randomized (2:1) to receive HP/TAZ lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score and a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’), impact on individual signs of  (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion, BSA, reduction in mean baseline IGAxBSA and achievement of a clinically meaningful response (number of patients who achieved at least a 75% improvement in IGAxBSA).

The consequences of obesity in the skin are underestimated. In this paper, we review the effect of obesity on the skin, including how increased body mass index affects skin physiology, skin barrier, collagen structure, and wound healing. Obesity also affects sebaceous and sweat glands and causes circulatory and lymphatic changes. Common skin manifestations related to obesity include acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, keratosis pilaris, striae distensae, cellulite, and plantar hyperkeratosis. Obesity has metabolic effects, such as causing hyperandrogenism and gout, which in turn are associated with cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial and Candida skin infections, as well as onychomycosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and chronic dermatoses like hidradenitis suppurativa, , and rosacea. The association between atopic dermatitis and obesity and the increased risk of skin cancer among obese patients is debatable. Obesity is also related to rare skin conditions and to premature hair graying. As physicians, understanding these clinical signs and the underlying systemic disorders will facilitate earlier diagnoses for better treatment and avoidance of sequelae.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib have been shown in several randomized clinical trials. The study presented here aimed to assess the clinical tolerability and effectiveness of tofacitinib among RA patients in real life.  Consecutive patients between January 2015 and April 2017 with RA who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 criteria were included in a prospectively designed analysis of retrospective data. Patients were initiated on tofacitinib  mg bid. The primary objective was to analyze the safety of tofacitinib in a real-life cohort. Safety was assessed by the reasons to stop tofacitinib during follow up and changes of liver enzymes, hemoglobin, and creatinine. The secondary outcome was to analyze the frequency of and time to achieve low disease activity (LDA) and remission as defined by 28 joint count disease activity score (DAS28).  A total of 144 patients were treated with tofacitinib. A total of 84.9% of patients were pre-exposed to at least one biological agent. The average DAS28 at the initiation of tofacitinib was 4.43. A total of 50.0% of patients were positive for rheumatoid factor and 49.0% for ACPA. The mean follow up was 1.22 years (range 10d-3.7a) after initiation of tofacitinib treatment. A total of 94 (64.4%) patients remained on tofacitinib during follow-up. The average time to stop tofacitinib was 190.0 days. Reasons to stop tofacitinib were: insufficient response (n = 23), gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 18), infection ( = ), myalgia ( = 2), remission ( = 2), headache ( = 2), cough, blue finger syndrome, intolerance, heartburn, , and increased liver enzymes (all  = 1). Increased alanine amino transferase (ALAT) or aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) > 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) were detected in 3.3% and 4.4% of patients, respectively. Hemoglobin decrease of >10% was detected in 15.1% of the patients and decreased lymphocytes <500/μL in 3.4%. An increase of creatinine >20% was detected in 9.4% of patients. A total of 62.9% and 50.0% of the patients achieved low disease activity (LDA) or remission after a median of 319 and 645 days, respectively. These rates were significantly higher in patients naïve to biologic agents as compared to patients pre-exposed to biologics (LDA: naïve 100% 92 d, pre-exposed 57.0% 434 d, p ≤ 0.001; remission: naïve 86.7% 132 d, pre-exposed 44.1%, 692 d, p = 0.001).  Tofacitinib is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with RA. Tofacitinib may induce high rates of LDA and remission in patients with active disease, even after the use of one or more biologics, though the rate appeared higher in patients naïve to biologics. Tofacitinib may be a valuable option in a treat-to-target approach.

We evaluated the performance of  mainstream CNN models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, and Xception) on a subset of BCC and pigmented nevi of this dataset. We also analyzed the basis of the diagnosis results in the form of heatmaps. We compared the optimal CNN classification model with 30 professional dermatologists.  Results: The Xiangya Skin Disease Dataset contains 150 223 clinical images with lesion annotations, covering 543 skin diseases, and each image in the dataset contains support for pathological gold standards and the patient's overall medical history. On the test set of 349 BCC and 497 pigmented nevi, the optimal CNN model was Xception, and its classification accuracy can reach 93.%, of which the area under curve (AUC) values were 0.974 and 0.969, respectively. The results of the heatmap showed that the CNN model can indeed learn the characteristics associated with disease identification. The ability of the Xception model to identify clinical images of BCC and Nevi was basically comparable to that of professional dermatologists.  Conclusion: This study is the first assistant diagnosis study for skin tumor based on Chinese ethnic clinical dataset. It proves that CNN model has the ability to distinguish between Chinese ethnicity's BCC and Nevi, and lays a solid foundation for the following application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment for skin tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624648>The Role of Ultrasound in Assessing Hand Joints and Tendons in Psoriatic Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis, usually involving peripheral joints, associated with cutaneous , in the absence of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies.The study included 28 patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis according to CASPAR criteria, presenting pain or swelling of the small joints of the hands and wrists, hospitalized in the Department of Rheumatology of the Emergency Clinical County Hospital of Craiova during 2016-2018.In the 28 patients, a total of 840 joints were examined clinically and by ultrasound. From the clinical point of view, out of the total, 32 joints were swollen while 59 joints were tender. Dactylitis was evidenced in 20/280 examined digits upon physical examination. MUS revealed the presence of synovial proliferation in 108/840 sites (12.85%), with grade 1 synovitis in 4 joints (3.7%), grade 2 in 94 joints (87.03%) and grade 3 in 10 joints (9.25%). Out of 280 examined fingers .71% presented dactylitis, the third digit being the most commonly targeted. Grade 2 tenosynovitis was found in 40 of the examined tendons, whereas 8 tendons presented with grade 3 tenosynovitis. The most frequently involved were the flexor tendons of the digits (38 out of 40 tendons with inflammatory changes), followed by the extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis tendons.Ultrasound has proven its utility in assessing joint and tendon inflammation to a higher extent that clinically expected.

But curcumin has low bioavailability issues that accompany low aqueous solubility, further, when administered orally, >90% of the drug degrades rapidly in the alkaline medium. Administering the drug topically can bypass the problem as well as first-pass metabolism and therefore delivering the drug at the targeted site of action. Encapsulating curcumin in nanostructured lipid nanocarriers (NLC) is an excellent novel strategy. Further, these NLC provides both the controlled release and helps in the enhanced permeation of the drug through the skin's physiological barrier, stratum corneum. For the NLC characterization, a reliable method must be developed that can accurately and precisely determine the drug content in the formulation and also for its in-vitro and ex-vivo characterization. This experiment describes the analytical validation parameters described as per International Conference of Harmonization guidelines to develop a method using the UV-Visible spectroscopy. The method was developed in two solvent systems i.e. methanol and 6.4 pH phosphate buffer with 1.% polysorbate 80. Methanol solvent was used for the determination of curcumin in the NLC formulation via determining the encapsulation efficiency and 6.4 pH phosphate buffer with 1.% polysorbate 80 solvent was used for in-vitro and ex-vivo characterization of the developed NLC formulation (cream and gel). These methods were validated in response to linearity, the limit of detection, the limit of quantification, precision, accuracy, repeatability, and specificity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

IL-17F shares 50% homology and biological activities with IL-17A. It is now of interest to target both cytokines. The objective was to compare the IL-17A and IL-17F effect on cytokine production by RA synoviocytes, and to extend to other cells.  Cells (RA synoviocytes,  skin fibroblasts, endothelial cells, myoblasts, and hepatocytes) were cultured in the presence or not of: IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF, IL-1β alone or their combinations, IL-17A/TNF, IL-17A/IL-1β, IL-17A/TNF/IL-1β, IL-17F/TNF, IL-17F/IL-1β, and IL-17F/TNF/IL-1β. All experiments were performed in parallel to reduce variability. After 48 h, supernatants were recovered and IL-6 and IL-8 levels were measured by ELISA.  IL-17A and IL-17F alone increased significantly IL-6 and IL-8 productions by synoviocytes, with a stronger effect for IL-17A. For IL-6 production, TNF or IL-1β alone had the largest effect on myoblasts (-fold increase), while for IL-8 production, it was on skin fibroblasts (-fold increase). The IL-17A/TNF synergistic increase was observed on all cells for IL-6; and for IL-8, except for endothelial cells. For IL-17F/TNF, except with endothelial cells, a synergistic effect was also observed, but less powerful than with IL-17A/TNF. IL-17A/IL-1β or IL-17F/IL-1β effect was cell-type dependent, with an additive effect for synoviocytes (1.6 and 2-fold increase, respectively for IL-6, and 1.8 and 2-fold increase, respectively for IL-8) and a synergistic effect for hepatocytes (3.8 and 4.2-fold increase, respectively for IL-6, and 6 and 2-fold increase, respectively for IL-8). The three-cytokine combination induced an additive effect for synoviocytes and a synergistic effect for skin fibroblasts.  IL-17A and IL-17F acted similarly by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, with a stronger response intensity with IL-17A. Their activities were potentiated by the combination with TNF and IL-1β, with an effect dependent on the cell type.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310690>Earlier discontinuation of TNF-α inhibitor therapy in female patients with inflammatory bowel disease is related to a greater risk of side effects.</a></h2><p>In rheumatoid arthritis and  female sex has been shown to be associated with discontinuation of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) therapy.To retrospectively assess the association between sex and TNF-α drug persistence in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).All IBD patients on anti-TNF-α therapy with a minimum follow-up of 12 months in a single tertiary centre were identified. Patient and treatment characteristics and reasons for anti-TNF-α discontinuation were recorded. Overall and cause-specific drug persistence was analysed with Kaplan-Meier followed by Cox proportional hazards regression models.We included 529 patients (49.9% male) with 631 treatment episodes (2280 anti-TNF-α treatment years) and 289 discontinuations of therapy. Female sex (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.74), greater age at start of therapy per decade (aHR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27] and dose escalation (aHR 3.74, 95% CI 2.78-.02) were associated with TNF-α inhibitor discontinuation. Total cohort cause-specific analysis identified female sex to be associated with side effects (aHR 4.05, 95% CI 2.36-6.98) but not to other discontinuation reasons. Adalimumab (aHR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.60) and golimumab (aHR 4.97, 95% CI 2.30-10.74) use and dose-escalation (aHR 7.71, 95% CI .28-11.26) were associated with secondary loss of response.Drug persistence of anti-TNF-α therapy is lower in females as compared to males, mainly because of higher rates of side effects in females.

Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) was found to represent the largest category in a Taiwanese cohort study. The aim in this study was to compare the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of ERA in a single tertiary center in Taiwan, as compared to those of other categories of JIA. Furthermore, we determined patients' characteristics and risk factors that can help assess the outcomes in ERA.A retrospective chart review of all patients with JIA referred to a pediatric rheumatology clinic in the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1993 and 2018 were identified according to ILAR criteria. Outcomes were assessed based on the Wallace criteria to categorize patients into active and non-active, including inactive, remission on medication, and remission off medication, groups. A subset of samples was further tested by DNA sequencing to identify HLA-B27 subtypes.One-hundred and eighty-three patients were included in the study, with a mean of 8 years' follow-up. ERA was the single largest category of JIA (39.9%);  and undifferentiated JIA were both the least common type (0.%). ERA was male predominant (86%), had a late age of onset (11.0 ± 3.2 years), and the majority of ERA patients was HLA-B27-positive (97%). Of 25 HLA-B27-positive ERA patients checked by HLA-B27 sequencing, 23 were B*27:04 and 2 were B*27:05. ERA patients were significantly less likely to achieve non-active status compared to patients with persistent oligoarthritis (P = 0.036). In terms of treatment response to TNF-α inhibitors in methotrexate-refractory ERA, 26 patients remained active and only 11 patients (30%) achieved a non-active status. Sacroiliitis was a risk factor contributing to poorer treatment response in ERA (P = 0.006).ERA represented the most common category of JIA in Taiwan. Those ERA patients with sacroiliitis were likely to have persistent active disease and may require a more aggressive treatment strategy to improve their outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672037>Risankizumab for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque .</a></h2><p> Risankizumab (Skyrizi), an interleukin-23 (IL-23) antagonist, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque  in April 2019.

Biologic therapy for  has been found to be favorably associated with luminal coronary plaque, but it is unclear whether these associations are attributable to direct anti-inflammatory effects on the coronary arteries.To investigate the association of biologic therapy with coronary inflammation in patients with  using the perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI), a novel imaging biomarker that assesses coronary inflammation by mapping spatial changes of perivascular fat composition via coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).This prospective cohort study performed from January 1, 2013, through March 31, 2019, analyzed changes in FAI in patients with moderate to severe  who underwent CCTA at baseline and at 1 year and were not receiving biologic  therapy at baseline.Biologic therapy for .Perivascular FAI mapping was performed based on an established method by a reader blinded to patient demographics, visit, and treatment status.Of the 134 patients (mean [SD] age, 51.1 [12.1] years; 84 [62.%] male), most had low cardiovascular risk by traditional risk scores (median 10-year Framingham Risk Score, 3% [interquartile range, 1%-7%]) and moderate to severe skin disease. Of these patients, 82 received biologic  therapy (anti-tumor necrosis factor α, anti-interleukin [IL] 12/23, or anti-IL-17) for 1 year, and 52 did not receive any biologic therapy and were given topical or light therapy (control group). At baseline, 46 patients (27 in the treated group and 19 in the untreated group) had a focal coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Biologic therapy was associated with a significant decrease in FAI at 1 year (median FAI -71.22 HU [interquartile range (IQR), -75.85 to -68.11 HU] at baseline vs -76.09 HU [IQR, -80.08 to -70.37 HU] at 1 year; P < .001) concurrent with skin disease improvement (median PASI, 7.7 [IQR, 3.2-12.] at baseline vs 3.2 [IQR, 1.8-.7] at 1 year; P < .001), whereas no change in FAI was noted in those not receiving biologic therapy (median FAI, -71.98 [IQR, -77.36 to -65.64] at baseline vs -72.66 [IQR, -78.21 to -67.44] at 1 year; P = .39). The associations with FAI were independent of the presence of coronary plaque and were consistent among patients receiving different biologic agents, including anti-tumor necrosis factor α (median FAI, -71.25 [IQR, -75.86 to -66.89] at baseline vs -75.49 [IQR, -79.12 to -68.58] at 1 year; P < .001) and anti-IL-12/23 or anti-IL-17 therapy (median FAI, -71.18 [IQR, -75.85 to -68.80] at baseline vs -76.92 [IQR, -81.16 to -71.67] at 1 year; P < .001).In this study, biologic therapy for moderate to severe  was associated with reduced coronary inflammation assessed by perivascular FAI.

We performed a systematic review of the literature on extrarenal immune-mediated disorders associated with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The principles recommended by the Economic and Social Research Council guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis and on the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews were used. We identified 41 original articles, published after 1965, which reported on 52 patients (34 males and 18 females aged from 1.7 to 57 years, median 9) affected by acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis associated with a further poststreptococcal disease: 29 cases with rheumatic fever (17 males and 12 females aged 3.0 to 57, median 17 years), 16 with hematologic diseases such as thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia (13 males and 3 females aged 1.8 to 13, median 6.0 years) and seven with Henoch-Schönlein syndrome, reactive arthritis or uveitis (4 males and 3 females aged 1.7 to 14, median 7.0 years).

A missense mutation in  encoding a cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor MDA5 has recently been identified in the SMS patients as well as in patients with a monogenic form of lupus. We previously reported that  mice express a constitutively active MDA5 and spontaneously develop lupus-like nephritis. In this study, we demonstrate that the  mice also exhibit SMS-like bone abnormalities, including decreased bone mineral density and thin cortical bone. Histological analysis revealed a low number of osteoclasts, low bone formation rate, and abnormal development of growth plate cartilages in  mice. These abnormalities were not observed in  ・ and  ・ mice, indicating the critical role of type I IFNs induced by MDA5/MAVS-dependent signaling in the bone pathogenesis of  mice, affecting bone turnover.

We describe a family carrying a novel heterozygous mutation in CARD14 gene, with childhood-onset erythrodermic  requiring an unusual extremely high dose (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab to achieve disease remission.We describe a large family with three pairs of twins presenting a clinical phenotype characterized by childhood-onset erythrodermic ; in some family members is also reported psoriatic arthritis. The two probands presented poor clinical response to topic and systemic therapy with antihistamine, steroid, retinoids, cyclosporine and etanercept. After exclusion of the most common genes associated to autoinflammatory diseases (IL36RN, IL1RN, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12, MEFV, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, LPIN2) we approached a new gene search by subjecting to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis five members of the family. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.446 T > G, leading to the missense amino acid substitution p.L149R) in the exon 4 of the CARD14 gene was identified in all affected members. Increasing dosages (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), allowed the complete control of the clinical manifestations, with an evident reduction of circulating Th17 and Th22 CD4+ T cell subsets.We describe the association of mutations of the CARD14 gene with an erythrodermic  pedigree, underlying the necessity to investigate CARD14 mutations in childhood-onset  cases and confirming the presence of CARD14 causative mutations also in erythrodermic  form, as recently reported.

Participants newly diagnosed with Crohn disease (n = 19,296) or  (n = 112,292) and participants with no history of these autoimmune diseases (n = 79,185) served as controls.The odds of MS were lower in participants with a recorded vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 0.870,  < 0.001 vs participants without autoimmune disease; OR 0.919,  < 0.001 vs participants with Crohn disease; OR 0.973,  = 0.177 vs participants with ). Lower odds were most pronounced for vaccinations against influenza and tick-borne encephalitis. These effects were consistently observed for different time frames, control cohorts, and definitions of the MS cohort. Effect sizes increased toward the time of first diagnosis.Results of the present study do not reveal vaccination to be a risk factor for MS. On the contrary, they consistently suggest that vaccination is associated with a lower likelihood of being diagnosed with MS within the next  years.

We used a neighborhood deprivation index, constructed from variables such as low education, low income, unemployment, and social welfare assistance, to assess the level of neighborhood deprivation. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level.  A significant association between level of neighborhood deprivation and ADs was found. The crude odds were 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.27-1.36) for those residing in the high-deprived neighborhoods compared to those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods.

The significant factors in this first model were introduced in a multivariate model using a backward step approach.This series included 159 men (54.8%) and 131 women (45.2%), with an average age of 54 ± 12 years. Obesity was more common both in  (36.% vs 22%, OR 2.1 [95%CI: 1.-2.8), P < .01]) and PsA (27.6% vs 22%, OR 1.4 [95%CI: 1.0-1.9], P < .05) than in the non-inflammatory population. Obesity was more frequent in  (36.%) than in PsA (27.6%), OR 1. 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.1, P < .05. After correcting for age, sex, disease duration, and other confounders, independent associations with obesity (P < .05) were: PsA family history (OR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.1-12.4), evolution as axial disease (OR 4.4, 95%CI: 1.0-15.4), and dyslipidemia (OR 3., 95%CI: 1.-8.6).Obesity is common in psoriatic disease, but much more frequent among patients with cutaneous than joint disease. Patients who present with spondylitis during evolution are more prone to this comorbidity, and therefore, should be closely monitored to correct this eventuality in a timely manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356171>IκB-ζ Expression Requires Both TYK2/STAT3 Activity and IL-17-Regulated mRNA Stabilization.</a></h2><p>Cytokine IL-17A (IL-17) acts on various cell types, including epidermal keratinocytes, and induces antimicrobial peptide and chemokine production to elicit antibacterial and antifungal defense responses. Excess IL-17 leads to inflammatory skin diseases such as . The IκB family protein IκB-ζ mediates IL-17-induced responses. However, the mechanism controlling IκB-ζ expression in IL-17-stimulated cells remains elusive. In this study, we showed that JAK kinase TYK2 positively regulates IL-17-induced IκB-ζ expression. TYK2-deficient mice showed reduced inflammation and concomitant reduction of IκB-ζ mRNA compared with wild-type mice in imiquimod-induced skin inflammation. The analysis of the IκB-ζ promoter activity using human cell lines (HaCaT and HeLa) revealed that catalytic activity of TYK2 and its substrate transcription factor STAT3, but not IL-17, is required for IκB-ζ promoter activity. In contrast, IL-17-induced signaling, which did not activate STAT3, posttranscriptionally stabilized IκB-ζ mRNA via its 3'-untranslated region. IL-17 signaling protein ACT1 was required to counteract constitutive IκB-ζ mRNA degradation by RNase Regnase-1. These results suggested that transcriptional activation by TYK2-STAT3 pathway and mRNA stabilization by IL-17-mediated signals act separately from each other but complementarily to achieve IκB-ζ induction. Therefore, JAK/TYK2 inhibition might be of significance in regulation of IL-17-induced inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.</p></html>
