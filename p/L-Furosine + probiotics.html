Microbial endocrinology, a field representing the union of microbiology, endocrinology and neurobiology, has theorized that microorganisms have the capacity to serve as neurochemical delivery vehicles [1]. According to microbial endocrinology, neurochemicals can serve as a common language between host and bacterium, enabling bidirectional communication. We report herein the first demonstration that Enterococcus sp. has the capacity to produce dopamine in a gastrointestinal-like environment when supplied with the dopamine precursor L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). The results presented herein provide a means to select  based on neurochemical-producing potential and suggest the possibility that  containing E. faecium may serve to influence the host through dopaminergic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28233282>Safety of Lactobacillus plantarum ST8Sh and Its Bacteriocin.</a></h2><p>Total DNA extracted from Lb. plantarum ST8Sh was screened for the presence of more than 50 genes related to production of biogenic amines (histidine decarboxylase,  decarboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase), virulence factors (sex pheromones, gelatinase, cytolysin, hyaluronidase, aggregation substance, enterococcal surface protein, endocarditis antigen, adhesion of collagen, integration factors), and antibiotic resistance (vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, bacitracin). Lb. plantarum ST8Sh showed a low presence of virulence genes. Only 13 genes were detected (related to sex pheromones, aggregation substance, adhesion of collagen, tetracycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, but not to vancomycin, and bacitracin) and may be considered as indication of safety for application in fermented food products. In addition, interaction between Lb. plantarum ST8Sh and drugs from different groups were determined in order to establish possible application of the strain in combination with commercial drugs. Cytotoxicity of the semi-purified bacteriocins produced by Lb. plantarum ST8Sh was depended on applied concentration-highly cytotoxic when applied at 25 μg/mL and no cytotoxicity at 5 μg/mL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut microbiota and cancer: How gut microbiota modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Also, it modulates the activity, efficacy and toxicity of several chemotherapy agents, such as gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, irinotecan, cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil, and target therapy, such as  kinase inhibitors. More recently, accumulating data suggest that the composition of gut microbiota may also affect efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the manipulation of gut microbiota through antibiotics, , prebiotics or fecal transplantation has been investigating with the aim to improve efficacy and mitigate toxicity of anticancer drugs.Copyright © 2019.

After the second lactic acid fermentation with 10∼30% skim milk powder, the fermented RSF resulted in an increase in acidity with 1.64∼1.99%,  content with 246∼308 mg% and protease activity in the range of 5.2∼17.5 unit/g and 0.966 water activity. Viable cell counts as  indicated 1.6×10(8) CFU/g of B. subtilis and 7.3×10(10) CFU/g of L. plantarum. The firmness of the first fermented RSF with 2,491 g·ømm(-1) greatly decreased to 1,533 g·ømm(-1) in the second fermented RSF, although firmness was slightly increased by adding a higher content of skim milk. The consistency of the second fermented RSF also decreased greatly from 55,640 to 3,264∼3,998 in the presence of 10∼30% skim milk. The effective hydrolysis of soy protein and skim milk protein in the fermented RSF was confirmed. Thus, the second fermented RSF with a sour taste and flavor showed similar textural properties to commercial soft cheese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29686137>d-Alanyl-d-Alanine Ligase as a Broad-Host-Range Counterselection Marker in Vancomycin-Resistant Lactic Acid Bacteria.</a></h2><p>The peptidoglycan composition in lactic acid bacteria dictates vancomycin resistance. Vancomycin binds relatively poorly to peptidoglycan ending in d-alanyl-d-lactate and binds with high affinity to peptidoglycan ending in d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala), which results in vancomycin resistance and sensitivity, respectively. The enzyme responsible for generating these peptidoglycan precursors is dipeptide ligase (Ddl). A single amino acid in the Ddl active site, phenylalanine or , determines depsipeptide or dipeptide activity, respectively. Here, we established that heterologous expression of dipeptide ligase in vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli increases their sensitivity to vancomycin in a dose-dependent manner and overcomes the effects of the presence of a native d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase. We incorporated the dipeptide ligase gene on a suicide vector and demonstrated that it functions as a counterselection marker (CSM) in lactobacilli; vancomycin selection allows only those cells to grow in which the suicide vector has been lost. Subsequently, we developed a liquid-based approach to identify recombinants in only 5 days, which is approximately half the time required by conventional approaches. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ddl serves as a marker to predict vancomycin resistance and consequently indicated the broad applicability of the use of Ddl as a counterselection marker in the genus  Finally, our system represents the first "plug and play" counterselection system in lactic acid bacteria that does not require prior genome editing and/or synthetic medium. The genus  contains more than 200 species, many of which are exploited in the food and biotechnology industries and in medicine. Prediction of intrinsic vancomycin resistance has thus far been limited to selected  species. Here, we show that heterologous expression of the enzyme Ddl (dipeptide ligase)-an essential enzyme involved in peptidoglycan synthesis-increases sensitivity to vancomycin in a dose-dependent manner. We exploited this to develop a counterselection marker for use in vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, thereby expanding the poorly developed genome editing toolbox that is currently available for most strains. Also, we showed that Ddl is a phylogenetic marker that can be used to predict vancomycin resistance in ; 81% of  species are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, which makes our tool broadly applicable.Copyright © 2018 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094525>[Viability and efects of the probiotic lactobacillus aracaseissp aracasei in Chilean low-fat Gauda cheese].</a></h2><p>The objective of this study is to infer the survival of the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei added during the processing of low-fat Gouda cheese, during the maturation (21 days) and the commercialization (14 days), in order to see the influence that this organism has on the quality of the product. The treatments were: TI (control): Gouda with normal fat content; T2: Low fat Gouda cheese (QGS) T3: QGS, with additional probiotic added with the initial culture; T4: QGS, with the probiotic added in the cooking of the curd. For the count of the probiotic, the methodology was used set forth by the American Public Health Association, (APHA), proteolysis by the method of soluble  in trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the physical and chemical analysis using the methods standardized by the International Dairy Federation, and Chilean normative. The counts obtained were from 10(8) ufc/g y 10(7) ufc/g in the cheeses that had the probiotic additive (T3 and T4, respectively) close to the level of innocuous (10(8) ufc/g) during the study period of 35 days. The proteolysis incremented normally, and was the same in all of the treatments during the 35 days studied. The treatments with fat-reduction presented approximately, 31% less fat than the control treatment, and also higher moistness. Within the treatments, there was no evidence of taste and general feel; in turn the cheeses with the reduction of fat resulted firmer, less cohesive, than the control, and with similar elasticity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504085>Alcohol, intestinal bacterial growth, intestinal permeability to endotoxin, and medical consequences: summary of a symposium.</a></h2><p>This report is a summary of the symposium on Alcohol, Intestinal Bacterial Growth, Intestinal Permeability to Endotoxin, and Medical Consequences, organized by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Office of Dietary Supplements, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of National Institutes of Health in Rockville, Maryland, October 11, 2006. Alcohol exposure can promote the growth of Gram-negative bacteria in the intestine, which may result in accumulation of endotoxin. In addition, alcohol metabolism by Gram-negative bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells can result in accumulation of acetaldehyde, which in turn can increase intestinal permeability to endotoxin by increasing  phosphorylation of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. Alcohol-induced generation of nitric oxide may also contribute to increased permeability to endotoxin by reacting with tubulin, which may cause damage to microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequent disruption of intestinal barrier function. Increased intestinal permeability can lead to increased transfer of endotoxin from the intestine to the liver and general circulation where endotoxin may trigger inflammatory changes in the liver and other organs. Alcohol may also increase intestinal permeability to peptidoglycan, which can initiate inflammatory response in liver and other organs. In addition, acute alcohol exposure may potentiate the effect of burn injury on intestinal bacterial growth and permeability. Decreasing the number of Gram-negative bacteria in the intestine can result in decreased production of endotoxin as well as acetaldehyde which is expected to decrease intestinal permeability to endotoxin. In addition, intestinal permeability may be preserved by administering epidermal growth factor, l-glutamine, oats supplementation, or zinc, thereby preventing the transfer of endotoxin to the general circulation. Thus reducing the number of intestinal Gram-negative bacteria and preserving intestinal permeability to endotoxin may attenuate alcoholic liver and other organ injuries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15469647>The in vivo use of the stable isotope-labelled biomarkers lactose-[15N]ureide and [2H4] to assess the effects of pro- and prebiotics on the intestinal flora of healthy human volunteers.</a></h2><p>Amongst the various claimed beneficial effects of pro- and prebiotics for the human host, it has been hypothesised that functional foods are able to suppress the generation and accumulation of toxic fermentation metabolites (NH3, p-cresol). Direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking mainly because of the unavailability of reliable biomarkers. Preliminary data indicate that lactose-[15N]ureide and [2H4] may be potential biomarker candidates. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of pro- and prebiotics on the colonic fate of these biomarkers in a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with nineteen healthy volunteers. At the start of the study and at the end of each 2-week study period, during which they were administered either a probiotic (n 10; 6.5 x 10(9) Lactobacillus casei Shirota cells twice daily) or a prebiotic (n 9; lactulose 10 g twice daily), the volunteers consumed a test meal containing the two biomarkers. Urine was collected during 48 h. Results were expressed as percentage of the administered dose. As compared with the placebo, the decrease in the percentage dose of p-[2H4]cresol in the 24-48 h urine fraction was significantly higher after probiotic intake (P=0.042). Similar changes were observed for the 15N tracer (P=0.016). After prebiotic intake, a significantly higher decrease in the percentage dose of p-[2H4]cresol (P=0.005) and 15N tracer (P=0.029) was found in the 0-24 h urine collection. The present results demonstrate that suppression of the generation and accumulation of potentially toxic fermentation metabolites by pro- and prebiotics can reliably be monitored in vivo by the use of stable isotope-labelled biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23879822>A surview of recent patents on anti-infective therapy for Clostridium difficile.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile has become the most common infectious cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea, with serious morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and even death.

Probiotic fermented milk and placebo were administered 3 times daily for 8 weeks. Improvements of IBS were assessed according to Rome III questionnaires and H NMR metabolic profiling of serum and fecal samples from all participants was used to characterize a significant change in serum and fecal metabolome before and after .Fecal counts of the Lactobacilli, but not Bifidobacteria species, which included in the probiotic milk, were increased significantly in feces of IBS patients receiving treatment (P=0.014). NMR data set coupled with multivariate statistical analysis identified intrinsically elevated serum levels of glucose (P=0.0265) and  (P=0.0016) in IBS patients. These levels normalized to those of healthy individuals in the probiotic administration group, but not the placebo group.This metabonomic study suggests that in a subset of IBS patients there exists a potential dysregulation in energy homeostasis (serum glucose) and liver function (serum ) that may be improved through  supplementation. Moreover, global metabolic profiling highlights the potential of metabonomic approach for assessing bowel diseases or symptoms with respect to host metabolic perturbation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340>Evaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.</a></h2><p>Angelica dahurica root (ADR), which shows strong antioxidant activity, is used in Chinese medicine. This study evaluated the tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of ADR extracts fermented by four different probiotic bacteria: Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus brevis. The ADR was first extracted using distilled water, 70% ethanol, and ethyl acetate, and then fermented by probiotic bacteria. The physiological characteristics of these fermented extracts, namely the antityrosinase activity, antioxidant activity, phenolic composition, and phenolic content, were evaluated and compared with those of unfermented extracts. Results showed that the water extracts after fermentation by probiotic bacteria exhibited the most favorable physiological characteristics. Among the extracts fermented by these probiotic bacteria, L. acidophilus-fermented ADR extract showed the most favorable physiological characteristics. The optimal IC values for antityrosinase activity, DPPH radical scavenging activity, and reducing power for L. acidophilus-fermented ADR extract were 0.07 ± 0.03, 0.12 ± 0.01, and 0.68 ± 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the physiological activities of fermented extracts were considerably higher than those of unfermented extracts. The tyrosinase inhibition and melanin content of B16F10 melanoma cells, and cytotoxicity effects of the fermented ADR extracts on B16F10 cells were also evaluated. We found that the L. acidophilus-fermented ADR extract at 1.5 mg/mL showed significant cellular antityrosinase activity with low melanin production in B16F10 cells and was noncytotoxic to B16F10 cells. Among all probiotic bacteria, water-extracted ADR fermented by L. acidophilus for 48 h was found to be the best skincare agent or antioxidant agent.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received  and LBW infants who did not receive .Forty-one infants were allocated to the non-probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth.There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine,  and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group.Probiotic supplement in formula may affect the composition, stability and function of LBW infants' gut microbiota.

Our findings demonstrate that recombinant L. lactis strains can successfully both deliver antigens to intestinal mucosa and maintain the epitopes for a long time in NOD mice. Oral administration of recombinant L. lactis could prevent hyperglycemia, improve glucose tolerance, and reduce insulitis by inhibiting antigen-specific proliferation of T cells, augmenting regulatory immune reactions, and balancing ratios of Th17/Tregs and Th1/Th2.

We reported previously that Sb modulates host inflammatory responses through down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 activities both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to identify upstream mediators responsible for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 inactivation and to examine the effects of Sb on tumor development in Apc(Min) mice.Signaling studies of colon cancer cells were done by western blot. Cell proliferation was measured by MTS and BrdU assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry, tunel assay and caspase assay. Apc(Min) mice were orally given Sb for 9 weeks before sacrifice for tumor analysis.We found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was deactivated upon exposure to Sb, leading to inactivation of both the EGFR-Erk and EGFR-Akt pathways. In human colonic cancer cells, Sb prevented EGF-induced proliferation, reduced cell colony formation, and promoted apoptosis. HER-2, HER-3, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor were also found to be inactivated by Sb. Oral intake of Sb reduced intestinal tumor growth and dysplasia in C57BL/6J Min/+ (Apc(Min)) mice.Thus, in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, Sb inhibits EGFR and other receptor  kinase signaling and thereby may also serve a novel therapeutic or prophylactic role in intestinal neoplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646072>Genetic and Environmental Interactions Modify the Risk of Diabetes-Related Autoimmunity by 6 Years of Age: The TEDDY Study.</a></h2><p>We tested the associations between genetic background and selected environmental exposures with respect to islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes.Infants with HLA-DR high-risk genotypes were prospectively followed for diabetes-related autoantibodies. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) came from the Illumina ImmunoChip and environmental exposure data were by parental report. Children were followed to age 6 years.Insulin autoantibodies occurred earlier than GAD antibody (GADA) and then declined, while GADA incidence rose and remained constant (significant in HLA-DR4 but not in the DR3/3 children). The presence of SNPs rs2476601 () and rs2292239 () demonstrated increased risk of both autoantibodies to insulin (IAA) only and GADA only. SNP rs689 () was protective of IAA only, but not of GADA only. The rs3757247 () SNP demonstrated increased risk of GADA only.

The principal bioactive peptide fraction was comprised mainly of proteins and minerals (74.3 and 15.5%, respectively). Lipids were not detected. The amino acid content revealed that arginine (4.6%), glutamic acid (5.3%) and  (4.8%) residues were represented in the highest composition in the antibacterial peptide fraction. The optimal inhibitory activity was observed at alkaline pH. The V. vulnificus strain, most sensitive to the peptide fraction, was used to develop purification methods. The most promising chromatography resins selected for purification, in order to isolate peptides of interest and to carry out their detailed biochemical characterization, were the SP-Sepharose™ Fast Flow cation exchanger and the Phenyl Sepharose™ High Performance hydrophobic interaction media. The partially purified antibacterial peptide fraction was analyzed for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, and the value obtained was 25 μg ml(-1).

However, research interests usually focus on biologic activities of the in vivo available herb-derived components and their exposure in circulation. In this study, we illustrated the importance of studying the presystemic interplay with gut microbiota for understanding the holistic actions of medicinal herbs by using calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (C7G), the most abundant flavonoid and chemical marker in Astragali Radix, as a model compound. When C7G was orally administrated to rats, calycosin-3'-O-glucuronide (G2) was the major circulating component in the blood together with a minor calycosin but not C7G. Rat gut microbiota hydrolyzed C7G in vitro rapidly and produced its aglycone calycosin. Calycosin exhibited higher permeability than C7G and further underwent extensive glucuronidation to yield 3'-glucuronide as the dominant metabolite. Bioactivity assays revealed that G2 exhibited similar or more potent proangiogenic effects than calycosin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor II-induced blood vessel loss model in zebrafish. More interestingly, the incubation of C7G with gut microbiota from both normal and colitic rats showed a -like effect through stimulating the growth of the beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.

Stool samples were collected at entry (T0), at the end of the 2-week therapeutic course (T1), and 30 (T2) and 60 days (T3) after the end of the therapeutic course. Real-time PCR quantified targeted microorganisms. Fecal metabolome patterns were studied by high-resolution proton NMR spectroscopy. At cumulative analysis, symptoms significantly decreased at each time point during follow-up (p less than 0.0001), and only left-lower quadrant pain increased again at T3. The overall bacterial quantity was not altered by the treatments. The amount of  species was significantly reduced at T1 (p=0.017) and at T2 (p=0.026), while at T3 the reduction was not significant in comparison to enrollment (p=0.090). Fecal molecular profile showed significant changes at T1 and T2, while at T3 it became similar to that of T0. Differences were found for 18 of the quantified molecules (tryptophan, phenylalanine, , 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, urocanate, X-6.363, X-5.779, uridylate, galactose, X-4.197, threonine, sarcosine, methionine, 2-oxoisocaproate, 5-aminolevulinate, alanine, leucine, valerate).

Since their elective habitat is food, especially dairy but also vegetal food, it is frequent to find bioactive molecules in fermented products. Sometimes these compounds can have adverse effects on human health such as biogenic amines (tyramine and histamine), causing allergies, hypertensive crises, and headache. However, some LAB products also display benefits for the consumers. In the present review article, the main nitrogen compounds produced by LAB are considered. Besides biogenic amines derived from the amino acids , histidine, phenylalanine, lysine, ornithine, and glutamate by decarboxylation, interesting peptides can be decrypted by the proteolytic activity of LAB. LAB proteolytic system is very efficient in releasing encrypted molecules from several proteins present in different food matrices. Alpha and beta-caseins, albumin and globulin from milk and dairy products, rubisco from spinach, beta-conglycinin from soy and gluten from cereals constitute a good source of important bioactive compounds. These encrypted peptides are able to control nutrition (mineral absorption and oxidative stress protection), metabolism (blood glucose and cholesterol lowering) cardiovascular function (antithrombotic and hypotensive action), infection (microbial inhibition and immunomodulation) and gut-brain axis (opioids and anti-opioids controlling mood and food intake). Very recent results underline the role of food-encrypted peptides in protein folding (chaperone-like molecules) as well as in cell cycle and apoptosis control, suggesting new and positive aspects of fermented food, still unexplored. In this context, the detailed (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) characterization of LAB of food interest (as starters, biocontrol agents, nutraceuticals, and ) can supply a solid evidence-based science to support beneficial effects and it is a promising approach as well to obtain functional food. The detailed knowledge of the modulation of human physiology, exploiting the health-promoting properties of fermented food, is an open field of investigation that will constitute the next challenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789126>Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: pathophysiology, frequency and guideline-based management.</a></h2><p>Diarrhea is one of the main drawbacks for cancer patients. Possible etiologies could be radiotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents, decreased physical performance, graft versus host disease and infections. Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) is a common problem, especially in patients with advanced cancer. The incidence of CID has been reported to be as high as 50-80% of treated patients (≥30% CTC grade 3-5), especially with 5-fluorouracil bolus or some combination therapies of irinotecan and fluoropyrimidines (IFL, XELIRI). Regardless of the molecular targeted approach of  kinase inhibitors and antibodies, diarrhea is a common side effect in up to 60% of patients with up to 10% having severe diarrhea. Furthermore, the underlying pathophysiology is still under investigation. Despite the number of clinical trials evaluating therapeutic or prophylactic measures in CID, there are just three drugs recommended in current guidelines: loperamide, deodorized tincture of opium and octreotide. Newer strategies and more effective agents are being developed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CID. Recent research focusing on the prophylactic use of antibiotics, budesonide,  or activated charcoal still have to define the role of these drugs in the routine clinical setting. Whereas therapeutic management and clinical work-up of patients presenting with diarrhea after chemotherapy are rather well defined, prediction and prevention of CID is an evolving field. Current research focuses on establishing predictive factors for CID like uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 polymorphisms for irinotecan or dihydropyrimidine-dehydrogenase insufficiency for fluoropyrimidines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134068> May Have Beneficial Effects in Parkinson's Disease:  Evidence.</a></h2><p> Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons and intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, both in the basal ganglia and in peripheral sites, such as the gut. Peripheral immune activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are important pathogenetic features of PD. In this context, the present study focused on the assessment of  effects of probiotic bacterial strains in PBMCs isolated from PD patients vs. healthy controls.  40 PD patients and 40 matched controls have been enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and co-cultured with a selection of  microorganisms belonging to the  and  genus.  release of the major pro- (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and Interleukin-17A and 6) and anti-inflammatory (Interleukin 4 and 10) cytokines by PBMCs, as well as the production of ROS was investigated. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of  to influence membrane integrity, antagonize the growth of potential pathogen bacteria, such as  and  and encode  decarboxylase genes ().  All probiotic strains were able to inhibit inflammatory cytokines and ROS production in both patients and controls. The most striking results were obtained in PD subjects with  LS01 and  which significantly reduced pro-inflammatory and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokines ( < 0.05). Furthermore, most strains determined restoration of membrane integrity and inhibition of  and . Finally, we also showed that all the strains do not carry  gene, which is known to decrease levodopa bioavailability in PD patients under treatment.   exert promising  results in decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and potentially pathogenic bacterial overgrowth.  longitudinal data are mandatory to support the use of bacteriotherapy in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824650>VSL#3 Probiotic Stimulates T-cell Protein  Phosphatase-mediated Recovery of IFN-γ-induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Defects.</a></h2><p>VSL#3 is a probiotic compound that has been used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) is the protein product of the inflammatory bowel disease candidate gene, PTPN2, and we have previously shown that it protects epithelial barrier function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VSL#3 improves intestinal epithelial barrier function against the effects of the inflammatory bowel disease-associated proinflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) through activation of TCPTP.Polarized monolayers of T84 intestinal epithelial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of VSL#3 to determine effects on TCPTP expression and enzymatic activity. Therapeutic effects of VSL#3 against barrier disruption by IFN-γ were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability. A novel TCPTP-deficient HT-29 intestinal epithelial cell line was generated to study the role of TCPTP in mediating the effects of VSL#3. Tight junction protein distribution was assessed with confocal microscopy.VSL#3 increased TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a VSL#3-induced decrease in IFN-γ signaling. VSL#3 corrected the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in epithelial permeability induced by IFN-γ. Moreover, the restorative effect of VSL#3 against IFN-γ signaling, epithelial permeability defects, altered expression and localization of the tight junction proteins claudin-2, occludin, and zonula occludens-1, were not realized in stable TCPTP/(PTPN2)-deficient HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells.VSL#3 reduces IFN-γ signaling and IFN-γ-induced epithelial barrier defects in a TCPTP-dependent manner.

The studied mice were divided into four groups: healthy, injured, LF-Suo-L and LF-Suo-H group. After the LF-Suo intragastric administration, the gastric injury area was reduced compared to the injured group. The serum MOT (motilin), SP (substance P), ET (endothelin) levels of LF-Suo treated mice were lower, and SS (somatostatin), VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) levels were higher than the injured group mice. The cytokine IL-6 (interleukin 6), IL-12 (interleukin 12), TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) and IFN-γ (interferon-γ) serum levels were decreased after the LF-Suo treatment. The gastric tissues SOD (superoxide dismutase), GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase), NO (nitric oxide) and activities of LF-Suo treated mice were increased and MDA (malondialdehyde) activity was decreased compared to the injured group mice. By the RT-PCR assay, LF-Suo raised the occludin, EGF (epidermal growth factor), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), Fit-1 (fms-like  kinase-1), IκB-α (inhibitor kappaB-α), nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase), eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT (catalase) mRNA or protein expressions and reduced the COX-2, NF-κB (nuclear factor kappaB), and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) expressions in gastric tissues compared to the gastric injured group mice. A high concentration (1.0 × 10⁸ CFU/kg b.w.) of LF-Suo treatment showed stronger anti-gastric injury effects compared to a low concentration of (0.5 × 10⁸ CFU/kg b.w.) of LF-Suo treatment.

Even though pigmentation is a normal mechanism protecting skin from UV-causing DNA damage and oxidative stress, it is still an aesthetic problem for many people. Bacteria can produce some compounds in response to their environment. These compounds are widely used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Some  have immunomodulatory activities and modulate the symptoms of several diseases. Previously, we found that the extracts of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Lycogen™) inhibited nitric oxide production and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression in activated macrophages. In this study, we sought to investigate an anti-melanogenic signaling pathway in α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-treated B16F10 melanoma cells and zebrafish. Treatment with Lycogen™ inhibited the cellular melanin contents and expression of melanogenesis-related protein, including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase in B16F10 cells. Moreover, Lycogen™ reduced phosphorylation of MEK/ERK without affecting phosphorylation of p38. Meanwhile, Lycogen™ decreased zebrafish melanin expression in a dose-dependent manner. These findings establish Lycogen™ as a new target in melanogenesis and suggest a mechanism of action through the ERK signaling pathway. Our results suggested that Lycogen™ may have potential cosmetic usage in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23173670>Potential role of  on colorectal cancer prevention.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer represents the most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract.

Evidence from a wide range of sources supports the assumption that the link between diet and colorectal cancer may be due to an imbalance of the intestinal microflora.Probiotic bacteria are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a healthy benefit on the host, and they have been investigated for their protective anti-tumor effects. In vivo and molecular studies have displayed encouraging findings that support a role of  in colorectal cancer prevention.Several mechanisms could explain the preventive action of  against colorectal cancer onset.

Defective PAH causes accumulation of phenylalanine, which has neurotoxic effects and leads to dermatological, behavioral, and neurocognitive problems. Treatments for this disease consist in life-long diets that are hard for patients to keep, or supplementation with BH4. In this study, we propose a system where a probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can be used as vehicle to express in situ an engineered human PAH. Engineered PAHs contain a secretion peptide, a gastrointestinal signal (GI), the human PAH, and a flexible glycine linker followed by the fluorescence protein mEGFP. Engineered constructs were successfully transformed, expressed, and secreted in Lactobacillus plantarum CM_PUJ411. PAH construct containing either the signal peptide GI1 or GI2 were transported through a Caco-2 cell monolayer. Nevertheless, the one containing GI1 allowed the highest transport through the cell monolayer. Co-culture of L. plantarum and Caco-2 cells showed that engineered PAH is produced in-situ and transported through the cell monolayer. Finally, the activity test showed that the engineered PAH secreted by L. plantarum CM_PUJ411 is active, leading to a reduction in l-Phe and an increase in l-Tyr levels, respectively. These results show the potential of this system as a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of PKU patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since different  seem to exert various effects in vivo, we tested the relevance of the autoaggregation phenotype on the intestinal persistence of lactobacilli and their ability to modulate the host's innate immune responses. After 14 days of diet supplementation, the aggregating strain Lactobacillus crispatus M247 but not aggregation-deficient isogenic mutant MU5 was recovered from the feces and colonic mucosa of mice. This observation was confirmed by strain-specific PCR amplification and by Lactobacillus-specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. Indeed, L. crispatus M247 increased Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA levels, while it reduced TLR4 mRNA and protein levels in the colonic mucosa, whereas MU5 was ineffective. In colonic epithelial cells (CMT-93 cells) L. crispatus M247 but not MU5 induced time-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1)  phosphorylation and TLR modulation, which were abolished in the presence of PD98059 (an ERK1 inhibitor). To assess the functional relevance of probiotic-induced TLR modulation, we determined the consequences of L. crispatus preexposure on TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and TLR2 [Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4] ligand-mediated effects in intestinal epithelial cells. Preexposure to L. crispatus M247 blunted LPS-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) release and inhibition of CMT-93 migration over a wound edge, whereas it enhanced TLR2-mediated IL-10 up-regulation. In summary, the aggregation phenotype is required for L. crispatus persistence in the colon and for modulation of TLR2/TLR4 expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. We speculate that the aggregation phenotype in L. crispatus M247 is required to temper epithelial cell responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins, which thus affects the evolution of intestinal inflammatory processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676723>Lactobacillus pentosus B231 Isolated from a Portuguese PDO Cheese: Production and Partial Characterization of Its Bacteriocin.</a></h2><p>Bacteriocin B231 produced by Lactobacillus pentosus, isolated from an artisanal raw cow's milk protected designation of origin Portuguese cheese, is a small protein with an apparent relative mass of about 5 kDa and active against a large number of Listeria monocytogenes wild-type strains, Listeria ivanovii and Listeria innocua. Bacteriocin B231 production is highly dependent on the type of the culture media used for growth of Lact. pentosus B231. Replacement of glucose with maltose yielded the highest bacteriocin production from eight different carbon sources. Similar results were recorded in the presence of combination of glucose and maltose or galactose. Production of bacteriocin B231 reached maximal levels of 800 AU/ml during the stationary phase of growth of Lact. pentosus B231 in MRS broth at 30 °C.

We previously observed that probiotic bacteria could prevent inhibition of lymphoproliferation and apoptosis responses of T cells associated with S. enterica infections in orally challenged mice.In this study, changes in expression of genes related to lymphocyte activation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) of mice orally infected with S. enterica with and without treatment with probiotic bacteria were evaluated. Probiotic bacteria increased expression of mRNA for clusters of differentiation antigen 2 (Cd2), protein  phosphatase receptor type C (Ptprc), and Toll-like receptor 6 (Tlr6) genes related to T and B cell activation in mouse intestinal tissue. The probiotic bacteria were also associated with reduced mRNA expression of a group of genes (RelB, Myd88, Iκκa, Jun, Irak2) related to nuclear factor of kappa light chains enhancer in B cells (NF-κB) signal transduction pathway-regulated cytokine responses. Probiotic bacteria were also associated with reduced mRNA expression of apoptotic genes (Casp2, Casp12, Dad1, Akt1, Bad) that suggest high avidity lymphocyte sparing. Reduced CD2 immunostaining in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) was suggestive of reduced lymphocyte activation in probiotic-treated mice. Reduced immunostaining of TLR6 in MALT of probiotic-treated, S. enterica-infected mice suggests that diminished innate immune sensitivity to S. enterica antigens is associated with preventing lymphocyte deletion.The results of this study are consistent with prevention of S. enterica-induced deletion of lymphocytes by the influence of probiotic bacteria in mucosal lymphoid tissues of mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22986194>Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented Manzanilla Aloreña green table olives.</a></h2><p>Manzanilla Aloreña (or Aloreña) table olives are naturally fermented traditional green olives with a denomination of protection (DOP).

We determined the effects of  on EHEC-mediated disruption of IFN-gamma-stimulated STAT-1 activation in epithelial cell lines. Confluent Intestine 407, HEp-2 and Caco-2 epithelial cells were pre-treated (3 h) with either  or surface-layer proteins derived from Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 prior to infection with EHEC O157:H7 strain CL56 (m.o.i. 100:1, 6 h, 37 degrees C in 5% CO2). Subsequently, cells were washed and stimulated with human recombinant IFN-gamma (50 ng ml(-1), 0.5 h, 37 degrees C) followed by whole-cell protein extraction and immunoblotting for -phosphorylated STAT-1. Relative to uninfected cells, STAT-1-activation was reduced after EHEC O157:H7 infection. Pre-incubation with the probiotic L. helveticus R0052 followed by EHEC infection abrogated pathogen-mediated disruption of IFN-gamma-STAT-1 signalling. As determined using Transwell inserts, probiotic-mediated protection was independent of epithelial cell contact. In contrast, pre-incubation with boiled L. helveticus R0052, an equal concentration of viable Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011, or surface-layer proteins (0.14 mg ml(-1)) did not restore STAT-1 signalling in EHEC-infected cells. The viable probiotic agent L. helveticus R0052 prevented EHEC O157:H7-mediated subversion of epithelial cell signal transduction responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21483797>Saccharomyces boulardii improves intestinal cell restitution through activation of the α2β1 integrin collagen receptor.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial cell damage is frequently seen in the mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Complete remission of these diseases requires both the cessation of inflammation and the migration of enterocytes to repair the damaged epithelium. Lyophilized Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb, Biocodex) is a nonpathogenic yeast widely used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we determined whether Sb could accelerate enterocyte migration. Cell migration was determined in Sb force-fed C57BL6J mice and in an in vitro wound model. The impact on α2β1 integrin activity was assessed using adhesion assays and the analysis of α2β1 mediated signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Sb secretes compounds that enhance the migration of enterocytes independently of cell proliferation. This enhanced migration was associated with the ability of Sb to favor cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Indeed, the yeast activates α2β1 integrin collagen receptors. This leads to an increase in  phosphorylation of cytoplasmic molecules, including focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, involved in the integrin signaling pathway. These changes are associated with the reorganization of focal adhesion structures. In conclusion Sb secretes motogenic factors that enhance cell restitution through the dynamic regulation of α2β1 integrin activity. This could be of major importance in the development of novel therapies targeting diseases characterized by severe mucosal injury, such as inflammatory and infectious bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19266568>Lactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716 prevents and reverts intestinal damage on TNBS-induced colitis in mice.</a></h2><p> attenuate gut inflammation when administered before experimental colitis, but data on their effect after colitis induction are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716 on gut injury when administered either before or after trinitrobencene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis in Balb/c mice.In a preventive study, probiotic or vehicle was administered for 2 weeks before colitis. Then mice were allocated to: probiotic + TNBS, probiotic + sham, vehicle + TNBS, or vehicle + sham, and sacrificed 72 hours later. In a therapeutic study, mice were allocated into the same groups as before. Probiotic or vehicle were administered for 3 weeks. Mice were sacrificed at weeks 1, 2, and 3 after TNBS. Histological score, myeloperoxidase activity, and eicosanoid and cytokine production in colonic explant cultures were measured. Immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine and MyD88 was also performed.In the preventive study, colitis was milder with probiotic than with vehicle (P = 0.041). This was associated with increased PGE(2), IL-2, and IL-4 production, as well as attenuated nitrotyrosine staining in the former. In the therapeutic study, histological score at week 1 post-TNBS was higher in probiotic than in vehicle fed mice (P = 0.018). However, at weeks 2 and 3 the histological score was significantly lower-with decreased IL-6 production and increased MyD88 staining-in mice receiving the probiotic.Pretreatment with L. fermentum CECT 5716 attenuates TNBS colitis, an effect that seems to be due to its antioxidant abilities. When administered after TNBS, this probiotic is also effective in accelerating colitis recovery, and this is associated with an enhanced Toll-like receptor function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776608>Long-term treatment with kefir  ameliorates cardiac function in spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>This work evaluated the effects of long-term kefir treatment in cardiac function (cardiac contractility and calcium-handling proteins) and the central nervous system (CNS) control of the sympathetic signaling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male normotensive rats [Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs)] and SHRs were divided into three groups: WKYs and SHRs treated with vehicle, and SHRs treated with milk fermented by the grains of kefir (5%; SHR-Kefir; oral gavage, 0.3 ml/100 g daily/9 weeks). At the end of treatment, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by direct arterial catheterization. Hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time constant, maximal and minimal pressure decay) were acquired through a left ventricular catheter implantation. Left ventricle protein expressions of phospholamban (PLB), its phosphorylated form (p-PLB) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) were determined by Western blot.  hydroxylase (TH) protein expression was evaluated via immunofluorescence within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). SHR-Kefir group presented lower MAP and HR compared to SHRs. Kefir treatment ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and promoted reduced expression of PLB, p-PLB and SERCA2a contractile proteins. Within the PVN and RVML, TH protein overexpression observed in SHRs was reduced by probiotic treatment. In addition, kefir improved cardiac hemodynamic parameters in SHR-treated animals. Altogether, the data show that long-term kefir treatment reduced blood pressure by mechanisms involving reduction of cardiac hypertrophy, improvement of cardiac contractility and calcium-handling proteins, and reduction in the CNS regulation of the sympathetic activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While the mechanisms by which commensal prokaryotes stimulate immune signaling networks are well-characterized, less is known about the mechanistic control over homeostatic pathways within tissues. Recent reports by our research group have demonstrated that contact between the gut epithelia and some groups of enteric commensal bacteria prompts the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within host cells. Whereas the bacterial-induced production of ROS in phagocytes in response to ligand binding to Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs) and ensuing activation of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is a well-defined mechanism, ROS generated by other cell types such as intestinal epithelia in response to microbial signals via FPRs and the NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) is less appreciated. Importantly, enzymatically generated ROS have been shown to function as second messengers in many signal transduction pathways via the transient oxidative activity on sensor proteins bearing oxidant-sensitive thiol groups. Examples of redox sensitive proteins include  phosphatases that serve as regulators of MAPK pathways, focal adhesion kinase, as well as components involved NF-kB activation. Here, we review the leading edge discoveries gleaned from investigations that focus on microbial-induced generation of ROS and their functional effects on host physiology. These studies identify the functional molecular elements and mechanistic events that mediate the established effects of the normal microbiota on intestinal physiology.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the composite evidence that this approach translates to the clinic, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of prophylactic  for the prevention of cancer therapy-induced diarrhoea.A three-step search strategy was used to identify relevant studies (1 June 2000-1 June 2017) investigating probiotic intervention for diarrhoea secondary to any cancer therapy (cytotoxic, targeted and immunotherapies). RCTs across PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and CENTRAL were assessed for eligibility and assessed using RevMan 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration). Seven trials with a total of 1091 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, prophylactic  did not prevent or reduce the overall incidence of diarrhoea or severe CTCAE Grade at least 3 diarrhoea [relative risk (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.60-1.09, Z = 1.41, P = 0.16; RR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.25-1.16, Z = 1.58, P = 0.11], nor did it influence the use of rescue medication (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.53-1.65, Z = 0.24, P = 0.81).Current evidence does not support widespread implementation of  for diarrhoea secondary to cytotoxic therapy and the  kinase inhibitor, dacomitinib.

In this context, the catabolism of amino acid tryptophan via kynurenine may play an important role. The present study examined the effect of a probiotic supplement on the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and the metabolism of aromatic amino acids after exhaustive aerobic exercise in trained athletes during three months of winter training.Thirty-three highly trained individuals were randomly assigned to probiotic (PRO,  = 17) or placebo (PLA,  = 16) groups using double blind procedures, receiving either 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU) of a multi-species probiotic ( W23,  W51,  W54,  W22,  W63, and  W58) or placebo once per day for 12 weeks. The serum concentrations of tryptophan, phenylalanine and their primary catabolites kynurenine and , as well as the concentration of the immune activation marker neopterin were determined at baseline and after 12 weeks, both at rest and immediately after exercise. Participants completed a daily diary to identify any infectious symptoms.After 12 weeks of treatment, post-exercise tryptophan levels were lowered by 11% (a significant change) in the PLA group compared to the concentrations measured before the intervention ( = 0.02), but remained unchanged in the PRO group. The ratio of subjects taking the placebo who experienced one or more URTI symptoms was increased 2.2-fold compared to those on  (PLA 0.79, PRO 0.35;  = 0.02).Data indicate reduced exercise-induced tryptophan degradation rates in the PRO group. Daily supplementation with  limited exercise-induced drops in tryptophan levels and reduced the incidence of URTI, however, did not benefit athletic performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265284>Characterization of functional, safety, and probiotic properties of Enterococcus faecalis UGRA10, a new AS-48-producer strain.</a></h2><p>Enterococcus faecalis UGRA10, a new AS-48-producer strain, has been isolated from a Spanish sheep's cheese. The inhibitory substance produced by E. faecalis UGRA10 was purified and characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, confirming its identity with AS-48 enterocin (7.150 Da). Subsequent genetic analysis showed the existence of the as-48 gene cluster on a plasmid of approximately 70-kb. The UGRA10 strain was examined for safety properties such as enterococci virulence genes, biogenic amine production, and antibiotic resistance. As for most E. faecalis strains, PCR amplification revealed the existence of gene encoding for GelE, Asa1, Esp, EfaA, and Ace antigens and for  decarboxylase. This strain was sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested, being resistant only to aminoglycosides, lincosamide, and pristinamicins. In addition, UGRA10 developed an ability to form biofilms and to adhere to Caco 2 and HeLa 229 cells. More interestingly, this strain shows a high ability to interfere with the adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes to Caco 2 cells. Altogether, the results suggest that this broad-spectrum bacteriocin-producing strain has biotechnological potential to be developed as a protective agent in food preservation and as a probiotic.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the importance of gut microbes in digestion, a genetically engineered microbe could potentially degrade some ingested phenylalanine from the diet prior to absorption. To test this, a phenylalanine lyase gene from Anabaena variabilis (AvPAL) was codon-optimized and cloned into a shuttle vector for expression in Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23C (pHENOMMenal). Functional expression of AvPAL was determined in vitro, and subsequently tested in vivo in homozygous PAHenu2 (PKU model) mice. Initial trials of two PAHenu2 homozygous (PKU) mice defined conditions for freeze-drying and delivery of bacteria. Animals showed reduced blood phe within three to four days of treatment with pHENOMMenal probiotic, and blood phe concentrations remained significantly reduced (P < 0.0005) compared to untreated controls during the course of experiments. Although pHENOMMenal probiotic could be cultured from fecal samples at four months post treatment, it could no longer be cultivated from feces at eight months post treatment, indicating eventual loss of the microbe from the gut. Preliminary screens during experimentation found no immune response to AvPAL. Collectively these studies provide data for the use of a genetically engineered probiotic as a potential treatment for PKU.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478573>Tyrosinase Inhibitory and Anti-oxidative Effects of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Dairy Cow Feces.</a></h2><p>Overproduction and accumulation of melanin cause a number of skin diseases. The inhibitors of tyrosinase are important for the treatment of skin diseases associated with hyper-pigmentation after UV exposure and application in cosmetics for whitening and depigmentation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydrogen peroxide are generated by chemical substances and metabolic intermediates and cause various diseases including cancer and heart diseases. We have isolated four different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains from dairy cow feces and investigated the tyrosinase inhibition and anti-oxidative effects of culture filtrates prepared from the isolated bacteria, which are designated as EA3, EB2, PC2, and PD3. To investigate optimal culture conditions isolated LAB strains, the measurements of tyrosinase inhibitory and anti-oxidative activities were performed. The results of tyrosinase inhibitory activities revealed that Enterococcus sp. EA3 showed about 65% at culture conditions (14 h, 30 °C, pH 8, and 0% NaCl), Enterococcus sp. EB2 about 65% at culture conditions (12 h, 30 °C, pH 9, and 0% NaCl), Pediococcus sp. PC2 about 80% at culture conditions (20 h, 30 °C, pH 6, and 0% NaCl), and Pediococcus sp. PD3 about 80% at culture conditions (20 h, 30 °C, pH 8, and 0% NaCl), respectively. In addition, anti-oxidative activities against four different LAB strains showed approximately more than 30% at optimal conditions for the measurements of tyrosinase inhibitory activities. From the results, we have suggested that the isolated four LAB strains could be useful for a potential agent for developing anti-oxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors.</p></html>
