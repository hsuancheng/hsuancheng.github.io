To this end, we developed in situ gelling hydrogels from low-fouling poly(carboxybetaine-co-maleimide) (pCBM) random copolymers and thiolated hyaluronic  (HA-SH). pCBM-HA hydrogel enzymatic degradation rates were tuned 5 fold by altering pCBM composition (4, 11, and 16 maleimide mol%) and 2.3 fold by HA-SH concentration (1-2 wt%). pCBM-HA gels were low-fouling towards bovine serum albumin (BSA; adsorbed ∼20 μg cm) and resisted fibroblast adhesion. To control pCBM-HA bioactivity, the cell adhesive peptide CGRGDS was immobilized on pCBM to promote fibroblast adhesion (39% decrease in circularity), which increased metabolic activity by ∼50%. pCBM-HA modified with CGRGDS enhanced the metabolic activity of encapsulated T cells by ∼21% compared to gels without HA, indicating their potential for immunotherapies. Low-fouling pCBM-HA hydrogels provide a vehicle with tunable degradation rates and biochemical environments for encapsulation applications in cell adoptive therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607477>The role of selenium-mediated redox signaling by selenophosphate synthetase 1 (SEPHS1) in hESCs.</a></h1><p>Selenium (Se) plays a vital role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and redox regulation in intracellular signaling via selenocysteine (Sec), known as the 21st proteinogenic amino , but its specific biological functions in development and disease remain undiscovered. In this study, we explored the role of selenophosphate synthetase 1 (SEPHS1) in the pluripotency maintenance and reprogramming. We found that high level of SEPHS1 is retained in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which is decreased during their differentiation. SEPHS1 knockdown significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency, proving that SEPHS1 is required for acquisition of pluripotency. However, SEPHS1 knockdown did not affect the expression of significant pluripotency genes, suggesting that SEPHS1 may be involved in the survival of pluripotent stem cells rather than in the regulation of pluripotency genes. Transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of the gene set related to the ROS pathway and apoptosis in SEPHS1-knockdown cells. We also demonstrated the role of SEPHS1 in human ESC clonogenicity, and we found improved single-cell survival of hESCs by selenium treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Our study implies that hSEPHS1 is a regulator of selenium-mediated redox-signaling in human pluripotent stem cells and plays a role in their survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These gut microbes alter therapeutic response and toxicity to cancer therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, kinase inhibitors, and  agents. The gut microbiota generates short-chain fatty  that are significant regulators of histone post-translational modifications that fundamentally regulate gene expression, linking the microbiota to cellular metabolism and transcriptional regulation. The short-chain fatty  not only act locally but can be taken up in the blood stream to inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases, regulate gene expression in distant organs as well as the effector function of CD8+ T cells. Cancer and the treatments for it negatively impact the microbiome often resulting in dysbiosis. This can diminish a patient's response to treatment as well as increase systemic toxicities from these therapies. In addition to the gut microbiota, microbes have been detected in tumors that can modulate chemotherapeutic drug response and can result in immune suppression. The gut microbiota and tumor-associated bacteria may be a significant contributor to the interindividual differences and heterogeneous responses to cancer therapies and drug tolerability and strategies that support and/or manipulate the microbiota to improve therapeutic outcome is an emerging area for personalized cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244949>Advances in intracellular delivery through supramolecular self-assembly of oligonucleotides and peptides.</a></h1><p>Cells utilize natural supramolecular assemblies to maintain homeostasis and biological functions. Naturally inspired modular assembly of biomaterials are now being exploited for understanding or manipulating cell biology for treatment, diagnosis, and detection of diseases. Supramolecular biomaterials, in particular peptides and oligonucleotides, can be precisely tuned to have diverse structural, mechanical, physicochemical and biological properties. These merits of oligonucleotides and peptides as building blocks have given rise to the evolution of numerous nucleic - and peptide-based self-assembling nanomaterials for various medical applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and . In this review, we provide an extensive overview of the intracellular delivery approaches using supramolecular self-assembly of DNA, RNA, and peptides. Furthermore, we discuss the current challenges related to subcellular delivery and provide future perspectives of the application of supramolecular biomaterials for intracellular delivery in theranostics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289278>Antitumor effects of the GM3(Neu5Gc) ganglioside-specific humanized antibody 14F7hT against Cmah-transfected cancer cells.</a></h1><p>The GM3(Neu5Gc) ganglioside represents a tumor-specific antigen that is considered a promising target for cancer . We previously demonstrated that the humanized antibody 14F7hT, specific for this ganglioside, exhibited significant antitumor effects in preclinical hematological tumor models. As this antibody recognizes human tumor tissues from several origins, we addressed its potential effect on different tumor types. The use of cell lines for testing GM3(Neu5Gc)-targeting strategies, in particular for human malignancies, is complicated by the absence in humans of functional cytidine monophospho-N-acetyl-neuraminic  hydroxylase (CMAH), the enzyme required for Neu5Gc sialic  biosynthesis. Quantitative flow cytometry revealed the absence of surface GM3(Neu5Gc) in several human but also mouse cell lines, in the last case due to low expression of the enzyme. Hypoxia-induced expression of this ganglioside on human SKOV3 cells was observed upon culture in Neu5Gc-containing medium without evidence for CMAH-independent biosynthesis. However, only transfection of the mouse Cmah gene into human SKOV3 and mouse 3LL cells induced a stable expression of GM3(Neu5Gc) on the cancer cell surface, resulting in effective models to evaluate the antitumor responses by 14F7hT in vitro and in vivo. This antibody exerted antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and in vivo antitumor effects on these Cmah-transfected non-hematological tumors from both mouse and human origin. These results contribute to validate GM3(Neu5Gc) as a relevant target for cancer  and reinforces the value of 14F7hT as a novel anti-cancer drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645452>Repurposing rotavirus vaccines for intratumoral  can overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade.</a></h1><p>Although immune checkpoint-targeted therapies are currently revolutionizing cancer care, only a minority of patients develop durable objective responses to anti-PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 therapy. Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with immune checkpoint-targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer . We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic cell death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the immune system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with immune checkpoint-targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with immune checkpoint-targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic -induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression represents a potential predictive biomarker for . One hundred and twenty-six DMGs (89 adult and 37 pediatric) were assessed for immune profile (PD-L1, cluster of differentiation (CD3, CD8) and genetic markers (mutation in 27th amino  of histone H3 (H3K27M), alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), p53) by immunohistochemistry. Sanger sequencing was done for IDH1 and H3K27M. The thalamus was the commonest site. Four molecular subgroups of DMGs were identified. H3K27M mutation was more frequent in children (P = 0.0001). The difference in median overall survival (OS) was not significant in any of the four molecular subgroups (P > 0.05). PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in H3K27M/IDH1 double-negative adult glioblastomas (GBMs) (P = 0.002). Strong PD-L1 expression was more frequent in grade IV tumors and thalamic location, although the difference was not significant (P = 0.14 and P = 0.19 respectively). Positive PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in median OS in PD-L1-positive versus negative cases among four genetic subgroups (P > 0.05). On univariate analysis, there was no direct correlation of PD-L1 with any genetic alteration, except H3K27M mutation (P = 0.01). CD3 infiltration was similar in both adults and pediatric ages (84.3% and 78.4%, respectively) while CD8 expression was significantly greater in adults compared to children (74.1% vs 37.8%, P = 0.0001). This is the first comprehensive analysis highlighting molecular and immune profiles of DMGs. Despite molecular and clinicopathological diversity, overall survival in DMGs remains dismal. Multicentric studies with larger numbers of cases should be undertaken for stratifying DMGs according to their age, immune and molecular profiles, to develop effective immunotherapies.© 2019 Japanese Society of Neuropathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251968>Plant cell-made protein antigens for induction of Oral tolerance.</a></h1><p>The gut associated lymphoid tissue has effective mechanisms in place to maintain tolerance to food antigens. These can be exploited to induce antigen-specific tolerance for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe allergies and to prevent serious immune responses in protein replacement therapies for genetic diseases. An oral tolerance approach for the prevention of peanut allergy in infants proved highly efficacious and advances in treatment of peanut allergy have brought forth an oral  drug that is currently awaiting FDA approval. Several other protein antigens made in plant cells are in clinical development. Plant cell-made proteins are protected in the stomach from  and enzymes after their oral delivery because of bioencapsulation within plant cell wall, but are released to the immune system upon digestion by gut microbes. Utilization of fusion protein technologies facilitates their delivery to the immune system, oral tolerance induction at low antigen doses, resulting in efficient induction of FoxP3 and latency-associated peptide (LAP) regulatory T cells that express immune suppressive cytokines such as IL-10. LAP and IL-10 expression represent potential biomarkers for plant-based oral tolerance. Efficacy studies in hemophilia dogs support clinical development of oral delivery of bioencapsulated antigens to prevent anti-drug antibody formation. Production of clinical grade materials in cGMP facilities, stability of antigens in lyophilized plant cells for several years when stored at ambient temperature, efficacy of oral delivery of human doses in large animal models and lack of toxicity augur well for clinical advancement of this novel drug delivery concept.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It occurs in a variety of diseases and, unless recognized and treated, leads to severe morbidity and mortality. We present the case of a 48-year-old woman who underwent lung transplantation, initially under tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone. Several complications emerged in the following months, including abdominal aortic and left renal artery thrombosis and cutaneous infections, although her renal function remained normal. Six months after transplant, her renal function began to deteriorate, which was assumed to be due to elevated tacrolimus levels and doses were adjusted. Due to leukopenia, MMF was changed to everolimus. One year after, she was admitted with fatigue, anemia, and renal dysfunction. Complementary exams revealed only iron deficiency, leukopenia, normal platelets, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase; her renal ultrasound was normal. A renal biopsy was performed and thrombotic microangiopathy was subsequently identified as the main cause of the renal dysfunction. Tacrolimus was therefore discontinued and MMF restarted with slow improvement of renal function. Only when everolimus was stopped did the patient's renal function show incremental improvement. TMA may be a serious complication after lung transplantation and the risk is higher when a combination of tacrolimus and everolimus is used. Renal biopsy findings are essential to confirm the final diagnosis of TMA, allowing for a change in immunosuppression to prevent permanent and severe renal damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cattle production is one of the most important economic sectors in Uruguay. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of BCoV infections and their genetic diversity in Uruguayan calves and to describe the evolutionary history of the virus in South America. The overall detection rate of BCoV in Uruguay was 7.8% (64/824): 7.7% (60/782) in dairy cattle and 9.5% (4/42) in beef cattle. The detection rate of BCoV in samples from deceased and live calves was 10.0% (6/60) and 7.6% (58/763), respectively. Interestingly, there was a lower frequency of BCoV detection in calves born to vaccinated dams (3.3%, 8/240) than in calves born to unvaccinated dams (12.2%, 32/263) (OR: 4.02, 95%CI: 1.81-8.90; p = 0.00026). The frequency of BCoV detection was higher in colder months (11.8%, 44/373) than in warmer months (1.5%, 3/206) (OR: 9.05, 95%CI: 2.77-29.53, p = 0.000013). Uruguayan strains grouped together in two different lineages: one with Argentinean strains and the other with Brazilian strains. Both BCoV lineages were estimated to have entered Uruguay in 2013: one of them from Brazil (95%HPD interval: 2011-2014) and the other from Argentina (95%HPD interval: 2010-2014). The lineages differed by four amino  changes, and both were divergent from the Mebus reference strain.

Exosomes play important roles in both normal and pathological conditions by regulating cell-cell communication in cancer, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, osteogenesis, and inflammation. Exosomes are stable in vivo and they can regulate biological processes by transferring lipids, proteins, nucleic , and even entire signaling pathways through the circulation to cells at distal sites. Recent advances in the identification, production, and purification of exosomes have created opportunities to exploit these structures as novel drug delivery systems, modulators of cell signaling, mediators of antigen presentation, as well as biological targeting agents and diagnostic tools in cancer therapy. This review will examine the functions of immunocyte-derived exosomes and their roles in the immune response under physiological and pathological conditions.

T-cell checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionizing the management of advanced cancers including non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. Unfortunately, many common cancers are not responsive to these drugs and resistance remains problematic. A growing number of novel cancer immunotherapies have been discovered but their clinical translation has been limited by shortcomings of conventional drug delivery. Immune signaling is tightly-regulated and often requires simultaneous or near-simultaneous activation of multiple signals in specific subpopulations of immune cells. Nucleic  therapies, which require intact intracellular delivery, are among the most promising approaches to modulate the tumor microenvironment to a pro-immunogenic phenotype. Advanced nanomedicines can be precisely engineered to overcome many of these limitations and appear well-poised to enable the clinical translation of promising cancer immunotherapies.Copyright © 2019.

Recently we have generated DNA aptamers that specifically recognize α-synuclein. In this study, we further investigated the in vivo effect of these aptamers on the neuropathological deficits associated with PD. For efficient delivery of the aptamers into the mouse brain, we employed modified exosomes with the neuron-specific rabies viral glycoprotein (RVG) peptide on the membrane surface. We demonstrated that the aptamers were efficiently packaged into the RVG-exosomes and delivered into neurons in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, the aptamer-loaded RVG-exosomes significantly reduced the α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-induced pathological aggregates, and rescued synaptic protein loss and neuronal death. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of these exosomes into the mice with intra-striatally injected α-synuclein PFF reduced the pathological α-synuclein aggregates and improved motor impairments. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the aptamers targeting α-synuclein aggregates could be effectively delivered into the mouse brain by the RVG-exosomes and reduce the neuropathological and behavioral deficits in the mouse PD model. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of the RVG-exosome delivery of aptamer to alleviate the brain α-synuclein pathology.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The detection of such glycans in malignant and fetal human tissues initially raised the possibility that it was an oncofetal antigen. However, "serum sickness" antibodies were also noted in various human disease states. These findings spurred further research on Neu5Gc, and the discovery that it is not synthesized in the human body due to a human-lineage specific genetic mutation in the enzyme . However, with more sensitive techniques Neu5Gc-glycans were detected in smaller quantities on certain human cell types, particularly epithelia and endothelia. The likely explanation is metabolic incorporation of Neu5Gc from dietary sources, especially red meat of mammalian origin. This incorporated Neu5Gc on glycans appears to be the first example of a "xeno-autoantigen," against which varying levels of "xeno-autoantibodies" are present in all humans. The resulting chronic inflammation or "xenosialitis" may have important implications in human health and disease, especially in conditions known to be aggravated by consumption of red meat. In this review, we will cover the early history of the discovery of "serum sickness" antibodies, the subsequent recognition that they were partly directed against Neu5Gc-glycans, the discovery of the genetic defect eliminating Neu5Gc production in humans, and the later recognition that this was not an oncofetal antigen but the first example of a "xeno-autoantigen." Further, we will present comments about implications for disease risks associated with red meat consumption such as cancer and atherosclerosis. We will also mention the potential utility of these anti-Neu5Gc-glycan antibodies in cancer  and provide some suggestions and perspectives for the future. Other reviews in this special issue cover many other aspects of this unusual pathological process, for which there appears to be no other described precedent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269428>Macrophages and Metabolism in the Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h1><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a plastic and heterogeneous cell population of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that can account for up to 50% of some solid neoplasms. Most often, TAMs support disease progression and resistance to therapy by providing malignant cells with trophic and nutritional support. However, TAMs can mediate antineoplastic effects, especially in response to pharmacological agents that boost their phagocytic and oxidative functions. Thus, TAMs and their impact on the overall metabolic profile of the TME have a major influence on tumor progression and resistance to therapy, de facto constituting promising targets for the development of novel anticancer agents.

Therefore, MDSCs are potential targets for cancer . In this study, we screened an effective polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) inhibitor from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Library and evaluated its synergistic antitumour effects with PD-1 inhibitor.In the present study, we found that PMN-MDSCs accumulate heavily in the spleen and bone marrow of melanoma (B16-F10) tumour-bearing mice. Then, we determined the top 10 key proteins in the upregulated KEGG pathways of PMN-MDSCs in tumour-bearing mice through proteomics and Cytoscape analysis. The key proteins were then used as targets for the screening of PMN-MDSC inhibitors from the traditional Chinese Medicine Library (20000 compounds) through molecular docking and weight calculation of the docking score. Finally, the inhibitory effect of the inhibitor was verified through proteomics and metabolomics analysis in vitro and melanoma (B16-F10) and triple-negative breast cancer (4 T1) mouse tumour models in vivo.Traditional Chinese medicine saposhnikovia root extract Prim-O-glucosylcimifugin (POG) could bind well to the target proteins and inhibit the proliferation, metabolism and immunosuppressive ability of PMN-MDSCs by inhibiting arginine metabolism and the tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA cycle).

We herein provide an update regarding the functions of the MEND system focusing on the introduction of different functional biomaterials that enhance efficiency. The octaarginine (R8) peptide enhances cellular uptake and controls intracellular trafficking to induce synergism in transgene expression. The R8 was also used for developing a MITO-Porter system for mitochondrial targeting. The function of the MITO-Porter system was extended by developing a mitochondrial reporter gene for mitochondrial gene therapy. For efficient in vivo gene delivery, new pH-sensitive lipids have been introduced to achieve controlled biodistribution and to enhance endosomal escape. For example, the CL4H6 lipid exerts a more efficient in vivo gene silencing than that of ONPATTRO, a preparation that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

This retrospective observational study primarily aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of autoimmune encephalitis patients in the Second Xiangya Hospital and report patient prognoses after .  The clinical data of 86 patients who were diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis from October 2014 to September 2018 were collected, and their corresponding clinical characteristics, laboratory examination, treatment, and outcome data analyzed.  In our study, 72 patients (83.7%) were positive for anti-NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) antibody; 5 patients (6%) for anti-GABABR (γ-aminobutyric  receptor-A); 4 patients (4.7%) for anti-LGI1 (leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1); 3 patients (3.5%) for anti-Caspr2 (contactin-associated protein-like 2) (1 patient was positive for both anti-LGI1 and anti-Caspr2 antibodies); and 3 patients (3.5%) for onconeural antibodies. Among the 86 patients diagnosed as having autoimmune encephalitis, 50% showed acute disease onset (≤2 weeks). The most common inducing factor was fever or cold (17/86, 19.8%). The main clinical symptoms included, among others, psychiatric disturbances (82.5%), epilepsy (60.5%), autonomic dysfunction (58.1%), sleep disorders (45.3%), consciousness disorders (45.3%), and speech disorders (46.5%). No significant correlation between ICU admission rates and CSF or serum antibody scores was observed. However, CSF antibody scores of (+ + +) and (++) were associated with longer lengths of hospitalization ( < 0.05) and a higher CSF WBC count when compared with CSF antibody scores of (+) in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis ( < 0.05). Additionally, there was no significant correlation between mRS score difference on admission and discharge (after ) and age, sex, and choice of immune treatment, while immune therapy taken within 15 days from onset was more inclined to be associated with an mRS score difference ≥2 after  in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis ( = 0.006).  Autoimmune encephalitis has an acute or sub-acute onset and presents with psychotic symptoms, epilepsy, and autonomic dysfunction. The sex ratio in anti-NMDAR encephalitis was nearly balanced. Infection was a major factor inducing anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and the CSF antibody scores could be helpful in determining its prognosis since these scores showed associations with hospitalization duration and CSF WBC counts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428573>Fact or Fiction, It Is Time for a Verdict on Vasculogenic Mimicry?</a></h1><p>The term vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the capacity of certain cancer cells to form fluid-conducting structures within a tumor in an endothelial cell (EC)-free manner. Ever since its first report by Maniotis in 1999, the existence of VM has been an extremely contentious issue. The overwhelming consensus of the literature suggests that VM is frequently observed in highly aggressive tumors and correlates to lower patient survival. While the presence of VM  in animal and patient tumors are claimed upon the strong positive staining for glycoproteins (Periodic  Schiff, PAS), it is by no means universally accepted. More controversial still is the existence of an  model of VM that principally divides the scientific community. Original reports demonstrated that channels or tubes occur in cancer cell monolayers  when cultured in matrigel and that these structures may support fluid movement. However, several years later many papers emerged stating that connections formed between cancer cells grown on matrigel represented VM. We speculate that this became accepted by the cancer research community and now the vast majority of the scientific literature reports both presence and mechanisms of VM based on intercellular connections, not the presence of fluid conducting tubes. In this opinion paper, we call upon evidence from an exhaustive review of the literature and original data to argue that the majority of  studies presented as VM do not correspond to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we raise doubts on the validity of concluding the presence of VM in patient samples and animal models based solely on the presence of PAS+ staining. We outline the requirement for new biomarkers of VM and present criteria by which VM should be defined  and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058074>Combined Adjuvant of Poly I:C Improves Antitumor Effects of CAR-T Cells.</a></h1><p>Chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells (CAR-T) therapy is an emerging  against malignancies. However, only limited success was obtained in solid tumors. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (poly I:C), ligand of TLR3, mediates innate immune and adaptive immune and shows broad antitumor effect on many types of cancer. In the present study, we combined EGFRvIII-targeted CAR-T cells with poly I:C treatment and evaluated the synergic antitumor effect  and in immunocompetent mice bearing subcutaneous colon or orthotopic breast cancer xenografts. Poly I:C significantly promoted more IL-2 and IFN γ production as well as higher lytic activity of CAR-T cells. Upon systemic administration , CAR-T cells obviously suppressed tumor growth, and poly I:C significantly enhanced the suppression. Further study showed that poly I:C exerted antitumor effect dependent on type I IFNs. In addition, poly I:C decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) number in peripheral blood and spleen, and attenuated the immunosuppressive activity of MDSC on proliferation and cytolytic function of CAR-T. Depletion of MDSC with anti-Gr1 Ab further increased the antitumor effect of CAR-T cells plus poly I:C treatment. In conclusion, CAR-T treatment combined with intratumoral delivery of poly I:C resulted in synergistic antitumor activity. We thus provide a rationale to translate this immunotherapeutic strategy to solid tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619273>Extracellular NK histones promote immune cell anti-tumor activity by inducing cell clusters through binding to CD138 receptor.</a></h1><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are important anti-tumor cells of our innate immune system. Their anti-cancer activity is mediated through interaction of a wide array of activating and inhibitory receptors with their ligands on tumor cells. After activation, NK cells also secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory molecules that contribute to the final immune response by modulating other innate and adaptive immune cells. In this regard, external proteins from NK cell secretome and the mechanisms by which they mediate these responses are poorly defined.TRANS-stable-isotope labeling of amino  in cell culture (TRANS-SILAC) combined with proteomic was undertaken to identify early materials transferred between cord blood-derived NK cells (CB-NK) and multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Further in vitro and in vivo studies with knock-down of histones and CD138, overexpression of histones and addition of exogenous histones were undertaken to confirm TRANS-SILAC results and to determine functional roles of this material transferred.We describe a novel mechanism by which histones are actively released by NK cells early after contact with MM cells. We show that extracellular histones bind to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan CD138 on the surface of MM cells to promote the creation of immune-tumor cell clusters bringing immune and MM cells into close proximity, and thus facilitating not only NK but also T lymphocyte anti-MM activity.This study demonstrates a novel immunoregulatory role of NK cells against MM cells mediated by histones, and an additional role of NK cells modulating T lymphocytes activity that will open up new avenues to design future  clinical strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061144>Immunizations with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli Heat-Stable Toxin Conjugates Engender Toxin-Neutralizing Antibodies in Mice That Also Cross-React with Guanylin and Uroguanylin.</a></h1><p>Infection with enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) is a common cause of childhood diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries, as well as of diarrhea among travelers to these countries. In children, ETEC strains secreting the heat-stable toxin (ST) are the most pathogenic, and there are ongoing efforts to develop vaccines that target ST. One important challenge for ST vaccine development is to construct immunogens that do not elicit antibodies that cross-react with guanylin and uroguanylin, which are endogenous peptides involved in regulating the activity of the guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptor. We immunized mice with both human ST (STh) and porcine ST (STp) chemically coupled to bovine serum albumin, and the resulting sera neutralized the toxic activities of both STh and STp. This suggests that a vaccine based on either ST variant can confer cross-protection. However, several anti-STh and anti-STp sera cross-reacted with the endogenous peptides, suggesting that the ST sequence must be altered to reduce the risk of unwanted cross-reactivity. Epitope mapping of four monoclonal anti-STh and six anti-STp antibodies, all of which neutralized both STh and STp, revealed that most epitopes appear to have at least one amino  residue shared with guanylin or uroguanylin. Despite this, only one monoclonal antibody displayed demonstrable cross-reactivity to the endogenous peptides, suggesting that targeted mutations of a limited number of ST residues may be sufficient to obtain a safe ST-based vaccine.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545417>Identification of immunodominant IgE epitopes of the major house dust mite allergen Der f 24.</a></h1><p>Previously, a ubiquinol‑cytochrome c reductase binding protein (UQCRB) homolog was identified in the house dust mite (HDM) species Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) as a major allergen. In the present study, the immunodominant immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitope of the protein Der f 24 was investigated. Analysis of the homologous amino  (aa) sequences in Der f and human UQCRB was performed. Four different recombinant Der f 24 and hybrid proteins formed by integrating Der f and human UQCRB sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using Ni‑NTA resins, and IgE‑binding activity was determined using IgE‑western blotting and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments. IgE epitopes were further identified by IgE‑dot blotting and IgE‑ELISA with synthetic polypeptides and HDM‑allergic sera. Three‑dimensional (3D) structural modeling was used to analyze the position of the immunodominant IgE epitope. The amino  sequence homology between Der f 24 and the human UQCRB protein was determined to be 39.34%. IgE‑ELISA and western blot analysis showed that all of the Der f‑human UQCRB hybrid proteins generated, except for the one lacking 59 residues of the N‑terminal region of Der f 24, were bound by allergic serum IgE. A synthetic polypeptide consisting of 32 residues of the N‑terminal reacted with IgEs from HDM‑allergic sera and could be used to generate high titer specific IgG or specific IgE antibodies in immunized mice. The 32‑aa N‑terminal region of Der f 24 was localized to a structural protrusion, which may facilitate specific IgE‑binding. These results indicate that the immunodominant IgE epitope of Der f 24 is located mainly in a 32‑residue region of the N‑terminus. These findings may inform the mechanisms of HDM allergy sensitization and allergy  development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173420>Switchable Enzymatic Accessibility for Precision Cell-Selective Surface Glycan Remodeling.</a></h1><p>Precision cell-selective surface glycan remodeling is of vital importance for modulation of cell surface dynamics, tissue-specific imaging, and , but remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report a switchable enzymatic accessibility (SEA) strategy for highly specific editing of carbohydrate moieties of interest on the target cell surface. We demonstrate the blocking of enzyme in the inaccessible state with a metal-organic framework (MOF) cage and instantaneous switching to the accessible state through disassembly of MOF. We further show that this level of SEA regulation enables initial guided enzyme delivery to the target cell surface for subsequent cell-specific glycan remodeling, thus providing a temporally and spatially controlled tool for tuning the glycosylation architectures. Terminal galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) remodeling and terminal sialic  (Sia) desialylation have been precisely achieved on target cells even with other cell lines in close spatial proximity. The SEA protocol features a modular and generically adaptable design, a very short protocol duration (ca. 30 min or shorter), and a very high spatial resolving power (ability to differentiate immediately neighboring cell lines).© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Heteroclitic BCMA [YLMFLLRKI] peptide-encapsulated liposome or poly(lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) nanoparticles displayed uniform size distribution and increased peptide delivery to human dendritic cells, which enhanced induction of BCMA-specific CTL. Distinct from liposome-based nanoparticles, PLGA-based nanoparticles demonstrated a gradual increase in peptide uptake by antigen-presenting cells, and induced BCMA-specific CTL with higher anti-tumor activities (CD107a degranulation, CTL proliferation, and IFN-γ/IL-2/TNF-α production) against primary CD138 tumor cells and MM cell lines. The improved functional activities were associated with increased Tetramer/CD45RO memory CTL, CD28 upregulation on Tetramer CTL, and longer maintenance of central memory (CCR7 CD45RO) CTL, with the highest anti-MM activity and less differentiation into effector memory (CCR7 CD45RO) CTL. These results provide the framework for therapeutic application of PLGA-based BCMA immunogenic peptide delivery system, rather than free peptide, to enhance the induction of BCMA-specific CTL with poly-functional Th1-specific anti-MM activities. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of PLGA nanotechnology-based cancer vaccine to enhance BCMA-targeted  against myeloma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522661>Influenza epidemiology in patients admitted to sentinel Australian hospitals in 2017: the Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN).</a></h1><p>The Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is a sentinel-hospital-based surveillance program that operates at sites in all jurisdictions in Australia. This report summarises the epidemiology of hospitalisations with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2017 influenza season. In this observational surveillance system, cases were defined as patients admitted to any of the 17 sentinel hospitals with influenza confirmed by nucleic  detection. Data are also collected on a frequency-matched control group of influenza-negative patients admitted with acute respiratory infection. During the period 3 April to 31 October 2017 (the 2017 influenza season), 4,359 patients were admitted with confirmed influenza to one of 17 FluCAN sentinel hospitals. Of these, 52% were elderly (≥65 years), 14% were children (<16 years), 6.5% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 1.6% were pregnant and 78% had chronic comorbidities. A significant proportion were due to influenza B (31%). Estimated vaccine coverage was 72% in the elderly (≥65 years), 50% in non-elderly adults with medical comorbidities and 24% in children (<16 years) with medical comorbidities. The estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the target population was 23% (95% CI: 7%, 36%).

Extent of resection continues to be the most important independent prognosticator of survival. This underlines the significance of increasing gross total resection (GTR) rates by using adjunctive intraoperative modalities to maximize resection with minimal neurological morbidity. 5-aminolevulinic  (5-ALA) is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved intraoperative optical agent used for fluorescence-guided surgical resection of gliomas. Despite several studies on the impact of intra-operative 5-ALA use on the extent of HGG resection, a clear picture of how such usage affects patient survival is still unavailable.  A systematic review was conducted of all relevant studies assessing the GTR rate and survival outcomes [overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)] in HGG. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed to assess the influence of 5-ALA-guided resection on improving GTR, OS, and PFS. GTR was defined as >95% resection.  Of 23 eligible studies, 19 reporting GTR rates were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled cohort had 998 patients with HGG, including 796 with newly diagnosed cases. The pooled GTR rate among patients with 5-ALA-guided resection was 76.8% (95% confidence interval, 69.1-82.9%). A comparative subgroup analysis of 5-ALA-guided vs. conventional surgery (controlling for within-study covariates) showed a 26% higher GTR rate in the 5-ALA subgroup (odds ratio, 3.8;  < 0.001). There were 11 studies eligible for survival outcome analysis, 4 of which reported PFS. The pooled mean difference in OS and PFS was 3 and 1 months, respectively, favoring 5-ALA vs. control ( < 0.001).  This meta-analysis shows a significant increase in GTR rate with 5-ALA-guided surgical resection, with a higher weighted GTR rate (~76%) than the pivotal phase III study (~65%). Pooled analysis showed a small yet significant increase in survival measures associated with the use of 5-ALA. Despite the statistically significant results, the low level of evidence and heterogeneity across these studies make it difficult to conclusively report an independent association between 5-ALA use and survival outcomes in HGG. Additional randomized control studies are required to delineate the role of 5-ALA in survival outcomes in HGG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234660>Effect of surgical or immune castration on postprandial nutrient profiles in male pigs.</a></h1><p>To avoid boar taint before slaughtering, late castration by immunisation against gonadotrophin releasing hormone or immunocastration has been developed. The current study aimed at determining whether differences in feed efficiency between castrated male (CM), immune castrated (IM) and entire male pigs (EM) can be explained by differences in nutrient plasma profiles after a meal. In this study, 24 male pigs ( = 8/type) were enrolled between 14 to 19 weeks of age. Entire and IM pigs ate less and were more feed efficient than CM pigs ( < 0.05). The postprandial plasma profiles of glucose, insulin, urea and amino  (AA) were determined before (d -6), just after (d 8) and well after (d 16) the decrease in testicular hormones in IM pigs. For each test day, pigs were fasted overnight and subsequently fed a small meal (400 g). On d -6, postprandial profiles of plasma glucose of IM pigs did not differ from the two other types of pigs. On d 8, EM pigs had a greater average plasma glucose concentration than IM and CM pigs ( < 0.05) but the profiles did not differ. On d 16, the differences between profiles of glucose suggest a lower clearance of glucose in EM compared with IM and CM pigs. Plasma insulin did not significantly differ between the three types. Plasma urea profiles did not differ between CM, EM and IC pigs on d -6 whereas CM pigs showed higher plasma urea concentrations than EM and IM thereafter ( < 0.01). Among AA, Lys plasma concentrations were greater in CM than in EM and IM pigs on d -6, d 8 and d 16 ( < 0.05), whereas on d 16 plasma Hypro concentrations were lower in CM than in EM and IM pigs ( < 0.05). The finding that plasma glucose profiles were modified by immunocastration much faster and earlier than urea and AA profiles, suggest that the decrease in testicular hormones impacted energy metabolism more rapidly than protein metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105808>Anti-tumor outcome evaluation against non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo using PolyI:C as nucleic  therapeutic agent.</a></h1><p>PolyI:C as a ligand of toll-like receptor 3 has been explored as a nucleic  therapeutic agent for anti-tumor therapy. The previous PolyI:C studies mainly focused on anti-tumor evaluation at cell level and anti-tumor mechanism involved in MyD88-independent pathway. However, there is a lack of information about the ability of PolyI:C to affect PI3K/Akt/p53 signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its pharmacodynamic evaluation in vivo still remain unclear so far. In this study, we explored the anti-tumor mechanism and efficacy in vivo of PolyI:C in NSCLC. Our results showed that PolyI:C had the ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by inducing G1 cell cycle block in LL/2 and A549 NSCLC cells. In vivo animal studies also demonstrated that PolyI:C effectively inhibited the tumor growth, suppressed spontaneous metastasis and prolonged the survival time of LL/2 tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays showed that its anti-tumor mechanism was associated with the interference with PI3K/Akt/p53 signaling pathway. Our results confirmed that PolyI:C increased the expression of CD80, CD86 in spleen dendritic cells of tumor-bearing mice and cytokine secretion in healthy mice. Generally, our study suggests that PolyI:C can become a promising anti-tumor agent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123399>Cationic polymer modified PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating Alhagi honey polysaccharides as a vaccine delivery system for ovalbumin to improve immune responses.</a></h1><p> Poly (lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) nanoparticles and surface modified PLGA nanoparticles have been widely studied as antigens or drugs carriers due to their controlled release characteristics and biocompatibility. However, most PLGA nanoparticles have lower antigens loading efficiency and adjuvanticity.  The aim of this study was to improve the antigen loading efficiency and adjuvant activity of PLGA nanoparticles.  Surface cationic polymer modification can improve the antigens loading efficiency of PLGA nanoparticles by surface adsorption. Therefore, in this study, chitosan modified PLGA nanoparticles (CS-AHPP/OVA), polyethyleneimine modified PLGA nanoparticles (PEI-AHPP/OVA), and ε-Poly-L-lysine modified PLGA nanoparticles (εPL-AHPP/OVA) were prepared as antigen delivery carriers to investigate the characterization and stability of these nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were evaluated for their efficacies as adjuvants pre- and post-modification.  The AHP and OVA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (AHPP/OVA) were positively charged after surface cationic polymers modification, and their structural integrity was maintained. Their antigen loading capacity and stability of nanoparticles were improved by the surface cationic polymers modification. Increased positive surface charge resulted in greater OVA adsorption capacity. Among AHPP/OVA and the three surface cationic polymers synthesized from modified PLGA nanoparticles, PEI-AHPP/OVA showed the highest antigen loading efficiency and good stability. AHPP/OVA, CS-AHPP/OVA PEI-AHPP/OVA, and εPL-AHPP/OVA formulations significantly enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and improved the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. In addition, AHPP/OVA, PEI-AHPP/OVA and εPL-AHPP/OVA formulations induced secretion of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-6), antibodies (IgG) and antibody subtypes (IgG1 and IgG2a) in immunized mice. These results demonstrate that these formulations generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Among them, PEI-AHPP/OVA induced the strongest Th1-biased immune response.  In conclusion, PEI-AHPP/OVA nanoparticles may be a potential antigen delivery system for the induction of strong immune responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664538>Correlation analysis of hepatitis C virus core antigen and low viral loads: Can core antigen replace nucleic  test?</a></h1><p>Value of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen (cAg) test has been controversy in patients with low HCV loads for its lower sensitivity. We assessed correlation between HCV-cAg and HCV RNA in serum samples with low viral loads and analyzed the performance of HCV-cAg assay in determining diagnosis and treatment outcomes in chronic hepatitis C patients. Both HCV RNA and HCV-cAg were detected for 2298 serum samples. Correlation analysis was performed between the two tests. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to assess value of HCV-cAg test in determining diagnosis and response outcomes at the different HCV RNA thresholds. The two tests were correlated very well, and moreover, correlation in the low viral load group was higher than that in the high viral load group (r value: 0.901 and 0.517). Positive agreement of HCV-cAg ≥ 3 fmol/L was as high as 97.0% for HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL, and its negative agreement for HCV RNA < 15 IU/mL was up to 98.9% in all samples. Area under ROCs ranged from 0.939 to 0.992, regardless of HCV RNA thresholds. When lower limit of detection of HCV RNA was 15, 100 or 1000 IU/mL, positive predictive value of HCV-cAg was 96.8%, 98.8% or 92.4%, and its negative predictive value was 87.0%, 89.9% or 98.3%, respectively, on the basis of different cutoff values. High-sensitivity HCV-cAg detection may likely replace HCV RNA to confirm the existence of HCV and to guide the treatment of chronic HCV infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669829>Analysis of different signal peptides for the secretory production of Ama r 2 in gram-positive systems (Lactococcus lactis).</a></h1><p>Prokaryotic systems have been considered the most affordable and simplest hosts which are being employed to express recombinant proteins such as allergens; nevertheless, without appropriate signal peptide (SP), these systems cannot be used for secretory proteins. Recently, a lot of effort has been put into assessing the potential of gram-positive strains such as lactic  bacteria for new applications in the production of heterologous proteins. Ama r 2 is a respiratory allergen from Amaranthus retroflexus, whose recombinant production in the probiotic host could be introduced as a specific and effective way to rapid diagnosis and  of this allergy. Consequently, the production of this recombinant protein using the prokaryotic system, requires a suitable SP to protect disulfide bonds and to prevent misfolding. This study was designed to predict the best SPs for the expression of Ama r 2 protein in Lactococcus lactis as the host. In this study, 42 signal sequences were selected from SP databases and the most important features of them were evaluated. First, n, h and c regions of the SPs and their probabilities were investigated by signalP software version 4.1. Then, their physicochemical properties were evaluated by Portparam and SOLpro. Moreover, the secretion sorting and sub-cellular localization sites were evaluated by PRED-TAT and ProtcompB software programs.

Here, we address the dilemma of using corticosteroids for the treatment of irAEs induced by ICB. ICB augments neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell responses, resulting in tumor regression. In our model, simultaneous, but not late, administration of corticosteroids impaired antitumor responses with reduction of CD8 T cell proliferation. Secondary challenge using tumors with/without the neoantigen showed selective progression in tumors lacking the neoantigen when corticosteroids were administered. Corticosteroids decreased low- but not high-affinity memory T cells by suppressing fatty  metabolism essential for memory T cells. In a small cohort of human melanoma patients, overall survival was shorter after treatment with CTLA-4 blockade in patients who received early corticosteroids or had low tumor mutation burden. Together, low-affinity memory T cells are dominantly suppressed by corticosteroids, necessitating careful and thoughtful corticosteroid use.© 2019 Tokunaga et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31046503>Immunotherapeutic potential of an N-formylated peptide of  in experimental tuberculosis.</a></h1><p> The current therapeutic regimens for tuberculosis (TB) are complex and involve the prolonged use of multiple antibiotics with diverse side effects that lead to therapeutic failure and bacterial resistance.

The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is regulated by intratumoral immune response. The tumor microenvironment has a major role in adaptive immune response tuning. Tumor cells generate a particular metabolic environment in comparison to other tissues. Tumors are characterized by glycolysis, hypoxia, acidosis, amino  depletion and fatty  metabolism modification. Such metabolic changes promote tumor growth, impair immune response and lead to resistance to therapies. This review will detail how these modifications strongly affect CD8 and CD4 T cell functions and impact  efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525619>Predictive value of high titer of GAD65 antibodies in a case of limbic encephalitis.</a></h1><p>We report the case of a 42-year-old woman who presented with vertigo and migraine and rapidly developed cognitive decline and seizures. Both serum and cerebro-spinal fluid samples showed high titer of anti-glutamic  decarboxylase (anti-GAD65) antibodies (998,881 IU/ml and 54,687 IU/ml respectively). Limbic encephalitis was diagnosed and high dose steroids treatment started. During one-year follow-up, without further immunomodulatory therapy, the patient became seizure free, and cognitive functions returned to normal. Serum anti-GAD65 antibodies titer decreased significantly but remained elevated (192,680 IU/ml). We discuss the prognostic and pathogenic value of high titer anti-GAD65 antibodies and its variations in a case of autoimmune limbic encephalitis.Copyright © 2019.

To conquer this cumbersome, we developed a new panel of different single-chain fragment variable (scFv) for serotype-independent detection of FMDV. The recombinant VP2 capsid protein, as a relatively conserved protein among FMDV serotypes, was expressed in E. Coli, and injected in mice. Spleen's RNA was extracted for isolating the coding sequences of IgG variable domains that were assembled into repertoires of scFv. Phage library displaying scFv was constructed with ∼1.9 × 10 plaque forming units. Characterization of the library showed eight of unique scFvs, which were expressed as bacterial periplasmic proteins with apparent molecular weight of ∼27 kDa.

Drugs are useful against hookworm infections, but hookworms rapidly reinfect people, and the parasites can develop drug resistance. Therefore, having a hookworm vaccine would be of tremendous benefit.We investigated the vaccine efficacy in outbred Syrian hamsters of three A. ceylanicum hookworm antigen candidates from two classes of proteins previously identified as promising vaccine candidates. These include two intestinally-enriched, putatively secreted cathepsin B cysteine proteases (AceyCP1, AceyCPL) and one small Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (AceySKPI3). Recombinant proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris, and adsorbed to Alhydrogel. Recombinant AceyCPL (rAceyCPL)/Alhydrogel and rAceySKPI3/Alhydrogel induced high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in 8/8 vaccinates, but were not protective. rAceyCP1/Alhydrogel induced intermediate serum IgG titers in ~60% of vaccinates in two different trials. rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had highly significantly decreased hookworm burdens, fecal egg counts and clinical pathology compared to Alhydrogel controls and nonresponders. Protection was highly correlated with rAceyCP1 serum IgG titer. Antisera from rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders, but not nonresponders or rAceyCPL/Alhydrogel vaccinates, significantly reduced adult A. ceylanicum motility in vitro. Furthermore, rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had canonical Th2-specific recall responses (IL4, IL5, IL13) in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo.These findings indicate that rAceyCP1 is a promising vaccine candidate and validates a genomic/transcriptomic approach to human hookworm vaccine discovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386869>Development of a lipoplex-type mRNA carrier composed of an ionizable lipid with a vitamin E scaffold and the KALA peptide for use as an ex vivo dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine.</a></h1><p>A dendritic cells (DCs)-based vaccine (DC-vaccine) system is an attractive technology for eliciting antigen-specific immune responses that can protect subjects from infectious diseases and for curing various types of cancers. For the insertion of a foreign antigen to DCs, the transfection of an antigen-coding mRNA to the cells is a promising approach. In order to introduce an antigen, a carrier for mRNA transfection is required, since the mRNA molecule per se is unstable in serum-containing medium. We previously reported on an ionizable lipid-like material with vitamin E-scaffolds (ssPalmE) as a material for a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based carrier for nucleic . In the present study, we report on the development of a lipoplex-type mRNA carrier for use as a DC-vaccine by using a combination of an ssPalmE-LNP and an α-helical cationic peptide "KALA" (ssPalmE-KALA). The transfection of mRNAs complexed with the ssPalmE-KALA achieved a significantly higher protein expression and the production of proinflammatory cytokines from murine bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) in comparison with a lipoplex that was prepared with an ssPalm with fatty -scaffolds (myristic ; ssPalmM-KALA). A cellular uptake process and a pH-responsive membrane-destabilization activity cannot explain the preferred protein expression and immune-stimulation caused by the ssPalmE-KALA. Proteomic analyses suggest that transfection with the ssPalmM-KALA stimulates a down-regulatory pathway of translation, while the transfection with the ssPalmE-KALA does not stimulate it. In the vaccination with the BMDCs that were preliminarily transfected with an ovalbumin (OVA)-encoding mRNA elicited the induction OVA specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in vivo. In parallel, the vaccination induced significant prophylactic anti-tumor effects against a model tumor that stably expressed the OVA protein. Based on the above findings, the ssPalmE-KALA appears to be a potent ex vivo DCs-based RNA vaccine platform.Copyright © 2019.

As receptors of sialic , Siglecs (sialic -binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) are noticeably found on peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which renew by the differentiation of recruited PBMs at the tumor site and positively correlate with tumor growth. Given this, a sialic -octadecylamine conjugate (SA-ODA) was synthesized and then modified on the surface of liposomal epirubicin (EPI-SAL) as a potent tumor-targeting delivery strategy. A cellular uptake assay indicated that SA-modified liposomes provided improved distribution of the drug in both PBMs and TAMs. Pharmacodynamic tests demonstrated that the antitumor efficacy of the EPI-SAL group was better than that of the other groups, owing to both inhibition of TAMs by EPI-SAL, and high-efficiency targeting of PBMs by EPI-SAL, after which PBMs containing EPI-SAL were recruited to the tumor site and then killed by EPI. Thus, an SA-based targeted delivery strategy effectively interdicted the generation of TAMs. Our research provides the feasibility of the SA-ODA decorated liposome as an active carrier for cancer .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Evading NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance is therefore critical to facilitating cancer cell survival and metastasis. Signals from a range of inhibitory and activating receptors located on the NK cell surface regulate NK cell cytotoxicity. Recently, attention has turned to the role of hypersialylated tumor cell surfaces in mediating immune-evasion of NK cells. Two inhibitory sialic -binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors are expressed by NK cells: Siglec-7 and Siglec-9. The abundance of sialic  on tumor cell surface is hypothesized to regulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by interacting with Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, causing a dampening of NK cell activation pathways. Targeting Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, or the sialic  coated tumor cell surface is therefore being investigated as a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the NK cell response against cancer. In this review we report on the currently published documentation of the role for Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 receptors on NK cells and their ligands expressed by tumor cells. We also discuss the strategies currently explored to target Siglec-7, Siglec-9 and the sialylated tumor cell surface as well as the impact abrogation of these interactions have on NK cell cytotoxicity against several cancer types.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118627>Single-dose Ag85B-ESAT6-loaded poly(lactic--glycolic ) nanoparticles confer protective immunity against tuberculosis.</a></h1><p>Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, the attenuated strain of , remains the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). However, its ineffectiveness in adults against pulmonary TB and varied protective efficacy (0-80%) speak to an urgent need for the development of an improved and efficient TB vaccine. In this milieu, poly(lactic--glycolic ) (PLGA), is a preferential candidate, due to such properties as biocompatibility, targeted delivery, sustained antigen release, and atoxic by-products.In this study, we formulated PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the bivalent H1 antigen, a fusion of  (Mtb) Ag85B and ESAT6 proteins, and investigated its role in immunomodulation and protection against Mtb challenge. Using the classical water-oil-water solvent-evaporation method, H1-NPs were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 86.1%±3.2%. These spherical NPs were ~244.4±32.6 nm in diameter, with a negatively charged surface (ζ-potential -4±0.6 mV).Under physiological conditions, NPs degraded slowly and the encapsulated H1 antigen was released over a period of weeks. As a proof-of-concept vaccine candidate, H1 NPs were efficiently internalized by the THP-1 human macrophages. Six weeks after a single-dose vaccination, H1 NP-immunized C57BL/6J mice showed significant increase in the production of total serum IgG (<0.0001) and its isotypes compared to H1 alone, IgG being the predominant one, followed by IgG. Further, the cytokine-release profile of antigen-stimulated splenocyteculture supernatant indicated a strong T1-biased immunoresponse in H1 NP-vaccinated mice, with ~6.03- and ~2.8-fold increase in IFNγ and TNFα cytokine levels, and ~twofold and 1.6 fold increase in IL4 and IL10 cytokines, respectively, compared to H1 alone-immunized mice. In protection studies, H1 NP-vaccinated mice displayed significant reductions in lung and spleen bacillary load (<0.05) at 5-week post-Mtb H37Rv challenge and prolonged survival, with a mean survival time of 177 days, compared to H1 alone-vaccinated mice (mean survival time 80 days).Altogether, our findings highlight the significance of the H1-PLGA nanoformulation in terms of providing long-term protection in mice with a single dose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412934>Indocyanine green and poly I:C containing thermo-responsive liposomes used in immune-photothermal therapy prevent cancer growth and metastasis.</a></h1><p>Efficient cancer therapy is sought not only for primary tumor treatment but also for the prevention of metastatic cancer growth.  has been shown to prevent cancer metastasis by inducing antigen-specific immune responses. Indocyanine green (ICG) has a peak spectral absorption at about 800 nm, which makes it a photothermal reagent for direct treatment of solid tumors by photothermal therapy (PTT). Since PTT alone cannot fully induce antigen-specific immune response for prevention of cancer metastasis, the combination of PTT and  has been developed as a new strategy of cancer treatment.Thermal responsive liposomes (TRL) were synthesized by incorporating ICG into the lipid bilayer and encapsulating the water-soluble immune stimulatory molecule polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (poly I:C) in the hydrophilic core. The poly I:C- and ICG-containing TRLs (piTRLs) were analyzed according to size, and their photothermal effect was evaluated following laser irradiation at 808 nm. Moreover, the temperature-dependent release of poly I:C was also measured. For cancer therapy, CT-26 (carcinoma) and B16 (melanoma) cells were subcutaneously inoculated to build the 1st transplanted tumor in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. These mice received a 2nd transplantation with the same cancer cells by intravenous inoculation, for evaluation of the anti-metastatic effects of the liposomes after PTT.Near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation increased the temperature of piTRLs and effectively released poly I:C from the liposomes. The increased temperature induced a photothermal effect, which promoted cancer cell apoptosis and dissolution of the 1st transplanted tumor. Moreover, the released poly I:C from the piTRL induced activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in tumor draining lymph node (tdLN). Cancer cell apoptosis and DC-activation-mediated cancer antigen-specific immune responses further prevented growth of lung metastatic cancer developed following intravenous transplantation of cancer cells.These results demonstrated the potential usage of a piTRL with laser irradiation for immuno-photothermal therapy against various types of cancer and their metastases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680949> Based on Dendritic Cell-Targeted/-Derived Extracellular Vesicles-A Novel Strategy for Enhancement of the Anti-tumor Immune Response.</a></h1><p>Dendritic cell (DC)-based anti-tumor vaccines have great potential for the treatment of cancer. To date, a large number of clinical trials involving DC-based vaccines have been conducted with a view to treating tumors of different histological origins. However, DC-based vaccines had several drawbacks, including problems with targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DCs and prolong storage of cellular vaccines. Therefore, the development of other immunotherapeutic approaches capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of existing DC-based vaccines or directly triggering anti-tumor immune responses is of great interest. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all types of eukaryotic cells for paracrine signaling. EVs can interact with target cells and change their functional activity by delivering different signaling molecules including mRNA, non-coding RNA, proteins, and lipids. EVs have potential benefits as natural vectors for the delivery of RNA and other therapeutic molecules targeted to DCs, T-lymphocytes, and tumor cells; therefore, EVs are a promising entity for the development of novel cell-free anti-tumor vaccines that may be a favourable alternative to DC-based vaccines. In the present review, we discuss the anti-tumor potential of EVs derived from DCs, tumors, and other cells. Methods of EV isolation are systematized, and key molecules carried by EVs that are necessary for the activation of a DC-mediated anti-tumor immune response are analyzed with a focus on the RNA component of EVs. Characteristics of anti-tumor immune responses induced by EVs  and  are reviewed.

Potential applications include the adoptive transfer of in vitro-expanded γδ T cells. Therefore, it is important to optimize the culture conditions to enable maximal proliferative and functional activity. Vitamin C (L-ascorbic ) is an essential vitamin with multiple effects on immune cells. It is a cofactor for several enzymes, has antioxidant activity, and is an epigenetic modifier. Here, we investigated the effects of vitamin C (VC) and its more stable derivative, L-ascorbic  2-phosphate (pVC), on the proliferation and effector function of human γδ T cells stimulated with zoledronate (ZOL) or synthetic phosphoantigens (pAgs). VC and pVC did not increase γδ T-cell expansion within ZOL- or pAg-stimulated PBMCs, but increased the proliferation of purified γδ T cells and 14-day-expanded γδ T-cell lines in response to γδ T-cell-specific pAgs. VC reduced the apoptosis of γδ T cells during primary stimulation. While pVC did not prevent activation-induced death of pAg-restimulated γδ T cells, it enhanced the cell cycle progression and cellular expansion. Furthermore, VC and pVC enhanced cytokine production during primary activation, as well as upon pAg restimulation of 14-day-expanded γδ T cells. VC and pVC also increased the oxidative respiration and glycolysis of γδ T cells, but stimulus-dependent differences were observed.

Here, we evaluated lipid-encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and a DNA plasmid vaccine encoding the prM-E genes of ZIKV in mouse models of congenital infection. Although the DNA vaccine provided comparable efficacy against vertical transmission of ZIKV, the mRNA vaccines, including one that minimizes antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, elicited higher levels of antigen-specific long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. Despite the induction of robust neutralizing antibody titers by all vaccines, breakthrough seeding of the placenta and fetal head was observed in a small subset of type I interferon signaling-deficient immunocompromised dams. In comparison, evaluation of one of the mRNA vaccines in a human STAT2-knockin transgenic immunocompetent mouse showed complete protection against congenital ZIKV transmission.

During the process of lymphatic metastasis, lymph nodes are also sites through which tumor cells must pass. Therefore, it is essential to develop a drug delivery system that can specifically transfer immunostimulatory medicine into lymph nodes to block lymphatic metastasis. Here, we developed a nucleic  drug delivery system containing cationic agarose (C-agarose) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. C-agarose has a high affinity for Siglec-1 on the surface of lymph node sinus macrophages, which have a high specificity for targeting lymph nodes. Subcutaneous implantation of C-agarose+CpG gel caused the accumulation of CpG in the lymph node sinus macrophages and generated antitumor immune responses in the lymph node. C-agarose+CpG gel treatment decreased the metastasis size in the tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) and lung metastatic nodules and suppressed tumor growth in both a mouse 4T1 breast cancer model and a B16F10 melanoma model.

We aimed to develop a long-acting delivery system for Herceptin, a HER2-targeting antibody, using injectable and thermosensitive hydrogels as the carrier to prevent the local relapse of HER2+ breast tumors while minimizing systemic side effects, especially cardiotoxicity. : Two poly(lactic --glycolic )--poly(ethylene glycol)--poly(lactic --glycolic ) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) triblock copolymers with different PEG/PLGA proportions were synthesized. Their mixtures with rational mix proportions displayed sol-gel transitions in water with rising of temperature and the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel systems were then prepared. Both the  antitumor and anti-relapse efficacies were evaluated after hypodermic injection of the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel, and the cardiotoxicity was also detected. : The gel performance, degradation rate and drug release kinetics of hydrogels were easily adjustable by simply varying the mix proportion. The hydrogel matrix with a specific mix proportion not only avoided initial burst release but also achieved sustained release of Herceptin  for up to 80 days, which is the longest period of Herceptin delivery that has ever been reported.  biodistribution studies performed in SK-BR-3 tumor-bearing mice revealed that a single hypodermic administration of the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel adjacent to the tumor tissue promoted the intratumoral antibody accumulation. This resulted in a better antitumor efficacy compared to weekly hypodermic injections of Herceptin solution for 28 days. A tumor relapse model was also established by imitative breast-conserving surgery on tumor-bearing mice, and both the single injection of the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel and the weekly injection of the Herceptin solution achieved superior anti-relapse efficacy. Furthermore, both antitumor and anti-relapse experiments demonstrated that the weekly pulsed administration of the Herceptin solution caused cardiotoxicity; however, the sustained release of Herceptin from the hydrogel effectively prevented this side effect. : The Herceptin-loaded hydrogel has great potential for preventing the relapse of HER2+ breast tumors after breast-conserving surgery with enhanced therapeutic efficacy, improved patient compliance and significantly reduced side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552050>Altered Cell Adhesion and Glycosylation Promote Cancer Immune Suppression and Metastasis.</a></h1><p>Cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion are key mediators of cancer progression and facilitate hallmarks of cancer including immune evasion and metastatic dissemination. Many cell adhesion molecules within the tumor microenvironment are changed and significant alterations of glycosylation are observed. These changes in cell adhesion molecules alter the ability of tumor cells to interact with other cells and extracellular matrix proteins. Three families of cell-cell interaction molecules selectins, Siglecs, and integrins have been associated with cancer progression in many pre-clinical studies, yet inhibition of cell adhesion as a therapeutic target is just beginning to be explored. We review how cell-cell interactions mediated by integrins and the glycan-binding receptors selectins and Siglec receptors support cancer progression. The discussion focuses on mechanisms during immune evasion and metastasis that can be therapeutically targeted by blocking these cell-cell interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099667>Novel Therapeutics Affecting Metabolic Pathways.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells are known to have distinct metabolic characteristics compared with normal cells, given the catabolic and anabolic demands of increased cell growth and proliferation. This altered metabolism in cancer cells imbues differential dependencies, and substantial effort has been invested in developing therapeutic strategies to exploit these potential vulnerabilities. Parallel to these efforts has been a growing appreciation for the presence of notable intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity. Although many novel agents are showing some promising results in targeting specific metabolic processes, the challenge moving forward will be to develop combination strategies to address the aforementioned metabolic heterogeneity and its interplay with both epigenetic and immune factors in the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss recent developments in targeting tumor catabolism, lipid biosynthesis, glycolysis, and the citric  cycle as well as efforts to combine these approaches with .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462144>Induction of autophagy through CLEC4E in combination with TLR4: an innovative strategy to restrict the survival of .</a></h1><p>Host-directed therapies are gaining considerable impetus because of the emergence of drug-resistant strains of pathogens due to antibiotic therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to exploit alternative and novel strategies directed at host molecules to successfully restrict infections. The C-type lectin receptor CLEC4E and Toll-like receptor TLR4 expressed by host cells are among the first line of defense in encountering pathogens. Therefore, we exploited signaling of macrophages through CLEC4E in association with TLR4 agonists (C.T) to control the growth of  (). We observed significant improvement in host immunity and reduced bacterial load in the lungs of infected mice and guinea pigs treated with C.T agonists. Further, intracellular killing of  was achieved with a 10-fold lower dose of isoniazid or rifampicin in conjunction with C.T than the drugs alone. C.T activated MYD88, PtdIns3K, STAT1 and RELA/NFKB, increased lysosome biogenesis, decreased  and  gene expression and enhanced macroautophagy/autophagy. Macrophages from autophagy-deficient ( knockout or  knockdown) mice showed elevated survival of . The present findings also unveiled the novel role of CLEC4E in inducing autophagy through MYD88, which is required for control of  growth. This study suggests a unique immunotherapeutic approach involving CLEC4E in conjunction with TLR4 to restrict the survival of  through autophagy.  3MA: 3 methyladenine; AO: acridine orange; Atg5: autophagy related 5; AVOs: acidic vesicular organelles; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; BMDMs: bone marrow derived macrophages; bw: body weight; C.T: agonists of CLEC4E (C/TDB) and TLR4 (T/ultra-pure-LPS); CFU: colony forming unit; CLEC4E/Mincle: C-type lectin domain family 4, member e; CLR: c-type lectin receptor; INH: isoniazid; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; Mφ: infected C.T stimulated macrophages; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MDC: monodansylcadaverine; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MYD88: myeloid differentiation primary response 88; NFKB: nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhance in B cells; NLR: NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-like receptors; PFA: paraformaldehyde; PPD: purified protein derivative; PtdIns3K: class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RELA: v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (avian); RIF: rifampicin; RLR: retinoic -inducible gene-I-like receptors; TDB: trehalose-6,6´-dibehenate; TLR4: toll-like receptor 4; Ultra-pure-LPS: ultra-pure lipopolysaccharide-EK; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H ATPase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042711>Somatic mutations render human exome and pathogen DNA more similar.</a></h1><p> has recently shown important clinical successes in a substantial number of oncology indications. Additionally, the tumor somatic mutation load has been shown to associate with response to these therapeutic agents, and specific mutational signatures are hypothesized to improve this association, including signatures related to pathogen insults. We sought to study in silico the validity of these observations and how they relate to each other. We first addressed the question whether somatic mutations typically involved in cancer may increase, in a statistically meaningful manner, the similarity between common pathogens and the human exome. Our study shows that common mutagenic processes like those resulting from exposure to ultraviolet light (in melanoma) or smoking (in lung cancer) increase, in the upper range of biologically plausible frequencies, the similarity between cancer exomes and pathogen DNA at a scale of 12 to 16 nucleotide sequences (corresponding to peptides of 4 - 5 amino ). Second, we investigated whether this increased similarity is due to the specific mutation distribution of the considered mutagenic processes or whether uniformly random mutations at equal rate would trigger the same effect. Our results show that, depending on the combination of pathogen and mutagenic process, these effects need not be distinguishable. Third, we studied the impact of mutation rate and showed that increasing mutation rate generally results in an increased similarity between the cancer exome and pathogen DNA, again at a scale of 4 - 5 amino . Finally, we investigated whether the considered mutational processes result in amino- changes with functional relevance that are more likely to be immunogenic. We showed that functional tolerance to mutagenic processes across species generally suggests more resilience to mutagenic processes that are due to exposure to elements of nature than to mutagenic processes that are due to exposure to cancer-causing artificial substances. These results support the idea that recognition of pathogen sequences as well as differential functional tolerance to mutagenic processes may play an important role in the immune recognition process involved in tumor infiltration by lymphocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068463>Rational vaccinology with spherical nucleic .</a></h1><p>In the case of cancer , nanostructures are attractive because they can carry all of the necessary components of a vaccine, including both antigen and adjuvant. Herein, we explore how spherical nucleic  (SNAs), an emerging class of nanotherapeutic materials, can be used to deliver peptide antigens and nucleic  adjuvants to raise immune responses that kill cancer cells, reduce (or eliminate) tumor growth, and extend life in three established mouse tumor models. Three SNA structures that are compositionally nearly identical but structurally different markedly vary in their abilities to cross-prime antigen-specific CD8 T cells and raise subsequent antitumor immune responses. Importantly, the most effective structure is the one that exhibits synchronization of maximum antigen presentation and costimulatory marker expression. In the human papillomavirus-associated TC-1 model, vaccination with this structure improved overall survival, induced the complete elimination of tumors from 30% of the mice, and conferred curative protection from tumor rechallenges, consistent with immunological memory not otherwise achievable. The antitumor effect of SNA vaccination is dependent on the method of antigen incorporation within the SNA structure, underscoring the modularity of this class of nanostructures and the potential for the deliberate design of new vaccines, thereby defining a type of rational cancer vaccinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577944>Restricting Glycolysis Preserves T Cell Effector Functions and Augments Checkpoint Therapy.</a></h1><p>Tumor-derived lactic  inhibits T and natural killer (NK) cell function and, thereby, tumor immunosurveillance. Here, we report that melanoma patients with high expression of glycolysis-related genes show a worse progression free survival upon anti-PD1 treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac lowers lactate secretion of tumor cells and improves anti-PD1-induced T cell killing in vitro. Surprisingly, diclofenac, but not other NSAIDs, turns out to be a potent inhibitor of the lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 and diminishes lactate efflux. Notably, T cell activation, viability, and effector functions are preserved under diclofenac treatment and in a low glucose environment in vitro. Diclofenac, but not aspirin, delays tumor growth and improves the efficacy of checkpoint therapy in vivo. Moreover, genetic suppression of glycolysis in tumor cells strongly improves checkpoint therapy. These findings support the rationale for targeting glycolysis in patients with high glycolytic tumors together with checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Tumor growth in mice was monitored using a digital caliper and by computed tomography in rabbits.Intratumoral administration of poly-ICLC immediately before IRE elicited shrinkage of Hepa.129 cell-derived tumors in 70% of mice, compared to 30% and 26% by poly-ICLC or IRE alone, respectively (P = .0004). This combined therapy induced the shrinkage of VX-2-based hepatocellular carcinoma tumors in 40% of rabbits, whereas no response was achieved by either individual treatment (P = .045). The combined therapy activated a systemic antitumor response able to inhibit the growth of other untreated tumors.IRE treatment, immediately preceded by the intratumoral administration of an immunogenic adjuvant such as poly-ICLC, might enhance the antitumor effect of the IRE procedure. This combination might facilitate the induction of a long-term systemic response to prevent tumor relapses and the appearance of metastases.Copyright © 2019 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, in addition to their direct tumoral vascular collapse effect, VDAs activate host immunological responses, which can remarkably impair their anticancer efficacy. Here, a VDA nanomedicine, poly(l-glutamic )--methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 (CA4-NPs), is found to induce the intratumor infiltration of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), thereby curtailing anticancer immunity. To overcome this problem, hypoxia-sensitive imiquimod (hs-IMQ) is developed, which is selectively activated into imiquimod (IMQ) in treated tumors following the catalysis of CA4-NPs-induced nitroreductase (NTR). The combination of hs-IMQ and CA4-NPs causes a 6.3-fold enhancement of active IMQ concentration in tumors, as compared to hs-IMQ treatment alone. The -generated IMQ alters the tumor microenvironment from a state of immunosuppression to immune activation. Hs-IMQ achieves this effect through the conversion of immature pDCs into their active form, leading to the robust infiltration and priming of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in treated tumors. Thus, the CA4-NPs and hs-IMQ combination treatment synergistically inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This work offers new approaches to harness intratumor pDCs to reverse the immune suppression resulting from VDA treatment. These findings additionally provide a mechanistic rationale for the use of VDAs in combination with TLR agonists to trigger  immune activation and enhance anticancer efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601857>Fucosylated α- glycoprotein as a biomarker to predict prognosis following tumor  of patients with lung cancer.</a></h1><p> targeting immune checkpoint molecules has provided remarkable clinical benefits in cancer patients but no clinically relevant biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes exists. Recently, we demonstrated that glycan structures of serum α- glycoprotein (AGP) changed dramatically in cancer patients and that α1,3fucosylated AGP (fAGP) levels increased along with disease progression and decreased responding to chemotherapy treatments. Here, the fAGP was analyzed in sera prospectively obtained from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer who underwent  with anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. Twenty-three patients had significantly high fAGP levels above the cut-off value (H-fAGP) at one month after starting the treatment and 20 patients in this group, whose tumor sizes did not decrease, maintained high fAGP levels continuously and subsequently died. However, the other 16 patients, whose fAGP levels decreased or maintained below the cut-off value (L-fAGP), survived during a 2-year observation even though 5 patients in this group had no tumor shrinkage. Accordingly, the overall survival rate was found to significantly correlate with the fAGP level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the H-fAGP was an independent risk factor for cancer progression. Therefore, the fAGP level appeared to be a reliable biomarker for predicting clinical efficacy of  with nivolumab.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377883>RANK/RANKL Acts as a Protective Factor by Targeting Cholangiocytes in Primary Biliary Cholangitis.</a></h1><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by the highly selective autoimmune injury of small intrahepatic bile ducts. Studies reported that the cholangiocytes from PBC patients expressed significantly higher levels of both receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) and its ligand RANKL. However, the accurate role of RANK/RANKL axis in PBC remains unclear.Forty patients with PBC were enrolled according to the inclusion criteria. The biochemical parameters (alkaline phosphatase, ALP; gamma-glutamyltransferase, GGT; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate transaminase, AST; total bilirubin, TB) were collected at baseline and followed-up after 6 months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA, 15 mg/kg d). Stages of PBC were diagnosed based on liver biopsy histopathology according to Nakanuma's criteria. RANK expression in hepatic tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The cellular immunofluorescence method was used to locate the distribution of RANK in the human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBECs) cultured in vitro. HIBECs were treated with RANKL at a concentration of 100 ng/ml or transfected with RANK-overexpressing lentivirus (LV-RANK). CCK-8 assay and cell cycle assay were used to detect the cell proliferation. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of IL-6, E-cadherin, VCAM, ICAM-1, TNF-α, and CD80.RANK expression in liver biopsies from early PBC patients (stage I + stage II) was significantly lower than that from advanced PBC patients (stage III + stage IV) (1.7 ± 0.63 vs. 2.3 ± 0.45 scores, P < 0.05). High-RANK patients seemed to have better response to UDCA than low-RANK patients (88.9% vs. 40.9%, P < 0.05). The baseline biochemical parameters between the two groups were comparable. The decline percentages of ALP and GGT after UDCA treatment were more obvious in high-RANK patients than those in low-RANK patients (53.90% ± 9.82% vs. 23.93% ± 6.24%, P < 0.05; 74.11% ± 7.18% vs. 48.00% ± 8.17%, P < 0.05, respectively). HIBECs proliferation was significantly inhibited after treatment of RANKL or transfection with LV-RANK. Increased expression of IL-6 and E-cadherin was observed in HIBECs treated with RANKL or LV-RANK.The overall hepatic RANK expression was associated with disease severity and biochemical response in PBC patients. Activation of RANK/RANKL signaling pathway inhibited cholangiocytes proliferation in vitro. Our study suggested that RANK/RANKL pathway might be a potential target of  of PBC based on its involvement in the occurrence and development of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101577>Folic  Reduces Mucositis in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients: A Retrospective Study.</a></h1><p>Mucositis is often experienced in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with targeted therapies.

We assessed the effect of folic  to reduce mucositis.Patients treated with systemic therapy for mRCC who developed Grade ≥2 mucositis according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE) received oral folic  to reduce mucositis. The medical charts were retrospectively reviewed.A total of 77 patients had Grade ≥2 mucositis during therapy with sunitinib (n = 29), pazopanib (n = 24), everolimus (n = 10), axitinib (n = 4), temsirolimus (n = 3), interleukin-2/interferon-α (n = 3), cabozantinib (n = 2), bevacizumab (n = 1), and nivolumab (n = 1).

However, the clinical symptoms (psychiatric disorders, cognitive decline) and signs (consciousness disturbance) at onset and after follow-up were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In 71.4% of the patients, anti-GABABR antibody serum levels were higher than those in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially in patients with lung cancer). Magnetic resonance imaging in 71.4% of patients indicated that the marginal lobe demonstrated encephalitis lesions. The average modified Rankin Scale score (2.0 ± 2.31) at follow-up was significantly better than that (3.86 ± 0.90) at the time of admission (P < 0.05).The clinical characteristics of anti-GABABR encephalitis were refractory epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment. Multiple antiepileptic drugs are crucial for the treatment of intractable epilepsy.

By diminishing the production of interferon (IFN) and other inflammatory mediators, tumors enhance immune evasion. Responses initiated by nucleic  sensors and triggered by dysregulated RNA transcription and cytoplasmic DNA undergo down-modulation in tumors. A protein hub that involves the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) editing enzyme adenosine deaminase RNA specific (ADAR), the RNase DICER1, and the dsRNA-activated kinase protein activator of PKR (PACT) mediates many of these tumor-intrinsic responses, with in vitro ADAR dependency varying by tumor type (range 11-80%). The central role played by ADAR, both as an enzyme and as a scaffold, sets it as a target for cancer .

In this work, a promising therapy for tumor treatment that can eliminate primary tumors and prevent tumor relapses is introduced by combining chemotherapy, photothermal therapy (PTT) and . Multifunctional FePt/MoS-FA nanocomposites (FPMF NCs) were obtained via anchoring FePt nanoparticles and folic  (FA) on MoS nanosheets. As an efficient ferroptosis agent, FePt nanoparticles could catalyze the Fenton reaction to produce the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Through the highly effective photothermal conversion of MoS nanosheets, the primary tumor cells could be ablated by photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, the metastatic tumors were eliminated effectively with the help of oligodeoxynucleotides containing cytosine-guanine (CpG ODNs) combined with systemic checkpoint blockade therapy using an anti-CTLA4 antibody. Even more intriguingly, a strong immunological memory effect was obtained by this synergistic therapy.

The diagnosis is based on AMA- or PBC-specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)-positivity in the presence of a cholestatic biochemical profile, histologic confirmation being mandatory only in seronegative cases. First-line treatment is ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), which is effective in preventing disease progression in about two thirds of the patients. The only approved second-line treatment is obeticholic . This article summarizes the most relevant conclusions of a meeting held in Lugano, Switzerland, from September 23rd-25th 2018, gathering basic and clinical scientists with various background from around the world to discuss the latest advances in PBC research. The meeting was dedicated to Ian Mackay, pioneer in the field of autoimmune liver diseases. The role of liver histology needs to be reconsidered: liver pathology consistent with PBC in AMA-positive individuals without biochemical cholestasis is increasingly reported, raising the question as to whether biochemical cholestasis is a reliable disease marker for both clinical practice and trials. The urgent need for new biomarkers, including more accurate markers of cholestasis, was also widely discussed during the meeting. Moreover, new insights in interactions of bile  with biliary epithelia in PBC provide solid evidence of a role for impaired epithelial protection against potentially toxic hydrophobic bile , raising the fundamental question as to whether this bile -induced epithelial damage is the cause or the consequence of the autoimmune attack to the biliary epithelium. Strategies are needed to identify difficult-to-treat patients at an early disease stage, when new therapeutic approaches targeting immunologic pathways, in addition to bile -based therapies, may be effective. In conclusion, using interdisciplinary approaches, groundbreaking advances can be expected before long in respect to our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of PBC, with the ultimate aim of improving its treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the immune regulatory mechanisms employed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells upon exposure to IFN-γ is critical for development of  and checkpoint blockade therapy approaches. This study aims to explore the influence of myeloid maturation on IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression and on pro-leukemogenic transcription factor STAT3 signaling in AML and MDS. Stimulation of myeloid blasts' maturation by all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) or 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D) increased the CD11b fraction that expressed PD-1 ligands in response to IFN-γ. Intriguingly, STAT3 pathway was potently induced by IFN-γ and strengthened upon prolonged exposure. Nonetheless, STAT3-mediated atypical IFN-γ signaling appeared as a negligible factor for PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. These negative influences of IFN-γ could be alleviated by a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3, stattic, which also inhibited the upregulation of PD-L1. In conclusion, induction of myeloid maturation enhances the responsiveness of AML and MDS cells to IFN-γ. However, these malignant myeloid cells can exploit both STAT3 pathway and PD-1 ligands to survive IFN-γ-mediated immunity and maintain secondary immune resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216462>Sera Antibody Repertoire Analyses Reveal Mechanisms of Broad and Pandemic Strain Neutralizing Responses after Human Norovirus Vaccination.</a></h1><p>Rapidly evolving RNA viruses, such as the GII.4 strain of human norovirus (HuNoV), and their vaccines elicit complex serological responses associated with previous exposure. Specific correlates of protection, moreover, remain poorly understood. Here, we report the GII.4-serological antibody repertoire-pre- and post-vaccination-and select several antibody clonotypes for epitope and structural analysis. The humoral response was dominated by GII.4-specific antibodies that blocked ancestral strains or by antibodies that bound to divergent genotypes and did not block viral-entry-ligand interactions. However, one antibody, A1431, showed broad blockade toward tested GII.4 strains and neutralized the pandemic GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney strain. Structural mapping revealed conserved epitopes, which were occluded on the virion or partially exposed, allowing for broad blockade with neutralizing activity. Overall, our results provide high-resolution molecular information on humoral immune responses after HuNoV vaccination and demonstrate that infection-derived and vaccine-elicited antibodies can exhibit broad blockade and neutralization against this prevalent human pathogen.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Among the previously described Schistosoma vaccine candidates, cyclophilins comprise an interesting antigen that could be used for vaccine formulations. Cyclophilin A is the target for the cyclosporine A, a drug with schistosomicide activity, and its orthologue from Schistosoma japonicum induces a protective immune response in mice. Although Schistosoma mansoni cyclophilin A also represents a promising target for anti-schistosome vaccines, its potential to induce protection has not been evaluated. In this study, we characterized the cyclophilin A (SmCyp), initially described as Smp17.7, analyzed its allergenic potential using in vitro functional assays, and evaluated its ability to induce protection in mice when administered as an antigen using different vaccine formulations and strategies. Results indicated that SmCyp could be successfully expressed by mammalian cells and bacteria. The recombinant protein did not promote IgE-reporter system activation in vitro, demonstrating its probable safety for use in vaccine formulations. T and B-cell epitopes were predicted in the SmCyp sequence, with two of them located within the active isomerase site. The most immunogenic antigen, SmCyp (107-121), was then used for immunization protocols. Immunization with the SmCyp gene or protein failed to reduce parasite burden but induced an immune response that modulated the granuloma area. In contrast, immunization with the synthetic peptide SmCyp (107-121) significantly reduced worm burden (48-50%) in comparison to control group, but did not regulate liver pathology. Moreover, the protection observed in mice immunized with the synthetic peptide was associated with the significant production of antibodies against the SmCyp (107-121) epitope. Therefore, in this study, we identified an epitope within the SmCyp sequence that induces a protective immune response against the parasite, thus representing a promising antigen that could be used for vaccine formulation against schistosomiasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Eggs contain all of the proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and growth factors necessary for embryonic development. In particular, egg white and yolk proteins are considered functional food substances because they possess biological activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, metal-chelating, antihypertensive, anticancer, and immunomodulatory activities. Peptides produced via processes such as enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation by microorganisms, and some chemical and physical treatments of egg proteins have been shown to enhance the functional properties and solubility of these peptides. Peptide activity is strongly related to amino  sequence, composition, and length. At present, cancer remains among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and therefore research aimed at developing new treatments for cancer  is of great interest. The present review focuses primarily on the anticancer and immunomodulatory activities of egg proteins and their peptides and provides some insight into their underlying mechanisms of action. A number of egg proteins and peptides have been reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, protect against DNA damage, decrease the invasion ability of cancer cells, and exhibit cytotoxic and antimutagenic activity in various cancer cell lines. Furthermore, egg proteins and peptides can stimulate or suppress pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as affect the production of inflammatory mediators in a variety of cell lines. In addition, the composition of eggs and the processes of egg proteins and peptides production will be discussed.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380170>PI3Kgamma Inhibitor Attenuates Immunosuppressive Effect of Poly(l-Glutamic )-Combretastatin A4 Conjugate in Metastatic Breast Cancer.</a></h1><p>Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) have great potential for cancer treatment. Poly(l-glutamic )-combretastatin A4 conjugate (PLG-CA4) is a novel class of VDAs. Though it has notable antitumor activity, it can induce host immune responses that promote tumor growth. Here, PLG-CA4 induces the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the M2-like phenotype in 4T1 metastatic breast cancer (Control 30% vs PLG-CA4 53%;  < 0.05). Compared to the monotherapy of PLG-CA4, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) attenuates the immunosuppressive effect of PLG-CA4 treatment by decreasing the number of M2-like TAMs (2.0 × 10 to 1.5 × 10 per tumor) and potential enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (3.0 × 10 to 5.7 × 10 per tumor). Importantly, PI3Kγ inhibitor synergizing with PLG-CA4 significantly extends the mean survival time from 52 days in monotherapy-treated mice to 61.8 days. Additionally, the combination of PLG-CA4 and PI3Kγ inhibitor improves the tumor therapeutic effect of NLG919, an inhibitor of immune checkpoint indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As far as it is known, this is the first demonstrated study that VDAs induce the reshaping of macrophages to the M2-like phenotype. The findings also indicate a potential therapeutic strategy of the combination VDAs with an accurate immune modifier in the tumor to reverse the immune resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616440>NK Cell Metabolism and Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h1><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are characterized by their potential to kill tumor cells by different means without previous sensitization and have, therefore, become a valuable tool in cancer . However, their efficacy against solid tumors is still poor and further studies are required to improve it. One of the major restrictions for NK cell activity is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). There, tumor and other immune cells create the appropriate conditions for tumor proliferation while, among others, preventing NK cell activation. Furthermore, NK cell metabolism is impaired in the TME, presumably due to nutrient and oxygen deprivation, and the higher concentration of tumor-derived metabolic end products, such as lactate. This metabolic restriction of NK cells limits their effector functions, and it could represent a potential target to focus on to improve the efficacy of NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors. In this review, we discuss the potential effect of TME into NK cell metabolism and its influence in NK cell effector functions.Copyright © 2019 Terrén, Orrantia, Vitallé, Zenarruzabeitia and Borrego.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384667>Recruitment of Intratumoral CD103 Dendritic Cells by a CXCR4 Antagonist-Armed Virotherapy Enhances Antitumor Immunity.</a></h1><p>Intratumoral dendritic cells play an important role in stimulating cytotoxic T cells and driving antitumor immunity. Using a metastatic ovarian tumor model in syngeneic mice, we explored whether therapy with a CXCR4 antagonist-armed oncolytic vaccinia virus activates endogenous CD103 dendritic cell responses associated with the induction of adaptive immunity against viral and tumor antigens. The overall goal of this study was to determine whether expansion of CD103 dendritic cells by the virally delivered CXCR4 antagonist augments overall survival and  boosting with a tumor antigen peptide-based vaccine. We found that locoregional delivery of the CXCR4-A-armed virus reduced the tumor load and the immunosuppressive network in the tumor microenvironment, leading to infiltration of CD103 dendritic cells that were capable of phagocytic clearance of cellular material from virally infected cancer cells. Further expansion of tumor-resident CD103 DCs by injecting the FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, the formative cytokine for CD103 DCs, provided a platform for a booster immunization with the Wilms tumor antigen 1 peptide-based vaccine delivered intraperitoneally with polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic  as an adjuvant. The vaccine-induced antitumor responses inhibited tumor growth and increased overall survival, indicating that expansion of intratumoral CD103 dendritic cells by CXCR4-A-armed oncovirotherapy treatment can potentiate  cancer vaccine boosting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132380>Photothermal therapy mediated by phase-transformation nanoparticles facilitates delivery of anti-PD1 antibody and synergizes with antitumor  for melanoma.</a></h1><p>Melanoma remains one of the most challenging malignant tumor related deaths worldwide and alternative approaches to efficiently treat melanoma are eagerly needed. Anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1)  is the most significant and impactful therapy for melanoma by immune checkpoint inhibition and T cell stimulation to mediate tumor killing. But the clinical remission rate of aPD1  is limited in melanoma. Here we show a potent combination of aPD1 and photothermal therapy (PTT) by effective delivery of a multifunctional phase-transformation nanocarrier to melanoma tumor. We successfully synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with aPD1, iron oxide and perfluoropentane (PFP) in lactic-co-glycolic  (PLGA) shell modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptides (GOP@aPD1). In vitro, GOP@aPD1 NPs were characterized for particle size and drug-loading efficiency. The NPs were also tested for photothermal property, optical droplet vaporization (ODV) capacity and the ability of aPD1 release profile. In vivo, GOP@aPD1 NPs were systemically administered to melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated no toxicity and accumulation at tumor site. When mediated with PTT, this synergistic treatment achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy, due to combination of the effective aPD1 release and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor site. In conclusion, GOP@aPD1 NPs combined with PTT could potentiate the efficacy of aPD1 not only by tumor-targeted delivery of aPD1 but also by activating the immune system in the tumor microenvironment, which is a highly effective approach to treat melanoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To successfully establish an infection,  must adapt to redox fluctuations in vivo. In the present study, we show that deletion of  fexA gene caused hypersensitivity to  and reactive oxygen species. The  mutant exhibited severe in vivo survival defects. For deeper understanding the role of  gene on the successful  infection, we analyzed differentially expressed genes in  mutant in comparison with wild type under aerobic, anaerobic or in vivo culture conditions by genome-scale DNA microarray analyses. Twenty-two genes were downregulated in the  mutant under all three culture conditions. Among them,  appeared to dominantly contribute to the defective phenotypes of the  mutant. The  deletion induced compensatory point mutations in the  promoter region over subcultures, suggesting essentiality. Those point mutations (PSMs) restored bacterial growth, motility, cytotoxicity ATP production and mouse lethality in the  mutant. These results indicate that the  operon, being regulated by , plays a crucial role in  survival under redox-fluctuating in vivo conditions.

However, how mA modification is involved in innate immunity via affecting the translation of immune transcripts remains to be further investigated. Here we report that RNA methyltransferase Mettl3-mediated mRNA mA methylation promotes dendritic cell (DC) activation and function. Specific depletion of Mettl3 in DC resulted in impaired phenotypic and functional maturation of DC, with decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and cytokine IL-12, and reduced ability to stimulate T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, Mettl3-mediated mA of CD40, CD80 and TLR4 signaling adaptor Tirap transcripts enhanced their translation in DC for stimulating T cell activation, and strengthening TLR4/NF-κB signaling-induced cytokine production. Our findings identify a new role for Mettl3-mediated mA modification in increasing translation of certain immune transcripts for physiological promotion of DC activation and DC-based T cell response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228184>Liquid biopsy in the era of immuno-oncology: is it ready for prime-time use for cancer patients?</a></h1><p>The emergence of  in oncology requires the discovery, validation and subsequent adoption of robust, sensitive and specific predictive and prognostic biomarkers for daily practice. Until now, anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue sections has been the only validated companion diagnostic test for first-line  for advanced and metastatic cancer, notably non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, detection of this biomarker presents limitations that have stimulated the development of other biomarkers and other approaches. Within this context, the use of a liquid biopsy (LB) could provide an important complementary or alternative added value to PD-L1 IHC. In this review, we discuss how LBs have been used in the field of immuno-oncology (I-O) to predict response, relapse or adverse advents for patients undergoing immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) and we highlight recent developments. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), proteins and cytokines detected in plasma as well as circulating T-lymphocytes are discussed as potential sources for developing new I-O biomarkers. The quantification of cfDNA as a predictive biomarker, as well as its sequencing for the determination of tumor mutational burden, is already well advanced. Additionally, the quantification of PD-L1 from CTCs, bound on exosomes or free in plasma, as well as the determination of cytokines, are also being actively investigated with promising results having recently been published. Lastly, analysis of T-lymphocytes, especially by analyzing the T-cell receptor, has recently emerged as a valuable biomarker that might become relevant for the prediction of response to ICIs. While LBs have not yet been implemented in routine I-O clinical practice, recent promising data and rapidly advancing technologies indicate that this approach has the potential to soon personalize the clinical management of cancer patients receiving ICIs.© The Author(s) 2019.

SLIT leads to tolerance against allergens possibly via the redirection of allergen-specific T helper 2 cells to T helper 1 cells and the generation of peripheral regulatory T (Treg) cells. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Systemic tolerance to orally administered antigens (oral tolerance) has been extensively investigated. Recent studies have recognized the central role of Treg cells and classical dendritic cells (cDCs) in oral tolerance development.This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SLIT compared with those of oral tolerance. The sublingual administration of soluble protein antigens has been reported to induce antigen-specific Treg cells in oral mucosa-draining submandibular lymph nodes in mice. The generation of Treg cells is critical for SLIT efficacy because the transfer of SLIT-induced Treg cells confers tolerance against the antigens. A large number of oral cDCs with the CD103CD11b phenotype exert retinoic -producing activity and convert naïve CD4 T cells into Foxp3 Treg cells in vitro in a transforming growth factor-β-dependent and retinoic -dependent manner. Oral CD103CD11b cDCs transport sublingual antigens to submandibular lymph nodes and induce antigen-specific Treg cells. Sublingual antigens enter the mucosa most likely by crossing the sublingual ductal epithelium and are captured by oral antigen-presenting cells, especially macrophages.Oral CD103CD11b cDCs are specialized for the induction of Treg cells in mice; thus, targeting their human counterpart may enhance the therapeutic effects of SLIT.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Association for Oral Biology.

Moreover, the development of agents that are active against specific resistance mechanisms arising during treatment make it equally important to characterize the tumor tissue at progression by performing tissue re-biopsy. Given that tumor tissue is not always available for molecular characterization due to the paucity of diagnostic specimens or problems relating to the carrying out of invasive procedures, the use of liquid biopsy represents a valid approach to overcoming these difficulties. The most common material used for liquid biopsy in this setting is plasma-derived cell free DNA (cfDNA), which originates from cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis. However, other sources of tumor material can be considered, such as extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived nucleic , which are actively secreted from living cells and closely correspond to tumor dynamics. In this review, we discuss the role of liquid biopsy in the therapeutic management of NSCLC with particular regard to targeted therapy and , and analyze the pros and cons of the different types of samples used in this context.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322330>A Generic Coordination Assembly-Enabled Nanocoating of Individual Tumor Cells for Personalized .</a></h1><p>A generic and effective tumor cells encapsulation strategy enabled by metal-organic coordination is developed to prepare a vaccine for personalized . Specifically, an epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-Al(III) coordination layer is in situ formed onto individual living cells in aqueous phase and the process can be completed within an hour. 98% of proteins in the cells are entrapped within the microparticles, which are endowed with high antigens loading capacity. The microparticles enhance the uptake efficiency of antigens, protect antigens from degradation in vivo, and delay the retention time of antigens in the lymph nodes. Moreover, dendritic cells (DCs) activation is triggered by the microparticles, and simultaneously, the expression of costimulation marker on DCs and the production of Th1-related cytokines are significantly upregulated. Moreover, six kinds of tumor cells are utilized and successfully coated with the EGCG/Al(III) layer, suggesting the generalization of this strategy. More importantly, the microparticles exhibit a comparative antitumor effect with polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (PolyI:C) in B16 pulmonary metastasis model. Overall, the encapsulation strategy enabled by metal-organic coordination can be potentially useful for personalized  customized to individual patient's tumor cells.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Typhimurium.</a></h1><p>Currently, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), is a major global public health problem, which has caused food-borne illnesses in many countries. Today, with the extensive use of antimicrobials, antimicrobial resistance is increasing at a serious rate in S. Typhimurium isolates. The present study sought the role of cysteine (Cys) auxotrophy on the resistance to quinolones and paraquat in S. Typhimurium. Cys auxotrophy was achieved by deleting either the cysDNC, cysJIH or cysQ loci. Deletion of these loci resulted in loss of susceptibility against nalidixic , levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and paraquat. Further studies with cysJIH mutant indicated increased expression of multi-antibiotic resistance genes marA and ramA, and consequently increased expression of efflux-pump systems. The cysJIH mutant presented a smaller increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in presence of paraquat or CIP. Expression of katG and sodA (expressing for a catalase and a superoxide dismutase, respectively) genes was increased in presence of paraquat in the cysJIH mutant; while expression of the superoxide dismutase gene sodB was decreased. These results indicate that deletion of cysDNC, cysJIH or cysQ genes of S. Typhimurium renders Cys auxotrophy along with decreased susceptibility in response to quinolone and paraquat. Overexpression of efflux-pump systems AcrB-TolC and SmvA-OmpD and antioxidant enzymes KatG and SodA could explain the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in the Cys auxotrophic mutants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, (Z)-11-eicosenol-a major constituent of bee venom, along with its derivations methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic , were synthesised to investigate their immune stimulatory effect and possible use as vaccine adjuvants. Stimuli that prime and activate the immune system have exerted profound effects on immune cells, particularly macrophages; however, the effectiveness of bee venom constituents as immune stimulants has not yet been established. Here, the abilities of these compounds to act as pro-inflammatory stimuli were assessed, either alone or in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by examining the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-10 by THP-1 macrophages. The compounds clearly increased the levels of IL-1β and decreased IL-10, whereas a decrease in IL-6 levels suggested a complex mechanism of action. A more in-depth profile of macrophage behaviour was therefore obtained by comprehensive untargeted metabolic profiling of the cells using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to confirm the ability of the eicosanoids to trigger the immune system. The level of 358 polar and 315 non-polar metabolites were changed significantly ( < 0.05) by all treatments. The LPS-stimulated production of most of the inflammatory metabolite biomarkers in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, purine, pyrimidine and fatty  metabolism were significantly enhanced by all three compounds, and particularly by methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic .

Glycans can impact all steps in tumour progression, from malignant transformation to metastasis, and have roles in all the cancer hallmarks. An increased understanding of glycans in the metastatic cascade offers exciting new therapeutic opportunities. Glycan-based targeting strategies are currently being tested in clinical trials and are a rich and untapped frontier for development. As we learn more about cancer glycobiology, new targets will continue to emerge for drug design. One key change in tumour glycosylation is the upregulation of cancer-associated sialylated glycans. Abnormal sialylation is integral to tumour growth, metastasis and immune evasion; therefore, targeting sialic  moieties in cancer could be of high therapeutic value. Here, we summarise the changes to sialic  biology in cancer and discuss recent advances and technologies bringing sialic- targeting treatments to the forefront of cancer therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350177>Treg Cells Promote the SREBP1-Dependent Metabolic Fitness of Tumor-Promoting Macrophages via Repression of CD8 T Cell-Derived Interferon-γ.</a></h1><p>Regulatory T (Treg) cells are crucial for immune homeostasis, but they also contribute to tumor immune evasion by promoting a suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Mice with Treg cell-restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cell types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T cell secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty  synthesis in immunosuppressive (M2-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained M2-like TAM metabolic fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival. SREBP1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that targeting Treg cells or their modulation of lipid metabolism in M2-like TAMs could improve cancer .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cancer cells are capable of evading clearance by macrophages through the overexpression of anti-phagocytic surface proteins called 'don't eat me' signals-including CD47, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the beta-2 microglobulin subunit of the major histocompatibility class I complex (B2M). Monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the interaction of 'don't eat me' signals with their macrophage-expressed receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in several cancers. However, variability in the magnitude and durability of the response to these agents has suggested the presence of additional, as yet unknown 'don't eat me' signals. Here we show that CD24 can be the dominant innate immune checkpoint in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, and is a promising target for cancer . We demonstrate a role for tumour-expressed CD24 in promoting immune evasion through its interaction with the inhibitory receptor sialic--binding Ig-like lectin 10 (Siglec-10), which is expressed by tumour-associated macrophages. We find that many tumours overexpress CD24 and that tumour-associated macrophages express high levels of Siglec-10. Genetic ablation of either CD24 or Siglec-10, as well as blockade of the CD24-Siglec-10 interaction using monoclonal antibodies, robustly augment the phagocytosis of all CD24-expressing human tumours that we tested. Genetic ablation and therapeutic blockade of CD24 resulted in a macrophage-dependent reduction of tumour growth in vivo and an increase in survival time. These data reveal CD24 as a highly expressed, anti-phagocytic signal in several cancers and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for CD24 blockade in cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100935>Expression of Glypican 3 is an Independent Prognostic Biomarker in Primary Gastro-Esophageal Adenocarcinoma and Corresponding Serum Exosomes.</a></h1><p>Exosomes are nano-sized membranous vesicles of endosomal origin that carry nucleic , lipids and proteins.

In the setting of cancer, the immune system is either tolerized and/or has a limited tumor-specific T cell repertoire. In this study, we explore whether intratumoral (IT) vaccination with an HPV vaccine can elicit quantitative and qualitative differences in immune response as compared to intramuscular (IM) vaccination to overcome immune resistance in established tumors. We report that IT administration of an HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine formulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic  [poly(I:C)] generated an enhanced antitumor effect relative to IM delivery. The elicited anti-tumor effect with IT vaccination was consistent among the vaccinated groups and across various C57BL/6 substrains. IT vaccination resulted in an increased frequency of PD-1 TILs, which represented both vaccine-targeted and non-vaccine-targeted tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Overall, the CD8/Treg ratio was increased within the tumor microenvironment using IT vaccination. We also assessed transcriptional changes in several immune-related genes in the tumor microenvironment of the various treated groups, and our data suggest that IT vaccination leads to upregulation of a broad complement of immunomodulatory genes, including upregulation of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and antigen presentation and processing machine (APM) components. IT vaccine delivery is superior to traditional IM vaccination routes with the potential to improve tumor immunogenicity, which has potential clinical application in the setting of accessible lesions such as head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409072>A Three-in-One  Nanoweapon via Cascade-Amplifying Cancer-Immunity Cycle against Tumor Metastasis, Relapse, and Postsurgical Regrowth.</a></h1><p>The antitumor immune response involves a cascade of three phases, namely, antigen presentation (Phase I), lymphocyte activation and proliferation/differentiation (Phase II), and tumor elimination (Phase III). Therefore, an ideal  nanoplatform is one that can simultaneously execute these three phases. However, it is of great challenge to develop a single  nanoplatform which can deliver individual immunoagent to their on-demand target sites for simultaneously tailoring three phases because of the different target sites restricted by three phases.

The step-by-step detachment of the antigen from near-infrared light irradiated HC component, the indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitor 1-mt, and the anti-PD-L1 toward their on-demand target sites demonstrated the simultaneous tailoring of Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III, respectively, of the . The aPD-L1@HC/PM NPs were verified to be an excellent  nanoplatform against tumor metastasis, relapse, and postsurgical regrowth because of the cascade-amplifying cancer-immunity cycle.

As current therapeutic options are primarily symptomatic, we have explored the potential of hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapy. Using Csf2rb mice, a model closely reflecting the human herPAP disease phenotype, we here demonstrate robust pulmonary engraftment of an alveolar macrophage population following intravenous transplantation of lentivirally corrected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Engraftment was associated with marked improvement of critical herPAP disease parameters, including bronchoalveolar fluid protein, cholesterol and cytokine levels, pulmonary density on CT scans, pulmonary deposition of Periodic -Schiff material as well as respiratory mechanics. These effects were stable for at least nine months. With respect to engraftment and alveolar macrophage differentiation kinetics, we demonstrate the rapid development of CD11cSiglec-F cells in the lungs from a CD11c/Siglec-F progenitor population within four weeks after transplantation. Based on these data, we suggest hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapy as an effective and cause-directed treatment approach for herPAP.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248842>Sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126879>Broad and Potent Neutralizing Antibodies Recognize the Silent Face of the HIV Envelope.</a></h1><p>Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 envelope (Env) inform vaccine design and are potential therapeutic agents. We identified SF12 and related bNAbs with up to 62% neutralization breadth from an HIV-infected donor. SF12 recognized a glycan-dominated epitope on Env's silent face and was potent against clade AE viruses, which are poorly covered by V3-glycan bNAbs. A 3.3Å cryo-EM structure of a SF12-Env trimer complex showed additional contacts to Env protein residues by SF12 compared with VRC-PG05, the only other known donor-derived silentface antibody, explaining SF12's increased neutralization breadth, potency, and resistance to Env mutation routes. Asymmetric binding of SF12 was associated with distinct N-glycan conformations across Env protomers, demonstrating intra-Env glycan heterogeneity. Administrating SF12 to HIV-1-infected humanized mice suppressed viremia and selected for viruses lacking the N448 glycan. Effective bNAbs can therefore be raised against HIV-1 Env's silent face, suggesting their potential for HIV-1 prevention, therapy, and vaccine development.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to determine the immune response in dogs with osteosarcoma by measuring stimulated leukocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and TNF and IL-6 to IL-10 ratios.Whole blood was collected from dogs with osteosarcoma receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, n = 11), dogs with osteosarcoma not receiving NSAIDs (n = 14) and healthy dogs (n = 5).No difference in TNF production was found among healthy and OSA dogs regardless of NSAID administration following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (p = .410), lipoteichoic  (LTA) (p = .693) or PBS (p = .120). Leukocyte IL-6 production was greater in all dogs with OSA after stimulation with LPS (p = .015), LTA (p = .014) and PBS (p = .034) with no difference between OSA dogs receiving NSAIDs and those not. No differences in IL-10 were found among healthy controls and dogs with OSA regardless of NSAID use. There was no difference among groups for LPS-stimulated TNF to IL-10 ratios (p = .407). For LTA-stimulated leukocytes, the TNF to IL-10 ratio was lower in dogs with OSA than in healthy dogs (p = .031) with no difference between OSA NSAID dogs compared to OSA non-NSAID dogs (p = .059). No differences were found in LPS (p = .310)- or LTA (p = .265)-stimulated leukocyte IL-6 to IL-10 production ratios among groups.Dogs with osteosarcoma have an altered pro- and anti-inflammatory immunologic profile compared to healthy dogs regardless of NSAID use. Further study is indicated to determine the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications of these findings.© 2019 The Authors.

Although there have been many studies on the prevention of furunculosis over the past few decades, it is still prevalent in many fisheries. In this study, a recombinant adenovirus vaccine candidate harboring the highly immunogenic Vapa gene (pAd-easy-cmv-Vapa) was successfully constructed and tested. The immune protection rate and specific antibody levels in the peripheral blood were then determined after immunizing rainbow trout. In addition, relative levels of IgM and IgT in the head kidney and hindgut before and after immunization were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Western blotting results indicated that the recombinant adenovirus could infect HEK-293 cells and express the A layer protein (encoded by Vapa). Further, survival analysis of fish 28 days after challenge showed that immunization significantly lowered the mortality rate (40%) compared to that in the control group (76.6%) and empty vector group (73.6%). This also led to an increase in specific antibodies in peripheral serum. In addition, levels of IgM and IgT in the head kidney and hindgut were increased to varying degrees. In conclusion, our research provides a candidate vaccine for the prevention of Aeromonas salmonicida A450 infection in rainbow trout and lays the foundation for future research on adaptive immune mechanisms associated with rainbow trout antibodies.Copyright © 2019.

Using RTqPCR, we have previously identified a gene expression panel that detected presence of malignant cells (MMP9:TIMP3 ratio) and quantified PD-L1 transcript levels in small biopsy specimens. However, RTqPCR has diagnostic limitations as it does not generate absolute copy number and is not readily multiplexed. To address this, we have developed a multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay.Biopsies obtained from NSCLC patients (n = 48 adenocarcinoma and n = 40 squamous cell carcinoma) and control lung biopsy specimens (n = 20) were analysed. Absolute MMP9, TIMP3 and PD-L1 transcript copy numbers were determined within a single assay by multiplex ddPCR using Taqman primers and the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System.Using our optimised triplex ddPCR assay, the MMP9:TIMP3 ratio was significantly elevated in NSCLC biopsies and using a cut-off of >0.028, was 99% (95% CI; 80.5-94.5) sensitive and 80% specific for identifying malignant biopsies. The PD-L1:TIMP3 ratio significantly associated with PD-L1 tumour cell immunohistochemistry staining (r = 0.539, p < 0.0001) and was significantly higher in biopsies with >50% PD-L1 tumour cell staining (p < 0.0001). In summary, a major advantage of our workflow is that it can accurately quantify PD-L1 tumour levels and provide sufficient nucleic  for screening additional targetable mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1 from a single small biopsy, thereby potentially avoiding the need for re-biopsy. Future studies will need to determine diagnostic ddPCR values that are predictive of clinical response to PD-1/PD-L1 .Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We and others previously showed that pseudotyping of oncolytic rhabdoviruses such as maraba virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) results in only a weak induction of neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, LCMV-GP-pseudotyped VSV (VSV-GP) was significantly more stable in normal human serum (NHS) than VSV. Here, we demonstrate that depending on the cell line used for virus production, VSV-GP showed different complement sensitivities in nonimmune NHS. The NHS-mediated titer reduction of VSV-GP was dependent on activation of the classical complement pathway, mainly by natural IgM antibodies against xenoantigens such as galactose-α-(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal) or -glycolylneuraminic  (Neu5Gc) expressed on nonhuman production cell lines. VSV-GP produced on human cell lines was stable in NHS. However, VSV-GP generated in transduced human cells expressing α-Gal became sensitive to NHS. Furthermore, GP-specific antibodies induced complement-mediated neutralization of VSV-GP independently of the producer cell line, suggesting that complement regulatory proteins potentially acquired by the virus during the budding process are not sufficient to rescue the virus from antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis. Thus, our study points to the importance of a careful selection of cell lines for viral vector production for clinical use. Systemic application aims to deliver oncolytic viruses to tumors as well as to metastatic lesions. However, we found that xenoantigens incorporated onto the viral surface from nonhuman production cell lines are recognized by natural antibodies in human serum and that the virus is thereby inactivated by complement lysis. Hence, to maximize the effective dose, careful selection of cell lines for virus production is crucial.Copyright © 2019 Pipperger et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087119>Drug repurposing to overcome resistance to various therapies for colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>Emergence of novel treatment modalities provides effective therapeutic options, apart from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, to fight against colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, drug resistance remains a huge challenge in clinics, leading to invariable occurrence of disease progression after treatment initiation. While novel drug development is unfavorable in terms of time frame and costs, drug repurposing is one of the promising strategies to combat resistance. This approach refers to the application of clinically available drugs to treat a different disease. With the well-established safety profile and optimal dosing of these approved drugs, their combination with current cancer therapy is suggested to provide an economical, safe and efficacious approach to overcome drug resistance and prolong patient survival. Here, we review both preclinical and clinical efficacy, as well as cellular mechanisms, of some extensively studied repurposed drugs, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, metformin, chloroquine, disulfiram, niclosamide, zoledronic  and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Here we have provided evidence that aberrant splicing by mutant SF3B1 altered the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of human cells, leading to missplicing-associated downregulation of metabolic genes, decreased mitochondrial respiration, and suppression of the serine synthesis pathway. We also found that mutant SF3B1 induces vulnerability to deprivation of the nonessential amino  serine, which was mediated by missplicing-associated downregulation of the serine synthesis pathway enzyme PHGDH. This vulnerability was manifest both in vitro and in vivo, as dietary restriction of serine and glycine in mice was able to inhibit the growth of SF3B1MUT xenografts. These findings describe a role for SF3B1 mutations in altered energy metabolism, and they offer a new therapeutic strategy against SF3B1MUT cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053413>Potentiating Oncolytic Virus-Induced Immune-Mediated Tumor Cell Killing Using Histone Deacetylase Inhibition.</a></h1><p>A clinical oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), talimogene laherparepvec, causes regression of injected and non-injected melanoma lesions in patients and is now licensed for clinical use in advanced melanoma. To date, limited data are available regarding the mechanisms of human anti-tumor immune priming, an improved understanding of which could inform the development of future combination strategies with improved efficacy. This study addressed direct oncolysis and innate and adaptive human immune-mediated effects of a closely related HSV encoding GM-CSF (HSV) alone and in combination with histone deacetylase inhibition. We found that HSV supported activation of anti-melanoma immunity via monocyte-mediated type I interferon production, which activates NK cells, and viral maturation of immature dendritic cells (iDCs) into potent antigen-presenting cells for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) priming. Addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic  (VPA) to HSV treatment of tumor cells increased viral replication, viral GM-CSF production, and oncolysis and augmented the development of anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, VPA increased expression of activating ligands for NK cell recognition and induced expression of tumor-associated antigens, supporting innate NK cell killing and CTL priming. These data support the clinical combination of talimogene laherparepvec with histone deacetylase inhibition to enhance oncolysis and anti-tumor immunity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We report that tissue-specific expression of the human long noncoding RNA LINK-A in mouse mammary glands initiates metastatic mammary gland tumors, which phenotypically resemble human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). LINK-A expression facilitated crosstalk between phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate and inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways, attenuating protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM71. Consequently, LINK-A expression enhanced K48-polyubiquitination-mediated degradation of the antigen peptide-loading complex (PLC) and intrinsic tumor suppressors Rb and p53. Treatment with LINK-A locked nucleic  or GPCR antagonists stabilized the PLC components, Rb and p53, and sensitized mammary gland tumors to immune checkpoint blockers. Patients with programmed ccll death protein-1(PD-1) blockade-resistant TNBC exhibited elevated LINK-A levels and downregulated PLC components. Hence we demonstrate lncRNA-dependent downregulation of antigenicity and intrinsic tumor suppression, which provides the basis for developing combinational  treatment regimens and early TNBC prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670734>A cell-penetrating peptide-assisted nanovaccine promotes antigen cross-presentation and anti-tumor immune response.</a></h1><p>Exogenous antigens processed in the cytosol and subsequently cross-presented on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules activate cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes (CTL), which are crucial in cancer . Here, we reported a nanovaccine, which was produced by encapsulating OVA (ovalbumin, a model antigen) chemically modified with MPGΔNLS (MPGΔNLS-OVA conjugate) into poly(lactide-co-glycolide)  (PLGA) nanoparticles. We hypothesized that after the uptake of the nanovaccine into immune cells, MPGΔNLS, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), would assist the escape of the antigens from lysosomes into the cytosol, increase the amount of antigens processed in the cytosol and subsequently enhance antigen cross-presentation via MHC-I molecules to elicit cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. The results of the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs not only elevated the release of OVA into the cytosol of dendritic cells (BMDCs), but also promoted the maturation and activation of BMDCs. It was also observed in mice vaccinated with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs that the MPGΔNLS modification could stimulate the expansion of OVA-specific T-cells, generation of OVA-specific IgG antibodies and proliferation of OVA-specific memory T cells. Moreover, the treatment of E·G7-OVA tumor-bearing mice with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs resulted in significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival periods of the mice compared to the treatment with unmodified OVA-PLGA NPs or free OVA. In summary, cell-penetrating peptides linked with antigens encapsulated in nanovaccines can spatiotemporally affect the intracellular localization of antigens, promote antigen cross-presentation and stimulate antigen-specific immune responses, especially CTL responses. Therefore, the CPP modification on antigens is an innovative approach to enhance the efficacy of nanovaccines for cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594620>A DNA electrochemical biosensor based on triplex DNA-templated Ag/Pt nanoclusters for the detection of single-nucleotide variant.</a></h1><p>A label-free electrochemical biosensor based on the triplex DNA-templated Ag/Pt bimetallic nanoclusters (triplex-Ag/PtNCs) and locked nucleic  (LNA) modified X-shaped DNA probe was developed for the detection of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) related to β-thalassemia.

Secondly, the LNA modified X-shaped probes were assembled on gold electrode surface, which can only be dissociated in the presence of target, leading to the hybridization with triplex-Ag/PtNCs and significant increase of current signal.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop appropriate strategies for preventing colonization by this bacterium and/or neutralizing virulence factors. In this study, we formulated the encapsulation of exotoxin A into PLGA nanoparticles. The biological activities of the nanovaccine candidate were also characterized. Based on the results, ETA-PLGA can act as a suitable immunogen to stimulate the humoral and cellular immune response. The antibodies raised against ETA-PLGA significantly decreased bacterial titer in the spleens of the immunized mice after challenge with PAO1 strain, compared to the control groups. The encapsulation of PLGA into ETA led to a significantly higher production of INF-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-17A cytokine responses compared to the ETA group. ETA-PLGA enhanced IgG responses in immunized mice compared to ETA antigen. We concluded that encapsulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ETA to PLGA nanoparticles can increase its functional activity by decreasing the bacterial dissemination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015081>Anti-glutamic  decarboxylase (GAD) positive cerebellar Ataxia with transitioning to progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), responsive to : A case report and review of literature.</a></h1><p>We present a case of a 65-year-old African American male, immunosuppressed on Tacrolimus, who initially presented with cerebellar ataxia and rapidly developed Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) with positive anti-glutamic  decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies, no underlying malignancy, and normal neuroimaging.

Administrations of cancer-specific neoepitopes in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have been proven effective in both mouse models and human patients. Because only a tiny fraction of cancer-specific neoepitopes actually elicits immune response, selection of potent, immunogenic neoepitopes remains a challenging step in cancer vaccine development. A basic approach for immunogenicity prediction is based on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with high affinity.In this study, we developed MHCSeqNet, an open-source deep learning model, which not only outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on both MHC binding affinity and MHC ligand peptidome datasets but also exhibits promising generalization to unseen MHC class I alleles. MHCSeqNet employed neural network architectures developed for natural language processing to model amino  sequence representations of MHC allele and epitope peptide as sentences with amino  as individual words. This consideration allows MHCSeqNet to accept new MHC alleles as well as peptides of any length.The improved performance and the flexibility offered by MHCSeqNet should make it a valuable tool for screening effective neoepitopes in cancer vaccine development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463653>An optimized retinoic -inducible gene I agonist M8 induces immunogenic cell death markers in human cancer cells and dendritic cell activation.</a></h1><p>RIG-I is a cytosolic RNA sensor that recognizes short 5' triphosphate RNA, commonly generated during virus infection. Upon activation, RIG-I initiates antiviral immunity, and in some circumstances, induces cell death. Because of this dual capacity, RIG-I has emerged as a promising target for cancer . Previously, a sequence-optimized RIG-I agonist (termed M8) was generated and shown to stimulate a robust immune response capable of blocking viral infection and to function as an adjuvant in vaccination strategies. Here, we investigated the potential of M8 as an anti-cancer agent by analyzing its ability to induce cell death and activate the immune response. In multiple cancer cell lines, M8 treatment strongly activated caspase 3-dependent apoptosis, that relied on an intrinsic NOXA and PUMA-driven pathway that was dependent on IFN-I signaling. Additionally, cell death induced by M8 was characterized by the expression of markers of immunogenic cell death-related damage-associated molecular patterns (ICD-DAMP)-calreticulin, HMGB1 and ATP-and high levels of ICD-related cytokines CXCL10, IFNβ, CCL2 and CXCL1. Moreover, M8 increased the levels of HLA-ABC expression on the tumor cell surface, as well as up-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. M8 induction of the RIG-I pathway in cancer cells favored dendritic cell phagocytosis and induction of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, together with increased expression of IL12 and CXCL10. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of M8 in cancer , with the capacity to induce ICD-DAMP on tumor cells and activate immunostimulatory signals that synergize with current therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260883>Synergistic triple-combination therapy with hyaluronic -shelled PPy/CPT nanoparticles results in tumor regression and prevents tumor recurrence and metastasis in 4T1 breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is characterized by high aggression, poor prognosis, and high recurrence rate.

An alternative is found in cell-free artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC), but these only present two or three kinds of immune molecules. Here, we describe a multipotent artificial antigen-presenting cell (MaAPC) that delivered 11 kinds of immune moleclues. This MaAPC simulated natural APCs through the concurent coupling of target antigens (H-2K/TRP2-Ig dimers and H-2D/gp100-Ig dimers), costimulatory molecules (anti-CD28, anti-4-1BB, and anti-CD2), and "self-marker" CD47-Fc onto surface-modified polylactic-co-glycolic  microparticles (PLGA-MP). These PLGA-MPs also encapsulated cytokines (IL2 and IL15), a chemokine (CCL21), and checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1). Culture of MaAPCs with naïve T cells for 1 week elevated the frequencies of TRP2-specific and gp100-specific CTLs to 51.0% and 43.3%, respectively, with enhanced cytotoxicity. Three infusions of MaAPCs inhibited subcutaneous melanoma growth in a mouse model and expanded TRP2 and gp100-specific CTLs 59-86-fold in peripheral blood, 76-77-fold in spleen, and 205-212-fold in tumor tissue, in an antigen-specific manner.

The degradation of Trp and the metabolites generated by the enzymatic activity of IDO can have immunomodulating effects, notably over T cells, which are particularly sensitive to the absence of Trp and leads to the inhibition of T cell activation, cell death, and the suppression of T cell effector functions. Noteworthy, T cells participate in the cellular immune response against the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and are essential for viral clearance, as well as the total recovery of the host. Furthermore, inadequate or non-optimal polarization of T cells is often seen during the acute phase of the disease caused by this pathogen. Here, we discuss the capacity of hRSV to exploit the immunosuppressive features of IDO to reduce T cell function, thus acquiring relevant aspects during the biology of the virus.

Fortunately, the identification of Staphylococcal enterotoxin-like toxins (SEls), which possess amino  sequences similar to those of classical SEs but exhibit no or low emetic activity, has provided a set of potential immunomodulatory candidates for cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of SElQ on lymphocyte activation and to further demonstrate its antitumour activity both in vitro and in vivo. High-purity SElQ was successfully harvested, and in vitro results confirmed that SElQ can significantly activate mouse- and human-derived lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, particularly CD4 and CD8 T cells, which showed significant increases in both percentage and absolute number. Further examination revealed that in addition to the originally recognized TCR Vβ5 and 21, TCR Vβ14, 17 and 18 were activated in SElQ-induced human PBMCs. Moreover, the expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ was significantly upregulated in vitro and in vivo after SElQ treatment. Based on the findings that SElQ induces lymphocyte activation and cytokine release, we then confirmed its antitumour activity both in vitro and in vivo. The data showed that treatment with a low concentration of SElQ (30 µg/mouse) could inhibit the growth of tumours by approximately 30% and no significant toxicity was observed. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SElQ can significantly induce T cell activation and cytokine release and further elicit substantial antitumour activity and thus provide support for the potential application of SElQ in cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575551>Metabolic Consequences of T-cell Costimulation in Anticancer Immunity.</a></h1><p>T-cell functional behavior and performance are closely regulated by nutrient availability and the control of metabolism within the T cell. T cells have distinct energetic and anabolic needs when nascently activated, actively proliferating, in naïveté, or in a resting, memory state. As a consequence, bioenergetics are key for T cells to mount adequate immune responses in health and disease. Solid tumors are particularly hostile metabolic environments, characterized by low glucose concentration, hypoxia, and low pH. These metabolic conditions in the tumor are known to hinder antitumor immune responses of T cells by limiting nutrient availability and energetic efficiency. In such immunosuppressive environments, artificial modulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial respiratory capabilities, and fatty  β-oxidation are known to enhance antitumor performance. Reportedly, costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD137, are important regulators of metabolic routes in T cells. In this sense, different costimulatory signals and cytokines induce diverse metabolic changes that critically involve mitochondrial mass and function. For instance, the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encompassing costimulatory domains, agonist antibodies to costimulatory receptors, and checkpoint inhibitors depends on the associated metabolic events in immune cells. Here, we review the metabolic changes that costimulatory receptors can promote in T cells and the potential consequences for cancer .

With increasing numbers of studies describing MDSC involvement in cancer immune escape, cancer metastasis and the dampening of  responses, MDSCs are of high interest in current cancer therapy research. Although heavily investigated in the last decades, the  migration dynamics of MDSC subpopulations in tumor- or metastases-bearing mice have not yet been studied extensively. Therefore, we have modified our previously reported intracellular cell labeling method and applied it to  generated MDSCs for the quantitative  monitoring of MDSC migration in primary and metastatic cancer. MDSC migration to primary cancers was further correlated to the frequency of endogenous MDSCs.  Utilizing a Cu-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-triacetic  (NOTA)-modified CD11b-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone M1/70), we were able to label  generated polymorphonuclear (PMN-) and monocytic (M-) MDSCs for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Radiolabeled PMN- and M-MDSCs ([Cu]PMN-MDSCs and [Cu]M-MDSCs, respectively) were then adoptively transferred into primary and metastatic MMTV-PyMT-derived (PyMT-) breast cancer- and B16F10 melanoma-bearing experimental animals, and static PET and anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired 3, 24 and 48 h post cell injection.  The internalization of the [Cu]NOTA-mAb-CD11b-complex was completed within 3 h, providing moderately stable radiolabeling with little detrimental effect on cell viability and function as determined by Annexin-V staining and T cell suppression in flow cytometric assays. Further, we could non-invasively and quantitatively monitor the migration and tumor homing of both [Cu]NOTA-αCD11b-mAb-labeled PMN- and M-MDSCs in mouse models of primary and metastatic breast cancer and melanoma by PET. We were able to visualize and quantify an increased migration of adoptively transferred [Cu]M-MDSCs than [Cu]PMN-MDSCs to primary breast cancer lesions. The frequency of endogenous MDSCs in the PyMT breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma model correlated to the uptake values of adoptively transferred MDSCs with higher frequencies of PMN- and M-MDSCs in the more aggressive B16F10 melanoma tumors. Moreover, aggressively growing melanomas and melanoma-metastatic lesions recruited higher percentages of both [Cu]PMN- and [Cu]M-MDSCs than primary and metastatic breast cancer lesions as early as 24 h post adoptive MDSC transfer, indicating an overall stronger recruitment of cancer-promoting immunosuppressive MDSCs.  Targeting of the cell surface integrin CD11b with a radioactive mAb is feasible for labeling of murine MDSCs for PET imaging. Fast internalization of the [Cu]NOTA-αCD11b-mAb provides presumably enhanced stability while cell viability and functionality was not significantly affected. Moreover, utilization of the CD11b-specific mAb allows for straightforward adaptation of the labeling approach for  molecular imaging of other myeloid cells of interest in cancer therapy, including monocytes, macrophages or neutrophils.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009335>Enhancing Natural Killer and CD8 T Cell-Mediated Anticancer Cytotoxicity and Proliferation of CD8 T Cells with HLA-E Monospecific Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h1><p>Cytotoxic NK/CD8 T cells interact with MHC-I ligands on tumor cells through either activating or inhibiting receptors. One of the inhibitory receptors is CD94/NKG2A. The NK/CD8 T cell cytotoxic capability is lost when tumor-associated human leukocyte antigen, HLA-E, binds the CD94/NKG2A receptor, resulting in tumor progression and reduced survival. Failure of cancer patients to respond to natural killer (NK) cell therapies could be due to HLA-E overexpression in tumor tissues. Preventing the inhibitory receptor-ligand interaction by either receptor- or ligand-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is an innovative passive immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer. Since receptors and ligands can be monomeric or homo- or heterodimeric proteins, the efficacy of mAbs may rely on their ability to distinguish monospecific (private) functional epitopes from nonfunctional common (public) epitopes. We developed monospecific anti-HLA-E mAbs (e.g., TFL-033) that recognize only HLA-E-specific epitopes, but not epitopes shared with other HLA class-I loci as occurs with currently available polyreactive anti-HLA-E mAbs. Interestingly the amino  sequences in the α1 and α2 helices of HLA-E, critical for the recognition of the mAb TFL-033, are strikingly the same sequences recognized by the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors on NK/CD8 cells. Such monospecific mAbs can block the CD94/NKG2A interaction with HLA-E to restore NK cell and CD8 anticancer cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the HLA-E monospecific mAbs significantly promoted the proliferation of the CD4/CD8 T cells. These monospecific mAbs are also invaluable for the specific demonstration of HLA-E on tumor biopsies, potentially indicating those tumors most likely to respond to such therapy. Thus, they can be used to enhance passive  once phased preclinical studies and clinical trials are completed. On principle, we postulate that NK cell passive  should capitalize on both of these features of monospecific HLA-E mAbs, that is, the specific determination HLA-E expression on a particular tumor and the enhancement of NK cell/CD8 cytotoxicity if HLA-E positive.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588231>Effective chemoimmunotherapy by co-delivery of doxorubicin and immune adjuvants in biodegradable nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>Chemoimmunotherapy is an emerging combinatorial modality for the treatment of cancers resistant to common first-line therapies, such as chemotherapy and checkpoint blockade . We used biodegradable nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for local, slow and sustained release of doxorubicin, two immune adjuvants and one chemokine for the treatment of resistant solid tumors.  Bio-compatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic )-PEG nanoparticles were synthesized in an oil/water emulsion, using a solvent evaporation-extraction method. The nanoparticles were loaded with a NIR-dye for theranostic purposes, doxorubicin cytostatic agent, poly (I:C) and R848 immune adjuvants and CCL20 chemokine. After physicochemical and  characterization the nanoparticles therapeutic efficacy were carried-out on established, highly aggressive and treatment resistant TC-1 lung carcinoma and MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma models .  The yielded nanoparticles average size was 180 nm and -14 mV surface charge. The combined treatment with all compounds was significantly superior than separate compounds and the compounds nanoparticle encapsulation was required for effective tumor control . The mechanistic studies confirmed strong induction of circulating cancer specific T cells upon combined treatment in blood. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment revealed a significant increase of infiltrating leukocytes upon treatment.  The multi-drug loaded nanoparticles mediated delivery of chemoimmunotherapy exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy gain on two treatment resistant cancer models and is a potent candidate strategy to improve cancer therapy of solid tumors resistant to first-line therapies.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485715>Sialic -binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) detect self-associated molecular patterns to regulate immune responses.</a></h1><p>The mammalian immune system evolved to tightly regulate the elimination of pathogenic microbes and neoplastic transformed cells while tolerating our own healthy cells.

Alternatively, the cell-free artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) have been rapidly developed. Nanoscale aAPCs are recently proposed owing to their superior biodistribution and reduced embolism than conventional cell-sized aAPCs, but pose the challenges: easier cellular uptake and smaller contact surface area with T cells than the cell-sized counterparts. This study aimed to fabricate a new "stealth" nano-aAPCs with microscale contact surface area to minimize cellular uptake and activate antigen-specific T cells by combination uses of ellipsoidal stretch, PEGylation, and self-marker CD47-Fc conjugation.The spherical polylactic-co-glycolic  nanoparticles were fabricated using a double-emulsion method, and then stretched twofold using film-stretching procedure followed by PEGylation and co-coupling with CD47-Fc, H-2K/TRP2-Ig dimers, and anti-CD28. The resulting PEGylated and CD47-conjugated nanoellipsoidal aAPCs (EaAPC) were co-cultured with macrophages or spleen lymphocytes and also infused into melanoma-bearing mice. The in vitro and in vivo effects were evaluated and compared with the nanospherical aAPCs (SaAPC), nanoellipsoidal aAPCs (EaAPC), or PEGylated nanoellipsoidal aAPC (EaAPC).EaAPC markedly reduced cellular uptake in vitro and in vivo, as compared with EaAPC, EaAPC, SaAPC, and Blank-NPs and expanded naïve TRP2-specific CD8 T cells in the co-cultures with spleen lymphocytes. After three infusions, the EaAPC showed much stronger effects on facilitating TRP2-specific CD8 T-cell proliferation, local infiltration, and tumor necrosis in the melanoma-bearing mice and on inhibiting tumor growth than the control aAPCs.The superimposed or synergistic effects of ellipsoidal stretch, PEGylation, and CD47-Fc conjugation minimized cellular uptake of nano-aAPCs and enhanced their functionality to expand antigen-specific T cells and inhibit tumor growth, thus suggesting a more valuable strategy to design "stealth" nanoscale aAPCs suitable for tumor active .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241068>Imaging analysis of EGFR mutated cancer cells using peptide nucleic  (PNA)-DNA probes.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer cells harbor various gene mutations in the mRNA sequence of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), especially the mutations of exon19del E746-A750, T790M, and L858R. This results in cancer progression and resistance to anticancer drugs (tyrosine kinase inhibitor; TKI). Therefore, the imaging analysis of EGFR mutations is required for the treatment planning for non-small cell lung cancers. This study focused on the imaging analysis of a single nucleotide substitute in EGFR mutated cancer cells. We developed three novel peptide nucleic  (PNA)-DNA probes for recognizing and detecting the following three gene mutations in EGFR gene mutations. The PNA-DNA probes consist of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated PNA as a detection probe and Dabcyl conjugated DNA as a quencher probe. The PNA-DNA probes were used to validate the feasibility for detecting three EGFR mutated sequences: exon19del E746-A750, T790M, and L858R. The three probes emitted fluorescent dose-dependent signals against three target DNA and RNA. Using the three PNA-DNA probes, we succeeded in distinguishing three kinds of lung-cancer cell lines (H1975, PC-9, and A549) which have different EGFR mutations by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302192>A Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist ARNAX for therapeutic .</a></h1><p>Vaccine  consisting of tumor antigens combined with an immune-enhancing adjuvant fosters cytotoxic T cell (CTL) proliferation. Clinically, polyI:C has been used as an adjuvant to enhance cancer vaccine protocols. However, according to its long history, polyI:C promotes inflammation that causes cytokine toxicity. Although checkpoint inhibitor  has improved the prognoses of patients with progressive cancer, over 75% of patients continue to experience resistance to antibody (Ab) against anti-programmed cell death-protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, PD-L1 therapy. In most cases, patients suffer from adverse events resulting from inflammation during anti-PD-1/L1 Ab therapy, which is a serious obstacle to patients' quality of life. We have studied the functional properties of double-stranded (ds)RNA and polyI:C, and developed a nucleic  adjuvant that barely induces a significant increase in the level of serum inflammatory cytokines in mouse models. This adjuvant, termed ARNAX, consists of DNA-capped dsRNA that specifies the endosomal target for Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in dendritic cells (DCs). We expect that this adjuvant is safe for administration in elderly patients with cancer receiving . Here, we summarize the properties of ARNAX for  in mice. We suggest that DC-priming is essential to induce anti-tumor immunity; neither exogenous inflammation nor the administration of tumor antigens is always a prerequisite for DC-mediated CTL proliferation. If our mouse data can be extrapolated to humans, ARNAX and the liberated endogenous tumor antigens may facilitate effect of current therapies on patients with therapy-resistant tumors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

MDSCs undergo metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to fatty  oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation led by lipid accumulation in tumor. Increased exogenous fatty  uptake by tumor MDSCs enhance their immunosuppressive activity on T-cells thus promoting tumor progression. Tumor-infiltrating MDSCs in mice may prefer FAO over glycolysis as a primary source of energy while treatment with FAO inhibitors improved anti-tumor immunity. This review highlights the immunosuppressive functions of lipid metabolism and its signaling pathways on MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment. The manipulation of these pathways in MDSCs is relevant to understand the tumor microenvironment therefore, could provide novel therapeutic approaches to enhance cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114761>Herpes Simplex Virus Evasion of Early Host Antiviral Responses.</a></h1><p>Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) have co-evolved with humans for thousands of years and are present at a high prevalence in the population worldwide. HSV infections are responsible for several illnesses including skin and mucosal lesions, blindness and even life-threatening encephalitis in both, immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals of all ages. Therefore, diseases caused by HSVs represent significant public health burdens. Similar to other herpesviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2 produce lifelong infections in the host by establishing latency in neurons and sporadically reactivating from these cells, eliciting recurrences that are accompanied by viral shedding in both, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The ability of HSVs to persist and recur in otherwise healthy individuals is likely given by the numerous virulence factors that these viruses have evolved to evade host antiviral responses. Here, we review and discuss molecular mechanisms used by HSVs to evade early innate antiviral responses, which are the first lines of defense against these viruses. A comprehensive understanding of how HSVs evade host early antiviral responses could contribute to the development of novel therapies and vaccines to counteract these viruses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121269>OmpW expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus casei elicits protective immunity against Aeromonas veronii in common carp.</a></h1><p>Aeromonas veronii is an opportunistic pathogen that is capable of infecting both aquatic livestock and mammals. Natural infection in fishes results in irreparable damage to the aquaculture industry. In this study, we sought to investigate whether recombinant Lactobacillus casei expressing the outer membrane protein W (OmpW) of A.veronii could elicit protective immunity against A.veronii infections. We generated two recombinant Lactobacillus casei (L.casei) strains expressing the OmpW of A.veronii (surface-displayed or secreted) and evaluated the effect on immune responses in a fish model. A 600-bp gene fragment was subcloned into the L.casei expression plasmids pPG-1 (surface-displayed) and pPG-2 (secreted). Expression of the recombinant OmpW protein was also confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Common carp immunized with Lc-pPG-1- OmpW and Lc-pPG-2- OmpW via oral administration elicited high serum specific antibody titers and high LZM, ACP, and SOD activities. High levels of the IL-10, IL-β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α genes in different organs indicated that the inflammatory response and cell immune response were triggered. Additionally, when immunized fish were challenged with A.veronii, Lc-pPG1-OmpW and Lc-pPG2-OmpW demonstrated 40% and 50% protective efficacy. These data indicate that the combination of OmpW delivery and the lactic  bacteria (LAB) approach may be a promising mucosal therapeutic strategy for treatment of A.veronii.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The agonists and inhibitors of RORγt are potential agents for tumor  and autoimmune diseases, respectively, and sometimes share similar scaffolds. Although the widely distributed triterpenoid ursolic  (UA) has been identified as a RORγt inhibitor, the report of a triterpenoid RORγt agonist is still absent. By screening an in-house triterpenoid library, we uncovered a novel RORγt agonist, betulinaldehyde (1), together with an inhibitor (2, 3β, 28-Dihydroxy-lupan-29-oic ). Compound 1 showed a good RORγt activating effect with the EC of 11.4 μM in Alpha Screen assay, and altered the thermal stability of RORγt by directly binding to the protein in vitro. Combined with the SPR assay, the Kd value of compound 1 was examined as 2.99 μM. The modulation mechanism of triterpenoid agonists and inhibitors were discussed by molecular docking. Herein, we firstly discovered compound 1 as a triterpenoid agonist of RORγt. The co-distribution of triterpenoid RORγt agonist and inhibitors in the same plant, might be related to the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous bioactivity of the plant extract.Copyright © 2019.

For example, DNA-based tension probes have revealed roles for mechanics in platelet, B cell, T cell, and fibroblast function. Nonetheless, imaging short-lived forces transmitted by low-abundance receptors remains a challenge. This is a particular problem for mechanoimmunology where ligand-receptor bindings are short lived, and a few antigens are sufficient for cell triggering. Herein, we present a mechanoselection strategy that uses locking oligonucleotides to preferentially and irreversibly bind DNA probes that are mechanically strained over probes at rest. Thus, infrequent and short-lived mechanical events are tagged. This strategy allows for integration and storage of mechanical information into a map of molecular tension history. Upon addition of unlocking oligonucleotides that drive toehold-mediated strand displacement, the probes reset to the real-time state, thereby erasing stored mechanical information. As a proof of concept, we applied this strategy to study OT-1 T cells, revealing that the T cell receptor (TCR) mechanically samples antigens carrying single amino  mutations. Such events are not detectable using conventional tension probes. Each mutant peptide ligand displayed a different level of mechanical sampling and spatial scanning by the TCR that strongly correlated with its functional potency. Finally, we show evidence that T cells transmit pN forces through the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD1), a major target in cancer . We anticipate that mechanical information storage will be broadly useful in studying the mechanobiology of the immune system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129755>AMPK activation inhibits the functions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC): impact on cancer and aging.</a></h1><p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a crucial role not only in the regulation of tissue energy metabolism but it can also control immune responses through its cooperation with immune signaling pathways, thus affecting immunometabolism and the functions of immune cells. It is known that AMPK signaling inhibits the activity of the NF-κB system and thus suppresses pro-inflammatory responses. Interestingly, AMPK activation can inhibit several major immune signaling pathways, e.g., the JAK-STAT, NF-κB, C/EBPβ, CHOP, and HIF-1α pathways, which induce the expansion and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). MDSCs induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumors and thus allow the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance. Chronic inflammation has a key role in the expansion and activation of MDSCs in both tumors and inflammatory disorders. The numbers of MDSCs also significantly increase during the aging process concurrently with the immunosenescence associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Increased fatty  oxidation and lactate produced by aerobic glycolysis are important immunometabolic enhancers of MDSC functions. However, it seems that AMPK signaling regulates the functions of MDSCs in a context-dependent manner. Currently, the activators of AMPK signaling are promising drug candidates for cancer therapy and possibly for the extension of healthspan and lifespan. We will describe in detail the AMPK-mediated regulation of the signaling pathways controlling the expansion and activation of immunosuppressive MDSCs. We will propose that the beneficial effects mediated by AMPK activation, e.g., in cancers and the aging process, could be induced by the inhibition of MDSC functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138102>Capturing the differences between humoral immunity in the normal and tumor environments from repertoire-seq of B-cell receptors using supervised machine learning.</a></h1><p>The recent success of  in treating tumors has attracted increasing interest in research related to the adaptive immune system in the tumor microenvironment. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology enabled the sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulins (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissues have high affinities for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of their amino  sequences and other sequence-independent features such as the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) may differ between the normal and tumor microenvironments. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rarity of recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCR/Ig sequences than in TCR sequences. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of discriminating BCRs/Igs in tumor and in normal tissues, by capturing these differences using supervised machine learning methods applied to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs.RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs were obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens from 90 gastric cancer patients. BCR/Ig-features obtained in Rep-Seq were used to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. Different machine learning models using various features were constructed as well as gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier combining these models. The results demonstrated that BCR/Ig sequences between normal and tumor microenvironments exhibit their differences. Next, by using a GBM trained to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences, we tried to classify sets of BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. As a result, an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.826 was achieved, suggesting that BCR/Ig repertoires have distinct sequence-level features in normal and tumor tissues.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that BCR/Ig sequences derived from tumor and normal tissues have globally distinct patterns, and that these tissues can be effectively differentiated using BCR/Ig repertoires.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332640>Dissolvable Microneedle-Mediated Transcutaneous Delivery of Tetanus Toxoid Elicits Effective Immune Response.</a></h1><p>Transcutaneous immunization using a microneedle device presents a promising alternative to syringe-based injection of vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate the effective immune response elicited after application of tetanus toxoid antigen-loaded dissolvable microneedles (TT-MN) in mice model. Dissolvable microneedles were prepared using 20% w/v of polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymer mixture by micromolding technique. TT-MN were prepared by addition of tetanus toxoid to polymer mixture before casting microneedles. TT-MN were characterized using texture analyzer, stereomicroscope, and scanning electron microscope. Tetanus toxoid loading was found to be 77 ± 2 μg per microneedle array. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that the microneedles penetrated to a depth of 130 μm inside mouse skin. Complete dissolution of microneedles was achieved within 1 h after insertion in skin. Immunization studies in Swiss albino mice demonstrated significantly (p < 0.001) greater IgG, IgG, and IgG antibody titers for TT-MN and intramuscular injection groups compared with naïve control. Splenocyte proliferation assay confirmed effective re-stimulation on exposure to tetanus toxoid in microneedle treatment groups.

Contrarily, GPC3 is specifically expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ovarian clear cell carcinoma, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, hepatoblastoma, nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor), yolk sac tumor, and some pediatric cancers. Although the precise function of GPC3 remains unclear, it has been strongly suggested that it is related to the malignant transformation of HCC. We identified GPC3 as a promising target for cancer  and have been working on the development of cancer immunotherapeutic agents targeting it through clinical trials. In some trials, it was revealed that the GPC3 peptide vaccines we developed using human leukocyte antigen-A24- and A2-restricted GPC3-derived peptides could induce GPC3-specific cytotoxic T cells in most vaccinated patients and thereby improve their prognosis. To further improve the clinical efficacy of cancer  targeting GPC3, we are also developing next-generation therapeutic strategies using T cells engineered to express antigen-specific T-cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor. In addition, we have successfully monitored the levels of serum full-length GPC3 protein, which is somehow secreted in the blood.

These vaccines induce and activate proliferation of TAA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), suppressing tumor growth. The therapeutic efficacy of TAA-specific CTLs depends on the properties of tumor microenvironment. The environments make immunosuppressive by function of regulatory T cells and tumor-associated myeloid cells; thus, regulation of these cells is important for successful cancer . We report here that L-ergothioneine (EGT) with the adjuvant Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligand modulated suppressive microenvironments to be immune-enhancing. EGT did not augment DC-mediated CTL priming or affect CTL activation in draining lymph node and spleen. However, EGT decreased the immuno-suppressive function of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TLR2 stimulation accompanied with EGT administration downregulated expression of PD-L1, CSF-1R, arginase-1, FAS ligand, and TRAIL in TAMs, reflecting reduction of CTL suppression. An anti-oxidative thiol-thione residue of EGT was essential to dampening CTL suppression. The effect was specific to the thiol-thione residue of EGT because no effect was observed with another anti-oxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). A CTL-suppressive environment made by TLR2 is relieved to be improved by the addition of EGT, which may ameliorate the efficacy of vaccine .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547654>Microfluidic-Based Immunomodulation of Immune Cells Using Upconversion Nanoparticles in Simulated Blood Vessel-Tumor System.</a></h1><p>The goal of cancer  is the selective killing of malignant cells by the cooperated efforts of immune cells at the primary and secondary sites.

The effectiveness of the nanoparticles in targeting dendritic cells and T cells to the tumor compartment was tested in a vasculature-tumor interface model constructed from the co-culture of endothelial cells and ovarian cancer cells, in different interconnected channels in a microfluidic device. In comparison to the unconjugated nanoparticles, the folic -conjugated nanoparticles efficiently diffuse across the engineered blood vessel and specifically target the folate receptor-expressing ovarian cancer cells.

Mammalian DGKs distribute into five subfamilies that regulate local availability of DAG and PA pools in a tissue- and subcellular-restricted manner. Pharmacological manipulation of DGK activity holds great promise, given the critical contribution of specific DGK subtypes to the control of membrane structure, signaling complexes, and cell-cell communication. The latest advances in the DGK field have unveiled the differential contribution of selected isoforms to human disease. Defects in the expression/activity of individual DGK isoforms contribute substantially to cognitive impairment, mental disorders, insulin resistance, and vascular pathologies. Abnormal DGK overexpression, on the other hand, confers the acquisition of malignant traits including invasion, chemotherapy resistance, and inhibition of immune attack on tumors. Translation of these findings into therapeutic approaches will require development of methods to pharmacologically modulate DGK functions.

Few other mammals do not synthetize Neu5Gc, however livestock species used for food production and as a source of biological materials for medical applications carry Neu5Gc. Trace amounts of Neu5Gc are up taken through the diet and incorporated into various tissues including epithelia and endothelia cells. Humans carry "natural," diet-induced Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies and when undertaking medical treatments or receiving transplants or devices that contain animal derived products they can cause immunological reaction affecting pharmacology, immune tolerance, and severe side effect like serum sickness disease (SSD). Neu5Gc null mice have been the main experimental model to study such phenotype. With the recent advances in genome editing, pigs and cattle KO for Neu5Gc have been generated always in association with the αGal KO. These large animals are normal and fertile and provide additional experimental models to study such mutation. Moreover, they will be the base for the development of new therapeutic applications like polyclonal IgG , Bioprosthetic Heart Valves, cells and tissues replacement.Copyright © 2019 Perota and Galli.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646082>A poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine synergizes with PD-1 blockade to induce T cell-mediated tumor control.</a></h1><p>The combination of immune-stimulating strategies has the potency to improve  of cancer. Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T cell immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino  stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T cell responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors.© 2019 The Author(s).

Current treatment options are associated with significant side effects including therapy with immune check point inhibitors (ICI). ICI therapy induced side effects are due to excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). At the same time, production of appropriate amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α are needed to eliminate tumor cells. Hence, methods are needed that can selectively eliminate tumor cells and tone down the side effects of cytokine storm. Studies showed that IL-6 and TNF-α activate phospholipases to induce the release of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) from the cell membrane phospholipid pool. PUFAs form precursors to pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and are capable of suppressing IL-6 and TNF-α excess production. PUFAs are endowed with capacity to selectively kill tumor cells by augmenting free radical generation and accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides in tumor but not normal cells. NK cells, TILs (tumor infiltrating cells) and γδ T cells release toxic granules (also called as cytolytic granules) that contain unsaturated fatty  localized between the granule delimiting membrane and the granule core. Thus, lipids are a universal component of cytolytic granules and play an important role in their cytotoxic actions. Based on this evidence, it is suggested that a combination of ICI/TILs and PUFAs may form a novel method of eliminating cancer with few side effects.Copyright © 2019 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Longitudinal data from large cohorts of children at risk of T1D are nor solidifying our understanding of the function of the microbiota in this disease.Although taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota associated with T1D are relatively modest, a functional defect in production of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) remains as a unifying feature across multiple studies and populations. Dysbiosis of the microbiota in T1D has been linked to decreased gut barrier and exocrine pancreas function. We explore factors contributing to the disturbed microbiota in T1D such as infant diet, probiotic use and genetic risk linked to defective immune regulation.

Herein, we provide evidence that the immunosuppressive phenotype of TAMs is controlled by long-chain fatty  metabolism, specifically unsaturated fatty , here exemplified by oleate. Consequently, en-route enriched lipid droplets were identified as essential organelles, which represent effective targets for chemical inhibitors to block in vitro polarization of TAMs and tumor growth in vivo. In line, analysis of human tumors revealed that myeloid cells infiltrating colon cancer but not gastric cancer tissue indeed accumulate lipid droplets. Mechanistically, our data indicate that oleate-induced polarization of myeloid cells depends on the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway.

One of the organs significantly affected by age is the gut. Age-dependent changes of the gut-associated microbiome have been linked to increased frailty and systemic inflammation. This change in microbial composition with age occurs in parallel with a decline in function of the gut immune system; however, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the two. Here we report that the defective germinal centre reaction in Peyer's patches of aged mice can be rescued by faecal transfers from younger adults into aged mice and by immunisations with cholera toxin, without affecting germinal centre reactions in peripheral lymph nodes. This demonstrates that the poor germinal centre reaction in aged animals is not irreversible, and that it is possible to improve this response in older individuals by providing appropriate stimuli.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173832>Effect of Bacillus sp.

DU-106 was introduced to ferment Dendrobium officinale (D. officinale) polysaccharides, and the effects of such process on the structure and immunostimulatory activity of D. officinale polysaccharide were investigated. Three polysaccharides were subsequently purified from unfermented D. officinale stem (UDP-1), fermented D. officinale stem (FDP-1), and polysaccharide in fermented liquid (FLP-1).

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) convert myofibroblast CAFs to a quiescent state, but whether ARBs can reprogram CAFs to promote T lymphocyte activity and enhance  is unknown. Moreover, ARB doses are limited by systemic adverse effects such as hypotension due to the importance of angiotensin signaling outside tumors. To enhance the efficacy and specificity of ARBs in cancer with the goal of revealing their effects on antitumor immunity, we developed ARB nanoconjugates that preferentially accumulate and act in tumors. We created a diverse library of hundreds of -degradable polymers and chemically linked ARBs to the polymer most sensitive to tumor pH. These tumor microenvironment-activated ARBs (TMA-ARBs) remain intact and inactive in circulation while achieving high concentrations in tumors, wherein they break down to active ARBs. This tumor-preferential activity enhances the CAF-reprogramming effects of ARBs while eliminating blood pressure-lowering effects.

Recently, nanomaterial-based immunotherapies are developed to precisely control in vivo immune activation in tumor tissues for reducing immune-related adverse events. However, little consideration has been put on the spatial modulation of interactions between immune cells and cancer cells to optimize the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Herein, a rational design of immunomodulating nanoparticles is demonstrated that can in situ modify the tumor cell surface with natural killer cell (NK cell)-activating signals to achieve in situ activation of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, as well as direction of their antitumor immunity toward tumor cells. Using these immunomodulating nanoparticles, the remarkable inhibition of tumor growth is observed in mice without noticeable side effects. This study provides an accurate immunomodulation strategy that achieves safe and effective antitumor immunity through in situ NK cell activation in tumors.

Many patients traditionally presented with aberrant behavior, especially of acute or subacute onset, and treated with anti-psychotic therapies, turn out to have a CNS autoimmune disease with pathogenic autoantibodies against synaptic antigens responding to immunotherapies. The review describes the clinical spectrum of these disorders, and the pathogenetic role of key autoantibodies directed against: a) cell surface synaptic antigens and receptors, including NMDAR, GABAa, GABAb, AMPA and glycine receptors; b) channels such as AQP4 water-permeable channel or voltage-gated potassium channels; c) proteins that stabilize voltage-gated potassium channel complex into the membrane, like the LGI1 and CASPR2; and d) enzymes that catalyze the formation of neurotransmitters such as Glutamic  Decarboxylase (GAD). These antibodies, effectively target excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the limbic system, basal ganglia or brainstem altering synaptic function and resulting in uncontrolled neurological excitability disorder clinically manifested with psychosis, agitation, behavioral alterations, depression, sleep disturbances, seizure-like phenomena, movement disorders such as ataxia, chorea and dystonia, memory changes or coma. Some of the identified triggering factors include: viruses, especially herpes simplex, accounting for the majority of relapses occurring after viral encephalitis, which respond to  rather than antiviral agents; tumors especially teratoma, SCLC and thymomas; and biological cancer therapies (immune-check-point inhibitors). As anti-synaptic antibodies persist after viral infections or tumor removal, augmentation of autoreactive B cells which release autoantigens to draining lymph nodes, molecular mimicry and infection-induced bystander immune activation products play a role in autoimmunization process or perpetuating autoimmune neuroinflammation. The review stresses the importance of early detection, clinical recognition, proper antibody testing and early therapy initiation as these disorders, regardless of a known or not trigger, are potentially treatable responding to systemic  with intravenous steroids, IVIg, rituximab or even bortezomid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Pre-durvalumab blood glucose was normal. The patient responded to treatment with intravenous fluids, insulin and electrolyte replacement. Simultaneously, he presented a thyroid hormone pattern that evolved in 10 weeks from subclinical hyperthyroidism (initially attributed to iodinated contrast used in a previous computerised tomography) to overt hyperthyroidism and then to severe primary hypothyroidism (TSH: 34.40 µU/mL, free thyroxine (FT4): <0.23 ng/dL and free tri-iodothyronine (FT3): 0.57 pg/mL).

The development of bioinformatics technology has accelerated the identification of neoantigens. The combination of different algorithms to identify and predict the affinity of neoantigens to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) or the immunogenicity of neoantigens is mainly based on the whole-exome sequencing technology. Tumor vaccines targeting neoantigens mainly include nucleic , dendritic cell (DC)-based, tumor cell, and synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines. The combination with immune checkpoint inhibition therapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy might achieve better therapeutic effects. Currently, several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these vaccines.

Because the transgenic rice (TG-rice) seeds express allergens containing whole amino  sequences of Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 in the endosperm tissue (edible part of rice grain), they can potentially target all Cry j 1- and Cry j 2-specific T-cells. However, it was unknown whether antigenicity of Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 could be completely preserved in TG-rice seeds. We verified the antigenicity of TG-rice seeds to T-cells through the analysis of the proliferative responses of T-cells in Cry j 1- or Cry j 2-immunized mice or T-cell lines to TG-rice seed extract. First, four mouse strains were immunized with Cry j 1 or Cry j 2. T-cells in the immunized mice proliferated on treatment with TG-rice seed extract, but not non-transgenic wild-type rice (WT-rice) seed extract. Furthermore, T-cell lines were established from the spleen cells of the immunized mice. Each T-cell line resulted in a proliferative response to TG-rice seed extract, but not to WT-rice seed extract, suggesting that TG-rice seeds certainly express T-cell epitopes corresponding to T-cell lines. Considering the modified amino  sequences of Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 in TG-rice seeds, the expression of specific T-cell epitopes suggested that TG-rice seeds express all possible T-cell epitope repertoires of Cry j 1 and Cry j 2.© 2019 The Authors.

Emerging evidence supports the role of gut microbiota in mediating the interaction between the host and environment by extracting energy from food otherwise indigestible by the host and producing metabolites and cytokines that affect host metabolism. Furthermore, gut microbial imbalance or dysbiosis has been shown in metabolic diseases including obesity, and recent studies are beginning to unravel the mechanisms involved. The gut microbiota affects host metabolism and obesity through several pathways involving gut barrier integrity, production of metabolites affecting satiety and insulin resistance, epigenetic factors, and metabolism of bile  and subsequent changes in metabolic signaling.

We previously identified a nephritogenic epitope, P14 (3), that could induce crescentic nephritis in WKY rats, and defined its core motif. Designing a modified peptide, replacing critical pathogenic residues with nonpathogenic ones (on the basis of homologous regions in 1NC1 chain of type IV collagen, known to be nonpathogenic), might provide a therapeutic option for anti-GBM GN.We synthesized a modified peptide, replacing a single amino , and injected it into 3-P14-immunized rats from day 0 (the early-treatment group) or a later-treatment group (from days 17 to 21). A scrambled peptide administrated with the same protocol served as a control.The modified peptide, but not the scrambled peptide, attenuated anti-GBM GN in both treatment groups, and halted further crescent formation even after disease onset. Kidneys from the modified peptide-treated rats exhibited reductions in IgG deposits, complement activation, and infiltration by T cells and macrophages. Treatment also resulted in an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile versus a proinflammatory profile for animals not receiving the modified peptide; it also reduced 3-P14-specific T cell activation, modulated T cell differentiation by decreasing Th17 cells and enhancing the ratio of Treg/Th17 cells, and inhibited binding of 3-P14 to antibodies and MHC II molecules.A modified peptide involving alteration of a critical motif in a nephritogenic T cell epitope alleviated anti-GBM GN in a rat model.

Although extensive treatments for GBM, including resection, irradiation, chemotherapy and , have been tried, the prognosis is still poor. Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, is a front-line chemotherapeutic drug for the clinical treatment of GBM; however, its effects are very limited because of the chemoresistance. Valproic  (VPA), an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity, has been shown to have synergistic effects with TMZ against GBM. The mechanism of action of VPA on TMZ combination therapy is still unclear. Accumulating evidence has shown that secreted proteins are responsible for the cross talking among cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may play a critical role in the regulation of drug responses.To understand the effect of VPA on secreted proteins in GBM cells, we first used the antibody array to analyze the cell culture supernatant from VPA-treated and untreated GBM cells. The results were further confirmed by lentivirus-mediated knockdown and exogenous recombinant administration.Our results showed that amphiregulin (AR) was highly secreted in VPA-treated cells. Knockdown of AR can sensitize GBM cells to TMZ. Furthermore, pretreatment of exogenous recombinant AR significantly increased EGFR activation and conferred resistance to TMZ. To further verify the effect of AR on TMZ resistance, cells pre-treated with AR neutralizing antibody markedly increased sensitivity to TMZ. In addition, we also observed that the expression of AR was positively correlated with the resistance of TMZ in different GBM cell lines.The present study aimed to identify the secreted proteins that contribute to the modulation of drug response. Understanding the full set of secreted proteins present in glial cells might help reveal potential therapeutic opportunities.

Toward this goal, we compared the efficacy of the following HER2 DNA vaccine constructs: vaccines encoding wild-type HER2, hybrid HER2 vaccines consisting of human HER2 and rat Neu, HER2 vaccines with single residue substitutions and a novel human HER2 DNA vaccine, ph(es)E2TM. ph(es)E2TM was designed to contain five evolution-selected substitutions: M198V, Q398R, F425L, H473R and A622T that occur frequently in 12 primate HER2 sequences. These ph(es)E2TM substitutions score 0 to 1 in blocks substitutions matrix (BLOSUM), indicating minimal biochemical alterations. h(es)E2TM recombinant protein is recognized by a panel of anti-HER2 mAbs, demonstrating the preservation of HER2 protein structure. Compared to native human HER2, electrovaccination of HER2 transgenic mice with ph(es)E2TM induced a threefold increase in HER2-binding antibody (Ab) and elevated levels of IFNγ-producing T cells. ph(es)E2TM, but not pE2TM immune serum, recognized HER2 peptide p95 LPESFDGDPASNTAP, suggesting a broadening of epitope recognition induced by the minimally modified HER2 vaccine. ph(es)E2TM vaccination reduced tumor growth more effectively than wild-type HER2 or HER2 vaccines with more extensive modifications. The elevation of tumor immunity by ph(es)E2TM vaccination would create a favorable tumor microenvironment for neoantigen priming, further enhancing the protective immunity. The fundamental principle of exploiting evolution-selected amino  substitutions is novel, effective and applicable to vaccine development in general.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311765>Folic : A New Weapon for Mucositis?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292444>Quantitative characterization of 3D bioprinted structural elements under cell generated forces.</a></h1><p>With improving biofabrication technology, 3D bioprinted constructs increasingly resemble real tissues. However, the fundamental principles describing how cell-generated forces within these constructs drive deformations, mechanical instabilities, and structural failures have not been established, even for basic biofabricated building blocks. Here we investigate mechanical behaviours of 3D printed microbeams made from living cells and extracellular matrix, bioprinting these simple structural elements into a 3D culture medium made from packed microgels, creating a mechanically controlled environment that allows the beams to evolve under cell-generated forces. By varying the properties of the beams and the surrounding microgel medium, we explore the mechanical behaviours exhibited by these structures. We observe buckling, axial contraction, failure, and total static stability, and we develop mechanical models of cell-ECM microbeam mechanics. We envision these models and their generalizations to other fundamental 3D shapes to facilitate the predictable design of biofabricated structures using simple building blocks in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606777>Increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and expression in prostate cancer following targeted .</a></h1><p>We previously found that PD-L1 expression is increased on tumor cells following vaccination treatments that lead to increased tumor-specific T cells that secrete IFNγ. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is another IFNγ inducible gene that has potent immunosuppressive effects. There have been reports of IDO expression in prostate cancer; however, it is unknown whether IDO expression might similarly increase in prostate tumors following T-cell-based .Blood samples from normal male blood donors (n = 12) and patients with different stages of prostate cancer (n = 89), including patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with a DNA vaccine and/or pembrolizumab, were evaluated for IDO activity by kynurenine and tryptophan levels. Metastatic tissue biopsies obtained pre- and post-treatments were evaluated for IDO expression. IDO suppression of vaccine-induced T-cell function was assessed by ELISPOT.Overall, IDO activity was increased in patients with more advanced prostate cancer. This activity, and IDO expression as detected immunohistochemically, increased following treatment with either a DNA vaccine encoding the prostatic  phosphatase (PAP) tumor antigen or PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab. Increased IDO activity after treatment was associated with the absence of clinical effect, as assessed by lack of PSA decline following treatment. Increased antigen-specific T-cell response, as measured by IFNγ release, to the vaccine target antigen was detected following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood cells with 1-methyltryptophan.These findings suggest that IDO expression is a mechanism of immune evasion used by prostate cancer and that future clinical trials using T-cell-based immune strategies might best include IDO inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437274>Imaging challenges of  and targeted therapy in patients with brain metastases: Response, Progression, and Pseudoprogression.</a></h1><p>The advent of  using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and targeted therapy (TT) has dramatically improved the prognosis of various cancer types. Following ICI therapy or TT, either alone (especially ICI) or in combination with radiotherapy, however, imaging findings on anatomical contrast-enhanced MRI can be unpredictable, highly variable, and are often difficult to interpret regarding treatment response and outcome. This review aims at summarizing the imaging challenges related to TT and ICI monotherapy as well as combined with radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases, and to give an overview on advanced imaging techniques which potentially overcome some of these imaging challenges. Currently, major evidence suggests that imaging parameters especially derived from amino  PET, perfusion-/diffusion-weighted MRI, or MR spectroscopy may provide valuable additional information for the differentiation of treatment-induced changes from brain metastases recurrence and the evaluation of treatment response.© The Author(s) 2019.

A critical challenge in using the ICD inducers in cancer  is the immunotoxicity accompanying their antiproliferative effects. To alleviate this, a nanocapsule formulation of carfilzomib (CFZ), an ICD-inducing proteasome inhibitor, was developed using interfacial supramolecular assembly of tannic  (TA) and iron, supplemented with albumin coating. The albumin-coated CFZ nanocapsules (CFZ-pTA-alb) attenuated CFZ release, reducing toxicity to immune cells. Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of the TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8 T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon-γ response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), supporting that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor immunity. This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100411>Nanoparticles for nucleic  delivery: Applications in cancer .</a></h1><p> has recently emerged as a powerful tool for cancer treatment.

In the present study, an oral powder formulation of pemetrexed (PMX) was developed to enhance intestinal membrane permeability and investigate its application in metronomic chemotherapy in combination with .PMX was ionically complexed with a bile  derivative (N-deoxycholyl-l-lysyl-methylester; DCK) as a permeation enhancer and mixed with dispersing agents, such as poloxamer 188 (P188) and Labrasol, to form an amorphous oral powder formulation of PMX/DCK (PMX/DCK-OP).The apparent permeability (P) of PMX/DCK-OP across a Caco-2 cell monolayer was 2.46- and 8.26-fold greater than that of PMX/DCK and free PMX, respectively, which may have been due to the specific interaction of DCK with bile  transporters, as well as the alteration of membrane fluidity due to Labrasol and P188. Furthermore, inhibition of bile  transporters by actinomycin D in Caco-2 cell monolayers decreased the P of PMX/DCK-OP by 75.4%, suggesting a predominant role of bile  transporters in the intestinal absorption of PMX/DCK-OP. In addition, caveola/lipid raft-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, passive diffusion, and paracellular transport mechanisms significantly influenced the permeation of PMX/DCK-OP through the intestinal membrane. Therefore, the oral bioavailability of PMX/DCK-OP in rats was 19.8%±6.93%, which was 294% higher than that of oral PMX. Moreover, an in vivo anticancer efficacy study in B16F10 cell-bearing mice treated with a combination of oral PMX/DCK-OP and intraperitoneal anti-PD1 exhibited significant suppression of tumor growth, and the tumor volume was maximally inhibited by 2.03- and 3.16-fold compared to the oral PMX/DCK-OP and control groups, respectively.These findings indicated the therapeutic potential of a combination of low-dose oral chemotherapy and  for synergistic anticancer efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090764>Recent progress in nanomaterials for nucleic  delivery in cancer .</a></h1><p>The combination of gene therapy and  has the potential to systemically promote anti-tumor effects while reducing adverse reactions.

Poly lactic-co-glycolic  is one of the best-known polymers used for encapsulating antigen to protect them against proteolytic enzymes. In this study, poly lactic-co-glycolic  nanoparticles (NPs) were used as DC antigen delivery vehicles in a preclinical model of  of gastric cancer. The DCs were generated from peripheral blood monocytes by conventional in vitro differentiation and loaded with either soluble tumor lysate or lysate encapsulated in NPs using a double emulsion/solvent evaporation technique. Morphology of NPs was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Tumor lysate, either in the soluble form or encapsulated in NPs, was loaded into DC and stimulatory capacity was compared using patient-derived autologous CD3+ T cells as responders. The amount of relevant cytokines produced by Ag-loaded DC and in DC/T cell cocultures was evaluated as a measure of initial DC stimulation and T-cell responses, respectively. Significance increases in expression of DC surface molecules (i.e., CD80, CD83, CD86, and Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR)) and cytokine production by both DC and DC/T cell cocultures (i.e., interleukin (IL)-12:IL-10 and interferon [IFN]-γ:IL-4 ratios) was observed following loading with lysate NP versus controls. The results suggest that NP-encapsulated antigen can shift antitumor T-cell responses toward a Th1 bias, which potentially increases DC vaccine potency in clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333665>Anti-Aβ Antibodies and Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Complications.</a></h1><p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) corresponds to the deposition of amyloid material in the cerebral vasculature, leading to structural modifications of blood vessel walls. The most frequent form of sporadic CAA involves fibrillar β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) deposits, mainly the 40 amino  form (Aβ), which are commonly found in the elderly with or without Alzheimer's disease. Sporadic CAA usually remains clinically silent. However, in some cases, acute complications either hemorrhagic or inflammatory can occur. Similar complications occurred after active or passive immunization against Aβ in experimental animal models exhibiting CAA, and in subjects with Alzheimer's disease during clinical trials. The triggering of these adverse events by active immunization and monoclonal antibody administration in CAA-bearing individuals suggests that analogous mechanisms could be involved during spontaneous CAA complications, drawing particular attention to the role of anti-Aβ antibodies. However, antibodies that react with several monomeric and aggregated forms of Aβ spontaneously occur in virtually all human individuals, hence being part of the "natural antibody" repertoire. Natural antibodies are usually described as having low-affinity and high cross-reactivity toward microbial components and autoantigens. Although frequently of the IgM class, they also belong to IgG and IgA isotypes. They likely display homeostatic functions and protective roles in aging. Until recently, the peculiar properties of these natural antibodies have hindered proper analysis of the Aβ-reactive antibody repertoire and the study of their implication in CAA complications. Herein, we review and comment the evidences of an auto-immune nature of spontaneous CAA complications, and discuss implications for forthcoming research and clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639342>Soft Matter DNA Nanoparticles Hybridized with CpG Motifs and Peptide Nucleic  Enable Immunological Treatment of Cancer.</a></h1><p>Nucleic  have been used as building blocks to assemble nanostructures by their sequence specific self-recognition properties, and resulting DNA architectures were applied as potential multifunctional drug carriers.

However, systemic administration of R848 often results in strong immune-related toxicities while having limited therapeutic effects to the tumor. In the present study, a prodrug-based nanocarrier delivery system was developed that exhibited high therapeutic efficiency. R848 was conjugated to α-tocopherol to constitute an R848-Toco prodrug, followed by formulating with a tocopherol-modified hyaluronic  (HA-Toco) as a polymeric nano-suspension. In vitro evaluation showed that the delivery system prolonged the release kinetics while maintaining TLR agonist activities. When administered subcutaneously, the nano-suspension formed a depot at the injection site, inducing localized immune responses without systemic expansion. This formulation also suppressed tumor growth and recruited immune cells to the tumor in a murine model of head and neck cancer. In a preclinical canine study of spontaneous mast cell tumors, the treatment led to a 67% response rate (three partial remissions and one complete remission).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The EVR group received reduced cyclosporin A and EVR. The standard protocol (STD) group received standard cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil. Both groups received basiliximab and steroids. De novo DSA was identified using LABScreen single antigen beads (One Lambda, Canoga Park, Calif., United States). Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values > 1000 were considered positive. P < .05 was considered significant.Graft survival was 100% in the EVR group and 90.9% in the STD group. All patients remained on the primary protocol in the EVR group, but 3 patients in the STD group (27.3%) were converted to tacrolimus due to DSA and non-adherence. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was similar in both groups. No EVR group recipients and 9.1% of STD group recipients were treated for T-cell-mediated rejection. No recipients of the EVR group exhibited peritubular capillaritis, while 9.1% in STD group developed chronic active antibody-mediated rejection. LABScreen revealed an accumulative class II DSA production rate of 15.4% in the EVR group and 18.3% in the STD group at 10 years. When the MFI cut-off level was set to 6000, anti-HLA antibody and de novo DSA-free survival was significantly better in the EVR group.EVR-based immunosuppression provided equivalent or even better clinical outcomes. EVR suppressed de novo DSA production at 10 years follow-up; however, further follow-up is inevitable.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Analyte-specific calibration is required for quantitative microdialysis, but these calibration methods are tedious, require significant technical skill, and often cannot be performed jointly with the experimental measurements. Here, we describe a method using retrodialysis with stable-isotope-labeled analytes that enables simultaneous calibration and quantification for in vivo tumor microdialysis. Isotope-labeled amino  relevant to immuno-metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (tryptophan, kynurenine, glutamine, and glutamate) were added to the microdialysis perfusate, and microdialysis probes were inserted in subcutaneous CT26 and MC38 tumors in mice. The levels of both the endogenous and isotope-labeled amino  in the perfusate outlet were quantified using LC-MS/MS. Plasma and tumor tissue samples were also collected from the same mice and amino  levels quantified using LC-MS/MS. Amino  which showed statistically significant differences between the CT26-bearing and MC38-bearing mice in tumor lysate (tryptophan, kynurenine, and glutamine) and plasma (glutamate) were not the same as those identified as significantly different in tumor interstitial fluid (kynurenine and glutamate), underscoring how microdialysis can provide unique and complementary insights into tumor and immune metabolism within the tumor microenvironment.Copyright © 2019 American Pharmacists Association®.

The ability of antitumor mAbs to elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) contributes to a large extent to their therapeutic efficacy. Many efforts accordingly aim to improve this important function by engineering mAbs with Fc parts that display enhanced affinity to the Fc receptor CD16 expressed, e.g., on natural killer (NK) cells. Here we characterized the CD133 mAb 293C3-SDIE that contains an engineered Fc part modified by the amino  exchanges S239D/I332E-that reportedly increase the affinity to CD16-with regard to its ability to induce NK reactivity against colorectal cancer (CRC). 293C3-SDIE was found to be a stable protein with favorable binding characteristics achieving saturating binding to CRC cells at concentrations of approximately 1 µg/mL. While not directly affecting CRC cell growth and viability, 293C3-SDIE potently induced NK cell activation, degranulation, secretion of Interferon-γ, as well as ADCC resulting in potent lysis of CRC cell lines. Based on the preclinical characterization presented in this study and the available data indicating that CD133 is broadly expressed in CRC and represents a negative prognostic marker, we conclude that 293C3-SDIE constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of CRC and thus warrants clinical evaluation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447221>Bile  metabolism and T cell responses in cholangiopathy: Not one-way traffic.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028439>Antigenic epitopes on the outer membrane protein A of Escherichia coli identified with single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies.</a></h1><p>Bacterial meningitis is a severe disease that is fatal to one-third of patients. The major cause of meningitis in neonates is Escherichia coli (E. coli) K1. This bacterium synthesizes an outer membrane protein A (OmpA) that is responsible for the adhesion to (and invasion of) endothelial cells. Thus, the OmpA protein represents a potential target for developing diagnostic and therapeutic agents for meningitis. In this study, we expressed recombinant OmpA proteins with various molecular weights in E. coli. The sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to check the molecular size of OmpA's full length (FL) and truncated proteins. OmpA-FL protein was purified for immunizing chickens to produce immunoglobulin yolk (IgY) antibodies. We applied phage display technology to construct antibody libraries (OmpA-FL scFv-S 1.1 × 10 and OmpA-FL scFv-L 5.01 × 10) to select specific anti-OmpA-FL scFv antibodies; these were characterized by their binding ability to recombinant or endogenous OmpA using ELISA, immunofluorescent staining, and confirmed with immunoblotting. We found 12 monoclonal antibodies that react to OmpA fragments; seven scFvs recognize fragments spanning amino  (aa) residues 1-346, aa 1-287, aa 1-167, and aa 60-192, while five scFvs recognize fragments spanning aa 1-346 and aa 1-287 only. Two fragments (aa 246-346 and aa 287-346) were not recognized with any of the 12 scFvs. Together, the data suggest three antigenic epitopes (60 aa-160 aa, 161 aa-167 aa, 193 aa-245 aa) recognized by monoclonal antibodies. These scFv antibodies show strong reactivity against OmpA proteins.

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of omega-3 fatty  and sublingual  in treating patients with bronchial asthma and evaluate the value of IL17A as a marker for effective treatment. The effect on asthma control test (ACT), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and serum interleukin 17A (IL17A) in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma were measured. A total of 48 patients were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group A included 24 patients treated with sublingual  for 6 months and group B, 24 patients given omega-3 fatty  for 3 months. Serum level of IL17A was measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A statistically significant difference was demonstrated in each parameter between before and after treatment (p < 001, for each). Comparison between omega-3 fatty  and sublingual  as regards ACT, PEFR, and FEV1and IL17A showed that omega-3 fatty  treatment was better than sublingual  in decreasing IL17A, but both were effective in decreasing PEFR, FEV1 and ACT.

Foreign circRNAs are potent adjuvants to induce antigen-specific T cell activation, antibody production, and anti-tumor immunity in vivo, and mA modification abrogates immune gene activation and adjuvant activity. mA reader YTHDF2 sequesters mA-circRNA and is essential for suppression of innate immunity. Unmodified circRNA, but not mA-modified circRNA, directly activates RNA pattern recognition receptor RIG-I in the presence of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chain to cause filamentation of the adaptor protein MAVS and activation of the downstream transcription factor IRF3.

The platform combines a multifunctional enzyme-responsive gelatin nanoparticle (GNP)-decorated substrate (GNP-chip) for specific capture with an acoustic droplet positioning technique to realize on-demand release of single CTCs. The acoustic droplet dispenser is employed to generate oxidized alginate microdroplets containing the MMP-9 enzyme (OA-MMP-9) with controllable size and precise positioning upon the cell-attached GNP-chip, allowing controlled cell-surface biodegradation under enzymatic reactions followed by calcium chloride (CaCl) solution treatment to form single-cell encapsulated calcium alginate hydrogels. Benefitting from the existence of hydrogels, the released cells could be efficiently recovered by microcapillary. Results demonstrate that the encapsulated cells maintain good cell morphology in the hydrogels, which allow further single-cell nucleic  analysis. As a proof-of-concept platform, this approach enables reliable and efficient retrieval of single CTCs and holds the potential for versatility in single-cell analysis systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468416>Effect of Taurine on Thymus Differentiation of Dex-Induced Immunosuppressive Mice.</a></h1><p>Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic ) has positive effects on the formation of immune systems. In this study, we evaluated the effects of taurine on the development of T lymphocyte subpopulations in thymus of immunosuppresive mice. The immunosuppressed mice model was established by intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone (Dex) for 7 days. Mice (male, Kunming strain) were randomly divided into three groups, the normal control group (Cont.), the Dex-induced immunosuppressive model group (Dex + PBS), and the taurine intervention group (Dex + TAU). Taurine was administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg for 30 days or until euthanasia. Total cell numbers in the thymi of mice were evaluated by cell count, and the flow cytometry was used to determine the proportion of different cell subsets. Our results showed that the size and weight of thymi of Dex + PBS group were significantly smaller than those of Cont. group, and taurine administration efficiently increased the thymus index. Taurine also significantly increased the number of CD4- CD8- double negative (DN), CD4+ CD8+ double positive (DP), CD4+ single positive (CD4+) and CD8+ SP (CD8+) cells compared with the Dex + PBS group, but did not affect the CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio in thymus of Dex-induced immunoseppressive mice. Our results suggested that taurine has a positive effect on thymus differentiation in Dex-induced immunosuppressive mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246413>Nanoparticles from Cuttlefish Ink Inhibit Tumor Growth by Synergizing  and Photothermal Therapy.</a></h1><p>Natural nanoparticles have been extensively studied due to their diverse properties and easy accessibility. Here, the nanoparticles extracted from cuttlefish ink (CINPs) with significant antitumor efficacy are explored. These CINPs, with spherical morphology, good dispersibility, and biocompatibility, are rich in melanin and contain a variety of amino  and monosaccharides. Through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, CINPs can efficiently reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from immune-suppressive M2-like phenotype to antitumor M1-like phenotype. Besides, under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, CINPs exhibit high photothermal effect and tumor cell killing ability, which make them a potential candidate in photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor. , CINPs can increase the proportion of M1 macrophages and foster the recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to tumors, leading to reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. In combination with their photothermal effect, which can induce tumor-specific antigens release, CINPs could almost completely inhibit tumor growth accompanied by more active immune responses. Collectively, these CINPs described here can provide both tumor  and PTT, implying that CINPs are promising for tumor treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644959>Screening and production of an affibody inhibiting the interaction of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint.</a></h1><p>An affibody is a 58 amino  peptide derived from the Z domain of staphylococcal protein A and generally applied in areas such as imaging diagnosis, clinical therapeutics and biotechnology research. To screen for an affibody targeting the immune checkpoint PD-L1, a combinatorial affibody library was generated in yeast using degenerate overlap PCR primers and In-fusion technology. Z-j1 and Z-j2 affibodies targeting the Ig-like V domain of PD-L1 were screened and identified from this combinatorial library using the yeast two hybrid system. The Z-j1 and Z-j2 recombinant affibody proteins were over produced in E.coli and purified. ELISA and GST pull-down assays showed that recombinant Z-j1 and Z-j2 affibody proteins bound with high affinity to PD-L1 and inhibited the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1. Thus, novel affibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 were identified and produced in this study and have the potential to be used in cancer .Copyright © 2019.

We describe a CAR T cell strategy in which CAR T cell activation and cancer cell killing can be sensitively regulated by adjusting the dose of a low molecular weight adapter that must bridge between the CAR T cell and cancer cell to initiate tumor eradication. By controlling the concentration and dosing schedule of adapter administration, we document two methods that can rapidly terminate (<3 h) a pre-existing CRS-like toxicity and two unrelated methods that can pre-emptively prevent a CRS-like toxicity that would have otherwise occurred. Because all four methods concurrently enhance CAR T cell potency, we conclude that proper use of bispecific adapters could potentially avoid a life-threatening CRS while enhancing CAR T cell tumoricidal activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292052>[Lewis tumor cell conditioned medium enhances immunosuppressive function of mouse myeloid-derived suppressor cells by regulating glycolytic pathway].</a></h1><p>Objective To investigate the effect of tumor microenvironment on the metabolism and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Methods The spleen-derived MDSCs of lung cancer xenograft mice were isolated by immunomagnetic beads. After treated by Lewis tumor cell conditioned medium (TCCM) for 48 hours, real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). The hexokinase (HK) method was used to detect the concentration of glucose; the lactic  test kit was used to detect the content of lactic  which was the final production of glycolysis; and the 5, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimiyl ester (CFSE) staining combined with flow cytometry was used to detect the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs on the proliferation of CD4 T cells. Arginase kit was used to detect arginase 1 (ARG1) activity of MDSCs, and nitric oxide kit was used to detect the level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Results Compared with the untreated group, the mRNA levels of LDHA, GLUT1 and HIF-1α were up-regulated; the activity of ARG1 and the level of iNOS significantly increased; the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs on the proliferation of CD4 T cells was significantly enhanced after the treatment of TCCM. Conclusion TCCM can activate the glycolytic pathway, up-regulate the immunosuppressive function on the proliferation of CD4 T cells and the release of immunosuppressive effector molecule of MDSCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238939>Mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNF scFv expression vector ameliorates experimental colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha therapy has become clinically important for treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, the use of conventional  requires a systemic exposure of patients and collateral side effects. Lactic  bacteria have been shown to be effective as mucosal delivering system for cytokine and single domain antibodies, and it is amenable to clinical purposes. Therefore, lactic  bacteria may function as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic antibodies molecules to the gastrointestinal tract restricting the pharmacological effect towards the gut. Here, we use the mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNFα scFv expression plasmid on a DSS-induced colitis model in mice.Experimental colitis was induced with DSS administered in drinking water. L. lactis carrying the scFv expression vector was introduced by gavage. After four days of treatment, animals showed a significant improvement in histological score and disease activity index compared to those of untreated animals. Moreover, treated mice display IL-6, IL17A, IL1β, IL10 and FOXP3 mRNA levels similar to health control mice. Therefore, morphological and molecular markers suggest amelioration of the experimentally induced colitis.These results provide evidence for the use of this alternative system for delivering therapeutic biopharmaceuticals in loco for treating inflammatory bowel disease, paving the way for a novel low-cost and site-specific biotechnological route for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155204>A Rare Manifestation of Tuberculosis in a Renal Transplant Patient: A Case Report.</a></h1><p>Cutaneous lesions in the presence of fever in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy are a diagnostic challenge and may represent manifestations of multiple diseases, such as fungal infections, nocardiosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, zoonosis, and tuberculosis. The authors report a case of a 66-year-old white man with chronic kidney disease since 2014 (chronic pyelonephritis) who had a renal transplant in the previous 6 months. Induction therapy was performed with thymoglobulin, and his current immunosuppression scheme included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. The patient had no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient presented with 2 cutaneous lesions, localized on the back and abdomen, that appeared to be firm, painful, subcutaneous, erythematous nodules with an approximately 5 cm diameter overlying an infected focus and purulent material inside. The patient also had a fever and fatigue. Blood analysis showed pancytopenia with an elevation of inflammatory markers and graft dysfunction. Tissue cultures and skin biopsy with histological analysis were performed. Histopathology of the lesion showed a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate without granulomas, and -fast bacillus staining was negative. Nevertheless, serum QuantiFERON testing was positive. But polymerase chain reaction finally confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis. A chest computed tomography scan showed a lung pattern of miliary tuberculosis. The patient was treated with multidrug tuberculosis therapy, resulting in lesion clearance after 3 weeks. Tuberculosis is a serious infection, especially in high-risk patients, such as those in an immunocompromised state. The incidence of cutaneous tuberculosis is rare, but it should be considered in patients presenting with atypical skin lesions suggestive of an underlying infectious etiology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Immunosuppressive enzymes produced in the tumor microenvironment modify nutrient availability by catabolizing essential or semi-essential amino  and producing toxic catabolites, thus participating in the local sabotage of the antitumor immune response. L-amino- oxidases are FAD-bound enzymes found throughout evolution, from bacteria to mammals, and are often endowed with anti-infectious properties. IL4I1 is a secreted L-phenylalanine oxidase mainly produced by inflammatory antigen-presenting cells-in particular, macrophages present in T helper type 1 granulomas and in various types of tumors. In the last decade, it has been shown that IL4I1 is involved in the fine control of B- and T-cell adaptive immune responses. Preclinical models have revealed its role in cancer immune evasion. Recent clinical data highlight IL4I1 as a new potential prognostic marker in human melanoma. As a secreted enzyme, IL4I1 may represent an easily targetable molecule for cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365169>ARID1A-SIN3A drives retinoic -induced neuroblastoma differentiation by transcriptional repression of TERT.</a></h1><p>Aggressive, high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) exhibits an immature differentiation state, profound epigenetic dysregulation and high telomerase activity. It has been suggested that aggressive NB may be treatable by inducing differentiation whereas therapeutic targeting of telomerase is under investigation for multiple cancer types. While epigenetic regulation of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter has been described in high-risk NB, the exact molecular mechanisms are still not completely understood. Here we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR, quantitative telomeric repeat amplification protocol, and immunoblot techniques to investigate epigenetic regulation of TERT in wild-type and genetically modified NB cell lines. We demonstrated that TERT expression is reduced during 13-cis retinoic -induced NB differentiation and that this inversely correlated with increased expression of AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), a subunit of the SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex. We showed that ARID1A directly caused suppression of TERT and was reliant on DNA binding and co-occupancy of the TERT promoter by the SIN3 transcription regulator family member A (SIN3A) repressor complex allowing NB differentiation to proceed. Finally, using data from NB patient cohorts, we reported a significant correlation between low ARID1A expression, elevated expression of TERT, and poorly differentiated, high-risk NB. These results provide insights into a key epigenetic pathway responsible for modulating TERT-driven NB progression, which could represent a target for therapeutic intervention.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547810>Anti-inflammatory activities of astringent persimmons (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) stalks of various cultivar types based on the stages of maturity in the Gyeongnam province.</a></h1><p>Natural products play a significant role in human health in relation to the prevention and treatment of inflammatory conditions. One of the plants with great medicinal potentials is Diospyros kaki which is mainly cultivated in Asian countries including Korea, Japan, and China. Astringent D. kaki is a wild species with an astringent taste until they are Ripened. kaki calyx is a traditional Korean medicine (TKM) made from the stalks of astringent D. kaki and is used in treating bed-wetting, vomiting, and hiccupping. The present study was designed to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory activities of astringent D. kaki stalks based on cultivar types and stages of maturity.The anti-inflammatory effects of the stalk extracts of local astringent D. kaki cultivar species were evaluated on RAW 264.7 cells. Cell viability was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) method. The anti-inflammatory effects were determined by measuring the nitric oxide (NO) concentration of the supernatant. Cellular signaling pathways were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reactions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Protein expression of iNOS and phospho-p65 was determined using western blot, and the nuclear localization of p65 was determined using confocal imaging in RAW 264.7 cells.We found that the stage 1 (8-9 month) samples all showed a high percentage of tannic  content and Gojongsi (Hamyang) stalks had the highest content. The stage 1 samples also showed the highest inhibition of NO production. Decreases in the expression of iNOS and phosphorylated p65, and in the nuclear localization of p65, were dose-dependent. All the extracts were nontoxic under 100 μg/ml concentration.This study provides insight into the changes in tannic  content in astringent D. kaki and their anti-inflammatory effects, in relation to their stage of maturity. These results are expected to be useful in the verification of the efficacy of oriental medicine and the timing of proper harvest for medical use.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228097>Tumor growth inhibition by mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine inducing augmented CD8 T cell immune responses.</a></h1><p>Poly(lactic-co-glycolic)  (PLGA) has been successfully used in drug delivery and biomaterial applications, but very little attention has been directed towards the potential in vivo effects of peptide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs), specifically the potency of intravenous (IV) STEAP peptide-loaded PLGA-NP (nanovaccine) dosing and whether STEAP-specific CD8 T cells directly play a key role in tumor inhibition. To address these concerns, syngeneic prostate cancer mouse models were established and treated with either mSTEAP peptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) via subcutaneous (SC) injection or mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine containing the same amount of peptide via IV or SC injection. Meanwhile, mice were treated with either CD8b mAb followed by nanovaccine treatment, free mSTEAP peptide, or empty PLGA-NPs. Immune responses in these mice were examined using cytotoxicity assays at 14 days after treatment. Tumor size and survival in various treatment groups were measured and monitored. The results demonstrated that mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine resulted in tumor inhibition by eliciting a significantly stronger CD8 T cell immune response when compared with the controls. Moreover, the survival periods of mice treated with mSTEAP nanovaccine were significantly longer than those of mice treated with mSTEAP peptide emulsified in IFA or the treatment controls. Additionally, it was observed that the peptide nanovaccine was mainly distributed in the mouse liver and lungs after IV injection. These findings suggest that the peptide nanovaccine is a promising immunotherapeutic approach and offers a new opportunity for prostate cancer therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390917>RNA-loaded dendritic cells: more than a  in cancer therapeutics.</a></h1><p>A wide array of therapeutic strategies has been implemented against cancers, yet their clinical benefit is limited.

Yet, there is marked patient-to-patient variation in liver transplantation outcomes. This calls for novel diagnostics to enable rational deployment of donor livers. Metabolomics is a postgenomic high-throughput systems biology approach to diagnostic innovation in clinical medicine. We report here an original systematic review of the metabolomic studies that have identified putative biomarkers in the context of liver transplantation. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria that involved sampling of blood ( = 4), dialysate fluid ( = 4), bile ( = 5), and liver tissue ( = 5). Metabolites of amino  and nitrogen metabolism, anaerobic glycolysis, lipid breakdown products, and bile  metabolism were significantly different in transplanted livers with and without graft dysfunction. However, criteria for defining the graft dysfunction varied across studies. This systematic review demonstrates that metabolomics can be deployed in identification of metabolic indicators of graft dysfunction with a view to implicated molecular mechanisms. We conclude the article with a horizon scanning of metabolomics technology in liver transplantation and its future prospects and challenges in research and clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588654>Neuronal antibodies in adult patients with new-onset seizures: A prospective study.</a></h1><p> in addition to antiepileptic drugs can improve seizure freedom rates in autoimmune epilepsy, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. A diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy can be supported by presence of serum antibodies to neuronal antigens. We asked how often neuronal antibodies are found in the serum of unselected adult patients with new-onset seizures and whether such testing could improve detection of autoimmune epilepsy.We included 44 patients over the age of 25 presenting after at least one unprovoked seizure to the Neurology Clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The median time between the first-ever seizure in life and the serum sampling was 50 days (range 22-11,000). Antibody testing in serum was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patients were followed for at least 1 year.Epilepsy could be diagnosed already at the first visit in 21/44 patients (47.7%). Two patients (4.5%) were positive for neuronal antibodies: one against contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR-2) and one against glutamate  decarboxylase (GAD). Three patients (6.7%) displayed very weak immunoreactivity that was deemed clinically insignificant. One of the antibody-positive patients had only a single seizure. The other had a focal cortical dysplasia and was seizure-free on levetiracetam. None of the five patients with antibodies or immunoreactivity displayed any feature of autoimmune epilepsy.We conclude that indiscriminate testing in patients presenting to a first seizure clinic with new-onset seizures or epilepsy is unlikely to improve detection of autoimmune epilepsy.© 2019 The Authors.
