However, the protective mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum C88 on chronic liver injury induced by mycotoxin remains unclear.In this study, the addition of L. plantarum C88 obviously ameliorated the increased contents of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol and triglyceride, the diminish contents of total protein and albumin in serum of mice challenged with AFB. Simultaneously, L. plantarum C88 attenuated the inflammatory response via significantly reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum. Furthermore, L. plantarum C88 remarkably down-regulated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways by weakening the expression of toll-like receptor  (TLR2) and TLR4, and inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation through enhancing the expression of NF-κB inhibitor (IκB). Neutralization experiments confirmed that L. plantarum C88 decreased the levels of some pro-inflammatory factors due to the suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathways. Besides, L. plantarum C88 decreased the levels of Bax and Caspase-3, elevated the level of Bcl-, and reduced mRNA expressions of Fatty acid synthetase receptor (Fas), FAS-associated death domain (FADD), TNF receptor associated death domain (TRADD) and Caspase-8 in the liver.Probiotic L. plantarum C88 prevented AFB-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by modulating TLR2/NF-κB and TLR4/NF-κB pathways. The molecular mechanisms of L. plantarum C88 in ameliorating AFB-induced excessive apoptosis included regulating the mitochondrial pathway and cell death receptor pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315657> in pregnancy: protocol of a double-blind randomized controlled pilot trial for pregnant women with depression and anxiety (PIP pilot trial).</a></h1><p>Maternal prenatal depressive or anxiety symptoms are associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. With prevalence rates of maternal prenatal depression and anxiety ranging between 10 and 20%, attempts to identify effective interventions to reduce symptoms are priority. There are indications that  can reduce symptoms of maternal depression or anxiety.  ingested by the mother may thus offer a promising and accessible intervention to complement existing treatments.The  in Pregnancy (PIP) pilot trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot trial. While one group orally consumes a probiotic mixture (Ecologic® Barrier; ,5 × 109 colony forming units/g;  g; daily), the other group consumes a placebo, from between 26 and 30 weeks gestation until delivery. Subjects are randomly allocated (1:1) to the intervention or placebo group. Forty healthy pregnant women with symptoms of depression or anxiety and uncomplicated pregnancies at randomization will be included. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a probiotic trial to reduce symptoms of maternal depression or anxiety in pregnancy. The secondary aim is to exploratorily compare the potential effect of , compared to placebo, on depressive and/or anxiety symptoms, maternal stress (i.e. reported/hair cortisol), maternal vaginal and intestinal microbiota, and by possibly affecting maternal mood and microbiota, maternal bonding to offspring, infant microbiota and infant crying.Results of this pilot trial will help determine whether or not to proceed with a full trial after the pilot trial, and if so, whether revisions should be made to the study protocol and procedures before conducting a full randomized controlled trial. Additionally, they are expected to provide insights into whether changes in psychological, behavioral and biological parameters can be attributed to the probiotic intervention.Netherlands Trial Register, NTR6219 .

Treatment with  DSM 17938 (LR), a probiotic with immunomodulatory functions, significantly increases regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestinal mucosa of newborn suckling rats. In humans, treatment with LR of infants with colic reduces crying optimally if the infants are breast-fed. Therefore, we examined the effects of human breast milk (HBM) on LR-associated immune modulation.Newborn rats were divided into 8 feeding groups, including dam-fed ± LR (10 CFU/kg bw/day, daily), formula-fed ± LR, formula with 20% (v/v) HBM-fed ± LR, and HBM-fed ± LR. Pups were fed by gavage from d1 to d3 of age. Subsequently, we measured intestinal immune cell profiles, including Tregs and tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) by flow cytometry. We also measured inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattratant (CINC)-1 in intestinal tissue lysates by ELISA.(1) Formula feeding increased intestinal CD3+ T cells, CD4+ helper T (TH) cells and CD11c+ DCs, pro-inflammatory effects which were reversed by HBM. () When comparing HBM-fed with formula-fed newborns, HBM supplementation produced a lower percentage of CD4+ TH cells and a higher percentage of CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells, while reducing protein levels of IL-1β and CINC-1 in the intestine. (3) Probiotic LR feeding maximally stimulated the percentage of intestinal Tregs and tDCs when the pups were fed HBM. In conclusion, HBM reduced formula-induced intestinal gut immune activation, and the addition of LR further promoted immune tolerance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555570>Effect of Synbiotic on the Treatment of Jaundice in Full Term Neonates: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>Jaundice accounts for most hospital admissions in the neonatal period. Nowadays, in addition to phototherapy, other auxiliary methods are used to reduce jaundice and the length of hospitalization. This study aimed to investigate the effect of  on the treatment of hyper-bilirubinemia in full-term neonates.In this randomized clinical trial, 83 full-term neonates, who were admitted to the hospital to receive phototherapy in the first 6 months of 2015, were randomly divided into two groups: synbiotic (SG, n=40) and control (CG, n=43). Both groups received phototherapy but the SG also received 5 drops/day of synbiotics. Serum bilirubin, urine, stool, feeding frequency, and weight were measured daily until hospital discharge. A -value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The mean total serum bilirubin in the SG was lower than that in the CG (9.38±.37 and 11.17±.60 mg/dL, respectively). The urine and stool frequency in the SG was significantly higher than that in the CG (<0.05). The duration of hospitalization in the SG was shorter than that in the CG.Use of synbiotics as an adjuvant therapy had a significant treatment effect on jaundice in full-term neonates. Further studies including larger samples with long follow-up periods are essential to confirm the benefits of routine use of synbiotics in neonatal patients with jaundice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640890>The probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum 296 attenuates cardiometabolic disorders in high fat diet-treated rats.</a></h1><p>High-fat (HF) diet consumption has been associated with gut dysbiosis and increased risk of dyslipidemia, type  diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, , purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5-ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5-ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and 5-ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in .8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in .5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h1><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined  (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554647>Changes in the gut microbiota during and after commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving in China.</a></h1><p>The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving. Their living and excursion depths were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the bacteria composition in the divers' guts.Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen saturation decreased the abundance of the genus , an obligate anaerobe, from .43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3. Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as , rectale group and , showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after diving. On the contrary, the abundance of species, such as , , , , ,  and , showed an increasing trend, but most of them were pathogens.Occupational exposure to high pressure in a helium-oxygen saturation environment decreased the abundance of  and some SCFA-producing bacteria, and increased the risk of pathogenic bacterial infection.

In this study, cell culture models of human intestinal cells (mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells, absorptive Caco- cells, and combined cocultures of the two) were used to determine the effects of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris treatments (exopolysaccharide producing and nonproducing strains) on the virulence gene expression of Salmonella Typhimurium and its mutant lacking the oligopeptide permease subunit A (ΔoppA). During the course of epithelial cell (HT29-MTX, Caco-, and combined) infection by Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, improved barrier function was reflected by increased transepithelial electrical resistance in cells treated with both strains of L. lactis subsp. cremoris. In addition, virulence gene expression was downregulated, accompanied with lower numbers of invasive bacteria into epithelial cells in the presence of L. lactis subsp. cremoris treatments. Similarly, virulence gene expression of Salmonella was also suppressed when coincubated with overnight cultures of both L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains in the absence of epithelial cells. However, in medium or in the presence of cell cultures, Salmonella lacking the OppA permease function remained virulent. HT29-MTX cells and combined cultures stimulated by Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 showed significantly lower secretion levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 after treatment with L. lactis subsp. cremoris cell suspensions. Contrarily, these responses were not observed during infection with S. Typhimurium ΔoppA. Both the exopolysaccharide producing and nonproducing strains of L. lactis subsp. cremoris JFR1 exhibited an antivirulence effect against S. Typhimurium DT104 although no significant difference between the two strains was observed. Our results show that an intact peptide transporter is essential for the suppression of Salmonella virulence genes which leads to the protection of the barrier function in the cell culture models studied.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385480>Do Kimchi and   as a Functional Food Improve Androgenetic Alopecia?

Vaginal isolates of  DSM 14869 and  DSM 14870 were previously selected to develop the probiotic EcoVag capsules and showed therapeutic effects in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in their probiotic activity are largely unknown. In this study, we identified three cell surface molecules in  DSM 14869 that promote adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC) by constructing dedicated knockout mutants, including exopolysaccharides (EPSs), a protein containing MucBP-like domains (N506_1778), and a putative novel adhesin (N506_1709) with rib/alpha-like domain repeats. EPS knockout mutants revealed 20-fold and 14-fold increases in adhesion to Caco- and HeLa cells, respectively, compared with wild type, while the adhesion to VEC was reduced 30% by the mutation, suggesting that EPSs might mediate tissue tropism for vaginal cells. A significant decrease in adhesion to Caco- cells, HeLa cells, and VEC was observed in the N506_1778 knockout mutant. The N506_1709 mutant showed no significant difference for the adhesion to Caco- and HeLa cells compared with wild type (WT); in contrast, the adhesion to VEC revealed a significant decrease (42%), suggesting that N506_1709 might mediate specific binding to stratified squamous epithelial cells, and this putative novel adhesin was annotated as  vaginal epithelium adhesin (LVEA). Thus, we have discovered an important role for EPSs and a novel adhesin, LVEA, in the adhesive capacity of a vaginal probiotic  strain. Lactobacilli are known to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy vaginal microbiota and some are selected as  for the prevention or treatment of urogenital diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis. However, the molecular mechanisms for these health-promoting effects are not fully understood. Here, we functionally identified three cell surface factors of a  strain potentially involved in its adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells, including exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and two sortase-dependent proteins (N506_1778 and N506_1709). We could demonstrate the tissue-specific adhesion of EPSs to vaginal cells and that N506_1709 might be a novel adhesin specifically mediating bacterial binding to stratified squamous epithelial cells. The results provide important new information on the molecular mechanisms of vaginal  spp. adhesion.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678855>An antibiotic depleted microbiome drives severe Campylobacter jejuni-mediated Type 1/17 colitis, Type  autoimmunity and neurologic sequelae in a mouse model.</a></h1><p>The peripheral neuropathy Guillain-Barré Syndrome can follow Campylobacter jejuni infection when outer core lipooligosaccharides induce production of neurotoxic anti-ganglioside antibodies. We hypothesized that gut microbiota depletion with an antibiotic would increase C. jejuni colonization, severity of gastroenteritis, and GBS. Microbiota depletion increased C. jejuni colonization, invasion, and colitis with Type 1/17 T cells in gut lamina propria.

The aim of this post hoc analysis was to investigate the effect of supplementation with probiotic and prebiotic on appetite, in parallel with body mass index (BMI), weight and energy intake, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).We extracted data from a clinical trial with 81 patients. The participants were randomly assigned to receive probiotic (Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum), prebiotic (galactooligosaccharide) or placebo for 8 weeks. Appetite, weight, BMI, dietary intake, serum leptin and physical activity were measured. Subjective appetite rating was evaluated every  weeks using visual analogue scales (VAS) to assess satiety, hunger, fullness and desire to eat. Serum leptin was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Physical activity was measured using the international physical activity questionnaire. A repeated measures analysis of variance model was used to analyse VAS data and analysis of variance/analysis of covariance models for dietary intake, BMI, weight and leptin data.VAS data analyses indicated no significant intervention-time interactions but did show a significant increase over time for desire to eat within the probiotic group (P = 0.025). No significant difference in either BMI or weight was seen among the groups. Energy intake and leptin were significantly increased in the probiotic group compared to the prebiotic.Overall, probiotic supplementation for 8 weeks among MDD patients resulted in improvement of appetite, whereas prebiotic administration had no significant effect on appetite.© 2019 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434991>Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota impairs corneal development in postnatal mice by affecting CCR2 negative macrophage distribution.</a></h1><p>Antibiotics are extremely useful, but they can cause adverse impacts on host bodies. We found that antibiotic treatment altered the composition of the gut microbiota and the gene expression profile in the corneal tissues of postnatal mice and decreased the corneal size and thickness, the angiogenesis of limbal blood vessels, and the neurogenesis of corneal nerve fibers. The reconstitution of the gut microbiota with fecal transplants in antibiotic-treated mice largely reversed these impairments in corneal development. Furthermore, C-C chemokine receptor type  negative (CCR2) macrophages were confirmed to participate in corneal development, and their distribution in the cornea was regulated by the gut microbiota. We propose that the CCR2 macrophage population is a crucial mediator through which gut microbiota affect corneal development in postnatal mice. In addition,  were shown to have the potential effect of restoring corneal development in antibiotic-treated mice. Abx-induced gut dysbiosis has significant, long-term effects on the development of the cornea, and reversal of these suppressive effects takes a long time.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481125> for glycemic control in patients with type  diabetes mellitus: protocol for a systematic review.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem worldwide.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including different sets of trials have concluded an overall beneficial effect of  in patients with T2DM. At least two RCTs with a longer treatment duration have been published since the publication of existing reviews.We will conduct a systematic review of RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of  for glycemic control in T2DM patients. Primary outcomes are fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). Secondary outcomes are plasma insulin, blood lipid profile, adverse events, and cost associated with the intervention and hospital visits. We will search PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, and trial registries. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias. We will summarize the results both qualitatively and statistically.

These techniques have allowed an unprecedented level of knowledge on complex microbial ecosystems, which is having key implications in land and marine ecology, industrial biotechnology or biomedicine. Multi-omics have recently been applied to artistic or archaeological objects, with the goal of either contributing to shedding light on the original context of the pieces and/or to inform conservation approaches. In this minireview, we discuss the application of -omic techniques to the study of prehistoric artworks and ancient man-made objects in three main technical blocks: metagenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. In particular, we will focus on how proteomics and metabolomics can provide paradigm-breaking results by unambiguously identifying peptides associated with a given, palaeo-cultural context; and we will discuss how metagenomics can be central for the identification of the microbial keyplayers on artworks surfaces, whose conservation can then be approached by a range of techniques, including using selected microorganisms as '' because of their direct or indirect effect in the stabilization and preservation of valuable art objects.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, new forms of treatment and/or adjunct therapy are needed. Evidence has confirmed the modulation of the gut-brain-microbiota axis as a promising approach in MDD patients. The overall purpose of the SANGUT study-a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled Study Evaluating the Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on the Mental Status, Inflammation, and Intestinal Barrier in Major Depressive Disorder Patients Using Gluten-free or Gluten-containing Diet - is to determine the effect of interventions focused on the gut-brain-microbiota axis in a group of MDD patients.A total of 120 outpatients will be equally allocated into one of four groups: (1) probiotic supplementation+gluten-free diet group (PRO-GFD), () placebo supplementation+ gluten-free diet group (PLA-GFD), (3) probiotic supplementation+ gluten containing diet group (PRO-GD), and (4) placebo supplementation+gluten containing diet group (PLA-GD). PRO groups will receive a mixture of psychobiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175), and GFD groups will follow a gluten-free diet. The intervention will last 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is change in wellbeing, whereas the secondary outcome measures include physiological parameters.Microbiota and its metabolites have the potential to influence CNS function.  may restore the eubiosis within the gut while a gluten-free diet, via changes in the microbiota profile and modulation of intestinal permeability, may alter the activity of microbiota-gut-brain axis previously found to be associated with the pathophysiology of depression. It is also noteworthy that microbiota being able to digest gluten may play a role in formation of peptides with different immunogenic capacities. Thus, the combination of a gluten-free diet and probiotic supplementation may inhibit the immune-inflammatory cascade in MDD course and improve both psychiatric and gut barrier-associated traits. .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476436>Comparative Efficacy of Treatment Options for Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy: A Systematic Review & Network Meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>To synthesize evidence for most effective treatment for minimal hepatic encephalopathy (HE).A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, OvidSP and CENTRAL databases for randomized-controlled-trials evaluating treatments for minimal HE in cirrhotics was conducted from their inception to 26July2018.

Through in ovo probiotic inoculation, beneficial microflora development in the gastrointestinal tract may occur prior to hatch without negatively impacting chick performance. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to observe the impacts of the injection of probiotic bacteria individually or combined into fertile broiler hatching eggs on hatch and live performance characteristics. A total of ,080 fertile broiler hatching eggs were obtained from a commercial source. On day 18 of incubation, 4 in ovo injected treatments were applied: 1.) Marek's Disease (HVT) vaccination, .) L. animalis (∼106 cfu/50μl), 3.) E. faecium (∼106 cfu/50μl), and 4.) L. animalis + E. faecium (∼106 cfu & ∼106 cfu/50μl each). On day of hatch, hatchability and hatch residue data were recorded. A portion of male chicks from each treatment were placed in a grow-out facility for a 21 d grow-out (18 chicks/pen × 10 pens/treatment = 720 male chicks) with a corn and soy bean meal-based diet without antibiotics or antibiotic alternatives. Performance data and gastrointestinal samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Results indicated no differences in all hatch parameters between treatments (P > 0.05) except for % pipped, where the L. animalis treatment had lower % pipped eggs compared to the HVT control and E. faecium treatments (P = 0.04). No differences were observed in body weight gain or mortality (P > 0.05). Probiotic treatments altered gastrointestinal tissue length, weight, and pH. This resulted in all in ovo injected probiotic treatments increasing feed conversion ratio (FCR) from days 7 to 14 as compared to the control (P = 0.01). Differences in FCR were not observed in any other week of data collection (days 0 to 7, 14 to 21, or 0 to 21; P > 0.05).

One intriguing approach to reducing the risk of salmonellosis is the direct ingestion of phages targeting  to enhance natural gut resilience and provide protection during foodborne disease outbreaks. We evaluated the ability of a prophylactically administered bacteriophage cocktail, the foodborne outbreak pill (FOP) targeting  O157:H7,  and  to resolve a  infection in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME), a simulated gut platform populated by the human intestinal microbiome of healthy donors. The FOP preparation eliminated  serovar Typhimurium from the colon compartment of the SHIME platform but health-associated metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and lactate, remained stable or increased in a donor-dependent manner. In studies of human intestinal cells, pretreatment of  Typhimurium with the FOP cocktail preserved lipopolysaccharide-stimulated signaling in a Caco--THP-1 Transwell system and prevented destruction of the Caco- monolayer by . Adhesion and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by -a critical factor in  pathogenesis-was blunted when the bacteria were incubated with the FOP preparation before addition to the monolayer. The FOP phage cocktail was effective for (i) eliminating  from a simulated human gut without disturbing the indigenous microbiota and (ii) reducing the risk of invasion by  into the intestinal epithelia. These results suggest that the FOP preparation may be of value for reducing the risk of salmonellosis in humans, e.g., during foodborne disease outbreaks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416116>Paraimmunobiotic Bifidobacteria Modulate the Expression Patterns of Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins in Porcine Intestinal Epitheliocytes and Antigen Presenting Cells.</a></h1><p>Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are able to induce innate immune responses through their binding to peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide, or lipoteichoic acid, or by interacting with other PRR-ligands. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the immunobiology of PGLYRPs in human and mice, however, their functions in livestock animals have been less explored. In this study, we characterized the expression patterns of PGLYRPs in porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their modulation by the interactions of host cells with PRR-ligands and non-viable immunomodulatory  referred to as paraimmunobiotics. We demonstrated that PGLYRP-1, -, -3, and -4 are expressed in PIE cells and APCs from Peyer's patches, being PGLYPR-3 and -4 levels higher than PGLYRP-1 and -. We also showed that PGLYRPs expression in APCs and PIE cells can be modulated by different PRR agonists. By using knockdown PIE cells for TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2, or the four PGLYRPs, we demonstrated that PGLYRPs expressions would be required for activation and functioning of TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2 in porcine epitheliocytes, but PGLYRPs activation would be independent of those PRR expressions. Importantly, we reported for the first time that PGLYRPs expression can be differentially modulated by paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria in a strain-dependent manner. These results provide evidence for the use of paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria as an alternative for the improvement of resistance to intestinal infections or as therapeutic tools for the reduction of the severity of inflammatory damage in diseases in which a role of PGLYRPs-microbe interaction has been demonstrated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365980>[The influence of  and synbiotics on intestinal inflammation and microbiota in mice with acute colitis].</a></h1><p> To investigate the effects of  and synbiotics on inflammation and microbiota of acute colitis in mice.

Over the last  decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of α-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the α-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread "prion like" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered gut microbiota and leaky gut have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (α-synuclein overexpression) and environmental (gut dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD. The restoration of the gut microbiome in patients with PD may alter the clinical progression of PD and this alteration can be accomplished by carefully designed studies using customized  and fecal microbiota transplantation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562911>Randomized Trial of Perioperative  Among Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Operation.</a></h1><p>We investigated the utility and safety of short-course oral  among patients undergoing major abdominal operations.

Here, we analyze the microbiome and metabolome of organically fermented vegetables, using a salt brine, which is a common 'at-home' method of food fermentation. We found that the natural microbial fermentation had a strong effect on the food metabolites, where all four foods (beet, carrot, peppers and radishes) changed through time, with a peak in molecular diversity after -3 days and a decrease in diversity during the final stages of the 4-day process. The microbiome of all foods showed a stark transition from one that resembled a soil community to one dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, such as  spp., within a single day of fermentation and increasing amounts of Lactobacillales through the fermentation process. With particular attention to plant natural products, we observed significant transformations of polyphenols, triterpenoids and anthocyanins, but the degree of this metabolism depended on the food type.

Salivary pH, plaque index, pH variation before and after a sugar rinse, quantification of Streptococcus mutans in saliva and demineralisation of the carious lesions were determined at the beginning and at the end of both milk ingestion periods.Regarding WP milk, a non-significant decrease in terms of the concentration of S. mutans and pH variation (p > 0.05), a significant decrease (i.e. acidification) in salivary pH (p < 0.01) and a remineralisation of 39.4% of the caries were found. On the other hand, for NP milk, a non-significant increase in terms of the concentration of S. mutans, pH variation, salivary pH (p > 0.05) and a remineralisation of 64.% were found.Lactic acid  can contribute to the decrease in the number of cariogenic microorganisms. However, the appropriate selection of the bacteria type with regard to its acidogenicity is fundamental to avoid the generation of an effect contrary to that expected, e.g. a significant decrease in salivary pH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485973>Efficacy of Indolicidin, Cecropin A (1-7)-Melittin (CAMA) and Their Combination Against Biofilm-Forming Multidrug-Resistant Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>The present study examined the anti-biofilm efficacy of two short-chain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), namely, indolicidin and cecropin A (1-7)-melittin (CAMA) against biofilm-forming multidrug-resistant enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (MDR-EAEC) isolates. The typical EAEC isolates re-validated by PCR and confirmed using HEp- cell adherence assay was subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing to confirm its MDR status. The biofilm-forming ability of MDR-EAEC isolates was assessed by Congo red binding, microtitre plate assays and hydrophobicity index; broth microdilution technique was employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs). The obtained MIC and MBEC values for both AMPs were evaluated alone and in combination against MDR-EAEC biofilms using crystal violet (CV) staining and confocal microscopy-based live/dead cell quantification methods. All the three MDR-EAEC strains revealed weak to strong biofilm-forming ability and were found to be electron-donating and weakly electron-accepting (hydrophobicity index). Also, highly significant (P < 0.001) time-dependent hydrodynamic growth of the three MDR-EAEC strains was observed at 48 h of incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.45% D-glucose. AMPs and their combination were able to inhibit the initial biofilm formation at 24 h and 48 h as evidenced by CV staining and confocal quantification. Further, the application of AMPs (individually and combination) against the preformed MDR-EAEC biofilms resulted in highly significant eradication (P < 0.001) at 24 h post treatment. However, significant differences were not observed between AMP treatments (individually or in combination). The AMPs seem to be an effective candidates for further investigations such as safety, stability and appropriate biofilm-forming MDR-EAEC animal models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410767>Optimization of Media Composition to Maximize the Yield of Exopolysaccharides Production by Lactobacillus rhamnosus Strains.</a></h1><p>Growth media composition is a critical factor influencing the yield of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPSs), which have attracted the interest of researchers around the world due to their diverse physicochemical and biological properties. This work presents the optimization of media for EPS synthesis by three Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains, namely ŁOCK 0943, ŁOCK 0935, and OM-1. The optimized media led to a more than 13-fold increase in EPS yield for L. rhamnosus ŁOCK 0943 (from 85 to 1138. mg/L), an almost 9-fold increase for L. rhamnosus ŁOCK 0935 (from 103.67 to 900 mg/L), and a more than 7-fold increase for L. rhamnosus OM-1 (from 133.67 to 987.84 mg/L) as compared to cultures in standard MRS medium (de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe).

Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal microbiota in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic  for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and immunity.A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at 5 weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time ). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo. may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥ 5 weeks.

Sixty mice were divided into the following three groups: negative control group C1, positive control group C2 (mice infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O149:F4), and experimental group LF (Lactobacillus reuteri CCM 8617 + 10% flaxseed + E. coli O149:F4). Supplements were administered for 42 days. Microbiological, hematological, and biochemical analyses, electrophoretic analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes, and analysis of fatty acids using gas chromatography and isotachophoresis were performed. We recorded higher numbers of jejunal and ileal lactic acid bacteria, lower Enterobacteriaceae counts in the feces of the animals, and an increased production of organic acids in the synbiotic-fed group. The supplements applied favored n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism and inhibited n-6 PUFA metabolism; thus, they influenced the n-6 to n-3 and eicosapentaenoic to arachidonic acid ratios. Additionally, the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs to the cell membrane decreased the activity of LDH, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase.

ACE2 has been shown to be protective in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including diabetes and its complications. However, the challenge for its clinical application is large-scale production of high-quality ACE2 with sufficient target tissue bioavailability. We developed an expression and delivery system based on the use of probiotic species  (LP) to serve as a live vector for oral delivery of human ACE2. We show that codon-optimized ACE2 can be efficiently expressed in LP. Mice treated with the recombinant LP expressing the secreted ACE2 in fusion with the non-toxic subunit B of cholera toxin, which acts as a carrier to facilitate transmucosal transport, showed increased ACE2 activities in serum and tissues. ACE2-LP administration reduced the number of acellular capillaries, blocked retinal ganglion cell loss, and decreased retinal inflammatory cytokine expression in two mouse models of diabetic retinopathy. These results provide proof of concept for feasibility of using engineered probiotic species as live vector for delivery of human ACE2 with enhanced tissue bioavailability for treating diabetic retinopathy, as well as other diabetic complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583250>Effects of Probiotic Supplement in Pregnant Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h1><p>Previous studies showed that  could improve glycemic control and attenuate some of the adverse effects of type  diabetes. However, whether the effects are generalizable to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains uncertain.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplement in GDM.PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and EBSCO were systematically searched for relevant literature published through January 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of probiotic supplement on one or more of the following in GDM were included: pregnancy outcome (the primary outcome), glycemic control, blood lipid profile, and inflammation and oxidative stress. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in studies. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the fixed effects model unless substantial heterogeneity was found among studies.Eleven randomized trials involving 719 participants were included for analysis. Eight of the trials were from Iran.  were given alone in eight trials and synbiotics in three trials. Though the components of  varied, Lactobacillus was included in all trials and Bifidobacterium in all except one. The duration of intervention ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. Almost all trials (10/11) had a low risk of bias. Probiotic supplementation reduced the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia by 74% and improved four biomarkers for glycemic control (fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index), two biomarkers for lipid profile (triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol), and four biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress (total glutathione, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and total antioxidant capacity). But significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses on the four biomarkers related to glycemic control and on triglycerides, which could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses according to the mean age of participants and intervention type (i.e.,  or synbiotics). The effects on the risk of preterm delivery, macrosomia and a newborns' hypoglycemia, gestational age, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were not statistically significant.Probiotic supplementation seemed to be able to reduce the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia and improve glycemic control, blood lipid profiles and inflammation and oxidative stress in pregnant women with GDM. However, due to the heterogeneity among existing studies, the surrogate nature of outcomes, and/or the fact that most studies were from Iran, the clinical significance and generalizability of the above findings remain uncertain.

Blood is collected for biochemical parameters analysis and tissue samples for histological analysis. Treatment with strain NL41 results in excellent blood glucose regulation and significantly decreases insulin resistance, and HbA1c, glucagon, and leptin levels, accompanied by remarkable improvement of dyslipidemia and oxidative stress status in the animals. Islets of Langerhans, liver, and kidney are significantly protected in the NL41-treated rats compared to the HFD/STZ-T2DM model rats. Histochemistry shows that strain NL41 inhibits beta-cell loss and alpha-cell expansion, indicating pancreatic islets as the targeted tissues for the primary ameliorative effect of the probiotic strain on HFD/STZ-T2DM rats.

Frequent acute exacerbations of COPD are sudden worsening of symptoms, the nature of which is associated with bacterial or viral infections. However, one-third of exacerbations remain of undetermined origin. Although it is largely discussed and controversial, current guidelines recommend treatment of exacerbations with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and systemic corticosteroids; this is despite being associated with limited benefits in term of reducing mortality, side effects and without paying attention to the heterogeneity of these exacerbations. Increasing evidence suggests that the lung microbiota plays an important role in COPD and numerous studies have reported differences in the microbiota between healthy and disease states, as well as between exacerbations and stable COPD, leading to the hypothesis that frequent acute exacerbation is more likely to experience significant changes in lung microbiota composition. These findings will need further examination to explain the causes of lung dysbiosis, namely microbial composition, the host response, including the recruitment of eosinophils, lifestyle, diet, cigarette smoking and the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids. It is now important to assess: 1) Whether alterations in the lung microbiota contribute to disease pathogenesis, especially in exacerbations of unknown origin; ) The role of eosinophils; and 3) Whether the microbiota of the lung can be manipulated therapeutically to improve COPD exacerbation event and disease progression. In summary, we hypothesize that the alterations of the lung microbiota may explain the undetermined origins of exacerbations and that there is an urgent need to facilitate the design of intervention studies that aim at conserving the lung microbial flora.Copyright 2019, Toraldo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560998>Altered gut microbiota and intestinal permeability in Parkinson's disease: Pathological highlight to management.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 3.7% of the population over 65 years of age. PD involves degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) with deficiency of dopamine. Genetic factors like SNCA, PARK-, PARK-7, PINK-1 and LRRK- as well as environmental toxins enhance alpha-synuclein, amyloid β (beta) and τ (tau) proteins aggregation. Moreover, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctioning, neuroinflammation, prion like phenomena, excitotoxicity, mutations etc are known to cause pathological insult in PD. Recently, facts indicates strong correlation between gut-brain axis and PD. The communication between the gastrointestinal system (GIT) and central nervous system is bidirectional and it is hypothesized that PD arises in the gut and spreads to brain via vagus nerve that helps to propagate the alpha-synuclein that target brain. The Lewy bodies are found in olfactory bulb, dorsal motor vagal nerve and the ENS of the gut indicate peripheral and central correlation. The alteration of gut microbial flora leads to GIT disturbance which cause neuroinflammation by prion alpha-synuclein expression and produces PD like symptoms. Persistent gut inflammation with spontaneous neuroinflammation is yet need to confirm but increased intestinal permeability and disrupt function of GIT is known to produce non-motor symptoms of PD. The present review is aimed to explore mechanistic approach for gut associated PD symptoms as well as use of  and prebiotics as therapeutic approach to retain gut microbial flora and prevent PD like symptoms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether DEHP exposure in newborns through medical treatment affected the gut microbiota pattern and vaccine response, which are both related to immune development. In this prospective cohort study from May 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017, newborns with respiratory distress who were given intravenous infusions (IVs) were enrolled as the DEHP group, and newborns who did not receive IVs were enrolled as the control group. We excluded patients with perinatal maternal , vaginal delivery, antibiotic treatment, and exclusive human milk or formula feeding. Of 118 infants, urinary phthalate metabolite analysis revealed that the calculated DEHP concentrations of the newborns treated with IVs (n = 15) were higher than those in the control group (n = 10) (p = 0.0001). DEHP exposure altered bacterial communities both in composition and diversity, particularly decreases in Rothia sp. and Bifidobacterium longum in the DEHP group.

QUE increased cell surface hydrophobicity of most of the tested  strains and increases or decreases in cell surface hydrophobicity varied in the presence of different RES concentrations among some strains. QUE and RES increased the ability of tested  strains to autoaggregate and coaggregate with pathogens. QUE and RES did not negatively affect the antagonistic activity of the tested  strains against pathogens and did not decrease their survival rates when exposed to  gastrointestinal conditions. In a few cases, the ability of some tested  strains to antagonize pathogens, as well as to survive specific steps of the  digestion was increased by QUE and RES. QUE exerted overall better protective effects on the measured  properties of tested  strains than RES, and  and  strains presented better responses when treated with QUE or RES. These results showed that probiotic  strains could present low susceptibility to QUE and RES. Combined use of QUE and RES with probiotic  could improve their functionalities on the host; however, the concentration of these polyphenols should be carefully selected to achieve the desirable effects and vary according to the selected probiotic strain.Copyright © 2019 dos Santos, de Albuquerque, de Brito Alves and de Souza.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424510>A novel Bacillus based multi-strain probiotic improves growth performance and intestinal properties of Clostridium perfringens challenged broilers.</a></h1><p>There is a necessity for the implementation of in-feed  in the poultry production industry, following strict regulations around the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). Bacillus spp. are becoming an attractive alternative because of their functionality and stability. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a novel multi-strain Bacillus based probiotic on growth performance and gut health in male Ross 308 broiler chickens challenged with Clostridium perfringens Type A. Broilers on a 4 phase feeding program were fed diets containing either a standard metabolizable energy (ME) (100%) or a reduced ME (98%) level. The test probiotic was compared to an un-supplemented negative control and a commercial benchmark product as positive control over a 35 D feeding trial, using a  × 3 factorial experimental design. Chicks were inoculated with a once-off dose of C. perfringens on day 14. Growth performance was measured weekly to calculate body weight (BW), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Villi histomorphology, gut lesions, and liver weight were assessed at day 35. Broilers fed the reduced ME diet with the test probiotic achieved higher final BWs (P = 0.037) and FCR (P = 0.014) than the negative control. Broilers fed the standard ME diet with the test probiotic showed improved (P = 0.001) FCR than the negative control from day 21 onwards. Increased duodenal villi height (P = 0.012) and villi height to crypt depth ratio in the duodenum (P < 0.0001) and jejunum (P = 0.0004) were observed in broilers fed the reduced ME diet containing the test probiotic. Additionally, the test probiotic resulted in significantly reduced relative liver weights in both ME groups. Consequently, the results suggest that the novel multi-strain Bacillus based probiotic enhanced broiler performance and improved gut health and is thus attractive as an alternative to AGP's in broiler production.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661976>Effects of phytogenic feed additives,  and mannan-oligosaccharides on performance, blood metabolites, meat quality, intestinal morphology, and microbial population of Japanese quail.</a></h1><p>1. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of ajwain () and dill () essential oils (AEO and DEO, respectively), probiotic (PRO) and mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) on the growth performance, serum metabolites, meat quality, intestinal morphology and microbial populations of Japanese quail.. A total of 375 one-day-old Japanese quail were randomly allocated into five treatment groups with five replicates of 15 birds each for a 42 d feeding experiment. The dietary treatments were a basal diet (control) or the same diet supplemented with PRO (0.15 g/kg feed), MOS ( g/kg feed), AEO (0.25 g/kg feed) or DEO (0.25 g/kg feed).3. AEO, MOS, and PRO supplementation increased weight gain, while diets supplemented with AEO decreased FI, and improved feed conversion ratio from d 1 to 21 (P<0.05). The relative weight of the gizzard was higher in birds supplemented with AEO compared to control group, while the birds fed MOS diet had the longest intestine (P<.05). Ceca length was greater in control, MOS and PRO groups (P<.05). Both essential oils decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration of breast meat and percentage of cooking loss in quail (P<.05). The villus length (VL) was greater in birds fed diet supplemented with MOS, AEO, and DEO (P<.05).The population of  decreased in Japanese quail fed MOS, while . count was increased in the MOS group (P<.05).4. In conclusion, AEO, MOS, and PRO supplementation exhibited a positive effect on growth performance, while lipid peroxidation of the meat decreased in birds fed AEO and DEO diets. The intestinal morphometric indices increased in quail fed the AEO, MOS, and DEO diets. Supplementation with MOS modulated intestinal microbial populations of the Japanese quail.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428100>Fecal Changes Following Introduction of Milk in Infants With Outgrowing Non-IgE Cow's Milk Protein Allergy Are Influenced by Previous Consumption of the Probiotic LGG.</a></h1><p>Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common allergy in the first year of life. Non-IgE mediated CMPA is characterized by digestive symptoms and tolerance development before the age of three. Gut microbiota composition in early life has been associated with food allergy. The ingestion of different foods/nutrients may mark different shifts in the microbial colonization of the infant intestine as well as the consumption of .  To analyze changes in microbiota composition and metabolic and cytokine profiles in fecal samples from infants with non-IgE mediated CMPA after successful milk challenges, tolerance acquisition, and increasing dairy introduction in their diet.  Twelve children with CMPA, aged between 1 and  years old, were recruited for the study. Participants were initially consuming hypoallergenic hydrolyzed formulas (four of them supplemented with the probiotic  GG), before being exposed to a standardized oral challenge (SOC) with cow's milk. Fecal samples were collected before, 1 week, and 1 month after performing the SOC. Changes in gut microbiota were determined by high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Levels of lactobacilli were also determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microbial metabolites were analyzed by chromatographic methods and fecal cytokines related to the Th1/Th2 balance were determined by immunoassay.  Lactic acid bacteria significantly increased in infants who outgrew non-IgE CMPA, after the introduction of milk. Microbial metabolites derived from the fermentation of proteins, such as branched chain fatty acids, and -cresol, diminished. After the SOC, some cytokines related to inflammation (TNF-α, IFN-γ) increased. Accompanying the introduction of an unrestricted diet, we found significant differences in fecal microbial composition, metabolites, and cytokines between infants who did not consume the probiotic  GG and those that did.  These findings indicate that the introduction of intact milk proteins is followed by modifications in the infant gut environment through changes in immune mediators, microbiota, and its metabolic end-products. Consumption of  during CMPA may contribute to gut homeostasis by fine-tuning these profiles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581386>Probiotic and antioxidant properties of noble  KCCM 12203P isolated from kimchi and evaluation of immune-stimulating activities of its heat-killed cells in RAW 264.7 cells.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the probiotic properties of  KCCM 12203P isolated from the Korean traditional food kimchi and to evaluate the antioxidative activity and immune-stimulating potential of its heat-killed cells to improve their bio-functional activities.  GG, which is a representative commercial probiotic, was used as a comparative sample. Regarding probiotic properties,  KCCM 12203P was resistant to 0.3% pepsin with a pH of .5 for 3 h and 0.3% oxgall solution for 24 h, having approximately a 99% survival rate. It also showed strong adhesion activity (6.84%) onto HT-29 cells and did not produce β-glucuronidase but produced high quantities of leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, β-galactosidase, and -acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. For antioxidant activity, it appeared that viable cells had higher radical scavenging activity in the ,-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, while in the -azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, heat-killed cells had higher antioxidant activity. Additionally,  KCCM 12203P showed higher lipid oxidation inhibition ability than  GG; however, there was no significant difference ( < 0.05) between heat-killed cells and control cells. Furthermore, heat-killed  KCCM 12203P activated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells without cytotoxicity at a concentration lower than 10 CFU/ml and promoted higher gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 than  GG. These results suggest that noble  KCCM 12203P could be used as a probiotic or applied to functional food processing and pharmaceutical fields for immunocompromised people.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364964>Bacteriocin activity of  and  ssp. .</a></h1><p>.

Accordingly, characterization of their bacteriocins, BacLP5 and BacLP9, was conducted to obtain information on their kinetic production, sensitivity to chemico-physical parameters and molecular weight. To investigate the possible use of the two  strains as , their gastrointestinal resistance, cellular adhesiveness and sensitivity to antibiotics were also studied.. The obtained data show that BacLP5 and BacLP9 most likely belong to class II bacteriocins and both have a molecular weight of approximately 3 kDa. The production of BacLP5 and BacLP9 started after 4 h (40 and 80 AU ml), respectively. Both of the  strains survived gastric and intestinal juices well and showed adhesive capability on HEp- cells.. Due to their peculiar antimicrobial characteristics,  ssp.

Metabotype-A only produces urolithin-A, metabotype-B yields urolithin-B and isourolithin-A in addition to urolithin-A, and metabotype 0 does not produce urolithins. Metabotype-A has been suggested to be 'protective', and metabotype-B dysbiotic-prone to cardiometabolic impairments. We analyzed the gut-microbiome of 40 healthy women and determined their metabotypes and enterotypes, and their associations with anthropometric and gut-microbial changes after 3 weeks, 4, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Metabotype-A was predominant in mothers who lost weight (≥ kg) (75%) versus metabotype-B (54%). After delivery, the microbiota of metabotype-A mothers changed, unlike metabotype-B, which barely changed over 1 year. The metabotype-A discriminating bacteria correlated to the decrease of the women's waist while some metabotype-B bacteria were inversely associated with a reduction of body mass index (BMI), waist, and waist-to-hip ratio. Metabotype-B was associated with a more robust and less modulating microbial and anthropometric profiles versus metabotype-A, in which these profiles were normalized through the 1-year follow-up postpartum. Consequently, urolithin metabotypes assessment could be a tool to anticipate the predisposition of women to normalize their anthropometric values and gut-microbiota, significantly altered during pregnancy and after childbirth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586210>Therapeutic Delivery of Ang(1-7) Via Genetically Modified Probiotic: A Dosing Study.</a></h1><p>In recent years a number of beneficial health effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that extend beyond lowering blood pressure, primarily mediated via the angiotensin converting enzyme- (ACE2)/angiotensin (1-7) or Ang(1-7)/MAS receptor axis. Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues. The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function. Indeed, genetically engineered recombinant  are promising treatment strategies offering delivery of therapeutic proteins with precision. An Ang(1-7) secreting Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) or LP-A has been described for regulation of diabetes and hypertension; however, we are the first to our knowledge to propose this paradigm as it relates to aging. In this Research Practice manuscript, we provide proof of concept for using this technology in a well-characterized rodent model of aging: the Fisher344 x Brown Norway Rat (F344BN). Our primary findings suggest that LP-A increases circulating levels of Ang(1-7) both acutely and chronically (after 8 or 28 treatment days) when administered 3 or 7x/week over 4 weeks. Our future preclinical studies will explore the impact of this treatment on gut and other age-sensitive distal tissues such as brain and muscle.© The Author(s) 2019.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards. No significant differences were observed in the main outcome, weight-gain (Control group: 5.77 Kg ± 0.95, Lf group: 5.77 Kg ± 1.31, Bb group: 5.58 Kg ± 1.10; p = 0.527). The three milk formulae were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were related to the consumption of any of the formula. Infants receiving B. breve CECT7263 had a 1.7 times lower risk of crying than the control group (OR = 0.569, CI 95% 0.568-0.571; p = 0.001). On the other hand, the incidence of diarrhoea in infants receiving the formula supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 was a 44% lower than in infants receiving the control formula (p = 0.014). The consumption of this Lactobacillus strain also reduced the duration of diarrhoea by .5 days versus control group (p = 0.044).The addition of L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263, two probiotic strains naturally found in breast milk, to infant formulae is safe and induces beneficial effects on the health of infants.The trial was retrospectively registered in the US Library of Medicine ( www.clinicaltrial.gov ) with the number  .

As a result, conventional dietary guidelines have focused on individual nutrients to maintain health and prevent disease. For dairy foods, this has led to general dietary recommendations to consume -3 daily servings of reduced-fat dairy foods, without regard to type (e.g., yogurt, cheese, milk), largely based on theorized benefits of isolated nutrients for bone health (e.g., calcium, vitamin D) and theorized harms of isolated nutrients for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and obesity (e.g., total fat, saturated fat, total calories). However, advances in nutrition science have demonstrated that foods represent complex matrices of nutrients, minerals, bioactives, food structures, and other factors (e.g., phoshopholipids, prebiotics, ) with correspondingly complex effects on health and disease. The present evidence suggests that whole-fat dairy foods do not cause weight gain, that overall dairy consumption increases lean body mass and reduces body fat, that yogurt consumption and  reduce weight gain, that fermented dairy consumption including cheese is linked to lower CVD risk, and that yogurt, cheese, and even dairy fat may protect against type  diabetes. Based on the current science, dairy consumption is part of a healthy diet, without strong evidence to favor reduced-fat products; while intakes of probiotic-containing unsweetened and fermented dairy products such as yogurt and cheese appear especially beneficial.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677091>A Multi-strain Potential Probiotic Formulation of GABA-Producing Lactobacillus plantarum 90sk and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 150 with Antidepressant Effects.</a></h1><p>Today, a number of studies conclusively show that certain bacterial strains, mainly from the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, influence the functioning of the central nervous system, leading to changes in beahvior, nociception and the cognitive abilities of humans and animals. Such strains serve as the basis for developing  with a curative potential for the central nervous system - psychobioitcs. However, the question of how to find such strains and which criteria to use for their selection remains unanswered. Some compounds produced by bacteria, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, are potential mediators between bacterial cells and the host. Previously, we established that some species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are capable of producing GABA. We presumed that GABA-producing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains are great candidates to use as psychobiotics. Therefore, we selected the strains Lactobacillus plantarum 90sk and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 150 as efficient GABA producers. The goal of this work was to assess the probiotic properties of the selected strains as well as their antidepressive effects in mice. We established that the ingestion of the probiotic composition based on the selected strains by BALB/c mice for  weeks reduced depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test; the effect was similar to that of fluoxetine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641523>Effects of metformin, acarbose, and sitagliptin monotherapy on gut microbiota in Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota was closely related to metabolic disorders such as type  diabetes. Oral antidiabetic medications including metformin, acarbose and sitagliptin lowered blood glucose levels via acting on the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the study was to observe the comparisons among those medications on gut microbiota composition.Zucker diabetic fatty rats (n=32) were randomly divided into four groups, and had respectively gastric administration of normal saline (control), metformin (215.15 mg/kg/day), acarbose (32.27 mg/kg/day), or sitagliptin (10.76 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood glucose levels were measured during an intragastric starch tolerance test after the treatments. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to access the microbiota in the fecal samples.Metformin, acarbose, and sitagliptin monotherapy effectively decreased fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels (p<0.001). Acarbose group displayed specific cluster and enterotype mainly composed by  while  was the dominant bacterium in the enterotype of the other three groups.

Inulin is one of the most common prebiotics that exhibit twisted hydrocolloidal properties in dairy products. The present study was designed to develop a synbiotic yogurt by incorporation of  and inulin at 1%, 1.5%, and % (w/v), comparing with the probiotic and control plain yogurts. Microrheological, microstructural, microbiological, sensory properties, and volatile compounds of the yogurt samples were evaluated. Microrheological analysis showed that addition of inulin to yogurt slightly reduced the values of G' and G″, while solid-liquid balance (SLB) values confirmed more solid properties of the synbiotic yogurt (0.582~0.595) than the plain yogurt (0.503~0.518). A total of 18 volatile compounds were identified in the synbiotic yogurt, while only five and six compounds were identified in plain and probiotic yogurts, respectively. Physiochemical parameters such as pH, acidity, and protein content were in the normal range (as with the control), while fat content in the synbiotic yogurt decreased significantly. Addition of 1% inulin not only reduced syneresis but also maintained viability of  after 28 days of storage. Microstructural and microrheological studies confirmed the dense, compressed, homogeneous structure of the synbiotic yogurt. Thus, addition of inulin improved the textural and sensory properties of the synbiotic yogurt, as well as survival of  with viable count above 6.0 log CFU/g in yogurt, as generally required for .

However, owing to a lack of consistency in nutritional and safety outcomes associated with , this topic remains controversial.  In this open-label pilot trial conducted between April 2013 and December 2013, we evaluated the safety of probiotic supplementation with 5 × 10 CFU of Lactobacillus casei LC5, 5 × 10 CFU of Bifidobacterium longum BG7, and  × 10 CFU of Bacillus coagulans SANK70258 in lactating women who exhibited allergies for  months (1-3 months postpartum); we also evaluated the effects of probiotic supplementation on transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels in human milk. Participants self-selected to join the probiotic ( = 41; age [median (interquartile range [IQR]), y] 33 [27-39], body mass index [BMI] [median (IQR), kg/m] 21.8 [19.5-22.8]) or no supplementation control group ( = 19; age [median (IQR), y] 33 [23-43], BMI [median (IQR), kg/m) 19.6 [18.4-22.1]).  (three tablets) received were taken as daily supplements. Milk samples were collected at 1, , and 3 months postpartum, and TGF-β1, TGF-β, and IgA levels were measured.  No adverse effects were observed in the probiotic group, according to the self-recorded diary during the study period. Milk IgA decreased with increasing postpartum months in both groups. In contrast, TGF- β1 and β were not affected by lactation periods, and showed different patterns over time between the two groups. TGF-β1, TGF-β1, and IgA levels were significantly correlated at baseline (respectively  < 0.05). However, the correlation between TGF-β1 and IgA became non-significant by the end of the intervention ( = 0.063).  Altogether, probiotic supplementation was tolerated with respect to no dropout and 91.5% adherence. Although probiotic supplementation might affect human milk TGF-β levels, a positive effect of probiotic supplementation was not entirely supported.

We attempted to validate the hypothesis that low bacterial diversity increases the risk of mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients with septic shock seen at  medical center from 2016 through 2019 were included in this cohort study. Total DNA was isolated from stool, and high-throughput sequencing was performed. Clinical data were extracted from patient medical records and hospital databases. Patients were grouped by gut microbiota bacterial diversity (measured by Shannon diversity index) on presentation. We used logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients with low Shannon diversity index. RESULTS Of the 150 patients enrolled in this study, low bacterial diversity (Shannon index <3.0) was found in 80 patients and normal diversity (Shannon index ≥3.0) was found in 70 patients. Low diversity was associated with a higher unadjusted mortality risk, compared to those with normal diversity (odds ratio [OR] .04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-.83). However, this result became non-significant after adjusting the confounding factors such as age, sex, severity of disease, comorbid status, usage of , enteral nutrition, and antimicrobial drugs (OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.55-.69).

Additionally, upregulation of apoptotic marker gene mRNA transcription was dramatically increased in 3D cultured cells compared to 2D systems. In conclusion, this study suggests that LCFS enhances the activation of intrinsic apoptosis in HCT-116 cells and the potential anti-cancer effects of Lactobacilli mixtures in 3D culture systems.

This was tested in a validated, dynamic in vitro model of the stomach and small intestine (TIM-1), simulating human adults after intake of a meal. Experiments were performed both in the gastric compartment of the model, as well as in the complete system (stomach + small intestine). Survival of the strains in an unformulated probiotic powder after transit through the gastric compartment was 5·3% for the bifidobacteria and 1% for L. gasseri. After transit through the complete gastrointestinal tract, this dropped to % for bifidobacteria and 0·1% for Lactobacillus. After several rounds of optimization, an enteric-coated tablet was developed that increased the delivery of viable cells reaching the small intestine to 72% (gastric survival) for bifidobacteria, and 53% (gastric) for L. gasseri. Also survival in the small intestine increased by about an order of magnitude. The final galenical formulation was tested in two applications: adults and elderly, both of which have their own physiological parameters. These experiments corroborated the results obtained in the development phase of the project. In conclusion, the developed enteric coating led to a 20- to 40-fold increase in the delivery of viable cells to the small intestine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Predictive GI in vitro models are very helpful and reliable tools for the development of new galenical formula containing , and in the current example helped to deliver >10-fold higher numbers of viable cells to the small intestine, presumably leading to improved functionality of the strains.© 2019 The Authors.

There are many factors that are speculated to interact in the development of eczema including genetics and environmental exposures. Prevention of the development of eczema may prevent the further development of food allergies and asthma. This concept has prompted a variety of research into the area of primary prevention of eczema in infants. This exploration includes a growing body of research examining infants supplemented with , prebiotics, or both (synbiotics) often compared with their breastfed counterparts. The goal of this paper is to examine the evidence for manipulating the microbiome in the prevention of eczema. Several strains of , compositions of prebiotics, and varied combinations of both are commercially available.

The MJM60397 strain was susceptible to antibiotics and was found to be non-mucinolytic and non-hemolytic, and does not produce bioamines. In addition, MJM60397 tolerated simulated oro-gastrointestinal conditions and adhered to Caco- cells. MJM60397 also exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity and could deconjugate bile acids. The hypocholesterolemic effects of strain MJM60397 were studied in high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemic male ICR mice. The mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) and were divided into the following three experimental groups: HCD-control (HCD-Con), mice fed with HCD + L. fermentum MJM60397 (HCD-MJM60397), and mice fed with HCD + L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 (HCD-L.ac) as the positive control. Simultaneously, a normal control diet (NCD) group was maintained. After 7 weeks, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the livers of the HCD-MJM60397 mice when compared to those in the HCD-Con and HCD-L.ac mice. Fecal total bile acid content was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the HCD-MJM60397 group than in the NCD, HCD-Con, and HCD-L.ac groups. Analysis of gene expression revealed higher expression of LDLR gene in the livers of the HCD-MJM60397 and HCD-L.ac mice than in the livers of the HCD-Con mice. These findings show that the hypocholesterolemic effects of the MJM60397 strain were attributable to its bile salt deconjugating activity, which resulted in decreased bile acid absorption and increased excretion of bile acids in the feces. These results indicate that L. fermentum MJM60397 could be developed into a potential probiotic for reducing the serum cholesterol levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664166>Mechanism and therapeutic prospect of resveratrol combined with TRAIL in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been reported to kill a wide variety of tumor cells with minimal effects on normal cell. However, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells 786-0 and OS-RC- were resistant to TRAIL. The present study examines the potential of combining polyphenolic compound resveratrol (RES) with TRAIL. We found that RES can sensitize RCC cells to TRAIL-induced death. Electron microscopy analyses showed that RES plus TRAIL can induce both autophagy and apoptosis in RCC cells. It was proved that the apoptosis is caspase-dependent and the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was involved in this process. Besides, we also found that XIAP expression was significantly inhibited after RES plus TRAIL treatment in RCC cells. Furthermore, a fiber-modified replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5/35-TRAIL was generated to test the synergistic effect of RES and TRAIL in vivo. Our data demonstrated that RES plus Ad5/35-TRAIL significantly inhibited RCC xenograft growth in nude mice. These results suggest the possibility of a new combination therapeutic leading to the improvement of RCC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321197>Zinc-enriched  enhanced growth performance, antioxidant status, immune function, gene expression, and morphological characteristics of Wistar rats raised under high ambient temperature.</a></h1><p>The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of zinc-enriched  (ZnP) on growth performance, antioxidant status, immune function, related gene expression, and morphological characteristics of Wistar rats raised under high heat stress condition during summer. 36, 6-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups; fed with basal diet (control), basal diet with  (P), and basal diet with zinc-enriched  supplementation (ZnP, 100 mg/L), for 40 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected through intracardiac method on the last day of experiment and tissues were collected from liver, heart, and kidneys. The results revealed that both P and ZnP significantly (< 0.05) enhanced growth performance. However, ZnP remarkably increased glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities but reduced malondialdehyde level in serum of the Wistar rats. The concentration of IL-, IL-6, and IFN-γ was significantly (< 0.05) increased with treatments of P and ZnP compared to control group while IL-10 was significantly (< 0.05) decreased. Additionally, the expression of SOD1, SOD2, MT1, and MT2 genes was significantly (< 0.05) up-regulated with the treatment of ZnP, but Hsp90 and Hsp70 heat shock genes were significantly (< 0.05) down-regulated with the treatment of P and ZnP, respectively. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed that both P and ZnP supplementation treatments induced changes in villus height and intestinal wall thickness. In conclusion, zinc-enriched  supplementation can improve the growth performance of Wistar rats under high ambient temperature through enhancing antioxidant status, immune function, related genes expression, and intestinal morphological characteristics. This product may serves as a potential nutritive supplement for Wistar rats under high heat stress conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553789>Antimicrobial peptide presenting potential strain-specific real time polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri KUB-AC5 in chicken intestine.</a></h1><p>The gene coding for antimicrobial peptides produced by probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri KUB-AC5 located on the cloned DNA fragment I-C46 containing  open reading frames I-C46-F2.1 and I-C46-F2. were designed for strain-specific primers P1 and P2, respectively, and assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. According to the obtained results, primer P1 has limited strain specificity. Primer P2 exhibited high efficacy and specificity at annealing temperature of 70°C while P1 annealed at 57°C causing nonspecific bands. Hence, P2 was selected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by isothermal annealing and extension reaction at high temperature of 70°C resulting in linearity for its DNA sequences ranging from 102 to 107 target copy numbers per assay, and displaying a detection limit of 6.17 log cfu/g of cecal digesta. Using spike testing, this system was able to detect 7.88 ± 0.06 to 11.78 ± 0.06 log copy number/g of digesta, higher than cultivation assay at about 1 log cfu/g, with good correlation of 0.99.

Accordingly, the aim of this population-based study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of  as an adjunct to standard therapy in Filipino children with acute community-acquired diarrhea of viral origin or associated with antibiotic administration.A total of 3178 patients (median age of  years) were enrolled in this open-label, multicenter, observational study, and were treated with one to two vials of  in the following bacterial stains: O/C, SIN, N/R, and T (oral suspension of  billion spores per 5-mL vial) for 5 to 7 days. Diarrhea duration, number of stools per day, improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms, children's overall acceptability of  therapy, and safety and tolerability were assessed. Concomitant treatment with oral rehydration solutions (26.6%), zinc (23.9%), and antibiotics prescribed for conditions other than diarrhea (13.6%) was recorded during the study. All other  and antidiarrheals were prohibited.Therapy with  was well-tolerated, and the adverse event rate was very low (0.09%). All reported adverse events, which included vomiting, erythematous rashes and stool color change, were mild to moderate.

Forty rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. The sham (control and prevention) group received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, the Alzheimer group received ICV injection of Aβ(1-42), and the probiotic+Alzheimer group received 500 mg  daily (15×10 colony-forming unit) by gavage for 4 weeks before and  weeks after injection of Aβ(1-42). The Morris water maze test was performed for evaluation of spatial learning and memory. LTP and PPF ratios were measured to evaluate longterm synaptic plasticity and pre-synaptic mechanisms, respectively. The results showed that probiotic supplementation significantly improved learning, but not memory impairment, and increased PPF ratios compared to those in the Alzheimer group. Both Aβ(1-42) injection and probiotic supplementation alone did not significantly effect plasma level of NO. Probiotic supplementation of rats in the probiotic (6 weeks)+Alzheimer group decreased serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol significantly compared to the Alzheimer group. The results of this study suggest that probiotic supplementation may positively impact learning capacity and LTP in rats with AD, most likely via the release of neurotransmitters via presynaptic mechanisms or via a protective effect on serum lipid profiles.Copyright © 2019 by The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31338788>Characteristic of Bacteriocins of Lactobacillus rhamnosus BTK 20-12 Potential Probiotic Strain.</a></h1><p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious health threat throughout the world resulting in reduced efficacy of antibacterial, antiparasitic, antiviral, and antifungal drugs. One of the most promising concepts that may represent a good alternative to antibiotics can be the use of bacteriocins obtained from lactic acid bacteria. The L. rhamnosus BTK 20-12 strain was isolated from traditional Armenian naturally fermented salted cheese. The probiotic potential of the strain was approved. It was shown that strain produced at less two bacteriocins (BCN 1 and BCN ) with different molecular weight (1427 Da and 602.6 Da, respectively). Bacteriocins inhibited the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria of different etiologies and belong to different taxonomic groups with diverse efficiency and it depends on properties of bacteriocins, as well as from isolation sources of pathogens.

Thus, in the present study, we addressed the effects of Sb supplementation on the rate of oxygen consumption (VO), mechanical efficiency (external work divided by VO), and aerobic performance of rats subjected to fatiguing, incremental-speed exercise. Twenty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: (1) non-supplemented, in which rats received 0.1 mL of a saline solution, and () Sb-supplemented, in which rats received 0.1 mL of a suspension containing 8.0 log colony-forming units. The rats received the treatments by gavage for 10 consecutive days; they were then subjected to fatiguing treadmill running. Sb supplementation did not change the VO values or mechanical efficiency during submaximal exercise intensities. In contrast, at fatigue, VO was increased by 12.7% in supplemented rats compared with controls ( = 0.01).

We evaluated the effect of a proanthocyanidin-rich avocado peel polyphenol extract (AvPPE) on the composition and metabolic activity of human fecal microbiota cultured for 24 h in a bioreactor in the presence of high protein (HP) amounts and the effect of the resulting culture supernatants (CSs) on HT-29Glc and Caco- cells. AvPPE decreased the HP-induced production of ammonia, HS, propionate, and isovalerate and increased that of indole and butyrate. Microbiota composition was marginally affected by HP, whileAvPPE increased the microorganisms/abundance of phylum Actinobacteria, families Coriobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae, and genus . AvPPE failed to prevent the HP-induced decrease of HT-29Glc cell viability and energy efficiency but prevented the HP-induced alterations of barrier function in Caco- cells. Additionally, the genotoxic effect of the CSs upon HT-29Glc was attenuated by AvPPE.

Gallstones can be pigmentary, cholesterol (75%) or mixed. Age, female sex, obesity, rapid weight loss, consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, iron deficiency, vitamin D and low intake of fiber and vitamin C are factors associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis. On the other hand, the intake of ω-3 fatty acids, oleic acid, calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric acid and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> .5 l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading  (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary. The nutritional intervention is an effective measure in the prevention of biliary and renal lithiasis and prevent its recurrence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366385>Effects of probiotic supplementation on post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome in rodent model.</a></h1><p> have been reported to be the active component used in the treatment of many functional gastrointestinal symptoms and syndromes.

Randomized controlled trials have shown positive effects of  on clinical outcomes in these commonly occurring RTIs. Two meta-analyses published by the York Health Economics Consortium (YHEC) and Cochrane reported the efficacy of  in reducing incidence and duration of RTIs, number of antibiotic courses, and days absent from work. The aim of this study was to assess the potential health-economic impact of  on RTI-associated events and expenses in the US primary care setting. A state-transition microsimulation model reproduced a study population representative of the US national demographics for age and gender (1/1,000 sample). RTI incidence was based on the influenza-like illness outpatient consultation rate reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView. Data on vaccination, on factors that negatively impact RTI outcomes, on resource utilization, and on productivity loss were obtained from US national databases. Analyses were performed for both meta-analyses independently. Outcomes included cost savings for the health care payer, related to a reduced number of RTI episodes, less outpatient consultations, and decreased medical prescriptions as well as cost savings from a broader societal perspective related to productivity loss. The analysis showed that generalized probiotic intake in the US population for 2017-2018 would have allowed cost savings for the health care payer of 4.6 million USD based on the YHEC scenario and 373 million USD for the Cochrane scenario, by averting 19 million and 54.5 million RTI sick days, respectively, compared to no . Antibiotic prescriptions decreased with 1.39-.16 million courses, whereas absence from work decreased by 3.58-4. million days when applying the YHEC and Cochrane data, respectively. When productivity loss is included, total savings for society represented 784 million or 1.4 billion USD for the YHEC and Cochrane scenarios, respectively. Subgroup analyses demonstrated an incremental benefit of  in at-risk groups, which might be of relevance for targeted interventions. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model outcomes. Our analysis demonstrated a positive impact of  on the health care and economic burden of flu-like RTIs. Improved disease outcomes translated into considerable cost savings for both the payer and society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482674>Necrotizing Enterocolitis Reduction Using an Exclusive Human-Milk Diet and Probiotic Supplementation in Infants With 1000-1499 Gram Birth Weight.</a></h1><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major complication confronting clinicians caring for premature infants. This investigation compares clinical outcomes before and after quality improvement-program interventions in a population of premature infants at intermediate risk for NEC.This study is a retrospective single-center chart review of infants admitted with a birth weight of 1000-1499 g, excluding major congenital anomalies, over a 6-year period, beginning with implementation of a donor breast-milk program when mother's own milk was not available. Infants were separated into  epochs, before (July 2012-December 2013) and after (April 2014-June 2018) introduction of human milk-derived fortifier (Prolacta) and a daily probiotic (FloraBABY) supplement.Comparing 140 preintervention infants with 265 postintervention infants, NEC was significantly lower in the postintervention group: 5.% vs 1.1% (P = 0.046). Somatic growth was similar in both epochs.Quality-improvement initiatives utilizing an exclusive human-milk diet and daily probiotic supplementation were associated with a decreased incidence of NEC in infants with a birth weight of 1000-1499 g. Implementation of the NEC reduction bundle did not affect infant growth.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391121>Lactobacillus reuteri extracts promoted wound healing via PI3K/AKT/β-catenin/TGFβ1 pathway.</a></h1><p>The balance of oral microbiomes is crucial to maintain oral health. Microecological imbalance can impair the function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and lead to delay wound healing.  is a promising prevention approach for the treatment of oral inflammatory diseases caused by a bacterial infection. However, the effect of  on oral MSCs and wound healing is unclear. In the present study, we used one type of  Lactobacillus reuteri extracts to determine whether bacterial extracts could regulate the functions of gingiva MSCs (GMSCs) and promote wound healing.Lactobacillus reuteri was prepared with bacterial extracts using ultrasonic crushing apparatus. The effects of Lactobacillus reuteri extracts on GMSCs were tested using the cell scratch migration, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin red staining, cell counting kit-8, real-time PCR, and western blot assays. To investigate the role of Lactobacillus reuteri extracts in the wound in mice, the wound position of bilateral mesial gingival of the maxillary first molar was established, the wound area with a size of 1 mm ×  mm and the full thickness gingiva was removed. Mice with wound were randomly distributed to two groups: injection of 0.9% NaCl (NS group) or injection of 50 μg/ml bacterial extracts.We discovered that 50 μg/ml Lactobacillus reuteri extracts increased the capacities of migration, expression of stem cell markers, osteogenic differentiation, and proliferation of GMSCs. In addition, local injection of 50 μg/ml bacterial extracts could promote wound-healing process in mice models. Mechanistically, we found that Lactobacillus reuteri extracts accelerated the process of wound healing via PI3K/AKT/β-catenin/TGFβ1 pathway.These data showed that Lactobacillus reuteri extracts could activate the potentials of GMSCs, thus promote wound healing. Our discovery provided the insight of the underlying mechanism activating functions of MSCs and identified Lactobacillus reuteri extracts as a potential therapeutic strategy for accelerating oral wound and potential application in the future dental clinic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620482>Dietary administration of  modulates non-specific immunity and gut microbiota of Nile tilapia () cultured in low input ponds.</a></h1><p>Poor culture conditions in low input ponds make fish highly susceptible to infectious pathogens which lead to diseases and mortalities yet the effects of  on immunity, gut microbiota and microbiological quality of fish in low input ponds are unknown.

However, current evidence on their effects is conflicting.A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and WHO Global Index Medicus electronic databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating  or synbiotics in adult patients undergoing elective colorectal, upper gastrointestinal, transplant, or hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery. Bibliographies of studies were also searched. The primary outcome measure was incidence of postoperative infectious complications. Secondary outcomes included incidence of noninfectious complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, and any treatment-related adverse events. Quantitative pooling of the data was undertaken using a random effects model.A total of 34 randomized controlled trials reporting on 2723 participants were included. In the intervention arm, 1354 patients received prebiotic or symbiotic preparations, whereas 1369 patients in the control arm received placebo or standard care. Perioperative administration of either  or synbiotics significantly reduced the risk of infectious complications following abdominal surgery [relative risk (RR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.69; P < 0.00001, n = 2723, I = 42%]. Synbiotics showed greater effect on postoperative infections compared with  alone (synbiotics RR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.33-0.66; P < 0.0001, n = 1399, I = 53%  RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53-0.80; P < 0.0001, n = 1324, I = 18%). Synbiotics but not  also led to a reduction in total length of stay (synbiotics weighted mean difference: -3.89; 95% CI: -6.60 to -1.18 days; P = 0.005, n = 535, I = 91%  RR: -0.65; 95% CI: -.03-0.72; P = 0.35, n = 294, I = 65%). There were no significant differences in mortality (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.54-1.80; P = 0.96, n = 1729, I = 0%) or noninfectious complications between the intervention and control groups. The preparations were well tolerated with no significant adverse events reported. and synbiotics are safe and effective nutritional adjuncts in reducing postoperative infective complications in elective abdominal surgery. The treatment effects are greatest with synbiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526274>Complex interactions between the microbiome and cancer immune therapy.</a></h1><p>Immuno-oncology has rapidly grown in the last thirty years, and immunotherapeutic agents are now approved to treat many disparate cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are employed to augment cytotoxic anti-cancer activity by inhibiting negative regulatory elements of the immune system. Modulating the immune system to target neoplasms has improved survivability of numerous cancers in many individuals, but forecasting outcomes post therapy is difficult due to insufficient predictive biomarkers. Recently, the tumor and gastrointestinal microbiome and immune milieu have been investigated as predictors and influencers of cancer immune therapy. In this review, we discuss: (1) ways to measure the microbiome including relevant bioinformatic analyses, () recent developments in animal studies and human clinical trials utilizing gut microbial composition and function as biomarkers of cancer immune therapy response and toxicity, and (3) using prebiotics, , postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) to modulate immune therapy. We discuss the respective benefits of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing including important considerations in obtaining samples and in designing and interpreting human and animal microbiome studies. We then focus on studies discussing the differences in response to ICIs in relation to the microbiome and inflammatory mediators. ICIs cause colitis in up to 25% of individuals, and colitis is often refractory to common immunosuppressive medications. Researchers have measured microbiota composition prior to ICI therapy and correlated baseline microbiota composition with efficacy and colitis. Certain bacterial taxa that appear to enhance therapeutic benefit are also implicated in increased susceptibility to colitis, alluding to a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory tumor killing and anti-inflammatory protection from colitis. Pre-clinical and clinical models have trialed probiotic administration, e.g.  or FMT, to treat colitis when immune suppressive agents fail. We are excited about the future of modulating the microbiome to predict and influence cancer outcomes. Furthermore, novel therapies employed for other illnesses including bacteriophage and genetically-engineered microbes can be adapted in the future to promote increased advancements in cancer treatment and side effect management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614915>Targeted Release of  from Enteric Microparticulated Formulations.</a></h1><p>The development of advanced probiotic delivery systems, which preserve bacteria from degradation of the gastrointestinal tract and achieve a targeted release mediated by pH-independent swelling, is of great interest to improve the efficient delivery of probiotic bacteria to the target tissue. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria models ( (Moro) Hansen and Mocquot (ATCC® 4356™) and  S17, respectively) have been successfully encapsulated for the first time in pH-independent microparticulate polymethacrylates (i.e., Eudraguard biotic) used for the targeted delivery of nutraceuticals to the colon. These bacteria have also been encapsulated within the mucoadhesive polymethacrylate Eudragit RS 100 widely used as targeted release formulation for active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Buoyancies of 90.% and 57.3% for Eudragit and Eudraguard microparticles, respectively, and long-term stability (5 months) for the encapsulated microorganisms were found. Cytotoxicity of the microparticles formulated with both polymers was evaluated (0.5-20 mg/mL) on Caco- cells, showing high cytocompatibility.

Biogenic Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) synthesized by  possess relatively strong chemical stability, high bioavailability, and low toxicity, this makes them potential Se supplements. Previously, we demonstrated that SeNPs synthesized by  ATCC 393 can alleviate hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced human and porcine intestinal epithelial cells' oxidative damage. However, the antioxidant mechanism remains unclear.  The possible antioxidant mechanism and protective effect of SeNPs on intestinal epithelial permeability and mitochondrial function were evaluated by establishing an HO-induced oxidative damage model of human colon mucosal epithelial cells (NCM460) and conducting Nrf2 inhibitor interference experiments. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial DNA content, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), ROS, and protein expression levels of Nrf2-related genes were determined. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy.  An amount of 4 μg Se/mL of SeNPs synthesized by  ATCC 393 alleviated increase of ROS, reduced ATP and MMP, and maintained intestinal epithelial permeability in NCM460 cells challenged by HO. In addition, SeNPs improved the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1. Moreover, SeNPs attenuated the damage of mitochondrial ultrastructure caused by oxidative stress. Nrf2 inhibitor (ML385) abolished the regulatory effect of SeNPs on intracellular ROS production.  Data suggest that biogenic SeNPs synthesized by  ATCC 393 can protect the intestinal epithelial barrier function against oxidative damage by alleviating ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction via Nrf2 signaling pathway. Biogenic SeNPs are an attractive candidate for potential Se supplement agent in preventing oxidative stress-related intestinal disease by targeting mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606256>The effect of  on the incidence of Clostridioides difficile: Retrospective cohort analysis.</a></h1><p>Conflicting evidence exists regarding  and the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This study evaluates whether  are efficacious for CDI prophylaxis in patients receiving antibiotics.A retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to NYU Winthrop Hospital who received at least 1 dose of antibiotics considered high risk of inducing CDI. Patients were grouped according to probiotic use; association between probiotic use and incident CDI was examined. A model for incident CDI adjusting for known CDI risk factors was estimated.Of 3,267 patients, 4.6% had CDI within 12 weeks of antibiotics initiation. A total of 5.1% received  within 24 hours of initiation, and 6.6% initiated  during the 12-week follow-up. Of those taking  within 24 hours of antibiotics, 9.6% had CDI, and of those not taking  4.% had CDI (relative risk, .3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 3.7). In time-dependent Cox models accounting for probiotic initiation and adjusting for potential confounders, a positive association between  and CDI remained significant (hazard ratio, .7; P < .001).Patients who received antibiotics with concurrent  were more likely to have an incident of CDI compared with those who did not receive . Additional risk factors were histamine  receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and administration of multiple antibiotics simultaneously.The present study, because of its large population and inclusion of multiple variables playing a role in CDI, serves as a valuable resource when considering efficacy of  as CDI prophylaxis.Copyright © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

Adequate nutrition is crucial for healthy brain development. Maternal breast milk is first choice of post-natal enteral nutrition for preterm infants. However, breast milk contains insufficient nutrient quantities to meet the greater nutritional needs of preterm infants, meaning that supplementation is recommended.  To provide an overview of current literature on potential nutritional interventions for improvement of neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants, by taking a bench to bedside approach from pre-clinical models of neonatal brain injury to randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in preterm infants.  Separate clinical and pre-clinical searches were performed in Medline and Embase for English written papers published between 08/2008 and 08/2018 that studied a single nutritional component. Papers were included if one of the following components was studied: lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, , prebiotics, oligosaccharides, fatty acids, or amino acids, with brain injury, brain development or neurodevelopmental outcome as outcome measure in preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1,500 g) or in animal models of neonatal brain injury.  In total, ,671 pre-clinical studies and 852 RCTs were screened, of which 24 pre-clinical and 22 RCTs were included in this review. In these trials supplementation with amino acids and protein, lipids,  (only clinical), prebiotics (only clinical), vitamins, and minerals was studied. All included pre-clinical studies show positive effect of supplementation on brain injury and/or neurodevelopment. Although some nutrients, such as glutamine, show promising short term outcome in clinical studies, no evident long term effect of any supplemented nutrient was found. Main limitations were inclusion of studies no older than 10 years at time of search and studies that focused on single nutritional components only.  Even though many pre-clinical trials demonstrate promising effects of different nutritional interventions on reducing brain injury and/or improving neurodevelopmental outcome, these positive effects have so far not evidently been demonstrated in RCTs. More clinically relevant animal models and long term follow up after clinical trials are needed to move novel nutritional therapies from bench to bedside of preterm infants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615799>Preventive strategies and factors associated with surgically treated necrotising enterocolitis in extremely preterm infants: an international unit survey linked with retrospective cohort data analysis.</a></h1><p>To compare necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) prevention practices and NEC associated factors between units from eight countries of the International Network for Evaluation of Outcomes of Neonates, and to assess their association with surgical NEC rates.Prospective unit-level survey combined with retrospective cohort study.Neonatal intensive care units in Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Finland, Israel, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Tuscany (Italy).Extremely preterm infants born between 24 to 28 weeks' gestation, with birth weights<1500 g, and admitted between 2014-2015.NEC prevention practices (, feeding, donor milk) using responses of an on-line pre-piloted questionnaire containing 10 questions and factors associated with NEC in literature (antenatal steroids, c-section, indomethacin treated patent ductus arteriosus and sepsis) using cohort data.Surgical NEC rates and death following NEC using cohort data.The survey response rate was 91% (153 units). Both probiotic provision and donor milk availability varied between 0%-100% among networks whereas feeding initiation and advancement rates were similar in most networks. The 9792 infants included in the cohort study to link survey results and cohort outcomes, revealed similar baseline characteristics but considerable differences in factors associated with NEC between networks. 397 (4.1%) neonates underwent NEC surgery, ranging from .4%-8.4% between networks. Standardised ratios for surgical NEC were lower for Australia/New Zealand, higher for Spain, and comparable for the remaining six networks.The variation in implementation of NEC prevention practices and in factors associated with NEC in literature could not be associated with the variation in surgical NEC incidence. This corroborates the current lack of consensus surrounding the use of preventive strategies for NEC and emphasises the need for research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Little is known about the effects of probiotic supplementation on symptoms of depression and quality of life (QOL) in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 44 patients with a recent diagnosis of MI who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Lactobacillus rhamnosus capsules 1.6 ×10 colony-forming unit (CFU) with their lunch (the active intervention group) or capsules that contained maltodextrin (the placebo control group) for 12 weeks.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.</a></h1><p>Yogurt is a good source of , calcium, and proteins, but its content of vitamin D is low. Therefore, yogurt could be a good choice for vitamin D fortification to improve the positive health outcomes associated with its consumption. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of vitamin D-fortified yogurt compared with plain yogurt on levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD). The secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of fortified yogurt on parathyroid hormone, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and lipid profile. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for eligible studies; that is, randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared vitamin D-fortified yogurt with control treatment without any additional supplement. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. Findings from 9 RCT (n = 665 participants) that lasted from 8 to 16 wk are summarized in this review. The meta-analyzed mean differences for random effects showed that vitamin D-fortified yogurt (from 400 to ,000 IU) increased serum 25OHD by 31.00 nmol/L. In addition, vitamin D-fortified yogurt decreased parathyroid hormone by 15.47 ng/L, body weight by 0.92 kg, waist circumference by .01 cm, HOMA-IR by .18 mass units, fasting serum glucose by 22.54 mg/dL, total cholesterol by 13.38 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 30.12 mg/dL compared with the controlled treatments. No publication bias was identified. Considerable between-study heterogeneity was observed for most outcomes. Vitamin D-fortified yogurt may be beneficial in improving serum 25OHD, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and anthropometric parameters and decreasing parathyroid hormone level in pregnant women and adult and elderly subjects with or without diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

A re-instrumentation was carried out and probiotic or placebo drops were applied once split-mouth according to the study protocol. Patients afterwards received lozenges to use 2x/d for 12 weeks. Probing pocket depth (PPD), recession, bleeding on probing and plaque levels were analysed, next to the microbiological impact.No effects of the probiotic drops could be found. However, after 24 weeks the overall PPD in the probiotic lozenges group (.64±0.33mm) was significantly lower compared to the control lozenges (.92±0.42mm). This difference was even more pronounced in moderate (4-6mm) and deep (≥7mm) pockets. In the probiotic lozenges group, there were also significantly more pockets converting from ≥4mm at baseline to ≤3mm at 24 weeks (67±18% versus 54±17%) and less sites in need for surgery (4±4% versus 8±6%). However, the probiotic products did not influence the microbiological counts of the periodontopathogens.The adjunctive consumption of L. reuteri lozenges after re-instrumentation improved the PPD reduction, without an impact on pocket colonization with periodontopathogens.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Kefir consumption has been associated with many advantageous properties to general health, including as an antioxidative, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor moiety. This beverage is commonly found and consumed by people in the United States of America, China, France, Brazil, and Japan. Recently, the consumption of kefir has been popularized in other countries including Malaysia. The microflora in kefir from different countries differs due to variations in culture conditions and the starter media. Thus, this study was aimed at isolating and characterizing the lactic acid bacteria that are predominant in Malaysian kefir grains via macroscopic examination and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The results revealed that the Malaysian kefir grains are dominated by three different strains of Lactobacillus strains, which are Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillusparacasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The probiotic properties of these strains, such as acid and bile salt tolerances, adherence ability to the intestinal mucosa, antibiotic resistance, and hemolytic test, were subsequently conducted and extensively studied. The isolated Lactobacillus spp. from kefir H maintained its survival rate within 3 h of incubation at pH 3 and pH 4 at 98.0 ± 3.3% and 96.1 ± 1.7% of bacteria growth and exhibited the highest survival at bile salt condition at 0.3% and 0.5%. The same isolate also showed high adherence ability to intestinal cells at 96.3 ± 0.01%, has antibiotic resistance towards ampicillin, penicillin, and tetracycline, and showed no hemolytic activity. In addition, the results of antioxidant activity tests demonstrated that isolated Lactobacillus spp. from kefir G possessed high antioxidant activities for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and 1,1-diphenyl--picryl-hydrazine (DPPH) assay compared to other isolates. From these data, all Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Malaysian kefir serve as promising candidates for  foods and beverage since they exhibit potential probiotic properties and antioxidant activities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430963>Anti-Colorectal Cancer Effects of Probiotic-Derived p8 Protein.</a></h1><p>Recently, we reported a novel therapeutic probiotic-derived protein, p8, which has anti-colorectal cancer (anti-CRC) properties. In vitro experiments using a CRC cell line (DLD-1), anti-proliferation activity (about 20%) did not improve after increasing the dose of recombinant-p8 (r-p8) to >10 μM. Here, we show that this was due to the low penetrative efficiency of r-p8 exogenous treatment. Furthermore, we found that r-p8 entered the cytosol through endocytosis, which might be a reason for the low penetration efficiency. Therefore, to improve the therapeutic efficacy of p8, we tried to improve delivery to CRC cells. This resulted in endogenous expression of p8 and increased the anti-proliferative effects by up to -fold compared with the exogenous treatment (40 μM). Anti-migration activity also increased markedly. Furthermore, we found that the anti-proliferation activity of p8 was mediated by inhibition of the p53-p21-Cyclin B1/Cdk1 signal pathway, resulting in growth arrest at the G phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these results suggest that p8 is toxic to cancer cells, shows stable expression within cells, and shows strong cancer suppressive activity by inducing cell cycle arrest. Therefore, p8 is a strong candidate for gene therapy if it can be loaded onto cancer-specific viruses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623025>Probiotic extracts ameliorate nasal allergy by inducing interleukin-35-producing dendritic cells in mice.</a></h1><p>The therapeutic efficacy of allergic rhinitis (AR) needs to be improved.  have immunoregulatory functions.

The present study assessed anti-senescence potential of secretory metabolites of probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum (Lact. fermentum) using HO-induced model of senescence in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Application of HO-induced cellular senescence characterized by increased cell size and SA-β-gal activity, activation of SASP and reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage response and induction of cell cycle inhibitors (p53/p21/p16). Further, a robust stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and AMPK signaling was also observed in HO-treated cells. However, exposure of cells to cell-free supernatant of Lact. fermentum significantly attenuated phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and alleviated senescence markers p53, p21, SA-β-gal, p38MAPK, iNOS, cox-, ROS, NF-κB, and DNA damage response.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fermented milk containing L paracasei HP7 and G glabra in patients with H pylori infection.This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in  hospitals from April to December 2017. Patients with H pylori infection were randomized into either the treatment group (fermented milk with L paracasei HP7 and G glabra) or placebo group (fermented milk only) once daily for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the gastric load of H pylori measured by C-urea breath test (UBT). Secondary endpoints were histologic and clinical improvement.A total of 142 patients were randomly allocated to the treatment (n = 71) or placebo groups (n = 71). Compared to baseline data, the quantitative value of C-UBT at 8 weeks was significantly reduced in the treatment group (from 20.8 ± 13.% to 16.9 ± 10.8%, P = .035), but not in the placebo group (P = .130). Chronic inflammation improved significantly only in the treatment group (P = .013), whereas the neutrophil activity deteriorated significantly only in the placebo group (P = .003). Moreover, the treatment group had significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (P = .049) and quality of life (P = .029). No serious adverse events were observed.The combination of fermented milk containing L paracasei and G glabra reduced H pylori density and improved histologic inflammation.

EntM (E 50 μL/animal/day in water) and sage extract (S 10 μL/animal/day in water) were applied individually and in combination (E+S) to rabbits during 21 days of treatment. The rabbits' growth was not significantly influenced by the additives. Lower feed conversion (FC) was noted in the experimental groups compared with controls, with the lowest data detected in E. The antimicrobial activity of EntM was noted (in E+S: lactic acid bacteria-P < 0.01; in E, E+S: enterococci, enterobacteria-P > 0.05; in E: clostridia-P > 0.05). The most significant changes in fermentation between weaned and older rabbits were noted in amylolytic activity at day 21 (E P < 0.05; E + S P < 0.05); prolonged reduction effect of sage extract on amylolytic activity was observed. The activity of cellulase, pectinase and xylanase was higher in older than in younger animals. Decrease in lactic acid and volatile fatty acids was noted during EntM administration, with significant effect on propionic acid concentration (E P < 0.05; E+S P < 0.001). The sage extract reduced propionic acid (S P < 0.001) and butyric acid levels (S P < 0.05) and increased the concentrations of butyric, iso-valeric, valeric, caproic acids and lactic acid (P < 0.001).

Old age alters our metabolic and regenerative capacity. Following recruitment of 65 human subjects in the age range of 70 to 82, we discerned healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) cohorts discordant in the occurrence of one or more major diseases: (1) cancer, () acute or chronic cardiovascular diseases, (3) acute or chronic pulmonary diseases, (4) diabetes, and (5) stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed these cohorts' oral microbiomes (saliva) and gut microbiomes (stool) to assess diversity and identify microbial biomarkers for HA. In contrast to the gut microbiome where no change was observed, we found that the saliva microbiome had higher α-diversity in the HA compared with the NHA group. We observed the genus Akkermansia to be significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of the HA group. Akkermansia muciniphila is a colonic mucin-degrading bacterium believed to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 was a taxon increased in abundance in the HA cohort.

Azurin protein was produced by cloning the azurin gene into pET21a and heterologous expression in E. coli BL21. The protein was purified using affinity chromatography and confirmed by Western blotting. The purified protein was evaluated by three experiments of adhesion and invasion assays, including exclusion, competition, and replacement. Azurin was observed to significantly inhibit the attachment and invasion of S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and E. coli, while no such inhibitory effects were observed on P. aeruginosa. In fact, the protein increased the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to the cell. In conclusion, our study proposes that azurin is a potential prophylactic or preventive helper candidate to inhibit the attachment and invasion of pathogenic bacteria to host cells and reduce the progression of the infection process. Our study also reveals the involvement of azurin in bacteria-host cell interactions, providing novel and important insights toward the elucidation of its biological function in this field. Thus, this study provides new opportunities to use azurin as an adjunct therapy against critical stages of infection by a wide range of pathogenic bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384325>Prebiotics and  in atopic dermatitis.</a></h1><p>Recent years have brought additional data on the benefits of prebiotics and  treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis.

The correction of such bowel problems could therefore make an important contribution to improving population health and quality-adjusted lifespan. We examined independent and interactive effects upon the fecal microbiota of two potentially favorable determinants of intestinal motility: the intake frequency of a fermented milk product containing  strain Shirota (LcS) and the quantity/quality of habitual physical activity in 338 community-living Japanese aged 65-92 years. Subjects were arbitrarily grouped on the basis of questionnaire estimates of LcS intake (0-, 3-5, and 6-7 days/week) and pedometer/accelerometer-determined patterns of physical activity [<7000 and ≥7000 steps/day, or <15 and ≥15 min/day of activity at an intensity >3 metabolic equivalents (METs)]. After adjustment for potential confounders, the respective numbers of various beneficial fecal bacteria tended to be larger in more frequent consumers of LcS-containing products, this trend being statistically significant (mostly  < 0.001) for total , the  subgroup, and the  cluster; in contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in fecal bacterial counts between the physical activity groups. A multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis estimated that the risk of infrequent bowel movements (arbitrarily defined as defecating ≤3 days/week) was significantly lower ( < 0.05) in subjects who ingested LcS-containing products 6-7 rather than 0- days/week [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.382 (0.149-0.974)] and was also lower in those who took ≥7000 rather than <7000 steps/day [0.441 (0.201-0.971)] or spent ≥15 rather than <15 min/day of physical activity at an intensity >3 METs [0.412 (0.183-0.929)]. The risk of infrequent bowel movements in subjects who combined 6-7 days/week of LcS with ≥7000 steps/day or ≥15 min/day of activity at >3 METs was only a tenth of that for individuals who combined 0- days/week of LcS with <7000 steps/day or <15 min/day at >3 METs. These results suggest that elderly individuals can usefully ingest LcS-containing supplements regularly (≥6 days/week) and also engage in moderate habitual physical activity (≥7000 steps/day and/or ≥15 min/day at >3 METs) in order to enhance their gastrointestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316478>A New Isolate of  (SL001) With Antibacterial Activity Against Fish Pathogens and Potency in Facilitating the Immunity and Growth Performance of Grass Carps.</a></h1><p>Probiotic-feeding continues to be a promising strategy to control the bacterial pathogens in aquaculture.

The challenge test against  showed that the survival rate of SL001-supplemented group was significantly higher than that of control group ( < 0.05). Moreover, SL001 could stably colonize in gut of grass carp and increased mucus-secreting goblet cells and extended intestinal villi could be observed in SL001-supplemented group ( < 0.05). Feeding with SL001 supplemented diet could significantly enhance the growth rate ( < 0.05) and markedly affect gut microbiota structure of grass carps, resulting in reduced potential pathogens and increased potential . Furthermore, feeding grass carps with SL001 caused the up-regulated expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1 and IGF-) and down-regulated expression of myostatin (MSTN-1 and MSTN-) ( < 0.05), which probably also account for the increased growth rate of SL001-fed group. Meanwhile, relative mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes in liver, spleen, and head kidney were analyzed in grass carps after feeding for 30 days with SL001 supplemented diets.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 on genital high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) clearance and quality of cervical smear.This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Women with genital HR-HPV infection were randomized into study and control groups. A probiotic or placebo preparation was administered orally (one capsule daily) until negative HR-HPV testing. A cervical smear and HR-HPV tests were performed at the beginning of the study and every 3 months thereafter until a negative result was obtained.A total of 121 women with genital HR-HPV infection were enrolled (62 in the study group and 59 in the control group). There was no significant difference in HR-HPV clearance rate between the two groups (58.1% vs. 54.%). The only factor predicting HR-HPV clearance was a lower initial viral load (HR 3.214; 95% CI: 1.398, 7.392; p = 0.006). Twenty-two women had a mildly abnormal initial cervical smear and nine had an unsatisfactory smear. At 6 months follow-up, both mildly abnormal cervical smear and unsatisfactory smear rates had decreased significantly in the study group compared to the control group (p = 0.017 and 0.027).The application of probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 did not influence genital HR-HPV clearance, but may have decreased the rates of mildly abnormal and unsatisfactory cervical smears.Clinicaltrials.gov  , May, 2012.

Most of the tested L. plantarum strains were considered safe. Whole bacterial cultures (WBC) and cell-free supernatants (CFSs) of L. plantarum strains inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus (average inhibition growth zones were .8 mm ± 1. and .8 mm ± 1.1 respectively). Moreover, almost all neutralized, catalase-treated cell-free supernatants (CFN) of L. plantarum cultures also exhibited slight anti-staphylococcal activity in vitro. The most promising strains Os4 and Kor14 were selected for further study. Both strains were able to survive during digestive gastro-intestinal passage model. Live cells of L. plantarum Os4 and Kor14 caused the strongest inhibition of S. aureus adhesion to Caco- cells comparing with CFN and heat-killed bacterial cells. S. aureus and L. plantarum (Os4 or Kor14) co-cultured in skim milk resulted in growth inhibition of S. aureus in both 8 °C and 37 °C incubation temperatures.

To prevent maternal GBS vaginal colonization, new antibiotic-free approaches, based on lactobacilli , are advisable. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-GBS activity of 14 vaginal Lactobacillus strains, belonging to different species (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis), isolated from healthy pre-menopausal women. In particular, we performed 'inhibition' experiments, evaluating the ability of both Lactobacillus cells and culture supernatants in reducing Streptococcus viability, after 60 min contact time. First, we demonstrated that the acidic milieu, produced by vaginal lactobacilli metabolism, is crucial in counteracting GBS growth in a pH-dependent manner. Experiments with organic/inorganic acid solutions confirmed the strict correlation between pH levels and the anti-GBS activity. GBS was more sensitive to lactic acid than to hydrochloric acid, indicating that the presence of H ions is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, experiments with Lactobacillus pH-adjusted supernatants led to exclude a direct role in the anti-GBS activity by other bioactive molecules. Second, we found that only a few Lactobacillus strains were able to reduce Streptococcus viability by means of cell pellets. The anti-GBS effect displayed by Lactobacillus cells was related to the their ability to interact and aggregate with Streptococcus cells. We found that the anti-GBS activity was retained after methanol/proteinase K treatment, but lost after lysozyme exposure of Lactobacillus cells. Therefore, we supposed that non-proteinaceous components of Lactobacillus cell wall could be responsible for the anti-GBS activity. In conclusion, we identified specific Lactobacillus strains able to interfere with GBS viability by multiple strategies and we elucidated some of the mechanisms of action. These strains could serve as probiotic formulations for the prevention of GBS vaginal colonization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study thus aims to evaluate the ability to survive under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and impact of Torulaspora delbrueckii B14 and Kluyveromyces lactis B10 as single and mixed inocula for cheese production. These two yeast strains were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal tracts and tested for self-aggregation, hydrophobicity, pathogen inhibition, antibiotic resistance, and β-galactosidase production. The yeast strains were also assessed for their ability to survive in different NaCl concentrations (.5%, 5%, and 10% w/v), multiple temperatures (4 °C and 40 °C), and used as single and mixed starter cultures for cheese production. Yeasts population levels were monitored by YPD plating and MALDI-TOF and metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS over the course of the 21 days cheese maturation process. T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 both showed >80% viability after the passage through the simulated gastrointestinal tract, had self-aggregation rates >90%, and displayed β-galactosidase activities of 0.35 U/g and 0.53 U/g, respectively. Both yeasts survived at .5%, 5%, and 10% NaCl for 21 days and showed growth at 4 °C. In cheese, the single inoculum of K. lactis B10 and mixed inoculum showed the highest levels of lactose consumption. HS-SPME GC-MS analysis of cheese samples allowed the identification of 38 volatile compounds. The highest concentrations of most of these compounds were observed after 21 days of maturation for the cheese produced with mixed inoculum. The most abundant acids detected were hexanoic and decanoic acid; the most abundant alcohols were ,3-butanediol, -phenylethanol and isoamyl alcohol, and the most prevalent ester compounds were isoamyl acetate and phenethyl acetate. Our results therefore show that T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 are interesting yeasts for further studies in the context of  and positively impact the composition of desirable volatile compounds in cheeses, particularly when used as mixed inoculum.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advances in the understanding of the gut microbiome have shown the role of gut micro-organisms in disease outcomes for distant organs-including the brain. Interventions targeting the gut microbiome have been shown to be effective in multiple neurological diagnoses, but there is little research into the role of the microbiome in migraine. This systematic review seeks to assess the current research landscape of randomized placebo controlled trials utilizing probiotic interventions as migraine prophylaxis. Searches were conducted of scientific databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, following PRISMA guidelines. Of 68 screened studies,  were eligible for analysis. Due to methodological differences, meta-analysis was not possible. Qualitative comparison of the studies demonstrated a dichotomy of results-one trial reported no significant change in migraine frequency and intensity, while the second trial reported highly significant improvements. No clear 'gold standard' currently exists for microbiome research, let alone for migraine-related microbiome research. The heterogeneity of outcome measures used in the two trials included in this systematic review shows the need for a standardization of outcome measures, therefore a series of recommendations for future probiotic-migraine research are included.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425831>Effects of potential probiotic Bacillus velezensis K2 on growth, immunity and resistance to Vibrio harveyi infection of hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus♂ × E. fuscoguttatus♀).</a></h1><p>Nowadays, there is no suitable treatment for vibriosis in groupers. So an eco-efficient and environmentally friendly treatment is necessary for the grouper industry. Probiotic-feeding has been a promising strategy to control the bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. A new Bacillus velezensis strain named K2 was isolated from the intestinal tract of healthy grouper, and exhibited wide antimicrobial spectrum of against fish pathogens, including Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas caviae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Lactococcus garvieae. Moreover, results of the safety of B. velezensis K2 showed that intraperitoneal injection of K2 in healthy grouper did not cause any pathological abnormality or death, indicating this bacteria could be considered as a candidate probiotic in aquaculture. Groupers were fed with the diets containing 1 × 10 cfu/g of B. velezensis K2 for 4 weeks. Various immune parameters were examined at 1, , 3, and 4 weeks of post-feeding. Results showed that diets supplemented with K2 significantly increased serum acid phosphatase (ACP) activity (P < 0.05). Results of the mRNA expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney of hybrid grouper showed that the expression of lysozyme gene was significantly upregulated after 1 and  weeks of feeding (P < 0.05). A significant up-regulation of the expression of piscidin, IgM and MyD88 were detected at day 21, whereas the TLR3 and TLR5 showed lower expression compared to the controls during 21 days, and a significant decrease of TLR3 gene was found at day 28 (P < 0.05). After challenge with V. harveyi, the survival rate of fish administrated with the strain K2 for 28 days was signifiacantly higher than the controls without this strain (P < 0.05). These results collectively suggest that B. velezensis K2 is a potential probiotic species to improve health status and disease resistance and can be developed as a probiotic agent in grouper industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of in-feed  on L. intracellularis infection dynamics was evaluated. In brief, 70 .5-week-old-pigs were randomly divided into six groups with 10-20 pigs each. All pigs were fed an age appropriate base ration for the duration of the study, which was supplemented with one of three Bacillus strains including B. amyloliquefaciens (T01), B. licheniformis (T02) and B. pumilus (T03). Another group was orally vaccinated with a commercial live L. intracellularis vaccine (VAC) at 3 weeks of age. At 7 weeks of age, T01-LAW, T02-LAW, T03-LAW, VAC-LAW and the POS-CONTROL groups were challenged with L. intracellularis while the NEG-CONTROL pigs were not challenged. All pigs were necropsied 16 days later. By the time of inoculation, all VAC-LAW pigs had seroconverted and at necropsy 10-65% of the pigs in all other challenged groups were also seropositive. The results indicate a successful L. intracellularis challenge with highest bacterial DNA levels in POS-CONTROL pigs, VAC-LAW pigs and T01-LAW pigs. There was a delay in onset of shedding in T02-LAW and T03-LAW groups, which was reflected in less severe macroscopic and microscopic lesions, reduced intralesional L. intracellularis antigen levels and a lower area under the curve for bacterial shedding. Under the study conditions, two of the  tested suppressed L. intracellularis infection.

Many studies have analysed the ability of live  to protect intestinal epithelial cells against tight junction damage caused by bacterial pathogens. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is among the  that positively modulates the intestinal epithelial barrier by regulating expression and distribution of tight junction proteins. We previously reported that regulation of ZO-1, claudin-14 and claudin- is mediated by EcN secreted factors, either free-released or associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Factors secreted by commensal ECOR63 elicited comparable effects in intact epithelial T-84 and Caco- cell monolayers.Here we analyse the ability of OMVs and soluble secreted factors to protect epithelial barrier function in polarized T-84 and Caco- cells infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Transepithelial electrical resistance, paracellular permeability, mRNA levels and subcellular distribution of tight junction proteins were monitored in the absence or presence of EcN and ECOR63 extracellular fractions. EPEC downregulated expression of ZO-1 ZO-, occludin and claudin-14 and altered the subcellular localization of ZO-1, occludin and F-actin cytoskeleton. OMVs and soluble factors secreted by EcN and ECOR63 counteracted EPEC-altered transepithelial resistance and paracellular permeability, preserved occludin and claudin-14 mRNA levels, retained ZO-1 and occludin at tight junctions in the cell boundaries and ameliorated F-actin disorganization. Redistribution of ZO-1 was not accompanied by changes at mRNA level.This study provides new insights on the role of microbiota secreted factors on the modulation of intestinal tight junctions, expanding their barrier-protective effects against pathogen-induced disruption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635441> S1 Improves Colitis induced by ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid by the Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling in Mice.</a></h1><p> S1 strongly inhibits the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-induced peritoneal macrophages for the mechanism that lactic acid bacteria from kimchi inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was isolated. The protective effect of this strain on the colitis mouse model induced by ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) was further evaluated. TNBS significantly elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic scores, and colon shortening. Oral  S1 administration resulted in reduction of TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB).  S1 inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, induced by TNBS, but enhanced IL-10 expression.

Patients with CKD also develop other comorbidities, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, liver and cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems, and cognitive deterioration, which worsens their health. Therapy includes reducing comorbidities or using replacement therapy, such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and organ transplant. Health care systems are searching for alternative treatments for CKD patients to mitigate or retard their progression. One new topic is the study of uremic toxins (UT), which are excessively produced during CKD as products of food metabolism or as a result of the loss of renal function that have a negative impact on the kidneys and other organs. High urea concentrations significantly modify the microbiota in the gut also, cause a decrease in bacterial strains that produce anti-inflammatory and fuel molecules and an increase in bacterial strains that can metabolize urea, but also produce UT, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. UT activates several cellular processes that induce oxidative environments, inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis development, and apoptosis; these processes mainly occur in the gut, heart, and kidney. The study of the microbiota during CKD allowed for the implementation of therapy schemes to try to reduce the circulating concentrations of UT and reduce the damage. The objective of this review is to show an overview to know the main UT produced in end-stage renal disease patients, and how prebiotics and  intervention acts as a helpful tool in CKD treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633390>Precision Reengineering of the Oral Microbiome for Caries Management.</a></h1><p>Technological advancements have revolutionized our understanding of the complexity and importance of the human microbiome. This progress has also emphasized the need for precision therapeutics, as it has underscored the dilemmas, such as dysbiosis and increasing antibiotic resistance, associated with current, broad-spectrum treatment modalities. Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease worldwide, accompanied by a tremendous financial and social burden, despite widespread and efficacious fluoride and hygienic regimens. Over the past several decades, various precision approaches to combat dental caries, including vaccines, , and antimicrobial compounds, have been pursued. Despite the distinct overall conceptual strengths of each approach, for various reasons, there are currently no approved precision antibiotic therapeutics to prevent dental caries. Specifically targeted antimicrobial peptides (STAMPs) are synthetic molecules that combine the antibiotic moiety of a traditional antimicrobial peptide with a targeting domain to provide specificity against a particular organism. Conjoining the killing domain from the antimicrobial, novispirin G10, and a targeting domain derived from the  pheromone, CSP, the STAMP C16G2 was designed to provide targeted killing of , widely considered the keystone species in dental caries pathogenesis. C16G2 was able to selectively eliminate  from complex ecosystems while leaving closely related, yet health-associated, oral species unharmed. This remodeling of the dental plaque community is expected to have significant advantages compared to conventional broad-spectrum mouthwashes, as the intact, surviving community is apt to prevent reinfection by pathogens. Following successful phase I clinical trials that evaluated the safety and basic microbiology of C16G2 treatments, the phase II trials of several C16G2 formulations are currently in progress. C16G2 represents an exciting advance in precision therapeutics, and the STAMP platform provides vast opportunities for both the development of additional therapeutics and the overall study of microbial ecology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608448>Postnatal  and allergic disease in very preterm infants: sub-study to the ProPrems randomized trial.</a></h1><p>Probiotic supplementation to mothers and/or their term-born infants has been suggested to prevent allergic disease, in particular eczema; however, no studies have investigated  for prevention of allergic diseases in very preterm infants. We evaluated the effect of a postnatal probiotic combination on development of allergic diseases in very preterm infants.This sub-study was an a priori secondary outcome of the ProPrems multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (ANZCTR:12607000144415). ProPrems randomized 1099 very preterm infants to receive a probiotic combination or placebo from soon after birth until discharge from hospital or term corrected age (CA), whichever was earlier. Allergic disease (eczema, atopic eczema, food allergy, wheeze, atopic sensitization) was assessed in a subgroup of ProPrems infants (n=281) as close to 12 months CA as possible by questionnaire, clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens.There was no difference in eczema incidence between the probiotic and placebo group (35[30%] of 118 infants vs 37[27%] of 137 infants, respectively, absolute difference .65%, 95% CI -8.45 to 13.75). Similarly, the incidence of atopic eczema (6[5%] of 118 vs 3[%] of 137), food allergy (4[3%] of 124 vs [1%] of 154), wheeze (39[31%] of 127 vs 45[29%] of 154) and atopic sensitization (14[13%] of 106 vs 13[11%] of 123) were similar between the probiotic and placebo groups.This study found no effect of postnatal administration of a probiotic combination on the incidence of allergic diseases or atopic sensitization in the first two years of life in children born very preterm. Evidence that  are effective for prevention of allergic disease in premature infants remains lacking; adequately powered randomized controlled trials evaluating probiotic supplementation for allergy prevention in very preterm infants are needed.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Modification of gut microbiota and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile acid synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut microbiota, which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco- cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

We evaluated the probiotic effect of D. rugosa SD-17 on 360 one-day-old Hy-line brown chickens that were divided into  groups, and each group contained 6 replicate pens with 30 birds per pen. The chickens were fed with basal diet supplemented with or without D. rugosa SD-17, and the effects of D. rugosa SD-17 on growth performance, intestine morphology, and immune status were assessed. Body weight was significantly improved from week 3 to 6 (P < 0.05), and the feed conversion ratio was significantly improved in weeks 1 and  (P < 0.001). The length of the duodenum was lengthened significantly in week 3 (P < 0.05), and supplementation of D. rugosa SD-17 significantly increased villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the ileum in week 3 (P < 0.05).

Type  diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of  has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial barrier function, which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase B (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521398>Mediterranean diet: The role of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids in fish; polyphenols in fruits, vegetables, cereals, coffee, tea, cacao and wine;  and vitamins in prevention of stroke, age-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer disease.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms of action of the dietary components of the Mediterranean diet are reviewed in prevention of cardiovascular disease, stroke, age-associated cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease. A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic acid while α-linolenic acid is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic acid from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in ω-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier ω-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on lipid metabolism of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type- diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease. From the public health viewpoint worldwide the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke. We review the important dietary role of cereal grains in prevention of coronary disease and stroke. Polyphenols from grapes, wine and alcoholic beverages are discussed, in particular their effects on coagulation. The mechanisms of action of  and vitamins are also included.Copyright © 2019.

Most of the time, if not always, starts within the gut; that is what we eat. Recent research shows that the imbalance between good versus bad microbial population, especially in the gut, causes systemic diseases. Thus, an appropriate balance of the gut microbiota (eubiosis over dysbiosis) needs to be maintained for normal health (Veeranki and Tyagi, 2017, Journal of Cellular Physiology, 232, 2929-2930). However, during various diseases such as metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension the dysbiotic gut environment tends to prevail. Our research focuses on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism that occupies a center-stage in many biochemically relevant epigenetic mechanisms. For example, dysbiotic bacteria methylate promoters to inhibit gene activities. Interestingly, the product of the 1-carbon metabolism is Hcy, unequivocally. Emerging studies show that host resistance to various antibiotics occurs due to inverton promoter inhibition, presumably because of promoter methylation. This results from modification of host promoters by bacterial products leading to loss of host's ability to drug compatibility and system sensitivity. In this study, we focus on the role of high methionine diet (HMD), an ingredient rich in red meat and measure the effects of a probiotic on cardiac muscle remodeling and its functions. We employed wild type (WT) and cystathionine beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS ) mice with and without HMD and with and without a probiotic; PB (Lactobacillus) in drinking water for 16 weeks. Results indicate that matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) activity was robust in CBS fed with HMD and that it was successfully attenuated by the PB treatment. Cardiomyocyte contractility and ECHO data revealed mitigation of the cardiac dysfunction in CBS  + HMD mice treated with PB. In conclusion, our data suggest that  can potentially reverse the Hcy-meditated cardiac dysfunction.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662635>The Anti-parasitic Effect of Probiotic Bacteria  Limiting the Fecundity of  Female Adults.</a></h1><p>A potential protective effect of probiotic strains against zoonotic  infection was investigated in the framework of a new therapeutic strategy aimed at using  to control parasitic zoonoses.

Complex therapy with Triozhinal, containing lyophilized culture of lactobacilli L. casei rhamnosus Doderleini, contributed to the normalization of PH, restoration of vaginal biocinosis, and, consequently, reduce the severity of complaints of dryness and burning in the vagina, dyspareunia. Thus, despite the reduction of symptoms in the majority of women, the proportion of such patients in group  was higher and amounted to 96.7% against 83.3% in group 1. Supportive reception of the drug for 3 months. it allowed to preserve the normocinosis of the vagina until the restoration of its trophic, as well as to reduce the frequency of bacteriuria and leukocyturia by 20% compared with the results of group 1, and to significantly reduce the number of relapses of infection (p<0.05).Triozhinal improves the results of treatment of recurrent urinary infection in women with vulvovaginal atrophy in peri- and postmenopausal and can be recommended for use in combination therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454897>Probiotic Supplementation is Associated with Increased Antioxidant Capacity and Copper Chelation in -Infected Fecal Water.</a></h1><p>Probiotic supplementation plays a key role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis due to its ability to modulate gut microbiota. Although their potential as potent antioxidants have previously been explored, their ability to affect the redox status in the gut lumen of healthy subjects or those with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders remains unclear. In our study, we assessed the ability of single strain and multispecies probiotic supplementation to cause a change in the redox status of normal fecal water and in -infected fecal water using a simulated gastrointestinal model. Changes in redox status were assessed by ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ','-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and iron and copper chelation assays. The findings from our study showed that in normal fecal water, probiotic supplements, apart from  ( R0011, showed a significant increase in iron chelation ( < 0.05), which was associated with lower FRAP and copper chelation. In -infected fecal water, all probiotic supplements showed a significant increase in FRAP ( < 0.05) and were associated with increased copper chelation. The DPPH assay showed no treatment effect in either fecal water. These findings suggest that  mediates dysregulation of redox status, which is counteracted by  through ferric-reducing ability and copper chelation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523411>The effects of supplementation of  and  spores on the intestinal microflora and growth performance in rat.</a></h1><p>The intestinal microflora has an important role in the health status. Since  can balance the intestinal microflora, they have a lot of health beneficial effects. So the appropriate selection of  can cause health-promoting effects. In this study, the combined effects of  and  on the intestinal microflora and growth performance in rats were investigated.80 male rats were divided into the treatment (receiving 5×10 spores/ml of  and 5×10 spores/ml of  for three weeks in daily water) and control (tap water without ) groups.

The present trial aims to examine effects of the probiotic  on symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients. Effects of this probiotic on the immune system have been reported by several studies, but the majority of the previous trials were animal studies. In addition, it is well known that symptoms in allergic rhinitis are prone to exhibit high placebo responses. Moreover, recent studies report that even placebos without deception (open-label placebos) are highly effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Our study design combines both new approaches to assess effects on allergic symptoms in patients. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a probiotic treatment () with effects seen by open-label placebo, concealed placebo treatment and no treatment control.A total of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to one of four different groups: a double-blind probiotic/placebo group (groups 1 and ), an open-label placebo group (group 3) and a no-treatment group (group 4) to control for spontaneous variation of symptoms. The primary outcome is the evaluation of allergic symptoms using the Combined Symptoms Medication Score. Furthermore, health-related quality of life is examined (Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes include a visual analogue scale on allergic burden and a second quality of life questionnaire. This report describes the study design of the randomised controlled trial.The study design was approved by the ethical committee of the UKT Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Tübingen, Germany. The trial is registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de, DRKS00015804).

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the immunoregulatory and antiviral activities of immunobiotics have not yet been elucidated in detail. The present study was conducted to determine whether selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) modulate toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) induced viral response in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). PolyI:C increased the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in HCT116 cells, and these up-regulations were significantly altered when cells were pre-stimulated with LAB isolated from Korean fermented foods. LAB strains were capable to up-regulate IFN-β but down-regulated IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1β mRNA levels as compared with PolyI: C. HCT-116 cell treatment with LABs beneficially modulated the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10), -5A oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OSA1), myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), TLR3, and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and TLR negative regulators. In addition, LABs increased IFN-β, IFN-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β protein/mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also protected the cells by maintaining tight-junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). The beneficial effects of these LABs were mediated via modulation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. Overall, the results of this study indicate that immunobiotics have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities that may use as antiviral substitutes for human and animal applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341568>Effect of  IS-10506 on blood lipopolysaccharide level and immune response in HIV-infected children.</a></h1><p>HIV enteropathy may cause disruption of the intestinal barrier, leading to a loss of CD4+ T cells, increased intestinal permeability, and microbial translocation.  IS-10506 has the ability to improve gut barrier function. This study investigated the effect of  IS-10506 on a number of biomarkers of enteropathy-related damage in HIV-infected paediatric patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ARV).A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on -18 year-old children, diagnosed as HIV infected according to the WHO 2007 criteria who had received ARV for ≥ 6 months. Subjects were excluded if ARV therapy was discontinued or the patients took  ≥  weeks prior to the study or during the study period. Subjects were randomized into a probiotic group and placebo group. The probiotic group received  IS-10506 .86 × 10 cfu/day for 6 days. Blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level, serum CD4+ T cell count, serum CD8+ T cell count, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, and faecal sIgA level were assessed as biomarkers.Twenty-one subjects completed this study. The blood LPS level decreased significantly in the probiotic group ( = 0.001). There was no significant difference in absolute CD4+ T cell count, percent CD4+ cells, absolute CD8+ T cell count, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, or faecal sIgA. No serious adverse events were reported.The probiotic  IS-10506 reduced the blood LPS level but showed no effect on the humoral mucosa and systemic immune response in HIV-infected children undergoing ARV therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380297>Probiotic Supplementation During Human Pregnancy Affects the Gut Microbiota and Immune Status.</a></h1><p>The consumption of  and fermented foods has been very popular in recent decades. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of  on the gut microbiota and the changes in inflammatory cytokines after an average of 6.7 weeks of probiotic administration among normal pregnant women. Thirty-two healthy pregnant women at 32 weeks of gestation were recruited and divided into two groups. The probiotic group ingested combined  until after birth. The base characteristics of the  and control groups showed no significant differences. The structure of the fecal microbiota at the genus level varied during the third trimester, and administration of  had no influence on the composition of the fecal microbiota however, many highly abundant taxa and core microbiota at the genus level changed in the probiotic group when compared to the control group. The analysis of cytokines showed that IL-5, IL-6, TNF-α, and GM-CSF had equal levels between the baseline and control groups but were significantly increased after probiotic administration (baseline = control < ). Additionally, levels of IL-1β, IL-, IL-12, and IFN-γ significantly increased among the three groups (baseline < control < ). This result demonstrated that  helped to shift the anti-inflammatory state to a pro-inflammatory state. The correlation analysis outcome suggested that the relationship between the microbiota and the cytokines was not strain-dependent. The gut microbiota varied during the third trimester.

Traditionally, probiotic food research has heavily focused on the genera  and , along with their benefits for gut health. Recently with the identification of new probiotic strains specifically intended for oral health applications, the development of probiotic foods for oral health benefits has garnered interest, with a renewed focus on identifying new food formats for delivering . The development of novel oral probiotic foods is highly complex, as the composition of a food matrix dictates: (1) bacterial viability during production and shelf life and () how bacteria partition with components within a food matrix and subsequently adhere to oral cavity surfaces. At present, virtually no information is available on oral probiotic strains such as ; specifically, how orally-derived strains survive under different food parameters. Furthermore, limited information exists on the partition behavior of  with food components, governed by physico-chemical interactions and adhesion phenomena.

The whole fruit juice of P. granatum which is rich with phytonutrients appeared to be a good probiotic carrier. The probiotication was carried out for 24 hr at 30, 35, and 37°C and pH .5, 4.0, and 5.5 under microaerophilic conditions. The results found that P. granatum juice cultivated with L. casei had a better growth profile with a higher biomass density at 37°C around pH 3.5-4.0. Probiotication could maintain the scavenging activity of P. granatum juice cultivated with L. casei. The scavenging activity achieved up to 90% inhibition at the concentration of 5 mg/ml. The whole fruit-squeezed P. granatum juice was suitable for the growth of Lactobacillus species even without supplementation during cultivation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The findings of this study presented the potential of P. granatum juice (whole fruit) to be used as a good probiotic carrier, particularly for Lactobacillus species without supplementation. High nutritious P. granatum juice catered the need of probiotic bacteria during fermentation. Probiotication could maintain the antioxidant capacity of the juice in term of its radical scavenging activity. The antioxidant capacity was mainly attributed to the metabolites such as phenolic acids (romarinic acid and caftaric acid) and flavonoids (quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin and kaempferol rutinoside). With the optimized temperature (37°C) and pH (4.00), probiotic bacteria could growth well up to a cell viability of .46 × 10  cfu/ml. This offers P. granatum to be developed into functional food to cater to the needs of the consumers who are lactose intolerant to dairy products.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595164>Protective Effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and its Supernatant against Myocardial Dysfunction in Obese Mice Exposed to Intermittent Hypoxia is Associated with the Activation of Nrf2 Pathway.</a></h1><p>Prolonged intermittent hypoxia (IH) has been shown to impair myocardial function (mainly via oxidative stress and inflammation) and modify gut microbiota in mice.

Research on novel  related therapies has evoked much attention. In our previous study, both Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and LGG cell-free supernatant (LGGs) were found to protect against alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis; however, the effects of LGG and LGGs on cardiac tissues of obese mice exposed to IH have not been determined. Here we exposed high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced obese mice to IH, to establish a model of obesity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Mice were divided into four groups: (1) HFHFD for 15 weeks; () HFHFD for 15 weeks with IH in the last 12 weeks (HFHFD/IH); (3) and (4) HFHFD/IH plus oral administration of either LGG (10 CFU bacteria/day) or LGGs (dose equivalent to 10 CFU bacteria/day) over the 15 weeks, respectively. Compared to HFHFD mice, HFHFD/IH-mice showed heart dysfunction with significant cardiac remodeling and inflammation; all these pathological and functional alterations were prevented by treatment with both LGG and LGGs (no significant difference between LGG and LGGs in this respect). The cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs against IH/HFHFD was associated with up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant pathways. Our findings suggest a cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs in obese mice with OSA.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31334254>Pharmaceutical Prescription in Canine Acute Diarrhoea: A Longitudinal Electronic Health Record Analysis of First Opinion Veterinary Practices.</a></h1><p>Canine acute diarrhoea is frequently observed in first opinion practice, though little is known about commonly used diagnostic or therapeutic management plans, including use of antimicrobials. This retrospective observational study utilised electronic health records augmented with practitioner-completed questionnaires from 3,189 cases (3,159 dogs) collected from 179 volunteer veterinary practices between April 2014 and January 2017. We used multivariable analysis to explore factors potentially associated with pharmaceutical agent prescription, and resolution of clinical signs by 10 days post-initial presentation. Use of bacteriological and/or parasitological diagnostic tests were uncommon (3.% of cases, 95% confidence interval, CI, .4-4.0), though systemic antimicrobials were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical agents (49.7% of cases, 95% CI 46.1-53.). Such prescription was associated with haemorrhagic diarrhoea (odds ratio, OR, 4.1; 95% CI 3.4-5.0), body temperature in excess of 39.0°C, or moderate/severe cases (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids) were prescribed to 37.7% of cases (95% CI 35.4-39.9), and were most frequently prescribed to vomiting dogs regardless of presence (OR 46.4, 95% CI 19.4-110.8) or absence of blood (OR 17.1, 95% CI 13.4-21.9). Endoparasiticides/endectocides were prescribed to 7.8% of cases (95% CI 6.8-9.0), such prescription being less frequent for moderate/severe cases (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.7), though more frequent when weight loss was recorded (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.3-9.0). Gastrointestinal nutraceuticals (e.g., ) were dispensed to 60.8% of cases (95% CI 57.1-64.6), these cases less frequently presenting with moderate/severe clinical signs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8). Nearly a quarter of cases were judged lost to follow-up (=754). Insured (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9); neutered (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.5), or vaccinated dogs (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.3-0.4) were less commonly lost to follow-up. Of remaining dogs, clinical signs were deemed resolved in 95.4% of cases (95% CI 94.6-96.). Provision of dietary modification advice and gastrointestinal nutraceuticals alone were positively associated with resolution (OR .8, 95% CI 1.3-6.1); no such associations were found for pharmaceutical agents, including antimicrobials. Hence, this study supports the view that antimicrobials are largely unnecessary for acute diarrhoea cases; this being of particular importance when considering the global threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485161>Immunomodulation of carcinogens-induced steroids-dependent human diseases.</a></h1><p>The experimental and clinical data about antibodies against environmental chemical carcinogens and endogenous steroids are represented.

No clinical factors were significantly correlated with the detection of bacteremia. On the other hand, plasma LBP level was significantly correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.312), fasting blood glucose (r = 0.279), fasting C-peptide (r = 0.265), body mass index (r = 0.371), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.241), and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, r = 0.543; and interleukin-6, r = 0.456). Multiple regression analysis identified body mass index, HbA1c, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as independent determinants of plasma LBP level.The plasma LBP level was similar in patients with and without bacteremia.

The regulation mechanism of serotonin by Bifidobacterium animalis F1-7 was revealed by RT-PCR and the results show that this most effective strain promotes intestinal peristalsis in zebrafish via the modulation of serotonin release and key genes for serotonin synthesis in zebrafish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562894>Evaluation of Lactococcus lactis HNL12 combined with Schizochytrium limacinum algal meal in diets for humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis).</a></h1><p>The humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis) is a commercially valuable species of the family Epinephelidae; however, its marketization suffers from slow growth speed, low survival rate, and various pathogenic diseases. Lactococcus lactis and Schizochytrium limacinum are commonly used as immunostimulants due to their health benefits for the aquatic organisms. In the present study, we assessed the effects of dietary supplementation with L. lactis HNL12 combined with S. limacinum algal meal on the growth performances, innate immune response, and disease resistance of C. altivelis against Vibrio harveyi. The results showed that fish fed with a combination diet of L. lactis and S. limacinum exhibited significantly higher final weight, percent weight gain, and specific growth rate compared with groups fed with them alone. A bacterial challenge experiment indicated that the group fed with the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet achieved the highest relative percent of survival value (68.63%), suggesting that L. lactis and S. limacinum significantly improved the disease resistance against V. harveyi after a 4-week feeding trial. Moreover, the respiratory burst activity of macrophages of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet was significantly higher than that of fish fed the control diet after 1, , and 3 weeks of feeding. The serum superoxide dismutase of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet significantly increased compared to those fed the control diet after 1 and  weeks of feeding, while the serum alkaline phosphatase of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet after  and 4 weeks was significantly increased, compared to the control group. The serum lysozyme activities of fish fed with a L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet significantly increased compared to the control group after  weeks of feeding. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing of the C. altivelis head kidney was conducted to explore the immune-regulating effects of the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet on C. altivelis. A total of 86,919 unigenes, annotated by at least one of the reference databases (Nr, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG, and KEGG), were assembly yielded by de novo transcriptome. In addition, 157 putative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum group and the control group. For pathway enrichment, the DEGs were categorized into nine KEGG pathways, which were mainly related to infective diseases, antigen processing and presentation, digestive system, and other immune system responses. The findings of this study suggest that the L. lactis combined with S. limacinum diet can induce positive effects on the growth, immunity, and disease resistance of C. altivelis against V. harveyi.

There are no basic criteria regarding differentiation of early-onset sepsis (EOS) versus late-onset sepsis (LOS). Stratification used in studies on neonatal sepsis also rarely includes the general condition of the newborn according to unambiguous assessment at birth, which hampers the establishment of a clear, uniform epidemiological description of neonatal sepsis. We aim to review the published data about the epidemiology and microbiology of sepsis in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Data was also collected on sepsis prevention programs that can be implemented in neonatal units. The outcomes of interest were incidence or incidence density of EOS and LOS, microbiology of EOS and LOS, and data on the methodology of the research, in particular the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of newborns from the study. Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used. For the preselection step, inclusion criteria included: "bloodstream infection" or "neonatal sepsis" (MesH), "very low birth weight", and "country" full-text studies, human, and English language. Exclusion criteria included: studies published in languages other than English and studies available only as an abstracts. For proper selection, inclusion criteria included: information about epidemiology or microbiology bloodstream infection (BSI), study population and case definitions, exclusion criteria, narrative reviews, commentaries, case studies, pilot studies, study protocols, pediatric studies, and only clinical data (without microbiology or epidemiology) or studies with only one etiological factor analysis. The data review indicated the lack of an unequivocal, unified definition and no unambiguous basic criteria with regard to differentiation of EOS versus LOS. Among infants <1500 g, studies reported an EOS rate from 7% to %. For studies using other definitions (mostly all inborn babies), the rate of EOS ranged from 1% to 3%. The LOS incidences were much more varied among countries; the highest rates were in the multicenter studies focused on very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The main pathogens in EOS are GBS and Gram-negative bacteria in LOS. Our review data shows that LOS microbiology is very diverse and that Gram-positive cocci, especially staphylococci, predominate versus Gram-negative rods. Unfortunately, the lack of uniform, international prevention programs results in high newborn morbidity and insufficient postnatal prevention of late-onset infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647500>Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis.</a></h1><p>Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated.To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors.This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1 445 850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within  years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers. Our findings suggest a potential protective role of prebiotics and  against lung carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662964>Extraction and Characterization of Inulin-Type Fructans from Artichoke Wastes and Their Effect on the Growth of Intestinal Bacteria Associated with Health.</a></h1><p>Globe artichoke is an intriguing source of indigestible sugar polymers such as inulin-type fructans. In this study, the effect of ultrasound in combination with ethanol precipitation to enhance the extraction of long chain fructans from artichoke wastes has been evaluated. The inulin-type fructans content both from bracts and stems was measured using an enzymatic fructanase-based assay, while its average degree of polymerization (DP) was determined by HPLC-RID analysis. Results show that this method provides artichoke extracts with an inulin-type fructans content of 70% with an average DP between 32 and 42 both in bracts and in stems. The prebiotic effect of long chain inulins from artichoke extract wastes was demonstrated by its ability to support the growth of five  and four  species, previously characterized as . Besides, we considered the possibility to industrialize the process developing a simpler method for the production of inulin-type fructans from the artichoke wastes so that the artichoke inulin preparation could be suitable for its use in synbiotic formulations in combination with different  for further studies including  trials.Copyright © 2019 Zahraa Zeaiter et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493500>Prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Recurrent Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (rCDI) is common, and patients who have had one recurrence are more likely to have multiple recurrences. Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (,805 subjects), and eight , prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin B; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, , and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and  demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of novel microbial species and quantification of their distributional variations among different samples that are sequenced using next-generation-sequencing technology hold the key to the success of most metagenomic studies. To achieve these goals, we propose a simple yet powerful metagenomic binning method, MetaBMF. The method does not require prior knowledge of reference genomes and produces highly accurate results, even at a strain level. Thus, it can be broadly used to identify disease-related microbial organisms that are not well-studied.Mathematically, we count the number of mapped reads on each assembled genomic fragment cross different samples as our input matrix and propose a scalable stratified angle regression algorithm to factorize this count matrix into a product of a binary matrix and a nonnegative matrix. The binary matrix can be used to separate microbial species and the nonnegative matrix quantifies the species distributions in different samples. In simulation and empirical studies, we demonstrate that MetaBMF has high binning accuracy. It can not only bin DNA fragments accurately at a species level but also at a strain level. As shown in our example, we can accurately identify the Shiga-toxigenic E. coli O104:H4 strain which led to the 2011 German E.coli outbreak. Our efforts in these areas should lead to (1) fundamental advances in metagenomic binning () development and refinement of technology for the rapid identification and quantification of microbial distributions (3) finding of potential  or reliable pathogenic bacterial strains.The software is available at https://github.com/didi10384/MetaBMF.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) (2019).

Sometimes, histology of enterocolic biopsies does not reveal inflammatory infiltrates or mucosal lesions that are typically associated with clinical disease activity. It is speculated that, similarly to humans, colonic dysmotility may be anxiety-based, although recent data demonstrate that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could result from acute infectious enteritis. Specific Lactobacillus spp. strains administered orally in humans induced the expression of μ-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in mucosal enterocytes, modulating intestinal morphine-like analgesic functions. We investigated the potential association of GI signs caused by colonic dysmotility and mucosal expression of cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells and the number of mucosal mast cells.Ten to 15 endoscopic biopsies were collected from colonic mucosa of 20 dogs diagnosed with dysmotility disturbances before and after probiotic (Slab51 bacterial blend; Sivoy ) administration (3-month period). Number and distribution of mast cells (MCs), and cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and type  (CB2) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Results were compared to data obtained from five clinically healthy dogs (archive samples).Decreased numbers of MCs (P < .0001) and increased CB1- and CB2-positive epithelial cells (P < .0001) in diseased dogs were positively associated with post-treatment CCECAI scores (P < .0001).Our results suggest that probiotic administration can reduce signs of colonic dysmotility, possibly due to microbiota modulation and epithelial cell receptor-mediated signaling in intestinal mucosa.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502382>Twice-a-day PPI, tetracycline, metronidazole quadruple therapy with Pylera® or Lactobacillus reuteri for treatment naïve or for retreatment of Helicobacter pylori.

To test this hypothesis, newborn piglets (16 piglets/group) were treated with either S. cerevisiae yeast (5 x 109 cfu/pig: Low) or (.5 x 1010 cfu/piglet: High) or equivalent volume of sterile water (Control) by oral gavage every other day starting from day 1 of age until weaning (28±1 days of age). Piglet body weight was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24 and 28 and average daily gain (ADG) calculated for the total period. At weaning, piglets were euthanized to collect cecum content for microbial profiling by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. ADG was higher in both Low and High yeast groups than in Control group (P<0.05). Alpha diversity analyses indicated a more diverse microbiota in the Control group compared with Low yeast group; the High yeast being intermediate (P < 0.01). Similarly, Beta diversity analyses indicated differences among treatments (P = 0.03), mainly between Low yeast and Control groups (P = 0.02). The sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) indicated that Control group was discriminated by a higher abundance of Veillonella, Dorea, Oscillospira and Clostridium; Low yeast treated pigs by higher Blautia, Collinsella and Eubacterium; and High yeast treated pigs by higher Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Parabacteroides, Mogibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis showed that piglet ADG was positively correlated with genus Prevotella in High yeast group. Yeast supplementation significantly affected microbial diversity in cecal contents of suckling piglets associated with an improvement of short chain fatty acid producing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, yeast treatment improved piglet performance and shaped the piglet cecum microbiota composition in a dose dependent way.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446476>Improvement of Redox State and Functions of Immune Cells as Well as of Behavioral Response in Aged Mice After Two-Week Supplementation of Fermented Milk with .</a></h1><p>The homeostatic systems, such as the nervous and immune systems, show deterioration in aging as a consequence of the age-related oxidative-inflammatory stress establishment.

The sample size for this study was 4,727. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, oral health-related variables, oral and general health status, and intake of semi-solid yogurt. Semi-solid yogurt intake (YI) was calculated by multiplying the frequency of YI over the previous week by the average intake per serving. We assessed periodontal conditions using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI) and defined periodontitis as a CPI score ≥3. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, and oral and general health behaviors and status.The mean weekly YI among those without periodontitis (1.03±0.06 cups) was significantly higher than among those with periodontitis (0.77±0.08 cups) (<0.001). Individuals who consumed more than  cups of yogurt per day were 76% less likely to have periodontitis than those who consumed less than 1 cup of yogurt per week after adjusting for all covariates (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.60).We found a significant association between increased intake of semi-solid yogurt and periodontal health.

The primary outcome was intestinal EPE eradication at the end of the 1-year follow-up, as shown by 3 consecutive negative EPE rectal swabs during the follow-up year. The per protocol follow-up for all patients was 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of the intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .In total, the target size of 80 patients were included. The median age was 68 years in both groups. The number of females in the  group was 23 (58%) and in the placebo group 28 (70%). At the end of the trial, 12.5% (5 out of 40) of the patients in the probiotic group had achieved successful eradication of EPE, as defined by the primary outcome, in the intention to treat analysis. In the placebo group, 5% ( out of 40) of the patients had achieved successful eradication of EPE (odds ratio .71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49-14.9; p 0.24).Successful EPE eradication was observed in very few individuals. This trial did not support Vivomixx® as being superior to placebo for intestinal decolonization in adult patients with chronic colonization of EPE, but was limited in power.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The results showed that hemp seed drinks have a specific aroma and its compounds are dependent on the type of formulation and to the probiotic used. For example, in hemp seed drinks, -heptanol, -methyl, ,4-decadienal, -butanone, 3-hydroxy, ,3-butanedione, and propanoic acid were fine descriptors of  fermentations Multivariate analysis of volatile metabolites and their correlation to some physiological parameters and nutritional values offered a novel approach to assess the quality of functional hemp drinks which could result in a decisional tool for industrial applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402586>Development of omics-based protocols for the microbiological characterization of multi-strain formulations marketed as : the case of VSL#3.</a></h1><p>The growing commercial interest in multi-strain formulations marketed as  has not been accompanied by an equal increase in the evaluation of quality levels of these biotechnological products. The multi-strain product VSL#3 was used as a model to setup a microbiological characterization that could be extended to other formulations with high complexity. Shotgun metagenomics by deep Illumina sequencing was applied to DNA isolated from the commercial VSL#3 product to confirm strains identity safety and composition. Single-cell analysis was used to evaluate the cell viability, and β-galactosidase and urease activity have been used as marker to monitor the reproducibility of the production process. Similarly, these lots were characterized in detail by a metaproteomics approach for which a robust protein extraction protocol was combined with advanced mass spectrometry. The results identified over 1600 protein groups belonging to all strains present in the VSL#3 formulation. Of interest, only 3. % proteins showed significant differences mainly related to small variations in strain abundance. The protocols developed in this study addressed several quality criteria that are relevant for marketed multi-strain products and these represent the first efforts to define the quality of complex probiotic formulations such as VSL#3.© 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of this validation was to evaluate the method's interlaboratory performance and submit the result to AOAC INTERNATIONAL for adoption as a First Action  for the detection of  species in select foods and environmental surfaces.  The GENE-UP method was evaluated in a multilaboratory study as part of the AFNOR NF VALIDATION certification process (NF102) following ISO 16140-:2016 using unpaired test portions for one food matrix, reconstituted infant formula containing . The candidate method was compared to the ISO 22964:2017 reference method. Sixteen participants from fifteen laboratories throughout the European Union participated. Three levels of contamination were evaluated: a noninoculated control level (0 CFU/target test portion), a low contamination level (approximately  CFU/target test portion), and a high contamination level (approximately 10 CFU/target test portion). Data from that study were analyzed according to the probability of detection (POD) statistical model as presented in the AOAC validation guidelines. The difference in laboratory POD (dLPOD) values with 95% confidence intervals across collaborators was calculated for each level between the candidate and reference method results and between the candidate presumptive and confirmed results.  The dLPOD values with 95% confidence intervals were 0.00 (-0.03, 0.03), -0.08 (-0.19, 0.02), and 0.00 (-0.03, 0.03) for the noninoculated, low, and high contamination levels, respectively.  The dLPOD results indicate no significant difference between the candidate method and the reference method or between presumptive and confirmed results for all three levels of contamination.  The GENE-UP  assay provides industry with a rapid, easy to use method for the rapid detection of  in a wide range of products and environmental samples.</p></html>
