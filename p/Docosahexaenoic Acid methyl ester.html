A total of 24 pens provided 12 replicates per treatment. Animals were weighed on day 0 and 28 with feed and water intake recorded per pen. After 31 days supplementation (28 days of study and 3 days until the slaughtering date) three animals per pen (n = 72) were slaughtered and the LL and backfat thickness, lean meat content and dressing percentage were recorded for the carcasses. The fatty  (FA) profile of the LL and backfat was established by direct FA   synthesis.No differences were observed for any performance parameters or carcass traits. Supplementation with AURA resulted in significant changes to the FA profiles of both the LL and backfat with male and female pigs responding differently to supplementation in terms of particular FAs. Overall, pork LL samples had significantly higher eicosapentaenoic  (p<0.001) and DHA concentrations (p<0.001), and higher omega-3 (n-3) FAs (p<0.001), as well as an increased omega3:omega6 (n-3:n-6) ratio (p = 0.001). For backfat, supplementation resulted in significantly higher amounts of DHA (p<0.001) and n-3 FAs (p<0.001).These results indicate that dietary supplementation with 1% AURA over a 31 day period can increase the FA composition of pork LL and backfat, specifically the DHA, with no major impact on growth performance and carcass traits.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949439>Losing Reproduction: Effect of High Temperature on Female Biochemical Composition and Egg Quality in a Freshwater Crustacean with Direct Development, the Red Cherry Shrimp, Neocaridina davidi (Decapoda, Atyidae).</a></h2><p>Maternal provisioning is particularly important in invertebrates with abbreviated development because large  reserves must be provided for the developing embryo. In this context, the objective of the present study was to analyze in an aquatic invertebrate with direct development the effect of temperature on female biochemical composition and reserve allocation to maturing ovaries, which determine egg quality. A decapod crustacean, the freshwater shrimp Neocaridina davidi, was used as experimental model. Newly hatched juveniles were exposed to 28 °C or 33 °C. Females showed mature ovaries and spawned at 28 °C (control ovigerous females), but no ovigerous female was found at 33 °C. After a 200-day period, half of the females at 33 °C were transferred to 28 °C, where they rapidly showed mature ovaries and spawned (transferred ovigerous females). Ovigerous females and females that did not spawn at 28 °C (control non-ovigerous females) and at 33 °C (high-temperature non-ovigerous females) were sacrificed to determine their biochemical composition. The number, volume, weight, and biochemical composition of the eggs from transferred and control ovigerous females were also analyzed as indicators of their quality. Female biochemical composition was not influenced by temperature, because control and high-temperature non-ovigerous females had similar lipid, protein, and glycogen contents. However, ovarian maturation and spawning were inhibited at 33 °C, which indicates a negative effect of this temperature on nutrient transfer to the oocytes. This effect was rapidly reversed after females were moved to 28 °C; the eggs from control and transferred ovigerous females were of similar quality, except for a lower protein content in the latter. The present results provide valuable information on reserve allocation to reproduction under thermal stress.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26802939>Supplementation of maternal omega-3 fatty acids to pregnancy induced hypertension Wistar rats improves IL10 and VEGF levels.</a></h2><p>Our recent study demonstrates the beneficial effect of a combined supplementation of vitamin B12, folic , and   in reducing the severity of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). It is also known to be associated with angiogenic imbalance and inflammation. The current study examines whether the individual/combined supplementation of folic , vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty  during pregnancy can ameliorate the inflammatory markers and restore the angiogenic balance in a rat model of PIH.There were total of six groups, control and five treatment groups: PIH Induced; PIH+vitamin B12; PIH+folic ; PIH+Omega-3 fatty acids and PIH+combined micronutrient supplementation (vitamin B12+folic +omega-3 fatty acids). Hypertension during pregnancy was induced using L- Nitroarginine methylester (L-NAME; 50mg/kg body weight/day). Dams were dissected at d20 of gestation and placental tissues were collected for further analysis.Animals from the PIH induced group demonstrated lower (p<0.01 for both) IL-10 and VEGF levels as compared to control. However, PIH induction did not alter the protein levels of eNOS, IL-6, Flt and mRNA levels of VEGF and VEGFR-1/ Flt-1. Individual micronutrient supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate did not offer benefit. In contrast individual omega-3 fatty  as well as combined micronutrient supplementation showed IL-10 and VEGF levels comparable to that of control.Omega 3 fatty  supplementation plays a key role in reducing inflammation in pregnancy induced hypertension.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Ionic Liquids.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a significant role in the modulation and prevention of various diseases, and hence are attracting increasing attention from the biotech industry. Thraustochytrids are marine heterokonts that exhibit robust growth rates, high PUFA content, and more specifically, a large percentage of omega-3 fatty acids like   (DHA). Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to improve the efficiency of organic solvent extraction of oils from wet oleaginous yeast and microalgae under mild conditions. Two ILs, the imidazolium 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate [C₂mim][EtSO₄] IL and the phosphonium (tetrabutylphosphonium propanoate [P][Prop]) IL were assessed for their ability to facilitate extraction of PUFA-containing lipids from a  sp. (T18) through efficient cell wall disruption. The oil extracted after IL pretreatment was further characterized with respect to fatty    (FAME) composition, while the effects of process parameters, such as the ratio of ionic liquid to co-solvent, the mass ratio of microalgae to the mixture of ionic liquid, and type of co-solvent were also investigated for both ILs. The results indicate that these ILs can disrupt the cells of  sp. when mixed with a co-solvent (methanol), and facilitated the recovery of oils over a large degree of dewatered  biomass (0⁻77.2 wt% water) in a short period of time (60 min) at ambient temperature, hence demonstrating a water compatible, low-, lipid recovery method. The lipid recovery was not affected by repeated usage of recycled ILs (tested up to five times).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24128590>Structural elucidation of olive pomace fed sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) polar lipids with cardioprotective activities.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to structurally characterise the polar lipids of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), fed with an experimental diet containing olive pomace (OP), that exhibit cardioprotective activities. OP has been added to conventional fish oil (FO) feed at 4% and this was the OP diet, having been supplemented as finishing diet to fish. Sea bass was aquacultured using either FO or OP diet. At the end of the dietary experiment, lipids in both samples of fish muscle were quantified and HPLC fractionated. The in vitro cardioprotective properties of the polar lipid fractions, using washed rabbit's platelets, have been assessed and the two most biologically active fractions were further analysed by mass spectrometry. The gas-chromatrograpy-mass spectrometric data shows that these two fractions contain low levels of myristic (14:0), oleic (18:1 cis ω-9) and linoleic acids (18:2 ω-6), but high levels of palmitic (16:0) and stearic acids (18:0) as well as eicosadienoic  (20:2 ω-6). The first fraction (MS1) also contained significant levels of arachidonic  (20:4 ω-6) and the omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic  (22:5) and   (22:6). Electrospray-mass spectrometry elucidated that the lipid composition of the two fractions contained various diacyl-glycerophospholipids species, where the majority of them have either 18:0 or 18:1 fatty acids in the sn-1 position and either 22:6 or 20:2 fatty acids in the sn-2 position for MS1 and MS2, respectively. Our research focuses on the structure/function relationship of fish muscle polar lipids and cardiovascular diseases and structural data are given for polar lipid HPLC fractions with strong cardioprotective properties.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects on neuronal potassium channels are less explored and experimental data ambiguous. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-excitable effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the neuronal M-channel, important for setting the resting membrane potential in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurones.Effects of fatty acids and fatty acid analogues on mouse dorsal root ganglion neurones and on the human KV 7.2/3 channel expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were studied using electrophysiology.Extracellular application of physiologically relevant concentrations of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (-2.4 mV by 30 μm) and increased the threshold current to evoke action potentials in dorsal root ganglion neurones. The polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid, α-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid facilitated opening of the human M-channel, comprised of the heteromeric human KV 7.2/3 channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes, by shifting the conductance-vs.-voltage curve towards more negative voltages (by -7.4 to -11.3 mV by 70 μm). Uncharged  and monounsaturated oleic acid did not facilitate opening of the human KV 7.2/3 channel.These findings suggest that circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids, with a minimum requirement of multiple double bonds and a charged carboxyl group, dampen excitability by opening neuronal M-channels. Collectively, our data bring light to the molecular targets of polyunsaturated fatty acids and thus a possible mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce neuronal excitability.© 2016 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

We sought to determine the efficacy of alpha-substituted DHA derivatives as lipid-lowering, antiobesity, and antidiabetic agents. C57BL/6 mice were given a corn oil-based high-fat (35% weight/weight) diet (cHF), or cHF with 1.5% of lipids replaced with alpha- DHA ethyl  (Substance 1), alpha-ethyl DHA ethyl  (Substance 2), alpha,alpha-di- DHA ethyl  (Substance 3), or alpha-thioethyl DHA ethyl  (Substance 4) for 4 months. Plasma markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, glucose tolerance, morphology, tissue lipid content, and gene regulation were characterized. The cHF induced , hyperlipidemia, impairment of glucose homeostasis, and adipose tissue inflammation. Except for Substance 3, all other substances prevented weight gain and Substance 2 exerted the strongest effect (63% of cHF-controls). Glucose intolerance was significantly prevented (~67% of cHF) by both Substance 1 and Substance 2. Moreover, Substance 2 lowered fasting glycemia, plasma insulin, triacylglycerols, and nonesterified fatty acids (73, 9, 47, and 81% of cHF-controls, respectively). Substance 2 reduced accumulation of lipids in liver and skeletal muscle, as well as adipose tissue inflammation associated with . Substance 2 also induced weight loss in dietary obese mice. In contrast to DHA administered either alone or as a component of the EPA/DHA concentrate (replacing 15% of dietary lipids), Substance 2 also reversed established glucose intolerance in obese mice.

Utilizing thin layer chromatography, we found that the peroxidized products isolated from the inflamed retinas were fatty acid hydroperoxides that corresponded to the autooxidized products from commercial , with Rf values ranging from 0.30 to 0.37. These were not demonstrated in similar preparations from normal retinas or in unoxidized docosahexaenoate. Boyden chamber assay revealed that the hydroperoxides isolated from inflamed eyes and the products of oxidized  possessed significantly higher chemotactic activity than did the retinal lipids isolated from normal eyes (P less than 0.01). These findings may help to explain the mechanism of inflammatory amplification induced by peroxidized retinal lipids that is seen in this animal model of uveitis.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110888>Inhibition of oxidation of aqueous emulsions of omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil by phloretin and phloridzin.</a></h2><p>The antioxidant properties of two apple dihydrochalcones, namely phloretin and phloridzin, were evaluated and compared with those of alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The effects were studied in an oil-in-water emulsion system containing methyl linolenate (ML), methyl eicosapentaenoate (MEPA), and  (MDHA) in which oxidation was initiated by the peroxyl radical generator 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and in fish oil where oxidation was initiated thermally. In the emulsion system, phloretin (1 and 5 mM) completely inhibited the oxidation of ML tested as evidenced by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. Under the same conditions, phloridzin was less effective than phloretin, but still more effective than alpha-tocopherol. Both phloretin and phloridzin molecules had a marginal inhibitory effect against oxidation of fish oil induced by heating at 70 degrees C for 3 hours, when compared to BHT.

In this study, we compared eight new endemic Australian thraustochytrid strains from the genera Aurantiochytrium, Schizochytrium, Thraustochytrium, and Ulkenia for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide (EPS), in addition to biodiesel and LC-PUFA. Aurantiochytrium sp. strains readily utilized glucose for biomass production, and increasing glucose from 2 to 4 % w/v of the culture medium resulted in increased biomass yield by an average factor of 1.7. Ulkenia sp. strain TC 010 and Thraustochytrium sp. strain TC 033 did not utilize glucose, while Schizochytrium sp. strain TC 002 utilized less than half the glucose available by day 14, and Thraustochytrium sp. strain TC 004 utilized glucose at 4 % w/v but not 2 % w/v of the culture suggesting a threshold requirement between these values. Across all strains, increasing glucose from 2 to 4 % w/v of the culture medium resulted in increased total fatty    content by an average factor of 1.9. Despite an increasing literature demonstrating the capacity of thraustochytrids for DHA synthesis, the production of EPS from these organisms is not well documented. A broad range of EPS yields was observed. The maximum yield of EPS was observed for Schizochytrium sp. strain TC 002 (299 mg/L). High biomass-producing strains that also have high lipid and high EPS yield may be better candidates for commercial production of biofuels and other coproducts.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620276>Global metabolomic profiling of human synovial fluid for rheumatoid arthritis biomarkers.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to analyse the metabolomic profiles of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid to test the use of global metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for clinical analysis of synovial fluid.Metabolites were extracted from rheumatoid arthritis (n=3) and healthy (n=5) synovial fluid samples using 50:50 water: acetonitrile.

Phloridzin shows poor absorption and cellular uptake due to its hydrophilic nature. The aim was to investigate and compare the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ester of PZ (PZ-DHA) and its parent compounds (phloridzin and DHA), phloretin (the aglycone of PZ) and cyclooxygenase inhibitory drugs (diclofenac and nimesulide) on production of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in inflammation-induced macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation. Human THP-1 monocytes were seeded in 24-well plates (5×10(5)/well) and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 0.1μg/mL) for 48h to induce macrophage differentiation. After 48h, the differentiated macrophages were washed with Hank's buffer and treated with various concentrations of test compounds for 4h, followed by the LPS-stimulation (18h). Pre-exposure of PZ-DHA ester was more effective in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels compared to DHA and nimesulide. However, diclofenac was the most effective in reducing prostaglandin (PGE2) level by depicting a dose-dependent response. However, PZ-DHA ester and DHA were the most effective in inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) among other test compounds.

Data show that the saturated fatty  palmitic , as well as lauric  and stearic , trigger the release of TNFα and IL-6 from astrocytes. Unsaturated fatty acids were unable to induce cytokine release from cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, the effects of palmitic  on cytokine release require Toll-like receptor 4 rather than CD36 or Toll-like receptor 2, and do not depend on palmitic  metabolism to palmitoyl-CoA. Inhibitor studies revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of p38 or p42/44 MAPK pathways prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of palmitic , whereas JNK and PI3K inhibition does not affect cytokine release. Depletion of microglia from primary astrocyte cultures using the lysosomotropic agent l-leucine   revealed that the ability of palmitic  to trigger cytokine release is not dependent on the presence of microglia. Finally, data show that the essential ω-3 fatty    acts in a dose-dependent manner to prevent the actions of palmitic  on inflammatory signaling in astrocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate the ability of saturated fatty acids to induce astrocyte inflammation in vitro. These data thus raise the possibility that high levels of circulating saturated fatty acids could cause reactive gliosis and brain inflammation in vivo, and could potentially participate in the reported adverse neurologic consequences of  and metabolic syndrome.© 2012 The Authors.
