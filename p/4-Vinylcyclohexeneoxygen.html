<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875473>VOC Emissions and Formation Mechanisms from Carbon Nanotube Composites during 3D Printing.</a></h1><p>A commercially available, 3D printer nanocomposite filament of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was analyzed with respect to its VOC emissions during simulated fused deposition modeling (FDM) and compared with a regular ABS filament. VOC emissions were quantified and characterized under a variety of conditions to simulate the thermal degradation that takes place during FDM. Increasing the residence time and temperature resulted in significant increases in VOC emissions, and the  content of the reaction gas influenced the VOC profile. In agreement with other studies, the primary emitted VOC was styrene. Multiple compounds are reported in this work for the first time as having formed during FDM, including  and 2-phenyl-2-propanol. Our results show that printing 222.0 g of filament is enough to surpass the reference concentration for inhalation exposure of 1 mg/m according to the EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). The presence of CNTs in the filament influenced VOC yields and product ratios through three types of surface interactions: (1) adsorption of O on CNTs lowers the available O for oxidation of primary backbone cleavage intermediates, (2) adsorption of styrene and other VOCs to CNTs leads to surface-catalyzed degradation, and (3) CNTs act as a trap for certain VOCs and prevent them from entering vapor emissions. While the presence of CNTs in the filament lowered the total VOC emission under most experimental conditions, they increased the emission of the most hazardous VOCs, such as α-methylstyrene and benzaldehyde. The present study has identified an increased risk associated with the use of CNT nanocomposites in 3D printing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428448>Accelerated ovarian failure induced by 4-vinyl cyclohexene diepoxide in Nrf2 null mice.</a></h1><p>Genetic and biochemical analyses have uncovered an essential role for nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in regulating phase II xenobiotic  and antioxidant response. Here we show that Nrf2 protects against the ovarian toxicity of  diepoxide (VCD) in mice. Nrf2-/- female mice exposed to VCD exhibit an age-dependent decline in reproduction leading to secondary infertility accompanied by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism after 30 weeks of age. VCD is shown to selectively destroy small ovarian follicles, resulting in early depletion of functional follicles. Treatment with VCD induces apoptotic death in cultured cells and in ovarian follicles, suggesting apoptosis as a mechanism of follicle loss. Loss of Nrf2 function blocks the basal and inducible expression of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, a key enzyme in the detoxification of VCD, and increases the oxidative stress in cells that is further exacerbated by VCD. Foxo3a, a repressor in the early stages of follicle activation, displays reduced expression in Nrf2-/- ovaries, causing accelerated growth of follicles in the absence of exposure to exogenous chemicals. Furthermore, Foxo3a is degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway in untreated cells and is induced by VCD via both Nrf2-dependent transcription and protein stabilization. This study demonstrates that Nrf2 serves as an essential sensor and regulator of chemical homeostasis in ovarian cells, protecting the cells from toxic chemicals by controlling  detoxification, reactive oxygen species defense, and Foxo3a expression. In addition, these findings raise the possibility that exposure to environmental or occupational ovotoxicants plays a role in the premature ovarian failure commonly associated with infertility and premature aging in women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778464>Peroxiredoxin 2 deficiency accelerates age-related ovarian failure through the reactive  species-mediated JNK pathway in mice.</a></h1><p>Reactive  species (ROS) produced in biological reactions have been shown to contribute to ovarian aging. Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by scavenging ROS; however, its effect on age-related, oxidative stress-associated ovarian failure has not been reported. Here, we investigated its role in age-related ovarian dysfunction and  diepoxide (VCD)-induced premature ovarian failure using Prx2-deficient mice. Compared to those in wildtype (WT) mice, serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone, 17β-estradiol, and progesterone and numbers of follicles and corpora lutea were significantly lower in 18-month-old Prx2 mice. Moreover, levels of Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, and phosphorylated JNK proteins were higher and numbers of apoptotic (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive) cells were considerably greater in 18-month-old Prx2 ovaries than WT ovaries. Furthermore, the effects of the ovarian toxicant VCD in significantly enhancing ROS levels and apoptosis through activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling were more pronounced in Prx2 than WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Expression of the steroidogenic proteins StAR, CYP11A1, and 3β-HSD and serum levels of 17β-estradiol and progesterone were also reduced to a greater extent in Prx2 mice than WT mice after VCD injection. This reduced steroidogenesis was rescued by addition of the Prx mimic ebselen or JNK inhibitor SP600125. This constitutes the first report that Prx2 deficiency leads to acceleration of age-related or VCD-induced ovarian failure by activation of the ROS-induced JNK pathway. These findings suggest that Prx2 plays an important role in preventing accelerated ovarian failure by inhibiting ROS-induced JNK activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although, several studies have reported the ovotoxicity of VCH, information on a possible involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of this occupational chemical is scarce. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate further possible mechanisms of toxicity of VCH with a specific emphasis on oxidative stress using a Drosophila melanogaster model. D. melanogaster (both genders) of 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different concentrations of VCH (10 µM-1 mM) in the diet for 5 days. Subsequently, the survival and negative geotaxis assays and the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined. In addition, we evaluated RT-PCR expressions of selected oxidative stress and antioxidant mRNA genes (HSP27, 70, and 83, SOD, Nrf-2, MAPK2, and catalase). Furthermore, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined. VCH exposure impaired negative geotaxic behavior and induced the mRNA of SOD, Nrf-2, and MAPK2 genes expressions. There were increases in catalase and ROS production, as well as inhibitions of GST, δ-ALA-D, and AChE activities (P<0.05). Our results suggest that the VCH mechanism of toxicity is associated with oxidative damage, as evidenced by the alteration in the oxidative stress-antioxidant balance, and possible neurotoxic consequences due to decreased AChE activity, and impairments in negative geotaxic behavior. Thus, we conclude that D. melanogaster is a useful model for investigating the toxicity of VCH exposure, and here, we have provided further insights on the mechanism of VCH-induced toxicity.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, VCM and VCD may be found as by-products of VCH oxidation in the environment. Recently, we reported the involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of VCH in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it was not possible to determine the individual contributions of VCM and VCD in VCH toxicity. Hence, we investigated the toxicity of VCM and VCD (10-1000 µM) in flies after 5 days of exposure via the diet. Our results indicated impairments in climbing behaviour and disruptions in antioxidant balance and redox status evidenced by an increase in DCFH oxidation, decreases in total thiol content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in the flies exposed to VCM and VCD (p<0.05). These effects were accompanied by disruptions in the transcription of the genes encoding the proteins superoxide dismutase (SOD1), kelch-like erythroid-derived cap-n-collar (CNC) homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), mitogen activated protein kinase 2 (MAPK-2), catalase, Cyp18a1, JAFRAC 1 (thioredoxin peroxidase 1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR-1) (p<0.05). VCM and VCD inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA D) activities in the flies (p<0.05). Indeed, here, we demonstrated that different target enzymes and genes were modified by the electrophiles VCM and VCD in the flies. Thus, D. melanogaster has provided further lessons on the toxicity of VCM and VCD which suggest that the reported toxicity of VCH may be mediated by its transformation to VCM and VCD.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Because of their nonrenewing nature, these "resting" oocytes are particularly vulnerable to xenobiotic insult, resulting in premature ovarian senescence and the formation of dysfunctional oocytes. In this study, we characterized the mechanisms of ovotoxicity for three ovotoxic agents,  diepoxide (VCD), methoxychlor (MXC), and menadione (MEN), all of which target immature follicles. Microarray analysis of neonatal mouse ovaries exposed to these xenobiotics in vitro revealed a more than twofold significant difference in transcript expression (p < 0.05) for a number of genes associated with apoptotic cell death and primordial follicle activation. Histomorphological and immunohistological analysis supported the microarray data, showing signs of primordial follicle activation and preantral follicle atresia both in vitro and in vivo. Sperm-oocyte fusion assays on oocytes obtained from adult Swiss mice treated neonatally revealed severely reduced sperm-egg binding and fusion in a dose-dependent manner for all the xenobiotic treatments. Additionally, lipid peroxidation analysis on xenobiotic-cultured oocytes indicated a dose-dependent increase in oocyte lipid peroxidation for all three xenobiotics in vitro. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of preantral ovotoxicity involving the homeostatic recruitment of primordial follicles to maintain the pool of developing follicles destroyed by xenobiotic exposure and to our knowledge provide the first documented evidence of short-term, low- and high-dose (VCD 40-80 mg/kg/day, MXC 50-100 mg/kg/day, MEN 7.5-15 mg/kg/day) neonatal exposure to xenobiotics causing long-term reactive oxygen species-induced oocyte dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27258136>Hepatic and renal toxicological evaluations of an industrial ovotoxic chemical,  diepoxide, in both sexes of Wistar rats.</a></h1><p> diepoxide (VCD) is an industrial occupational health hazard chemical because it induces ovotoxicity in rodents. The current study investigated the impacts of VCD on selected hepatic and renal markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in both sexes of Wistar rats. Thus, male and female rats were randomly distributed into four groups of ten rats per group, and dosed orally with VCD for 28days. The control male and female groups of rats received corn oil only, while each of the three remaining groups of both sexes of rats received VCD (100, 250 and 500mg/kg BW) respectively. Thereafter, biomarkers of hepatic and renal oxidative damage, inflammation and immunohistochemical expressions of iNOS, COX-2, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were evaluated. The results revealed that VCD increased markers of liver and kidney functions, oxidative damage and inflammation, and disrupted the antioxidant homeostasis of the rats (p<0.05). Lastly, VCD enhanced the immunohistochemical expressions of iNOS, COX-2, caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the liver of the rats. Thus, our data imply that VCD induced toxicity in the liver and kidney of rats via the combined impacts of oxidative damage and inflammation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
