It consists of a native pollen extract for 13 grass species, chemically modified with glutaraldehyde, and adsorbed to  in a microcrystalline form with addition of the adjuvant Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL ). Previous non-clinical safety testing, including rat repeat dose toxicity in adult and juvenile animals, rat reproductive toxicity and rabbit local tolerance studies showed no safety findings of concern. A new Good Laboratory Practice compliant rat subcutaneous repeat dose toxicity study to evaluate a higher clinical dose and modified posology (once every 2 weeks for 13 weeks) showed no signs of toxicity. As seen in previous studies, relatively minor, immunostimulatory effects were seen such as reversible increased white cell count (notably neutrophils), increased globulin level (resulting in decreased A/G ratio) and increased fibrinogen as well as minor dose site reaction in the form of inflammatory cell infiltrate. These findings are likely due to the immunostimulatory nature of MPL and/or the presence of  within the adjuvanted vaccine. This new toxicity study with PQ Grass therefore supports longer posology with higher dose levels.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902997>iRGD synergizes with PD-1 knockout  by enhancing lymphocyte infiltration in gastric cancer.</a></h1><p>Poor infiltration of activated lymphocytes into tumors represents a fundamental factor limiting the therapeutic effect of adoptive cell . A tumor-penetrating peptide, iRGD, has been widely used to deliver drugs into tumor tissues. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that iRGD could also facilitate the infiltration of lymphocytes in both 3D tumor spheroids and several xenograft mouse models. In addition, combining iRGD modification with PD-1 knockout lymphocytes reveals a superior anti-tumor efficiency. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the binding of iRGD to neuropilin-1 results in  phosphorylation of the endothelial barrier regulator VE-cadherin, which plays a role in the opening of endothelial cell contacts and the promotion of transendothelial lymphocyte migration. In summary, these results demonstrate that iRGD modification could promote tumor-specific lymphocyte infiltration, and thereby overcome the bottleneck associated with adoptive immune cell therapy in solid tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406302>Co-occurring genomic alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer biology and therapy.</a></h1><p>The impressive clinical activity of small-molecule receptor  kinase inhibitors for oncogene-addicted subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (for example, those driven by activating mutations in the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or rearrangements in the genes encoding the receptor  kinases anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) and rearranged during transfection (RET)) has established an oncogene-centric molecular classification paradigm in this disease. However, recent studies have revealed considerable phenotypic diversity downstream of tumour-initiating oncogenes. Co-occurring genomic alterations, particularly in tumour suppressor genes such as TP53 and LKB1 (also known as STK11), have emerged as core determinants of the molecular and clinical heterogeneity of oncogene-driven lung cancer subgroups through their effects on both tumour cell-intrinsic and non-cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks. In this Review, we discuss the impact of co-mutations on the pathogenesis, biology, microenvironmental interactions and therapeutic vulnerabilities of non-small-cell lung cancer and assess the challenges and opportunities that co-mutations present for personalized anticancer therapy, as well as the expanding field of precision .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497341>Trends in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: immune checkpoint blockade  and related combination therapies.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Systemic treatments with several multi-targeted  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib and cabozantinib, have been widely utilized int the treatment of HCC. However, with tolerable adverse events and relative low survival time, neo or optimized therapies for advanced HCC are still urgently needed. New developed immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy have been first demonstrated effective in metastatic melanoma through against CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 to renew T cell effector function. Preclinical data indicated that interference with immune checkpoint molecules results in HCC growth suppression, suggesting it may bring hope to the HCC treatment. Several clinical trials applying monoclonal antibodies to immune checkpoint molecules demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors are safe and enable durable antitumor activity in advanced HCC patients. Several published  trials in HCC using Anti-CTLA-4 agents (tremelimumab) or anit-PD-1 agents (Nivolumab) have showed promising results, in which have similar response rate (15%-30%) and disease control rate with TKIs therapies.

Here we unravel the results of an unbiased screen identifying high-dose (10 µM) crizotinib as an ICD-inducing  kinase inhibitor that has exceptional antineoplastic activity when combined with non-ICD inducing chemotherapeutics like cisplatin. The combination of cisplatin and high-dose crizotinib induces ICD in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells and effectively controls the growth of distinct (transplantable, carcinogen- or oncogene induced) orthotopic NSCLC models. These anticancer effects are linked to increased T lymphocyte infiltration and are abolished by T cell depletion or interferon-γ neutralization. Crizotinib plus cisplatin leads to an increase in the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumors, coupled to a strong sensitization of NSCLC to  with PD-1 antibodies. Hence, a sequential combination treatment consisting in conventional chemotherapy together with crizotinib, followed by immune checkpoint blockade may be active against NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285907>Changes in store for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>The management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been revolutionized in recent years with the introduction of biomarker-targeted molecular therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. In contrast, since adjuvant chemotherapy was first established twenty years ago as the standard of care, little has changed for resected early-stage (IB-IIIA) patients for whom the potential for cure is greatest. In this manuscript we will review recently presented data as well as ongoing/planned studies in this arena. So far, investigative efforts have yielded mixed results regarding the use of  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in early-stage NSCLC, though a series of now better planned, biomarker-driven ongoing phase III trials may be more informative. Several innovative  studies have already shown promising results principally in the neoadjuvant setting with a large number of pivotal neo-adjuvant and adjuvant trials now in progress. Given the more robust design and biomarker-focused approach of the new generation of studies, significant advances in the optimal curative treatment of early stage NSCLC are anticipated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p> Renal cell carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with  kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several immune-related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of immune-related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to  in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864018>Strategies to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR TKI in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and has been the first-line therapy in clinical practice. While erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib have achieved superior efficacy in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival compared with conventional chemotherapy in NSCLC patients, most people inevitably develop acquired resistance to them, which presents another challenge in the treatment of NSCLC. The mechanisms of acquired resistance can be classified as three types: target gene mutation, bypass signaling pathway activation and histological transformation. And the most common mechanism is T790M which accounts for approximately 50% of all subtypes. Many strategies have been explored to overcome the acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. Continuation of EGFR TKI beyond progressive disease is confined to patients in asymptomatic stage when the EGFR addiction is still preserved in some subclones. While the combination of EGFR TKI and chemotherapy or other targeted agents has improved the survival benefit in EGFR TKI resistant patients, there are controversies within them. The next-generation EGFR TKI and  represent two novel directions for overcoming acquired resistance and have achieved promising efficacy. Liquid biopsy provides surveillance of the EGFR mutation by disclosing the entire genetic landscape but tissue biopsy is still indispensable because of the considerable rate of false-negative plasma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937130>H NMR-based metabolomic study of metabolic profiling for pollinosis.</a></h1><p>Allergic rhinitis is the main symptom of pollinosis, relieved by non-specific treatment universally.

Besides their direct activity against tumor cells, monoclonal antibodies and  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) also influence the antitumoral activity of immune cells, which has important implications for the design of immunotherapies. In this preclinical study, we treated different ovarian cancer cell lines with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs and co-incubated them with natural killer (NK) cells. We studied treatment-related structural and functional changes on tumor and immune cells in the presence of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab and investigated NK-mediated antitumoral activity. We show that long-term exposure of ovarian cancer cells to TKIs leads to reduced responsiveness of intrinsically sensitive cancer cells over time. Inversely, neither long-term treatment with TKIs nor cetuximab could overcome the intrinsic resistance of certain ovarian cancer cells to anti-EGFR agents. Remarkably, tumor cells pretreated with anti-EGFR TKIs showed increased sensitivity towards NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In contrast, the cytokine secretion of NK cells was reduced by TKI sensitization. Our data suggest that sensitization of tumor cells by anti-EGFR TKIs differentially modulates interactions with NK cells. These data have important implications for the design of chemo-immuno combination therapies in this tumor entity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360140>Current and Future Systemic Therapies for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with unmet needs and limited effective therapeutic options. The management strategy for diagnosed HCC is based on Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging. Advanced HCC is treated with systemic therapy comprising oral  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and intravenous immune checkpoint inhibitors, provided that liver function is reasonable. Five new agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past 2 years for the treatment of HCC: lenvatinib in the first-line setting, and regorafenib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cabozantinib as second-line therapies. The FDA is considering a label expansion of ramucirumab to include its use in HCC. These therapies have all been shown to extend overall patient survival and appear to have a reasonable safety profile. Multiple ongoing trials are studying immune checkpoint inhibition alone or in combination with TKIs. The results of these trials will help determine the optimal choice, timing, and sequence of agents. This article reviews the role of currently approved systemic therapies for HCC and highlights potential future combination therapeutic strategies. The article also brings forward the concept of a developing shift to the left for therapy, as mapped out in the BCLC staging and treatment algorithm, marking earlier use of systemic therapy prior to advanced progression of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut microbiota and cancer: How gut microbiota modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.

Anti-cytokine therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in IBD. Janus kinases (JAKs) are  kinases that bind different intracellular cytokine receptors, leading to phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of transcription molecules implicated on targeted gene transcription. Four isoforms of JAKs have been described: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Oral JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have been developed as synergic anti-cytokine therapy in IBD, showing different selectivity towards JAK isoforms. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC. With the aim of improving the benefit: risk ratio of this drug class, several second-generation subtype-selective JAKi are under development. However, whether selective inhibition of JAK isoforms is associated with an increased clinical efficacy and/or a better safety profile remains debatable. The aim of this review is to critically review the preclinical and clinical data for the differential selectivity of JAK inhibitors and to summarise the potential clinical implications of the selective JAK inhibitors under development for UC and CD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The ubiquitous expression of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands among the cellular players of the immune system underscores the importance of these molecules in orchestrating an optimal immune response. This review provides an overview of the various roles of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands in immune cell development, activation, and migration. We also discuss the role of Eph receptors in disease pathogenesis as well as the implications of Eph receptors as future  targets. Given the diverse and critical roles of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands throughout the immune system during both resting and activated states, this review aims to highlight the critical yet underappreciated roles of this family of signaling molecules in the immune system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646776>Current and emerging first-line systemic therapies in metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The treatment of metastatic clear-cell renal cell cancer (mccRCC) has seen substantial progress over the last decade. Until 2006, non-specific  with high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib ( kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual checkpoint inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era.

We investigated these immune checkpoint markers in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) in the tumor microenvironment of 100 untreated and 25 VEGF-TKI-treated primary ccRCC tissues. Upregulated expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 by TIIC, and PD-L1 by tumor cells was associated with the histological grade and unfavorable prognosis of RCC patients. High PD-1 and PD-L1 expression by TIIC was associated with a poorer response to VEGF-TKI, whereas PD-L1 expression by tumor cells did not affect the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, increased PD-1-positive TIIC and PD-L1-positive TIIC were observed in tumors treated with VEGF-TKIs compared with those in untreated tumors. Our data suggest that PD-1 and PD-L1 expression by TIIC in the tumor microenvironment is involved in treatment resistance, and that sequential therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic strategy for ccRCC resistant to VEGF-TKI treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a 20-minute 18F-FET PET scan in MRI-suspected recurrent glioblastoma 6 months after standard radiotherapy and its ability to prognosticate overall survival (OS).In total, 146 glioblastoma patients with 168 18F-FET PET scans were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with MRI responses to bevacizumab or undergoing re-irradiation or  after 18F-FET PET were excluded. Maximum and mean tumor-to-background ratios (TBRmax, TBRmean) and biological tumor volume (BTV) were recorded and verified by histopathology or clinical/radiological follow-up. Thresholds of 18F-FET parameters were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Prognostic factors were investigated in Cox proportional hazards models.Surgery was performed after 104 18F-FET PET scans, while clinical/radiological surveillance was used following 64, identifying 152 glioblastoma recurrences and 16 posttreatment changes. ROC analysis yielded thresholds of 2.0 for TBRmax, 1.8 for TBRmean, and 0.55 cm3 for BTV in differentiating recurrent glioblastoma from posttreatment changes with the best performance of TBRmax (sensitivity 99%, specificity 94%; P < 0.0001) followed by BTV (sensitivity 98%, specificity 94%; P < 0.0001). Using these thresholds, 166 18F-FET PET scans were correctly classified. Increasing BTV was associated with shorter OS (P < 0.0001).A 20-minute 18F-FET PET scan is a powerful tool to distinguish posttreatment changes from recurrent glioblastoma 6-month postradiotherapy, and predicts OS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we report that while irAE-prone Ipilimumab and TremeIgG1 rapidly direct cell surface CTLA-4 for lysosomal degradation, the non-irAE-prone antibodies we generated, HL12 or HL32, dissociate from CTLA-4 after endocytosis and allow CTLA-4 recycling to cell surface by the LRBA-dependent mechanism. Disrupting CTLA-4 recycling results in robust CTLA-4 downregulation by all anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and confers toxicity to a non-irAE-prone anti-CTLA-4 mAb. Conversely, increasing the pH sensitivity of TremeIgG1 by introducing designed -to-histidine mutations prevents antibody-triggered lysosomal CTLA-4 downregulation and dramatically attenuates irAE. Surprisingly, by avoiding CTLA-4 downregulation and due to their increased bioavailability, pH-sensitive anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are more effective in intratumor regulatory T-cell depletion and rejection of large established tumors. Our data establish a new paradigm for cancer research that allows for abrogating irAE while increasing CITE of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048702>Myasthenia gravis.</a></h1><p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or other AChR-related proteins in the postsynaptic muscle membrane.

Here, we have observed that hypofractionated EGFR TKI treatment (HypoTKI) is more potent than standard hyperfractionated EGFR TKI treatment (HyperTKI), and its antitumor effect associated with preventing tumor relapse depends on T cells. HypoTKI triggers greater innate sensing for type I IFN and CXCL10 production through the Myd88 signaling pathway to enhance tumor-specific T cell infiltration and reactivation. We also demonstrate that timely programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade can synergize with HypoTKI to control advanced large tumors and effectively limit tumor relapse without severe side effects. Our study provides evidence for exploring the potential of a proper combination of EGFR TKIs and  as a first-line treatment for treating EGFR-driven tumors.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

According to Dr. Wells A. Messersmith, targeted therapies (ie, VEGFR, EGFR, multitargeted  kinase inhibitors) play an important role in CRC management, but none of them have been successful in the adjuvant setting (although checkpoint inhibition is now being tested in MSI-high stage III CRC). Reliable predictive biomarkers for most agents are still greatly lacking, highlighting the importance of investing in CRC biomarker studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617128>Aggressive prolactinomas: how to manage?</a></h1><p>Aggressive prolactinomas are defined as radiologically invasive tumors which cannot be cured by surgery, and that have an unusually rapid rate of tumor growth despite dopamine agonist treatment and surgery. In some cases, metastasis occurs, defining prolactin carcinoma which is the second most frequent pituitary carcinoma.A literature search was performed to review the available data on the treatment of aggressive pituitary prolactinomas or carcinomas.When optimal standard therapies (high dose cabergoline, surgery and radiotherapy) failed, temozolomide, an alkylating drug, is currently the best option, allowing to control tumor growth in about 50% of treated prolactinomas and improving overall survival of these patients. However, long-term complete response occurs in a limited subgroup of tumors. Alternative drugs could be discussed in a subset of aggressive prolactinomas either before temozolomide (pasireotide, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy…) or after temozolomide failure.Despite the significant improvement obtained with the use of temozolomide, a need for alternative drugs persists since a majority of these tumors are resistant or will recur during the follow-up. Patients suffering from such a rare condition should have access to clinical trials available for other types of rare cancers, such as  kinase inhibitors or .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493284>In vitro cytotoxic effect of Trastuzumab in combination with Pertuzumab in breast cancer cells is improved by interleukin-2 activated NK cells.</a></h1><p>Targeting erb-b2 receptor  kinase 2 (ERBB2) using the combination of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab has demonstrated promising results in breast cancer therapy. It has further been revealed that interleukin-2 (IL-2) can activate Natural Killer cells (NK cells) and elevate their cytotoxic potency against tumor cells. In this study, we explored the cytotoxic effect of recombinant human IL-2 in combination with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab on the ERBB2 positive (SK-BR-3) and negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines. The cytotoxicity level of IL-2 activated NK cells (approximately 75%) were significantly higher than untreated cells (approximately 55%) in the presence of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab against SK-BR-3 cells, while no difference was observed in the case of MDA-MB-231 cells (about 15%).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540976>Triple Therapy with MerTK and PD1 Inhibition plus Radiotherapy Promotes Abscopal Antitumor Immune Responses.</a></h1><p>Radiotherapy (RT) traditionally has been used for local tumor control in the treatment of cancer. The recent discovery that radiotherapy can have anti-cancer effects on the immune system has led to recognition of its ability to sensitize the tumor microenvironment to . However, radiation can also prompt adverse immunosuppressive effects that block aspects of systemic response at other tumor sites. Our hypothesis was that inhibition of the MER proto-oncogene  kinase (MerTK) in combination with anti-programmed cell death-1 (α-PD1) checkpoint blockade will enhance immune-mediated responses to radiotherapy.We tested the efficacy of this triple therapy (Radiation + α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs) in 129Sv/Ev mice with bilateral lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Primary tumors were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (36 Gy in three 12-Gy fractions), and tumors were monitored for response.The triple therapy significantly delayed abscopal tumor growth, improved survival rates, and reduced numbers of lung metastases. We further found that the triple therapy increased the activated CD8 and NK cells populations measured by granzyme B expression with upregulation of CD8CD103 tissue-resident memory cells (T) within the abscopal tumor microenvironment relative to radiation only.The addition of α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs to radiotherapy could alter the cell death to be more immunogenic and generate adaptive immune response via increasing the retention of T cells in the tumor islets of the abscopal tumors which was proven to play a major role in survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106530>[The Construction of ROR1 Targeting Chimeric Antigen Receptor Modified T Cells and Its Killing Effect for ROR1-positive Tumor Cells].</a></h1><p>To test the killing effect of type Ⅰ receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR1) chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) on several ROR1-expressing tumor cells The CAR gene was designed and synthesized by constructing the lentiviral vector plasmid, and HⅠ/RⅠ was used to identify the plasmid. The expression levels of ROR1 among a variety of tumor cell lines were compared using flow cytometry (FCM). The killing effect of CAR-T on positive cells was detected by FCM, the LDH assay and ELISA.The double enzyme digestion identified CAR gene was successfully constructed to the lentivirus vector plasmid. FCM detection showed that the efficiency of CAR-T infection was about 47.23%. Multiple tumor cells expressed ROR1 in varying degrees. The FCM and the LDH assay indicated that CAR-T specifically killed ROR1-positive tumor cells. On positive target cells, more interferonI-γ (FN-γ) could be released during the CAR-T killing process than control T (<0.05).We successfully constructed ROR1 CAR-T. CAR-T can specifically kill ROR1-positive tumor cells and cause the release of large amounts of IFN-γ, providing an experimental basis for clinical application.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963600>Mantle cell lymphoma: 2019 update on the diagnosis, pathogenesis, prognostication, and management.</a></h1><p>Unprecedented advances in our understanding of the pathobiology, prognostication, and therapeutic options in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have taken place in the last few years. Heterogeneity in the clinical course of MCL-indolent vs aggressive-is further delineated by a correlation with the mutational status of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain, methylation status, and SOX-11 expression. Cyclin-D1 negative MCL, in situ MCL neoplasia, and impact of the karyotype on prognosis are distinguished. Apart from Ki-67% and morphology pattern (classic vs blastoid/pleomorphic), the proliferation gene signature has helped to further refine prognostication. Studies focusing on mutational dynamics and clonal evolution on Bruton's  kinase (BTK) inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib) and/or Bcl2 antagonists (venetoclax) have further clarified the prognostic impact of somatic mutations in TP53, BIRC3, CDKN2A, MAP3K14, NOTCH2, NSD2, and SMARCA4 genes. In therapy, long-term follow-up on chemo- studies has demonstrated durable remissions in some patients; however, long-term toxicities, especially from second cancers, are a serious concern with chemotherapy. The therapeutic options in MCL are constantly evolving, with dramatic responses from nonchemotherapeutic agents (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and venetoclax). Chimeric antigen receptor therapy and combinations of nonchemotherapeutic agents are actively being studied and our focus is shifting toward making the treatment of MCL chemotherapy-free. Still, MCL remains incurable. The following aspects of MCL continue to pose a challenge: disease transformation, role of the cytokine-microenvironmental milieu, incorporation of positron emission tomography-computerized tomography imaging, minimal residual disease in the prognosis, circulating tumor DNA testing for clonal evolution, predicting resistance to BTK inhibitors, and optimal management of patients who progress on BTK/Bcl2 inhibitors. Next-generation clinical trials should incorporate nonchemotherapeutic agents and personalize the treatment based upon the genomic profile of individual patient. Recent advances in the field of MCL are reviewed.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954906>Choosing wisely first line  in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): what to add and what to leave out.</a></h1><p> has dramatically changed the therapeutic scenario in treatment naïve advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While single agent pembrolizumab has become the standard therapy in patients with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells ≥ 50%, the combination of pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy has emerged as an effective first line treatment regardless of PD-L1 expression both in squamous and non-squamous NSCLC without oncogenic drivers. Furthermore, double immune checkpoint inhibition has shown promising results in treatment naïve patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). Of note, the presence of both negative PD-L1 expression and low TMB may identify a subgroup of patients who has little benefit from  combinations and for whom the best treatment option may still be platinum-based chemotherapy. To date, first-line single agent immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated limited activity in EGFR mutated NSCLC and the combination of  and targeted agents has raised safety concerns in both EGFR and ALK positive NSCLC patients. Finally, in EGFR mutated or ALK rearranged NSCLC, atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab is emerging as a potential treatment option upon progression to first line  kinase inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib in advanced NSCLC. : We searched PubMed, PMC database, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science to obtain the relevant literature. The efficacy and safety of afatinib was assessed based on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), primary grade 3/4 adverse events and fatal adverse events (FAEs). A subgroup analysis was performed according to control type for all end-points. : Seven randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 3093 patients. The meta-analysis showed that afatinib treatment significantly prolonged PFS in patients compared with control groups (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.42-0.76; P = 0.00), increased OS (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99; P = 0.04) and ORR (RR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.13-2.93; P = 0.01). In terms of safety, afatinib significantly increased the incidence of diarrhea (RR = 8.9, 95% CI: 5.33-14.93; P = 0.00), rash (RR = 7.31, 95% CI: 1.56-34.12; P = 0.01) and stomatitis (RR = 6.45, 95% CI: 1.27-32.78; P = 0.03), compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference in FAEs (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.38-1.49; P = 0.41). : This meta-analysis confirmed that afatinib extended survival, improved response rates and did not increase the risk of treatment-related mortality in advanced NSCLC.

In addition, NRPs have been shown to control many other fundamental signaling pathways, especially mediated by  kinase receptors (RTKs) of growth factors, such as HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) and EGF (epidermal growth factor). This enables NRPs to control a range of pivotal mechanisms in the cancer context, from tumor cell proliferation and metastatic dissemination, to tumor angiogenesis and immune escape. Moreover, cancer treatment failures due to resistance to innovative oncogene-targeted drugs is typically associated with the activity of alternative RTK-dependent pathways; and neuropilins' capacity to control oncogenic signaling cascades supports the hypothesis that they could elicit such mechanisms in cancer cells, in order to escape cytotoxic stress and therapeutic attacks. Intriguingly, several studies have recently assayed the impact of NRPs inhibition in combination with diverse anti-cancer drugs. In this minireview, we will discuss the state-of-art about the relevance of NRPs as potential predictive biomarkers of drug response, and the rationale to target these proteins in combination with other anticancer therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308774>Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition in NSCLC: mechanism of action and emerging predictive biomarkers.</a></h1><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Due to often unspecific disease symptoms, locally advanced or metastatic disease is diagnosed in the majority of all cases. Palliative treatment options comprise of conventional cytotoxic agents,  with checkpoint inhibitors and the use of specific small-molecule  kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, these TKIs are mainly restricted to a small proportion of patients with lung cancer that harbor activating driver mutations. Still, the effectiveness and favorable safety profile of these compounds have prompted a systematic search for specific driver mechanisms of tumorigenesis and moreover the development of corresponding kinase inhibitors. In recent years, the Polo-like kinase (PLK) family has emerged as a key regulator in mitotic regulation. Its role in cell proliferation and the frequently observed overexpression in various tumor entities have raised much interest in basic and clinical oncology aiming to attenuate tumor growth by targeting the PLK. In this review, we give a comprehensive summary on the (pre-) clinical development of the different types of PLK inhibitors in lung cancer and summarize their mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy data and give an overview on translational research aiming to identify predictive biomarkers for a rational use of PLK inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953466>Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma: predictors and pitfalls.</a></h1><p>For progressive metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the available treatment options with  kinase inhibitors result in grade 3-4 adverse events in a large number of patients. Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), which has also been suggested to be a useful treatment for MTC, is usually well tolerated, but evidence on its effectivity is very limited.Retrospective evaluation of treatment effects of PRRT in a highly selected group of MTC patients, with progressive disease or refractory symptoms. In addition, a retrospective evaluation of uptake on historical In-DTPA-octreotide scans was performed in patients with detectable tumor size > 1 cm.Over the last 17 years, 10 MTC patients were treated with PRRT. Four out of 10 patients showed stable disease at first follow-up (8 months after start of therapy) whereas the other 6 were progressive. Patients with stable disease were characterized by a combination of both a high uptake on In-DTPA-octreotide scan (uptake grade ≥ 3) and a positive somatostatin receptor type 2a (SSTR2a) expression of the tumor by immunohistochemistry. Retrospective evaluation of historical In-DTPA-octreotide scans of 35 non-treated MTC patients revealed low uptake (uptake grade 1) in the vast majority of patients 31/35 (89%) with intermediate uptake (uptake grade 2) in the remaining 4/35 (11%).PRRT using Lu-octreotate could be considered as a treatment in those patients with high uptake on In-DTPA-octreotide scan (uptake grade 3) and positive SSTR2a expression in tumor histology. Since this high uptake was present in a very limited number of patients, this treatment is only suitable in a selected group of MTC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707374>KIT as an Oncogenic Driver in Melanoma: An Update on Clinical Development.</a></h1><p>Metastatic melanoma is a heterogenous disease that has served as a model for the development of both targeted therapy and . KIT-mutated melanoma represents a rare subset, most commonly arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged skin. Additionally, KIT alterations are enriched in the triple wild-type subtype of cutaneous melanoma. Activating alterations of KIT-a transmembrane receptor  kinase important for cell development, growth, and differentiation-have been shown to be critical to oncogenesis across many tumor subtypes. Following the successes of BRAF-targeted therapy in melanoma and KIT-targeted therapy in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, small-molecule  kinase inhibitors targeting KIT have been examined in KIT-mutated melanoma. KIT inhibitors that have been investigated in relevant clinical trials in advanced melanoma include imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. In these studies, selected patients with KIT-mutated melanoma were shown to be responsive to therapy with KIT inhibition, especially patients with L576P and K642E mutations. This has led to the incorporation of KIT-targeted therapy in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for systemic therapy for metastatic or unresectable melanoma.

This review aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding the clinical management of ACC.Surgery remains the cornerstone for localized ACC management. In more advanced cases, debulking surgery when feasible can help with hormonal control and may allow the initiation of systemic therapy. Over the last few years, our understanding of ACC molecular pathogenesis has expanded with no significant change in treatment options. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the gold standard in metastatic ACC despite suboptimal efficacy.  kinase inhibitor use did not result in meaningful benefit in ACC patients. Multiple clinical trials are currently exploring the role of  in ACC. Despite the remarkable improvement in our understanding of the molecular signature and pathways in ACC, this knowledge did not yield a major breakthrough in management of advanced ACC.

ROR-1 is involved in many key processes in cancer including proliferation, survival and metastasis. Hence, ROR-1 is an attractive and promising therapeutic target. There are many therapeutic approaches that target ROR-1 and these include specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), modified T cells (CART cell), miRNAs and  kinase inhibitors (TKI). Areas covered: This review examines ROR-1 structure and function, immunotherapeutic strategies including specific chimeric antigen receptor (CARs) T cells and miRNAs and other targeted approaches such as the use of  kinase inhibitors. Expert opinion: Chimeric antibodies, CARs T cells, bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs), miRNAs and TKIs are used to target the ROR-1 marker on cancer cell lines. By selecting the most favorable therapeutic approaches regarding ROR-1 in vivo, anti-ROR-1 antibodies or CAR T cells can be also used for diagnosis of ROR-1 cancer cells in new technologies such as biosensors.

The molecular biology underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) development and progression has been a key milestone in the management of this type of tumor. The discovery of Von Hippel Lindau () gene alterations that arouse in 50% of ccRCC patients, leads the identification of an intracellular accumulation of HIF and, consequently an increase of VEGFR expression. This change in cell biology represents a new paradigm in the treatment of metastatic renal cancer by targeting angiogenesis. Currently, there are multiple therapeutic drugs available for advanced disease, including therapies against VEGFR with successful results in patients´ survival. Other  kinases' pathways, including PDGFR, Axl or MET have emerged as key signaling pathways involved in RCC biology. Indeed, promising new drugs targeting those  kinases have exhibited outstanding efficacy. In this review we aim to present an overview of the central role of these  kinases' activities in relevant biological processes for kidney cancer and their usefulness in RCC targeted therapy development. In the  era, angiogenesis is still an "old guy" that the medical community is trying to fight using "new bullets".</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444334>Single-cell profiling guided combinatorial  for fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Acquired resistance to targeted cancer therapy is a significant clinical challenge. In parallel with clinical trials combining CDK4/6 inhibitors to treat HER2+ breast cancer, we sought to prospectively model tumor evolution in response to this regimen in vivo and identify a clinically actionable strategy to combat drug resistance. Despite a promising initial response, acquired resistance emerges rapidly to the combination of anti-HER2/neu antibody and CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Using high-throughput single-cell profiling over the course of treatments, we reveal a distinct immunosuppressive immature myeloid cell (IMC) population to infiltrate the resistant tumors. Guided by single-cell transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that combination of IMC-targeting  kinase inhibitor cabozantinib and immune checkpoint blockade enhances anti-tumor immunity, and overcomes the resistance. Furthermore, sequential combinatorial  enables a sustained control of the fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant tumors.

Achieving a durable cure currently relies on either resection or transplantation, but since most patients will be diagnosed with inoperable disease, there is great interest in achieving more effective systemic therapies. At a molecular level, HCC is heterogeneous, but initial treatment strategies, including the use of multi-targeted  kinase inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors, have been fairly homogenous, depending on general host factors and overall tumor burden rather than specific molecular signatures. Over the past 2 decades, however, there has been significant success in identifying key molecular targets, including driver mutations involving the telomerase reverse transcriptase, p53, and beta-catenin genes, and significant work is now being devoted to translating these discoveries into the development of robust and well-tolerated targeted therapies. Furthermore, multi-modal therapies have also begun to emerge, harnessing possible synergism amongst a variety of different treatment classes.

We recently observed that high-dose (final concentration in vivo: ~10 µM) crizotinib can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells lacking ALK/ROS1 activation through off-target effects that require the inhibition of several other  kinases. When combined with cisplatin (which alone does not induce ICD), crizotinib sensitizes NSCLC models to subsequent  with PD-1 blockade, allowing to cure more than 90% of established orthotopic cancers. Of note, simultaneous treatment of mice with cisplatin, crizotinib and PD-1 blocking antibodies causes acute hepatotoxicity that can be avoided by a sequential regimen involving initial treatment with cisplatin plus crizotinib, followed by PD-1 blockade one week later. It will be important to translate these results obtained in mice into a clinical trial in NSCLC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340094>Erdafitinib in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Alterations in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor () are common in urothelial carcinoma and may be associated with lower sensitivity to immune interventions. Erdafitinib, a  kinase inhibitor of FGFR1-4, has shown antitumor activity in preclinical models and in a phase 1 study involving patients with  alterations.In this open-label, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients who had locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with prespecified  alterations. All the patients had a history of disease progression during or after at least one course of chemotherapy or within 12 months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior  was allowed. We initially randomly assigned the patients to receive erdafitinib in either an intermittent or a continuous regimen in the dose-selection phase of the study. On the basis of an interim analysis, the starting dose was set at 8 mg per day in a continuous regimen (selected-regimen group), with provision for a pharmacodynamically guided dose escalation to 9 mg. The primary end point was the objective response rate. Key secondary end points included progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival.A total of 99 patients in the selected-regimen group received a median of five cycles of erdafitinib. Of these patients, 43% had received at least two previous courses of treatment, 79% had visceral metastases, and 53% had a creatinine clearance of less than 60 ml per minute. The rate of confirmed response to erdafitinib therapy was 40% (3% with a complete response and 37% with a partial response). Among the 22 patients who had undergone previous , the confirmed response rate was 59%. The median duration of progression-free survival was 5.5 months, and the median duration of overall survival was 13.8 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher, which were managed mainly by dose adjustments, were reported in 46% of the patients; 13% of the patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. There were no treatment-related deaths.The use of erdafitinib was associated with an objective tumor response in 40% of previously treated patients who had locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with  alterations.

Limited data exist on responses and survival on second-line (2L) vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor  kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI) therapy after 1L ICI therapy.This is a retrospective study of mccRCC patients treated with 2L VEGFR-TKI after progressive disease (PD) with 1L ICI. Patients were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between December 2015 and February 2018. Objective response was assessed by blinded radiologists' review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours v1.1. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier method were used.Seventy patients were included in the analysis. Median age at mccRCC diagnosis was 59 years; 8 patients (11%) had international metastatic database consortium favourable-risk disease, 48 (69%) had intermediate-risk disease and 14 (20%) had poor-risk disease.

Its allosteric inhibitor SHP099 is known to inhibit cancer cell growth both  and . However, whether SHP099-mediated SHP2 inhibition retards tumor growth  anti-tumor immunity remains elusive. To address this, a CT-26 colon cancer xenograft model was established in mice since this cell line is insensitive to SHP099. Consequently, SHP099 minimally affected CT-26 tumor growth in immuno-deficient nude mice, but significantly decreased the tumor burden in CT-26 tumor-bearing mice with intact immune system. SHP099 augmented anti-tumor immunity, as shown by the elevated proportion of CD8IFN-  T cells and the upregulation of cytotoxic T-cell related genes including , which decreased the tumor load. In addition, tumor growth in mice with SHP2-deficient T-cells was markedly slowed down because of enhanced anti-tumor responses. Finally, the combination of SHP099 and anti-PD-1 antibody showed a higher therapeutic efficacy than either monotherapy in controlling tumor growth in two colon cancer xenograft models, indicating that these agents complement each other.

However, there is no definitive conclusion about how the inhibition of PTPN3 in lymphocytes affects immune functions in human lymphocytes. In the present study, we showed that PTPN3 inhibition significantly contributes to the enhanced activation of activated human lymphocytes. The PTPN3 expression of lymphocytes was significantly increased through the activation process using IL-2 and anti-CD3 mAb. Interestingly, inhibiting the PTPN3 expression in activated lymphocytes significantly augmented the proliferation, migration, and cytotoxicity through the phosphorylation of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), lymphocyte-specific protein  kinase (LCK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Lymphocyte activation by PTPN3 inhibition was observed only in activated CD3 T cells and not in NK cells or resting T cells. In therapy experiments using autologous tumors and lymphocytes, PTPN3 inhibition significantly augmented the number of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes and the cytotoxicity of activated lymphocytes. Our results strongly imply that PTPN3 acts as an immune checkpoint in activated lymphocytes and that PTPN3 inhibitor may be a new non-antibody-type immune checkpoint inhibitor for cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719215>Immune checkpoint inhibitors in EGFR-mutation positive TKI-treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer network meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation benefit from a first line of treatment with  kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

A network meta-analysis was performed and 4 randomized trials comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors versus chemotherapy were identified. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was carried out to compare three checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) versus chemotherapy (docetaxel), evaluating their Hazard Ratio (HR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for Overall Survival (OS). Results suggest that patients with NSCLC and EGFR mutation, previously treated with TKIs, show better OS when treated with docetaxel in comparison to checkpoint inhibitors treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258426>Limitations to the Therapeutic Potential of  Kinase Inhibitors and Alternative Therapies for Kidney Cancer.</a></h1><p> Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are the most common primary renal tumor. RCCs have a high rate of metastasis and have the highest mortality rate of all genitourinary cancers. They are often diagnosed late when metastases have developed, and these metastases are difficult to treat successfully. Since 2006, the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic RCC has been multitargeted  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. RCCs are highly vascularized tumors, and their angiogenesis is controlled by  kinases that play a vital role in growth factor signaling to stimulate this process. TKI therapy was introduced for direct targeting of angiogenesis in RCC. TKIs have been moderately successful in the treatment of metastatic RCC and initially increased cancer-specific survival times. However, RCC rapidly becomes resistant to TKIs, and no current drug has produced a cure for advanced RCC.  We provide an overview of RCC, explain some reasons for therapy resistance in RCC, and describe some therapies that may overcome resistance to TKIs. The key pathways that determine therapy resistance are illustrated.  Factors involved in the development and progression of RCC include genetic mutations, activation of hypoxia-inducible factor and related proteins, cellular metabolism, the tumor microenvironment, and growth factors and their receptors. Resistance to the therapeutic potential of TKIs can be acquired or intrinsic. Alternative therapies include other small molecule drugs and  based on immune checkpoint blockade.  The treatment of RCC is undergoing a paradigm shift from sole use of small molecule antiangiogenesis TKIs as first-line therapy to include newly approved agents for second-line and third-line therapy that now involve the mTOR pathway and immune checkpoint blockade drugs for patients with advanced RCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380271>Targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Oesophagogastric Cancer: A Review of Progress to Date and  Combination Strategies.</a></h1><p>In 2014, the survival benefits seen in REGARD and RAINBOW studies led the way for the regulatory approval of ramucirumab in the second line setting in oesophagogastric (OG) cancer.

We aimed to generate better risk model based on the sub-classification of IG.We analyzed records of 213 consecutive patients receiving molecular targeted therapy. Age, gender, histology, type of initial molecular targeted therapy, serum laboratory data, previous nephrectomy and , and metastatic sites were used for IG sub-stratification. Modified and original models were compared using a concordance correlation coefficient analysis.Median follow-up was 17.8 months. Serum albumin, serum C-reactive protein, and bone metastases were independent predictors of overall survival (OS) in IG. IG was sub-classified into low-, middle-, and high-risk IG according to the number of predictors. The following modified model was developed: modified FG (FG & low-risk IG), modified IG (middle-risk IG), and modified PG (PG & high-risk IG). Concordance indices for original and modified models were 0.68 and 0.73, respectively (P < 0.001). OS was significantly longer in modified PG treated with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors as second-line therapy than with  kinase inhibitors, whereas this was not observed in the original model.We successfully developed modified IMDC model using a two-step process: the original IMDC plus an IG sub-stratification, and demonstrated that it predicts outcomes more accurately than original model.© The Author(s) 2019.

The emergence of resistance to the EGFR  kinase inhibitors led to the unveiling of multiple resistance mechanisms that are now recognized to be frequent mechanisms across multiple tumor types. Coevolution of technological advancements in testing methods available to clinical laboratories now has identified a growing number of molecularly defined subsets of NSCLC that have new therapeutic implications. In addition, identifying patients eligible for  is another goal for precision oncology. Recently, studies suggest that TMB may be a promising biomarker for selecting patients with NSCLC for .

However, the molecular mechanism for macrophage endocytosis remains elusive. Here we report that LAPF (lysosome-associated and apoptosis-inducing protein containing PH and FYVE domains) is required for caveolae-mediated endocytosis.  deficient macrophages have impaired capacity to endocytose and eliminate bacteria. Macrophage-specific -deficient mice are more susceptible to  () infection with higher bacterial loads. Moreover,  deficiency impairs TLR4 endocytosis, resulting in attenuated production of TLR-triggered proinflammatory cytokines. LAPF is localized to early endosomes and interacts with caveolin-1. Phosphorylation of LAPF by the  kinase Src is required for LAPF-Src-Caveolin complex formation and endocytosis and elimination of bacteria. Collectively, our work demonstrates that LAPF is critical for endocytosis of bacteria and induction of inflammatory responses, suggesting that LAPF and Src could be potential targets for the control of infectious diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396957>Oxidative phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.</a></h1><p>In contrast to prior belief, cancer cells require oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to strive, and exacerbated OXPHOS dependency frequently characterizes cancer stem cells, as well as primary or acquired resistance against chemotherapy or  kinase inhibitors. A growing arsenal of therapeutic agents is being designed to suppress the transfer of mitochondria from stromal to malignant cells, to interfere with mitochondrial biogenesis, to directly inhibit respiratory chain complexes, or to disrupt mitochondrial function in other ways. For the experimental treatment of cancers, OXPHOS inhibitors can be advantageously combined with  kinase inhibitors, as well as with other strategies to inhibit glycolysis, thereby causing a lethal energy crisis. Unfortunately, most of the preclinical data arguing in favor of OXPHOS inhibition have been obtained in xenograft models, in which human cancer cells are implanted in immunodeficient mice. Future studies on OXPHOS inhibitors should elaborate optimal treatment schedules and combination regimens that stimulate-or at least are compatible with-anticancer immune responses for long-term tumor control.© 2019 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851071>Reduced lung cancer burden by selective immunomodulators elicits improvements in muscle proteolysis and strength in cachectic mice.</a></h1><p>Identification of to what extent tumor burden influences muscle mass independently of specific treatments for cancer-cachexia remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that reduced tumor burden by selective treatment of tumor with immunomodulators may exert beneficial effects on muscle wasting and function in mice. Body and muscle weight, grip strength, physical activity, muscle morphometry, apoptotic nuclei, troponin-I systemic levels, interleukin-6, proteolytic markers, and  release, and apoptosis markers were determined in diaphragm and gastrocnemius muscles of lung cancer (LP07 adenocarcinoma cells) mice (BALB/c) treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), against immune check-points and pathways (CD-137, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programed cell death-1, and CD-19; N = 10/group). Nontreated lung cancer cachectic mice were the controls. T and B cell numbers and macrophages were counted in tumors of both mouse groups. Compared to nontreated cachectic mice, in the mAbs-treated animals, T cells increased, no differences in B cells or macrophages, the variables final body weight, body weight and grip strength gains significantly improved. In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of mAbs-treated cachectic mice, number of apoptotic nuclei,  release, proteolysis, and apoptosis markers significantly decreased compared to nontreated cachectic mice. Systemic levels of troponin-I significantly decreased in treated cachectic mice compared to nontreated animals. We conclude that reduced tumor burden as a result of selective treatment of the lung cancer cells with immunomodulators elicits per se beneficial effects on muscle mass loss through attenuation of several biological mechanisms that lead to increased protein breakdown and apoptosis, which translated into significant improvements in limb muscle strength but not in physical activity parameters.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024634>Second-line treatment options in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>For many years, sorafenib has been the only approved systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For over a decade, randomized controlled trials exploring the efficacy of new drugs both in first- and second-line treatment have failed to prove any survival benefit. However, in the past few years, several advances have been made especially in pretreated patients; phase III trials of regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab in patients with elevated α-fetoprotein have demonstrated efficacy in patients progressing after or intolerant to sorafenib. In addition, early phase I and II trials have shown promising results of  alone or in combination with -kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies in the same setting of patients.

Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated survival benefits of alternative treatments to docetaxel. However, information is lacking on which patients benefit the most and what drug or regimen is optimal. We report a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of second-line treatments in all subgroup combinations determined by histology, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Biosciences Information Service (using the Dialog Platform), Cochrane Library, and abstracts from scientific meetings were searched for RCTs published up to September 2015. Key outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Bayesian hierarchical exchangeable NMAs were conducted to calculate mean survival times and relative differences for eight subgroups, using docetaxel as the reference comparator. For OS, the NMA was based on hazard ratios applied to a first-order fractional polynomial model fitted to the reference treatment. For PFS, a second-order fractional polynomial model was fitted to reconstructed patient-level data for the entire network of evidence.The search identified 30 studies containing 17 different treatment regimens. Docetaxel plus ramucirumab was associated with a significant improvement in OS and PFS, relative to docetaxel, regardless of patient type. Docetaxel plus nintedanib showed similar efficacy to docetaxel plus ramucirumab in the nonsquamous populations. EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib showed superior levels of efficacy in EGFR mutation-positive populations and the one PD-1  (nivolumab) studied showed superior efficacy in the populations exhibiting high PD-L1 expression.In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, we performed a mixed-treatment analysis to synthesize evidence of the efficacy of each treatment. Benefits are optimized by targeting specific treatments to individual patients guided by histology, PD-L1 expression, and EGFR mutation status.This review is registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42014013780 available at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131167>Sequential Treatment Based on Sunitinib and Sorafenib in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcome of alternative sequences of sunitinib followed by sorafenib versus sorafenib followed by sunitinib therapies in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).This single-center study analyzed patients with mRCC on systemic therapy between January 2005 and August 2011. Patients were treated with the recommended first-line therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, or ) until progression or intolerable toxicity and afterward switched to another guideline-recommended systemic therapy. Only patients starting first-line therapy on either sorafenib or sunitinib and switching to the other of these drugs were included in this analysis.Out of 266 patients (females: 85, males: 181) with a median age of 57.1 years (30 - 76 years), 57 patients with a sequence of sunitinib and sorafenib were identified. First-line sorafenib therapy was followed by sunitinib (So-Su) in 32 patients; sunitinib was followed by sorafenib (Su-So) in 25 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with first-line sorafenib was 11.6 months and was 8.7 months for sunitinib. Overall survival (OS) rates for Su-So was 118.8 months and 83.3 months with So-Su (p = 0.82). No new safety signals were detected.None of the therapeutic first-line approaches was superior to the other. Sequencing  kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy seems to be effective in mRCC and superior to single-line therapy.

This study aimed to assess general trends in the use of various types of HSCTs performed between 2001 and 2015 in Europe, based on data reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. We also evaluated HSCT rates with respect to ALL incidence in selected countries. Altogether, 15,346 first allogeneic (n = 13,460) or autologous (n = 1886) HSCTs were performed in the study period. Comparing 2013-2015 and 2001-2003, the number of allogeneic HSCTs performed in first complete remission increased by 136%, most prominently for transplantations from unrelated (272%) and mismatched related donors (339%). The number of HSCTs from matched sibling donors increased by 42%, while the total number of autologous HSCTs decreased by 70%. Increased use of allogeneic HSCT was stronger for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive (166%) than for Ph-negative ALL (38%) and for patients aged > 55 years (599%) than for younger adults (59%). The proportion of allogeneic HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) increased from 6 to 27%. The age-standardized rates of allogeneic HSCT per ALL incidence varied strongly among countries. Our analysis showed a continued trend toward increased allogeneic HSCT use for adults with ALL, which may be attributed to increasing availability of unrelated donors, wider use of RIC regimens, and improving efficacy of pretransplant therapy, including  kinase inhibitors for Ph-positive ALL. Allogeneic HSCT remains a major tool in the fight against ALL in adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608727>Prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a systematic review.</a></h1><p>: In recent years, the treatment landscape of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has been improved using immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Nevertheless, the number of patients experiencing clinical benefit from  is still limited, while others obtain more benefit from  kinase inhibitors (TKI). The identification of prognostic and predictive factors would be crucial to better select patients most likely to benefit from  among the other potentially available therapeutic options. : This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge (2010-2019) on molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers, assessed in peripheral blood and/or from tumor tissue, in mRCC patients treated with ICI. : Among all the biomarkers analyzed, PD-L1 expression on tumor tissue is the most studied. It has an unfavorable prognostic role for patients treated with TKI, which seems to be overcome by ICI-based combinations. Nevertheless, no clear predictive role of  efficacy has been observed for PD-L1 in mRCC. Emerging evidence regarding pro-angiogenic or pro-immunogenic genomic and transcriptomic signatures suggests a potential predictive role in patients treated with ICI-based combinations.

Application of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as checkpoint inhibitors is rapidly becoming a promising therapeutic approach in treating tumors, and some of them have successfully been commercialized in the past few years. However, not all patients show complete responses and adverse events have been noted, suggesting a better understanding of PD-1 pathway mediated immunosuppression is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy.

This mutation leads to significantly reduced numbers of circulatory B cells and serum immunoglobulins in patients. Therefore, they exhibit repetitive bacterial infections since infancy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is the primary treatment. HLH is a life-threatening condition with manifestations of non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, lipid disorder, and multiple organ failure. It is caused by the immune dysregulation between cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and histiocytes. The treatment is based on HLH-2004 protocol including , chemotherapy, supportive therapy, and stem cell transplantation. However, as we know more about the classification and pathophysiology of HLH, the treatment is modified. T-cell-directed  is effective in patients with primary HLH, and strong immunosuppression is contraindicated in patients with severe ongoing infections or some primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Here, we report the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with ecthyma gangrenosum and several episodes of pyogenic infections during childhood. At the age of 5 years, he exhibited cyclic HLH every 2-3 months. The remission of HLH episodes finally achieved after he received monthly Ig replacement therapy (400 mg/kg) at the 4th HLH. However, transient elevation of IgM was incidentally discovered after 6 cycles of monthly Ig replacement therapy. IgM-secreting multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and lymphoma were excluded. The IgM levels then declined and returned to the normal range within a year. The patient and his parents received whole-genome sequencing analysis. It revealed a novel hemizygous c.1632-1G>A mutation in the  gene and XLA was diagnosed. XLA exhibits a spectrum of clinical and immunological presentations in patients. The identification of the mutation in the  gene contribute to an accurate diagnosis.

However, UR-SCIT is associated with an increased risk of systemic reaction (SR) and typically has been conducted in a hospital admission setting. To overcome disadvantages of UR-SCIT, we evaluated the safety of UR-SCIT conducted in an outpatient clinic in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic rhinitis (AR).UR-SCIT was performed in 538 patients with AD and/or AR sensitized to house dust mite (HDM). A maximum maintenance dose of -adsorbed HDM extract (1 mL of maintenance concentration) was divided into 4 increasing doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL) and administered to the patients by subcutaneous injection at 2-hour intervals for 8 hours in an outpatient clinic. SRs associated with UR-SCIT were classified according to the World Allergy Organization grading system.SR was observed in 12 of 538 patients (2.2%) with AD and/or AR during UR-SCIT. The severity grades of the observed SRs were mild-to-moderate (grade 1 in 7 patients, grade 2 in 4 patients, and grade 3 in 1 patient). The scheduled 4 increasing doses of HDM extract could be administered in 535 of 538 patients (99.4%) except 3 patients who experienced SR before administration of the last scheduled dose. SR was observed within 2 hours in 11 patients after administration of the scheduled doses of HDM extract except one patient who experienced a grade 2 SR at 5.5 hours after administration of the last scheduled dose.UR-SCIT with -adsorbed HDM extract conducted in an outpatient clinic was tolerable in patients with AD and AR.

Subgrouping of myasthenia gravis is dependent on the age of onset, pattern of clinical weakness, autoantibody detected, type of thymic pathology, and response to . Generalized immunosuppressive therapies are effective in all subgroups of myasthenia gravis; however, approximately 15% remain refractory and more effective treatments with improved safety profiles are needed. In recent years, successful utilization of targeted B-cell therapies in this disease has triggered renewed focus in unraveling the underlying immunopathology in attempts to identify newer therapeutic targets. While myasthenia gravis is predominantly B-cell mediated, T cells, T cell-B cell interactions, and B-cell-related factors are increasingly recognized to play key roles in its immunopathology, particularly in autoantibody production, and novel therapies have focused on targeting these specific immune system components. This overview describes the current understanding of myasthenia gravis immunopathology before discussing B-cell-related therapies, their therapeutic targets, and the rationale and evidence for their use. Several prospective studies demonstrated efficacy of rituximab in various myasthenia gravis subtypes, particularly that characterized by antibodies against muscle-specific  kinase. However, a recent randomized control trial in patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies was negative. Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, has recently gained regulatory approval for myasthenia gravis based on a phase III trial that narrowly missed its primary endpoint while achieving robust results in all secondary endpoints. Zilucoplan is a subcutaneously administered terminal complement inhibitor that recently demonstrated significant improvements in functional outcome measures in a phase II trial. Rozanolixizumab, CFZ533, belimumab, and bortezomib are B-cell-related therapies that are in the early stages of evaluation in treating myasthenia gravis. The rarity of myasthenia gravis, heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations, and variability in immunosuppressive regimens are challenges to conducting successful trials. Nonetheless, these are promising times for myasthenia gravis, as renewed research efforts provide novel insights into its immunopathology, allowing for development of targeted therapies with increased efficacy and safety.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431692>T-cell expression of Bruton's  kinase promotes autoreactive T-cell activation and exacerbates aplastic anemia.</a></h1><p>The role of Bruton's  kinase (BTK) in BCR signaling is well defined, and BTK is involved in B-cell development, differentiation, and malignancies. However, the expression of Btk in T cells and its role in T-cell function remain largely unknown. Here, we unexpectedly found high expression and activation of BTK in T cells. Deficiencies in BTK resulted in the impaired activation and proliferation of autoreactive T cells and ameliorated bone marrow failure (BMF) in aplastic anemia. Mechanistically, BTK is activated after TCR engagement and then phosphorylates PLCγ1, thus promoting T-cell activation.

PD-L1 is an important biomarker in the tumor microenvironment that can predict patient response to immunotherapies. Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve a real-time, noninvasive assessment of PD-L1 expression, which can provide critical information for recruiting patients as well as monitoring therapeutic efficacy. We herein studied the EGFR-TKI-induced effects on PD-L1 levels in NSCLC tumor models using immuno-PET imaging with Zr-Df-KN035, an imaging tracer previously established by our group. A549 human NSCLC xenografts were established in BALB/c nude mice and treated with different doses of an EGFR-TKI gefitinib. PET imaging with Zr-Df-KN035 was performed before and after the treatment to evaluate PD-L1 expression, which was further verified by immunohistochemical staining. Our results demonstrate that Zr-Df-KN035 can specifically evaluate PD-L1 levels in NSCLC tumor models. Compared to the untreated control, the high dose of gefitinib inhibited tumor growth and lowered the tumor uptake of Zr-Df-KN035. In comparison, the low dose of gefitinib did not affect tumor growth, although the extensive tumor necrosis also led to the lower uptake of Zr-Df-KN035.

Here we show that covalently conjugating phosphorothioated DNA oligonucleotides to antibodies enabled their efficient cellular internalization. Antibody cell penetration was partially mediated by membrane potential alteration. Moreover, without an antigen to bind, intracellular levels of the modified antibodies underwent cellular clearance, which involved efflux and lysosomal degradation, enabling detection of intended intracellular molecules as tested in fibroblasts, tumor cells, and T cells. This target-dependent cellular retention of modified antibodies extended to in vivo studies. Both local and systemic administrations of low doses of modified antibodies effectively inhibited intracellular targets, such as transcription factors Myc, interferon regulatory factor 4, and -protein kinase SRC, and expression of their downstream genes in tumors, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition.

In this review, we provide a summary of the efficacy and safety data from the landmark trials of single-agent ibrutinib and acalabrutinib that led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of these agents for patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. Toxicities of interest observed with ibrutinib include bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and increased risk for infection. The selectivity of acalabrutinib for BTK is greater than that of ibrutinib, which mitigates the risk for certain off-target toxicities, including atrial fibrillation; however, these toxicities, along with frequent headaches, still occur. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating both alternate BTK inhibitors and BTK inhibitors in combination with chemo- or other targeted agents in an effort to enhance the depth and duration of response. Trials to evaluate the use of these agents in the frontline setting are emerging and are likely to build upon the success of BTK inhibitors in patients with MCL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275935>Modeling the Hematopoietic Landscape.</a></h1><p>Some time ago, we proposed a continuum-like view of the lineages open to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); each HSC self-renews or chooses from the spectrum of all end-cell options and can then "merely" differentiate. Having selected a cell lineage, an individual HSC may still "step sideways" to an alternative, albeit closely related, fate: HSC and their progeny therefore remain versatile. The hematopoietic cytokines erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and ligand for the fms-like  kinase 3 instruct cell lineage. Sub-populations of HSCs express each of the cytokine receptors that are positively auto-regulated upon cytokine binding. Many years ago, Waddington proposed that the epigenetic landscape played an important role in cell lineage choice. This landscape is dynamic and unstable especially regarding DNA methylation patterns across genomic DNA. This may underlie the receptor diversity of HSC and their decision-making.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227054>Radionuclide Therapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.</a></h1><p>The current mainstay of treatment in metastatic prostate cancer is based on hormonal manipulations. Standard androgen deprivation therapy and novel androgen axis drugs are commonly well tolerable and can stabilize metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancers for years. However, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is still challenging to treat. Except taxanes, prostate cancer presents intrinsic resistance against conventional chemotherapies. The typically elderly patient population excludes more aggressive treatment regimens. First clinical trials evaluating  or -kinase-inhibitors against prostate cancer failed. In contrast, prostate cancer can be radiosensitive and external beam radiotherapy is effective in localized prostate cancer, thus providing a good rationale for the use of systemic radiopharmaceuticals in the metastatic setting. Beta-particle emitting "bone-seekers" have a long history and are effective as analgesics but do not improve survival because they are limited by red-marrow dose. Alpha emitting Radium can be used in a dose that prolongs survival but is restricted to bone-confined patients. Currently radiolabeled high-affinity ligands to the prostate-specific membrane antigen are in clinical evaluation. While radioimmunotherapy approaches were limited by the long circulation time and slow tumor-accumulation of antibodies, low molecular weight PSMA-specific ligands offer an approx. ten-fold improved tumor to red-marrow ratio in comparison to the unspecific bone-seekers. Early clinical studies demonstrate that regarding surrogate markers, such as >50% PSA reduction (60%) and radiologic response (80%), PSMA-therapy exceeds the antitumor activity of all approved or other recently tested compounds; for example, PSA-response was only observed in approx. a total of 10% of patients treated with ipilimumab, sunitinib, cabozantinib, or xofigo, respectively and in approx. 30, 40, 50% of patients treated with abiraterone, cabazitaxel, or enzalutamide. Also progression free and overall survivals of these single-arm studies appear promising when compared to historical controls. Consecutively, the first PSMA-RLT recently advanced into phase-3 (Lu-PSMA-617; VISION-trial). Future developments aim to avoid off-target radiation by ligand-optimization and to outperform the antitumor activity of beta-emitter PSMA-RLT by labeling with highly focused, high energy transferring alpha-nuclides; however the latter potentially also increasing the risk of side-effects and additional early phase studies are needed to improve treatment protocols. Academically clinical research is developing prognostic tools to improve treatment benefit by selecting the most appropriate patients in advance.Copyright © 2019.

Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also demonstrated increased levels of Flt3L protein in serum and lung tissue and accumulation of lung DC in explant subpleural lung tissue specimen. Mice lacking Flt3L showed significantly reduced lung DC along with worsened lung fibrosis and reduced lung function relative to wild-type (WT) mice, which could be inhibited by administration of recombinant Flt3L. Moreover, therapeutic Flt3L increased numbers of CD11b DC and improved lung fibrosis in WT mice exposed to AdTGF-β1. In this line, RNA-sequencing analysis of CD11b DC revealed significantly enriched differentially expressed genes within extracellular matrix degrading enzyme and matrix metalloprotease gene clusters. In contrast, the CD103 DC subset did not appear to be involved in pulmonary fibrogenesis.We show that Flt3L protein and numbers of lung DC are upregulated in mice and humans during pulmonary fibrogenesis, and increased mobilisation of lung CD11b DC limits the severity of lung fibrosis in mice. The current study helps to inform the development of DC-based  as a novel intervention against lung fibrosis in humans.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

The tumor microenvironment, largely composed of heterogeneous myeloid cells, creates a physical, metabolic, and immunosuppressive barrier that prevents T cells from infiltrating cancer beds. In this issue of the JCI, Markosyan and colleagues have reported a tumor-intrinsic mechanism that excludes T cells from the vicinity of tumor cells. They showed that a receptor  kinase, ephrin-A receptor 2 (EPHA2), regulates prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) (encodes COX-2) expression in a TGF-β signaling-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of Epha2 or Ptgs2 in preclinical models or pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 elicited the transformation of this immunosuppressive microenvironment into a T cell-permissive milieu. Consequent T cell relocation rendered this immunoresistant malignancy responsive to combinations of checkpoint blockers and CD40 agonists. Because the association between T cell infiltration and the EPHA2/TGF-β/COX-2 axis is supported by independent clinical data, these results provide a rationale for ensuing clinical trials aimed at incorporating pancreatic cancer into the range of -responsive tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189114>Quantitative Interactomics in Primary T Cells Provides a Rationale for Concomitant PD-1 and BTLA Coinhibitor Blockade in Cancer .</a></h1><p>Deciphering how TCR signals are modulated by coinhibitory receptors is of fundamental and clinical interest. Using quantitative interactomics, we define the composition and dynamics of the PD-1 and BTLA coinhibitory signalosomes in primary effector T cells and at the T cell-antigen-presenting cell interface. We also solve the existing controversy regarding the role of the SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein- phosphatases in mediating PD-1 coinhibition. PD-1 predominantly recruits SHP-2, but when absent, it recruits SHP-1 and remains functional. In contrast, BTLA predominantly recruits SHP-1 and to a lesser extent SHP-2. By separately analyzing the PD-1-SHP-1 and PD-1-SHP-2 complexes, we show that both dampen the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways equally. Therefore, our study illustrates how comparison of coinhibitory receptor signaling via quantitative interactomics in primary T cells unveils their extent of redundancy and provides a rationale for designing combinations of blocking antibodies in cancer  on the basis of undisputed modes of action.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Since the FDA approval of the  kinase inhibitor, imatinib, in 2001 for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the number of these inhibitors together with Src  kinase inhibitors (STKIs) has increased notably due to their beneficial effects. Dasatinib, a second-generation STKI inhibitor widely studied, proved high efficiency in CML patients resistant to imatinib. In the last decade STKIs have also been implicated and showed therapeutic potential for the treatment of diverse pathologies other than cancer. In this regard, we review the properties of STKIs, dasatinib in particular, including its immunomodulatory role. Similarly, the potential benefits, adverse effects, and safety concerns of these inhibitors regarding viral infections are considered. Moreover, since life expectancy has increased in the last decades accompanied by age-related morbidity, the reduction of undesirable effects associated to aging has become a powerful therapeutic target. Here, we comment on the ability of STKIs to alleviate age-associated physical dysfunction and their potential impact in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 Rivera-Torres and San José.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366141>Current Position of the Molecular Therapeutic Targets for Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma: A Literature Review.</a></h1><p>Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) shows low sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy and has a poor prognosis, especially in advanced stages.

The authors selected guidelines, publications, and abstracts relevant to the current and emerging role of genomics in genitourinary cancers. The risk of developing genitourinary cancer can be stratified based on genomic data. Prostate cancer has the strongest degree of heritability, with BRCA1/2 and HOXB13 mutations playing a role in familial disease. Genomic data is on the verge of informing treatment decisions across genitourinary cancers. mCRPC has diverse genomic alterations that represent potential therapeutic targets, including alterations in the AR pathway, DNA damage and repair pathways, cell cycle pathways, PI3K pathway, and Wnt signaling. Genomic alterations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma can inform prognosis and mutations in mTOR pathways predict response to mTOR inhibitors. Urothelial carcinoma can be classified into different subtypes based on gene expression profiling, which provides prognostic information and predicts response to chemotherapy and . Specific mutations have been identified that predict response to therapy including ERCC2 mutations and cisplatin, DNA damage and repair mutations and checkpoint inhibitors, and FGFR3 mutations and FGFR  kinase inhibitors such as erdafitinib. CONCLUSION: Genitourinary malignancies have not felt the impact of genomic data as greatly as other cancer types. The majority of benefit lies in identifying patients at high risk of genitourinary cancer. Fortunately, breakthroughs are on the horizon that will result in a greater incorporation of genomic information into treatment decisions for patients with genitourinary cancer.Copyright © 2019 by Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202955> kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced thyroid disorders.</a></h1><p>Recently,  kinase inhibitors (TKI) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) have emerged as new classes of anticancer therapies. Although generally considered less toxic than cytotoxic chemotherapy, these new drugs can cause significant unanticipated side effects including thyroid dysfunction. This review provides a literature assessment of thyroid dysfunctions induced by TKI and ICPIs. We intend to define for these two classes the frequency of thyroid involvement, the potential mechanisms that result in this toxicity, the clinical-biological impact and the therapeutic management. Detection of thyroid dysfunction requires monitoring of TSH, in combination with free T4 if needed and, depending on the clinical impact and the kinetics of biological abnormalities, starting symptomatic treatment of hyperthyroidism and/or correcting hypothyroidism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Additional strategies are necessary to improve these agents' efficacy.Patients with stable disease for at least 4 months on TKI or checkpoint inhibitors were included. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered to an organ with comparable lesions, where one lesion was in the treatment target and the other one was intentionally left untreated (control lesion). Response in both lesions was scored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1 criteria 2 months after completion of SBRT. The primary endpoint was the rate of SBRT adverse events, and the secondary endpoints included the rate of reduction in target lesion size.17 patients were enrolled (14 men and 3 women, median age: 54.5 years old). SBRT was delivered to the lungs (n=5), bones (n=4), lymph nodes (n=4), liver (n=1), primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1) and locally recurrent RCC (n=2). The equivalent dose in 2 Gy with an alpha to beta ratio of 2.6 was 114 Gy. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the cumulative rate of SBRT-related toxicity (grade 1) was 12% (n=2), consisting of oesophagitis and skin erythema. No grade 2 or higher toxicity was detected. Radiographic response in the target lesion was seen in 13 patients (76%), with complete response in 5 (29%) patients and partial response in 8 (47%), including abscopal effect in 1 patient. Control lesions remained stable in 16 patients. The difference between response in the target and control lesions as judged by the mean sizes of these lesions before and at 2 months after SBRT was statistically significant (p<0.01).

Targeted therapy approaches are promising treatments for lung cancer. However, despite the development of targeted therapies using  kinase inhibitors (TKI) as well as monoclonal antibodies, the five-year relative survival rate for lung cancer patients is still only 18%, and patients inevitably become resistant to therapy. Mutations in Kirsten ras sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the two most common genetic events in lung adenocarcinoma; they account for 25% and 20% of cases, respectively. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor  kinase, and ALK rearrangements are responsible for 3-7% of NSCLC, predominantly of the adenocarcinoma subtype, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner with KRAS and EGFR mutations. Among drug-resistant NSCLC patients, nearly half exhibit the T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR.

BI1361849 (CV9202) is an active cancer immunotherapeutic comprising protamine-formulated, sequence-optimized mRNA encoding six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated antigens (NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C1, MAGE-C2, survivin, 5T4, and MUC-1), intended to induce targeted immune responses.We describe a phase Ib clinical trial evaluating treatment with BI1361849 combined with local radiation in 26 stage IV NSCLC patients with partial response (PR)/stable disease (SD) after standard first-line therapy. Patients were stratified into three strata (1: non-squamous NSCLC, no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, PR/SD after ≥4 cycles of platinum- and pemetrexed-based treatment [n = 16]; 2: squamous NSCLC, PR/SD after ≥4 cycles of platinum-based and non-platinum compound treatment [n = 8]; 3: non-squamous NSCLC, EGFR mutation, PR/SD after ≥3 and ≤ 6 months EGFR- kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment [n = 2]). Patients received intradermal BI1361849, local radiation (4 × 5 Gy), then BI1361849 until disease progression. Strata 1 and 3 also had maintenance pemetrexed or continued EGFR-TKI therapy, respectively. The primary endpoint was evaluation of safety; secondary objectives included assessment of clinical efficacy (every 6 weeks during treatment) and of immune response (on Days 1 [baseline], 19 and 61).Study treatment was well tolerated; injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms were the most common BI1361849-related adverse events. Three patients had grade 3 BI1361849-related adverse events (fatigue, pyrexia); there was one grade 3 radiation-related event (dysphagia). In comparison to baseline, immunomonitoring revealed increased BI1361849 antigen-specific immune responses in the majority of patients (84%), whereby antigen-specific antibody levels were increased in 80% and functional T cells in 40% of patients, and involvement of multiple antigen specificities was evident in 52% of patients. One patient had a partial response in combination with pemetrexed maintenance, and 46.2% achieved stable disease as best overall response.

The advent of targeted therapies for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (mRCC) has underscored the need to subtype tumors according to tumor-immune expression profiles that may more reliably predict treatment outcomes. Over the past 2 decades, several vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and  kinase inhibitors have been the mainstay for first- and second-line treatment of mRCC. Very recently,  checkpoint inhibitors have significantly changed the treatment landscape for patients with mRCC, particularly for first-line treatment of intermediate to poor risk mRCC patients. Now, combination  as well as combinations of  with targeted agents can significantly alter disease outcomes. The field of immuno-oncology for mRCC has unveiled a deeper understanding of the immunoreactivity inherent to these tumors, and as a result combination therapy is evolving as a first-line modality. This review provides a timeline of advances and controversies in first-line treatment of mRCC, describes recent advances in understanding the immunoreactivity of these tumors, and addresses the future of combination anti-VEGF and immunotherapeutic platforms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Outcomes from different therapies may vary within each risk group. These survival algorithms have been applied to assess outcomes in patients receiving T-cell checkpoint inhibitory  and  kinase inhibitor therapy, but have not been applied extensively to patients receiving high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) .Survival of 810 mRCC patients treated from 2006 to 2017 with high dose IL-2 (aldesleukin) and enrolled in the PROCLAIM registry data base was assessed utilizing the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk criteria. Median follow-up is 23.4 months (mo.) (range 0.2-124 mo.). Subgroup evaluations were performed by separating patients by prior or no prior therapy, IL-2 alone, or therapy subsequent to IL-2. Some patients were in two groups. We will focus on the 356 patients who received IL-2 alone, and evaluate outcome by risk factor categories.Among the 810 patients, 721 were treatment-naïve (89%) and 59% were intermediate risk. Overall, of the 249 patients with favorable risk, the median overall survival (OS) is 63.3 mo. and the 2-year OS is 77.6%. Of 480 patients with intermediate risk, median OS is 42.4 mo., 2-year OS 68.2%, and of 81 patients with poor risk, median OS 14 mo., 2-year OS 40.4%. Among those who received IL-2 alone (356 patients), median OS is 64.5, 57.6, and 14 months for favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories respectively. Two year survival among those treated only with HD IL-2 is 73.4, 63.7 and 39.8%, for favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories respectively.Among mRCC patients treated with HD IL-2, all risk groups have median and 2-year survival consistent with recent reports of checkpoint or targeted therapies for mRCC. Favorable and intermediate risk (by IMDC) patients treated with HD IL-2 have longer OS compared with poor risk patients, with most durable OS observed in favorable risk patients.

Until the last decade, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was less than 5%. Improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of new biomarker-targeted therapies and led to improvements in overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic disease.Systemic therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is selected according to the presence of specific biomarkers. Therefore, all patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer should undergo molecular testing for relevant mutations and expression of the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). Molecular alterations that predict response to treatment (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF V600E mutations) are present in approximately 30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Targeted therapy for these alterations improves progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. For example, somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene are present in approximately 20% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib improve progression-free survival in patients with susceptible EGFR mutations. In patients with overexpression of ALK protein, the response rate was significantly better with crizotinib (a  kinase inhibitor) than with the combination of pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-based chemotherapy) (74% vs 45%, respectively; P < .001) and progression-free survival (median, 10.9 months vs 7.0 months; P < .001). Subsequent generations of  kinase inhibitors have improved these agents. For patients without biomarkers indicating susceptibility to specific targeted treatments, immune checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimens either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are superior vs chemotherapy alone. These advances in biomarker-directed therapy have led to improvements in overall survival. For example, the 5-year overall survival rate currently exceeds 25% among patients whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of ≥50%) and 40% among patients with ALK-positive tumors.Improved understanding of the biology and molecular subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer have led to more biomarker-directed therapies for patients with metastatic disease.

The discovery of novel tumor associated antigens to improve efficacy and minimize the toxicities of  is therefore warranted. eceptor  Kinase-like rphan eceptor-1 and 2 (ROR1 and ROR2) have been found to be expressed in several malignancies with limited expression in healthy tissues.  Given their role in tumor migration and proliferation and the fact that they were originally cloned from a NBL cell line, we hypothesized that ROR1 and ROR2 could serve as potential targets for anti-ROR1 and anti-ROR2 based immunotherapies in NBL.  We characterized the mRNA and protein expression of ROR1 and ROR2 in NBL cell lines and tissue microarrays of patient samples. To explore the potential of ROR1 targeting, we performed  cytotoxicity assays against NBL using NK92 cells as effector cells.  Both ROR1 and ROR2 are expressed across all stages of NBL. In patients with non-MYC amplified tumors, expression of ROR1/ROR2 correlated with survival and prognosis.

ROR1 and ROR2 could serve as novel targets for  in NBL.

The first therapies to affect the course of RCC were cytokines (interferon alfa-2B and interleukin-2). Subsequently, drugs that inhibit HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling demonstrated overall survival advantages ( kinase inhibitors and mTor inhibitors).In the last 3 years, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care treatments in the first and second lines for RCC. Emerging data show that combinations of ICI, HIF signaling inhibitors, and cytokines are potentially powerful regimens. How to combine and sequence these types of therapies and how to integrate new approaches into the management of RCC are now the key questions for the field. Treatment of RCC is likely to change dramatically in the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415244>ROR1-CAR T cells are effective against lung and breast cancer in advanced microphysiologic 3D tumor models.</a></h1><p>Solid tumors impose immunologic and physical barriers to the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy that are not reflected in conventional preclinical testing against singularized tumor cells in 2-dimensional culture. Here, we established microphysiologic three-dimensional (3D) lung and breast cancer models that resemble architectural and phenotypical features of primary tumors and evaluated the antitumor function of receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 1-specific (ROR1-specific) CAR T cells. 3D tumors were established from A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) and MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer) cell lines on a biological scaffold with intact basement membrane (BM) under static and dynamic culture conditions, which resulted in progressively increasing cell mass and invasive growth phenotype (dynamic > static; MDA-MB-231 > A549). Treatment with ROR1-CAR T cells conferred potent antitumor effects. In dynamic culture, CAR T cells actively entered arterial medium flow and adhered to and infiltrated the tumor mass. ROR1-CAR T cells penetrated deep into tumor tissue and eliminated multiple layers of tumor cells located above and below the BM. The microphysiologic 3D tumor models developed in this study are standardized, scalable test systems that can be used either in conjunction with or in lieu of animal testing to interrogate the antitumor function of CAR T cells and to obtain proof of concept for their safety and efficacy before clinical application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290997>Immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The position of  as a pillar of systemic cancer treatment has been firmly established over the past decade. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a welcome option for patients with different malignancies. This is in part because they offer the possibility of durable benefit, even for patients who have failed other treatment modalities. The recent demonstration that  is effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a milestone in the history of this recalcitrant disease. The treatment of HCC has been a challenge, and for many years was limited to the  kinase inhibitor sorafenib and to several novel  kinase inhibitors that have shown efficacy and have been approved. The current role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of HCC, and how this role is likely to evolve in the years ahead, are key. Other than efforts evaluating single checkpoint inhibitors, potential combination strategies, including combinations with existing local and systemic approaches, including novel therapies are evolving. This is understandably of special interest considering the potential unique immune system of the liver, which may impact the use of  in patients with HCC going forward, and how can it be enhanced further.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063864>Impact of Patient Characteristics, Prior Therapy, and Sample Type on Tumor Cell Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 Expression in Patients with Advanced NSCLC Screened for the ATLANTIC Study.</a></h1><p>We evaluated the impact of patient characteristics, sample types, and prior non- treatment on tumor cell (TC) programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression using samples from patients with advanced NSCLC.Patients (N = 1590) screened for the ATLANTIC study submitted a recently acquired (≤3 months) or archival (>3 months to >3 years old) tumor sample for PD-L1 assessment using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay with a cutoff of ≥25% of TCs expressing PD-L1 (TC ≥25%). Samples were acquired either before or after the two or more treatment regimens required for study entry and sample age varied among patients. A subset of patients (n = 123) provided both recent and archival samples.A total of 517 of 1590 (32.5%) patients had TC greater than or equal to 25%: prevalence was greater in smokers versus nonsmokers (p = 0.0005) and those with EGFR- versus EGFR+ tumors (p = 0.0002); these effects were independent. Prevalence of TC greater than or equal to 25% was increased in recent metastatic versus primary (p = 0.005) and recent versus archival (p = 0.039) samples. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but not  kinase inhibition, before sampling was associated with significantly increased PD-L1 prevalence. PD-L1 status (TC ≥25% cutoff) remained unchanged in 74.0% of patients with recent and archival samples; where PD-L1 status changed, it was more likely to increase than decrease over time or with intervening treatment.Several factors potentially impact PD-L1 TC greater than or equal to 25% prevalence in advanced NSCLC; however, no characteristic can be considered a surrogate for PD-L1 expression. Fresh biopsy may provide more accurate assessment of current tumoral PD-L1 expression where a low/negative result is seen in an archival sample, especially if the patient has received intervening therapy.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Current treatment is associated with significant toxicities and includes chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and few targeted treatments. Targeted treatments, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agent, cetuximab, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, show improved toxicity profiles and modestly improved survival in select patients. An urgent need remains to identify novel targeted treatments for single-agent or combined therapy use.Multitargeted kinase inhibitors are small molecule inhibitors with limited toxicity. This review will focus on early-stage investigations of multitargeted  kinase inhibitors (m-TKIs) (those that target at least two  kinases) for HNSCC. Preclinical and early trials investigating m-TKIs for various disease settings of HNSCC will be evaluated for efficacy, identification of significant biomarkers and potential for combination therapy.Few single agent m-TKIs have demonstrated efficacy in unselected HNSCC populations. The most promising clinical results have been obtained when m-TKIs are tested in combination with other therapies, including , or in mutation-defined subgroups of patients.

Adaptive and innate immune cells are present in the tumor microenvironment, indicating GIST as inflamed tumors. In addition, murine models suggested a potential interaction between immune components and imatinib. In this retrospective study, the GIST immunological profile was investigated through  analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC), exploring the basis for  approaches. Gene expression profiles (GEP) from 31 KIT/PDGFRA-mutant GIST were analyzed to evaluate the tumor microenvironment and  predictive signatures such as the expanded IFN-γ-induced immune signature (EIIS) and the T-cell-inflamed signature (TIS). GEP and IHC supported the presence of immune infiltrate in GIST, with dominance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and M2 macrophages showing a remarkable similarity with melanoma microenvironment. The EIIS genes were expressed in most of GIST samples and positively correlated with PD-L1 abundance ( < .0001). Co-expression was also found between PD-L1 and CD8A ( < .0001) or CD8B ( = .0003). Moreover, the median TIS score for GIST was between the 65th and 70th percentile of the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, in the same range of tumors responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus database GIST samples pre- and post-treatment confirmed that imatinib downregulates PD-L1 and IRF1 expression through the inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA, thus contributing to counteract the suppressed adaptive immune response against GIST. The presence of a rich immune infiltrate in GIST along with the presence of TIS and EIIS suggests that GIST may benefit from  along with  kinase inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30842091>Cancer  with T Cells Carrying Bispecific Receptors That Mimic Antibodies.</a></h1><p>Tumors are inherently heterogeneous in antigen expression, and escape from immune surveillance due to antigen loss remains one of the limitations of targeted . Despite the clinical use of adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected T cells in lymphoblastic leukemia, treatment failure due to epitope loss occurs. Targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) may thus improve the outcome of CAR-T cell therapies. CARs developed to simultaneously target multiple targets are limited by the large size of each single-chain variable fragment and compromised protein folding when several single chains are linearly assembled. Here, we describe single-domain antibody mimics that function within CAR parameters but form a very compact structure. We show that antibody mimics targeting EGFR and HER2 of the ErbB receptor  kinase family can be assembled into receptor molecules, which we call antibody mimic receptors (amR).

Glycoprotein (GP)VI and C-type lectin-like receptor (CLEC)-2 signal through a (hem)-immunoreceptor -based activation motif, which induces platelet activation. GPVI and CLEC-2 support vascular integrity during inflammation in the skin through regulation of leukocyte migration and function, and by sealing sites of vascular damage. In this study, we investigated the role of impaired vascular integrity due to GPVI and/or CLEC-2 deficiency in wound repair using a full-thickness excisional skin wound model in mice. Transgenic mice deficient in both GPVI and CLEC-2 exhibited accelerated skin wound healing, despite a marked impairment in vascular integrity. The local and temporal bleeding in the skin led to greater plasma protein entry, including fibrinogen and clotting factors, was associated with increased fibrin generation, reduction in wound neutrophils and M1 macrophages, decreased level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and enhanced angiogenesis at day 3 after injury. Accelerated wound healing was not due to developmental defects in CLEC-2 and GPVI double-deficient mice as similar results were observed in GPVI-deficient mice treated with a podoplanin-blocking antibody. The rate of wound healing was not altered in mice deficient in either GPVI or CLEC-2. Our results show that, contrary to defects in coagulation, bleeding following a loss of vascular integrity caused by platelet CLEC-2 and GPVI deficiency facilitates wound repair by increasing fibrin(ogen) deposition, reducing inflammation, and promoting angiogenesis.Copyright© 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536932>A fully chimeric IgG antibody for ROR1 suppresses ovarian cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>Over-expression of Receptor--kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1) in cancer cells has been reported in the context of several tumors (including ovarian cancer) and is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to construct a fully chimeric anti-ROR1 IgG antibody (ROR1-IgG) and investigate its antitumor activity against ovarian cancer cells, bothin vitro and in vivo.A fully chimeric anti-ROR1 IgG antibody (ROR1-IgG) eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and ROR1-IgG antibody was expressed in CHO cells. The characteristics of ROR1-IgG were investigated by ELISA, SPR, Western blotting, FACS and fluorescence staining analyses. CCK8 and wound healing assays were performed to determine inhibition and migration capacity of ovarian cancer cells after treatment with ROR1-IgGin vitro. Further, the antitumor activity of ROR1-IgG was assessed in vivo using tumor-mice xenograft model.The results showed that ROR1-IgG could specifically bind to ROR1-positive cells (HO8910 and A2780) with a high affinity. Functional studies revealed that ROR1-IgG inhibited the malignant behavior of ROR1-positive cells (HO8910 and A2780) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were not observed in ROR1-negative lose386 cells. The tumor inhibition rates following treatment with low, medium, and high concentrations of ROR1-IgG were approximately 47.72%, 53.79%, and 60.51%, respectively. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2 was obviously reduced while that of Bax was distinctly elevated in xenografts.Collectively, our findings suggest that ROR1-IgG may be a novel therapeutic agent for patients with ROR1-positive ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, acquired resistance to TKIs invariably develops within approximately 1 year of treatment by various mechanisms, including gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathway activation and histological transformations. Because  is an option for patients with drug-resistant cancers, we generated several TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and then evaluated the cytotoxicity of NK92-CD16 cells to these resistant cells.TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H3122CR1, H3122LR1, H3122CR1LR1, PC-9GR, PC-9ER, EBC-CR1 and EBC-CR2) were established from NCI-H3122 (EML4-ALK fusion), PC-9 (EGFR exon19 deletion) and EBC-1 (MET amplification) after continuous exposure to crizotinib, ceritinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and capmatinib. Expression of ligands for natural killer (NK) cell receptors and total EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry. NK cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab were measured using NK92-CD16 as effectors and detected using the Chromium-release assay.We found that NK92-CD16 cells preferentially killed TKI-resistant NSCLC cells when compared with their parental NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was up-regulated in the TKI-resistant NSCLC cells and patients' tumors, and the ICAM-1 up-regulated cancer cells lines were less susceptible to NK cytotoxicity by blocking ICAM-1. Moreover, NK92-CD16 cell-induced cytotoxicity toward TKI-resistant NSCLC cells was enhanced in the presence of cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting mAb.These data suggest that combinational treatment with NK cell-based  and cetuximab may be promising for patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC.Copyright © 2019 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy.

TTD was calculated as date of randomization to date of discontinuation or death and compared to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) across all patients, as well as in treatment-defined subgroups [EGFR mutation-positive treated with  kinase inhibitor (TKI), EGFR wild-type treated with TKI, ALK-positive treated with TKI, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), chemotherapy doublet with maintenance, chemotherapy monotherapy].Overall across 8947 patients, TTD was more closely associated with PFS (r = 0.87, 95% CI 0.86-0.87) than with OS (0.68, 95% CI 0.67-0.69). Early TTD (PFS-TTD ≥ 3 months) occurred in 7.7% of patients overall, and was more common with chemo monotherapy (15.0%) while late TTD (TTD-PFS ≥ 3 months) occurred in 6.0% of patients overall, and was more common in EGFR-positive and ALK-positive patients (12.4% and 22.9%). In oncogene-targeted subgroups (EGFR positive and ALK positive), median TTDs (13.4 and 14.1 months) exceeded median PFS (11.4 and 11.3 months).At the patient level, TTD is associated with PFS across therapeutic classes. Median TTD exceeds median PFS for biomarker-selected patients receiving oncogene-targeted therapies. TTD should be prospectively studied further as an end point for pragmatic randomized RWE trials only for continuously administered therapies.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology 2019.

CIBERSORT and ssGSEA analyses revealed that M2 macrophages accounted for the highest proportion from 22 subsets of tumor‑infiltrating immune cells and were enriched in higher histologic grade and higher pathologic stage bladder cancer and 'basal' subtype of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Kaplan‑Meier survival curve analysis indicated that patients with high numbers of infiltrating M2 macrophages had worse overall and disease‑specific survival rates. RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry results indicated that M2 macrophages were enriched in MIBC and promoted angiogenesis. M2 macrophage infiltration was higher in bladder cancer tissues with mutant TP53, RB transcriptional corepressor 1, phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit α, lysine methyltransferase 2A, lysine demethylase 6A and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic‑polypeptide‑like, but lower in tissues with mutant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), E74‑like ETS transcription factor 3, PC4 and SFRS1 interacting protein 1 and transmembrane and coiled‑coil domains 4. In addition, M2 macrophage infiltration was lower in the tissues with amplified FGFR3, erb‑b2 receptor  kinase 2, BCL2‑like 1, telomerase reverse transcriptase and ‑3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan‑5‑monooxygenase activation protein ζ, as well as in the tissues with deleted cyclin‑dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, CREB binding protein, AT‑rich interaction domain 1A, fragile histidine triad diadenosine triphosphatase, phosphodiesterase 4D, RAD51 paralog B, nuclear receptor corepressor 1 and protein  phosphatase receptor type D.

Overall, the present study concluded that M2 macrophages are the predominant tumor‑infiltrating immune cell in bladder cancer and differentially expressed miRNAs due to cancer‑specific genomic alterations may be important drivers of M2 macrophage infiltration. These findings suggested that M2 macrophage infiltration may serve as a potential  target in bladder cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384667>Recruitment of Intratumoral CD103 Dendritic Cells by a CXCR4 Antagonist-Armed Virotherapy Enhances Antitumor Immunity.</a></h1><p>Intratumoral dendritic cells play an important role in stimulating cytotoxic T cells and driving antitumor immunity. Using a metastatic ovarian tumor model in syngeneic mice, we explored whether therapy with a CXCR4 antagonist-armed oncolytic vaccinia virus activates endogenous CD103 dendritic cell responses associated with the induction of adaptive immunity against viral and tumor antigens. The overall goal of this study was to determine whether expansion of CD103 dendritic cells by the virally delivered CXCR4 antagonist augments overall survival and  boosting with a tumor antigen peptide-based vaccine. We found that locoregional delivery of the CXCR4-A-armed virus reduced the tumor load and the immunosuppressive network in the tumor microenvironment, leading to infiltration of CD103 dendritic cells that were capable of phagocytic clearance of cellular material from virally infected cancer cells. Further expansion of tumor-resident CD103 DCs by injecting the FMS-related  kinase 3 ligand, the formative cytokine for CD103 DCs, provided a platform for a booster immunization with the Wilms tumor antigen 1 peptide-based vaccine delivered intraperitoneally with polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid as an adjuvant. The vaccine-induced antitumor responses inhibited tumor growth and increased overall survival, indicating that expansion of intratumoral CD103 dendritic cells by CXCR4-A-armed oncovirotherapy treatment can potentiate  cancer vaccine boosting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600169>Enapotamab vedotin, an AXL-specific antibody-drug conjugate, shows preclinical antitumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Targeted therapies and  have shown promise in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Tumor regression or stasis was observed in 17/61 (28%) of the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and was associated with AXL mRNA expression levels. Significant single-agent activity of enapotamab vedotin was validated in vivo in 9 of 10 AXL-expressing NSCLC xenograft models. In a panel of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines rendered resistant to EGFR inhibitors in vitro, we observed de novo or increased AXL protein expression concomitant with enapotamab vedotin-mediated cytotoxicity. Enapotamab vedotin also showed antitumor activity in vivo in 3 EGFR-mutant, EGFR inhibitor-resistant PDX models, including an osimertinib-resistant NSCLC PDX model.

Fms-like  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) is detectable during homeostasis and increases in hypoplasia due to genetic defects or treatment with cytoreductive agents. Conversely, Flt3+ AML is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering complete remission (CR) but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the bone marrow. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 140 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the  kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib or placebo. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney UP < .0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival; Flt3L ≤291 pg/mL was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS), and Flt3L >1185 pg/mL was associated with higher overall survival (OS; P = .0119). The separation of EFS and OS curves increased when minimal residual disease (MRD) status was combined with Flt3L measurement, and Flt3L retained a near-significant association with survival after adjusting for MRD in a proportional hazards model. Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML illustrates the potential value of monitoring Flt3L to identify relapse. Measurement of Flt3L is a noninvasive test with the potential to inform clinical decisions in patients with AML.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865033>Treatment of oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>With the development of targeted therapies, the treatment strategy of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed tremendously. In this review, we focus on the different aspects of the treatment of oncogene-driven NSCLC.Patients with an EGFR or ALK alteration show a better clinical outcome with  kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment compared to chemotherapy.Patients with a ROS1 rearrangement or a BRAF V600E mutation show favorable clinical outcome with TKI treatment compared to chemotherapy, although randomized trials are not available.Patients on TKIs will eventually develop disease progression because of acquired resistance.The treatment with  in EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC patients did not improve overall survival over that of chemotherapy.Blood-based genetic analysis provides the opportunity to noninvasively screen patients for the presence of oncogenic drivers and to monitor resistance during TKI treatment.Targeted molecular therapies are now standard of care for patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC with a good clinical benefit and minimal toxicity.

Data that support the benefit of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in high risk patient subsets or in late relapse patients are still questioned and have yet to be determined conclusive. This article presents the newly published data in ALL workup and treatment, putting it into perspective for the attending physician in hematology and oncology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440117>The role of  amplification and overexpression in therapeutic resistance of malignant tumors.</a></h1><p>The MDM2 protein encoded by the mouse double minute 2 () gene is the primary negative regulatory factor of the p53 protein. MDM2 can ligate the p53 protein via its E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the ubiquitinated p53 can be transferred to the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes. Therefore, MDM2 can maintain the stability of p53 signaling pathway.  amplification has been detected in many human malignancies, including lung cancer, colon cancer and other malignancies. MDM2 overexpression is associated with chemotherapeutic resistance in human malignancies. The mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance by MDM2 overexpression mainly include the p53-MDM2 loop-dependent and p53-MDM2 loop-independent pathways. But the role of MDM2 overexpression in  kinase inhibitors resistance remains to be further study. This paper reviews the possible mechanisms of therapeutic resistance of malignancies induced by  amplification and overexpression, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted agents and hyperprogressive disease of . Besides, MDM2-targeted therapy may be a potential new strategy for treating advanced malignancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670078>Dual inhibition of CSF1R and MAPK pathways using supramolecular nanoparticles enhances macrophage .</a></h1><p>Among the numerous immune interactions, or lack-thereof, that occur during cancer progression, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) - cancer cell interactions have been shown to play an important role in modulating the tumor-microenvironment to an immune suppressive mode, promoting accelerated tumor growth, survival and metastatic spread. TAMs are predominantly polarized to a pro-tumorigenic M2-phenotype through macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (MCSF) cytokines that bind to the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a class III receptor  kinase. This MCSF-CSF1R interaction results in autophosphorylation of CSF1R and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to proliferation, survival and functional activity of M2 TAMs. Therapeutic inhibition of CSF1R and MAPK signaling could effectively re-polarize M2 macrophages to an anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype; however, this is challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that concurrent and sustained inhibition of the CSF1R and MAPK signaling pathways using dual-kinase inhibitor-loaded supramolecular nanoparticles (DSNs) enhance repolarization of pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages to the anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype. The supramolecular nanoparticles exhibited physical stability of over 7 days during storage conditions at 4 °C and over 24 h in human serum, released the inhibitors in a sustained manner and showed significantly higher internalization and accumulation of inhibitors in the M2 macrophages even at longer time points. When tested in a highly aggressive 4T1 breast cancer model, the supramolecular nanoparticles accumulated in TAMs at a significantly higher concentration, increased M1-like phenotype at significantly higher proportion and improved anti-tumor efficacy as compared to combination of single-inhibitor nanoparticles or the small molecule inhibitors. Our data suggests that concurrent, vertical inhibition of multiple intracellular kinase signaling pathways is important for repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, and by utilizing dual-inhibitor loaded supramolecular nanoparticles, further increase the ability to produce more M1 macrophages as compared to M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. This results in enhanced tumor growth inhibition and reduced toxicity. Therefore, vertical, co-inhibition of CSF1R and downstream signaling pathways like MAPK could be a promising macrophage  strategy for aggressive cancers.Copyright © 2019.

Both, genetically modified donor-derived NK cells as well as continuously expanding NK-92 cells are currently under clinical development. To enhance their therapeutic utility for the treatment of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we engineered NK-92 cells by lentiviral gene transfer to express a FMS-like  kinase 3 (FLT3)-specific CAR that contains a composite CD28-CD3ζ signaling domain. FLT3 has primarily been described as a therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia, but overexpression of FLT3 has also been reported in B-ALL. Exposure of FLT3-positive targets to CAR NK-92 cells resulted in conjugate formation between NK and leukemia cells, NK-cell degranulation and selective cytotoxicity toward established B-ALL cell lines and primary blasts that were resistant to parental NK-92. In a SEM B-ALL xenograft model in NOD-SCID IL2R γ mice, treatment with CAR NK-92 but not parental NK-92 cells markedly inhibited disease progression, demonstrating high antileukemic activity in vivo. As FLT3 is known to be also expressed on precursor cells, we assessed the feasibility of incorporating an inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) suicide switch to enhance safety of our approach. Upon addition of the chemical dimerizer AP20187 to NK-92 cells coexpressing the FLT3-specific CAR and iCasp9, rapid iCasp9 activation was observed, precluding further CAR-mediated cytotoxicity. Our data demonstrate that B-ALL can be effectively targeted by FLT3-specific CAR NK cells which may complement CD19-directed immunotherapies, particularly in cases of inherent or acquired resistance to the latter.© 2019 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431076>A kinome-wide screen using a NanoLuc LATS luminescent biosensor identifies ALK as a novel regulator of the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis and immune evasion.</a></h1><p>The Hippo pathway is an emerging signaling pathway that plays important roles in organ size control, tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and immune response. Although many regulators of the Hippo pathway have been reported, the extracellular stimuli and kinase regulators of the Hippo pathway remain largely unknown. To identify novel regulars of the Hippo pathway, in this study we created the first ultra-bright NanoLuc biosensor (BS) to monitor the activity of large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinase 1, a central player of the Hippo pathway. We show that this NanoLuc BS achieves significantly advanced sensitivity and stability both  using purified proteins and  in living cells and mice. Using this BS, we perform the first kinome-wide screen and identify many kinases regulating LATS and its effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ- binding motif (TAZ). We also show for the first time that activation of receptor  kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) by its extracellular ligand family with sequence similarity (FAM)150 activates Hippo effector YAP/TAZ by increasing their nuclear translocation. Significantly, we show that constitutively active ALK induces tumorigenic phenotypes, such as increased cancer cell proliferation/colony formation  YAP/TAZ and elevated immune evasion  YAP/TAZ-programmed death-ligand 1 in breast and lung cancer cells. In summary, we have developed a new LATS BS for cancer biology and therapeutics research and uncovered a novel  signaling axis that may play important roles in cancer and possibly other biologic processes.-Nouri, K., Azad, T., Lightbody, E., Khanal, P., Nicol, C.

Although the main cause of the loss of DAergic neurons is still unknown, various etiopathogenic mechanisms are distinguished, including release and accumulation of endogenous excitotoxic mediators along with the production of oxidative free radicals. Several neurotrophic and growth factors are known to increase DAergic neuronal survival and enhance antioxidant mechanisms. In this context, the micro- (MI) approach consists to regulate the immune system in order to protect DAergic neurons and control oxidative stress.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the MI medicine (MIM), 2LPARK (Labo'Life), on oxidative stress and on the number of neurons positive for  hydroxylase (TH), in an in vitro model of PD.Rat primary mesencephalic DAergic neurons cultures were pre-treated for 1 hr with the MIM (10 μM and 10 mM), placebo (10 μM and 10 mM) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 3.3 μM) and then intoxicated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 20 μM) for 48 hrs. After incubation, cells were incubated 30 mins at 37°C with CellROX green reagent and number of labeled cells were quantified. Then, cells were fixed and incubated with anti-TH antibody and the number of TH neurons was evaluated.We showed that, contrary to placebo, MIM was able to reduce oxidative stress and protect DAergic neurons from 6-OHDA-induced cell death.Our results demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of MIM on two essential mechanisms of PD and propose the MI approach as a new ally in the regulation of neuroinflammation and in the treatment of this degenerative disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979816>FGFR2 Promotes Expression of PD-L1 in Colorectal Cancer via the JAK/STAT3 Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>Although multidisciplinary treatment is widely applied in colorectal cancer (CRC), the prognosis of patients with advanced CRC remains poor.  blocking of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a promising approach. Binding of the transmembrane protein PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells or tumor microenvironment cells to its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) induces immunosuppressive signals and reduces the proliferation of T cells, which is an important mechanism of tumor immune escape and a key issue in . However, the regulation of PD-L1 expression is poorly understood in CRC. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) 2 causes the  kinase domains to initiate a cascade of intracellular signals by binding to FGFs and dimerization (pairing of receptors), which is involved in tumorigenesis and progression. In this study, we showed that PD-L1 and FGFR2 were frequently overexpressed in CRC, and FGFR2 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and poor survival. In the current study, PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with FGFR2 expression in CRC. Tumor-derived-activated FGFR2 induced PD-L1 expression via the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in human CRC cells (SW480 and NCI-H716), which induced the apoptosis of Jurkat T cells. FGFR2 also promoted the expression of PD-L1 in a xenograft mouse model of CRC. The results of our study reveal a novel mechanism of PD-L1 expression in CRC, thus providing a theoretical basis for reversing the immune tolerance of FGFR2 overexpression in CRC.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468288>Game of thrones:  versus molecular targeted therapy in renal cell cancer scenarios.</a></h1><p>Treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has become increasingly more complex over the last several years.

The cytotoxic effects of NK cells were first identified against leukemia cells, and it is now hypothesized that they may have a critical role in leukemia therapy. The cellular functions of NK cells are mediated by their cell surface receptors, which recognize ligands on cancer cells. The role of NK cells is specifically regulated by the activating or inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin‑like receptors (KIRs) on their surface, which bind to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands present on the target cells. The association between KIR and HLA is derived from the diversity of KIR/HLA gene profiles present in different individuals, and this determines the cytotoxic effect of NK cells on cancer cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological leukemia characterized by the hyper‑proliferation of myeloid cells, with the majority of patients with CML presenting with abnormal immune cells.  kinase inhibitors are the present standard therapy for CML, but are associated with numerous adverse side effects. Various studies have proposed CML therapy by immunotherapeutic approaches targeting the immune cells.

However, the role of RFX5 in the carcinogenesis and progress of HCC remains unknown. This study aimed to reveal its biological significance and the underlying mechanism in HCC.RFX5 mRNA expression level and copy number variation in HCC tumors and cell lines were determined by analyzing deposited data sets in the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database. The biological significance of RFX5 in HCC was investigated by monitoring the colony formation and subcutaneous tumor growth capacity when RFX5 was silenced with lentiviral short hairpin RNA and CRISPR/Cas9 system in HCC cell lines. The downstream gene transcriptionally activated by RFX5 in HCC cells was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay. The involvement of  3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein theta (YWHAQ) in HCC development was further determined by performing colony formation rescue assay and subcutaneous tumor growth rescue experiment. The association of YWHAQ with recurrence-free survival of patients with HCC was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Moreover, apoptosis level and the protein level of p53 pathway were determined to reveal the mechanism of RFX5 in driving HCC development.RFX5 was amplified and highly overexpressed in HCC tumor tissues compared with the corresponding non-tumor tissues. The mRNA expression level of RFX5 was significantly correlated with its DNA copy number (r = 0.4, P < 0.001). Functional study demonstrated that RFX5 was required for both clonogenic forming in vitro and subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo of HCC cells. Further study identified YWHAQ, namely 14-3-3 tau, as a key downstream transcriptional target gene of RFX5, which was tightly regulated by RFX5 in HCC. Moreover, overexpression of YWHAQ largely rescued the clonogenic growth of HCC cells that was suppressed by RFX5 knockdown. In addition, overexpression of YWHAQ in primary tumor was linked to poor prognosis of patients with HCC. These results demonstrated that YWHAQ was a downstream effector of RFX5 in HCC. Notably, RFX5-YWHAQ pathway could protect cells from apoptosis by suppressing the p53 and Bax in HCC.RFX5 is a putative HCC driver gene that plays an important role in the development and progression of HCC by transactivating YWHAQ and suppressing apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646085>Evidence for interaction of the NLRP3 inflammasome and Bruton's  kinase in tumor-associated macrophages: implications for myeloid cell production of interleukin-1beta.</a></h1><p>An inflammatory microenvironment has been shown to play an important role in the growth and metastasis of tumors. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex of the innate immune system that is responsible for the production of the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) are an expanded population of immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment that can promote the initiation and metastasis of tumor cells. Their presence has been correlated with disease burden, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this population. However, to date clinically relevant pharmacologic strategies to target TAM remain elusive. Here, we show that  generated TAM harbor NLRP3 inflammasome components and produce IL-1β. Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase (BTK), is in clinical use for the treatment of B- cell malignancies. We report that BTK is expressed by human  generated TAM and murine macrophages and that it physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, ibrutinib is able to inhibit BTK phosphorylation in TAM generated . Treatment of TAM with ibrutinib significantly impaired the ability of these cells to produce IL-1β. The present study provides evidence that BTK physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome and that inhibition of BTK with ibrutinib can impair the production of IL-1β by  generated TAM. Thus, ibrutinib could potentially be of clinical use in abrogating inflammation-associated cancer progression and the immune-suppressive effects of myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31407920>Diagnostic impact of additional O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)- (F-FET) PET following  with dendritic cell vaccination in glioblastoma patients.</a></h1><p>: Vaccination therapy using tumour antigen-loaded, autologous dendritic cells (DC) is a promising therapeutic approach alongside standard treatment for glioblastoma (GBM).

We applied gene expression profiling for comparison of leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells with their normal counterparts. Here, we show that the T-cell receptor γ chain alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is overexpressed in de novo pediatric (n=13) and adult (n=17) acute myeloid leukemia sorted leukemic stem cells and blasts compared to hematopoietic stem cells and normal myeloblasts (15 healthy controls). Moreover, TARP expression was significantly associated with a fms-like  kinase receptor-3 internal tandem duplications in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. TARP overexpression was confirmed in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (n=9), and was found to be absent in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=5) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n=1). Sequencing revealed that both a classical TARP transcript, as described in breast and prostate adenocarcinoma, and an acute myeloid leukemia-specific alternative TARP transcript, were present. Protein expression levels mostly matched transcript levels. TARP was shown to reside in the cytoplasmic compartment and showed sporadic endoplasmatic reticulum co-localization. TARP-T-cell receptor engineered cytotoxic T-cells in vitro killed acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and patient leukemic cells co-expressing TARP and HLA-A*0201. In conclusion, TARP qualifies as a relevant target for immunotherapeutic T-cell therapy in acute myeloid leukemia.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596963>Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Risk Factors and Current Management Strategies.</a></h1><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, ~257 million people are chronically infected with HBV, defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, but millions more have prior HBV exposure indicated by positive hepatitis B core antibody. Reactivation of hepatitis B implies a sudden increase in viral replication in a patient with chronic HBV infection or prior HBV exposure. Hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) can occur spontaneously, but it is more commonly triggered by immunosuppressive therapies for cancer, immunologic diseases, or transplantation. Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HBV-HCV coinfected individuals treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has also been identified as an important cause of HBVr. Hepatitis B virus reactivation is an underappreciated but important complication of common medical therapies that can delay treatment or result in clinical episodes of hepatitis, hepatic failure, or death. In this review, factors associated with HBVr, particularly medication-related risks, are explored. We review data involving rituximab and ofatumumab, doxorubicin, corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor antagonists,  kinases, bortezomib, hematologic stem cell transplantation, and DAAs for HCV treatment. In addition, we discuss screening strategies, choice of antiviral prophylaxis, and the optimal duration of therapy for HBVr. With additional awareness, screening, and appropriate antiviral therapy, it is expected that most cases of HBVr can be prevented.© 2019 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270272>The  kinase inhibitor dasatinib acts as a pharmacologic on/off switch for CAR T cells.</a></h1><p> with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells can be effective against advanced malignancies. CAR T cells are "living drugs" that require technologies to enable physicians (and patients) to maintain control over the infused cell product. Here, we demonstrate that the  kinase inhibitor dasatinib interferes with the lymphocyte-specific protein  kinase (LCK) and thereby inhibits phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ζ-chain of T cell receptor-associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP70), ablating signaling in CAR constructs containing either CD28_CD3ζ or 4-1BB_CD3ζ activation modules. As a consequence, dasatinib induces a function-off state in CD8 and CD4 CAR T cells that is of immediate onset and can be sustained for several days without affecting T cell viability. We show that treatment with dasatinib halts cytolytic activity, cytokine production, and proliferation of CAR T cells in vitro and in vivo. The dose of dasatinib can be titrated to achieve partial or complete inhibition of CAR T cell function. Upon discontinuation of dasatinib, the inhibitory effect is rapidly and completely reversed, and CAR T cells resume their antitumor function. The favorable pharmacodynamic attributes of dasatinib can be exploited to steer the activity of CAR T cells in "function-on-off-on" sequences in real time. In a mouse model of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), we demonstrated that a short treatment course of dasatinib, administered early after CAR T cell infusion, protects a proportion of mice from otherwise fatal CRS.

The angiopoietin/Tie2 and MET pathways have been implicated in tumor angiogenesis, metastases, and macrophage infiltration. In our study, we used trebananib, an angiopoietin 1/2 inhibitor and a novel small molecule MET kinase inhibitor in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of ccRCC. Our goal was to assess the ability of these compounds to alter the status of tumor infiltrating macrophages, inhibit tumor growth and metastases, and prolong survival. Seven-week-old SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically with human ccRCC models. One month post implantation, mice were treated with angiopoietin 1/2 inhibitor trebananib (AMG 386), MET kinase inhibitor or combination. In our metastatic ccRCC PDX model, RP-R-02LM, trebananib alone and in combination with a MET kinase inhibitor significantly reduced lung metastases and M2 macrophage infiltration (p=0.0075 and p=0.0205 respectively). Survival studies revealed that treatment of the orthotopically implanted RP-R-02LM tumors yielded a significant increase in survival in both trebananib and combination groups. Additionally, resection of the subcutaneously implanted primary tumor allowed for a significant survival advantage to the combination group compared to vehicle and both single agent groups. Our results show that the combination of trebananib with a MET kinase inhibitor significantly inhibits the spread of metastases, reduces infiltrating M2 type macrophages, and prolongs survival in our highly metastatic ccRCC PDX model, suggesting a potential use for this combination therapy in treating patients with ccRCC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092071>Recent advances in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</a></h1><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease with a bimodal distribution.

These patients are excluded from first-line . After a phase of regression these tumors develop systematically resistance requiring a rapid change in therapy. At present two strategies are being discussed. The first strategy, so called "historical' sequential treatment strategy, is based on the administration of first- or second-generation TKIs until the emergence of therapeutic resistance and, in the case of a  T790M mutation, on the administration of third-generation TKIs. The recently proposed second strategy, so called the "next-generation" TKIs strategy, concerns initial treatment with third-generation TKIs. This latter strategy appears to be promising but needs to be confirmed by data comparing survival curves of patients treated in a sequential manner. Several criteria influence the choice of these strategies, in particular the presence of brain metastases, the potential toxicity and the economic model. The selected therapeutic algorithm has certainly an impact on the activity of laboratories.

It includes checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1, which limit antitumor and antivirus T-cell responses. CD28 homolog (CD28H) and B7H7 have been identified as a receptor-ligand pair in this family, which has costimulatory activity in T cells. Here, we show that CD28H is expressed in primary natural killer (NK) cells and that it is a strong activator of NK cells through selective synergy with receptors NKp46 and 2B4 to induce degranulation, lysis of target cells, and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of B7H7 on target cells enhanced both natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of NK cells. Mutation of  192 on the CD28H cytoplasmic tail abolished NK-cell activation through CD28H. As B7H7 is broadly expressed in tumor tissues, we engineered a CD28H chimeric antigen receptor (CD28H-CAR) consisting of full-length CD28H fused to the cytoplasmic domain of T-cell receptor ζ chain. Remarkably, expression of CD28H-CAR in NK cells triggered lysis of B7H7 HLA-E tumor cells by overriding inhibition by the HLA-E receptor NKG2A. The cytoplasmic domains of CD28H and of the ζ chain were both required for this activity. Thus, CD28H is a powerful activation receptor of NK cells that broadens their antitumor activity and holds promise as a component of NK-based CARs for cancer .©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479431>Chimeric antigen receptor-induced BCL11B suppression propagates NK-like cell development.</a></h1><p>The transcription factor B cell CLL/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) is indispensable for T lineage development of lymphoid progenitors. Here, we show that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expression during early phases of ex vivo generation of lymphoid progenitors suppressed BCL11B, leading to suppression of T cell-associated gene expression and acquisition of NK cell-like properties. Upon adoptive transfer into hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, CAR-expressing lymphoid progenitors differentiated into CAR-induced killer (CARiK) cells that mediated potent antigen-directed antileukemic activity even across MHC barriers. CD28 and active immune receptor -based activation motifs were critical for a functional CARiK phenotype. These results give important insights into differentiation of murine and human lymphoid progenitors driven by synthetic CAR transgene expression and encourage further evaluation of ex vivo-generated CARiK cells for targeted .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040696>Long-term response of metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma following a subcutaneous injection of mixed bacterial vaccine: a case report.</a></h1><p>In this study, we present the case of a 56-year-old patient with renal clear cell carcinoma who developed lung metastases 13 months after nephrectomy and subsequently received  kinase inhibitor (sunitinib) and PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) , which failed to control the progression of the disease. The patient further developed metastases to the left pleura, bilateral hilar lymph nodes, liver, right lower kidney, scapula, left sixth rib, right tonsil, and other organs. There was severe anemia, requiring weekly blood transfusions. Karnofsky score was 30. After receiving mixed bacterial vaccine (MBV) consisting of 6 kinds of heat-inactivated bacteria plus Poly I:C, the patient's condition rapidly improved, systemic metastases gradually reduced in size or disappeared, anemia was corrected, and the patient was able to resume normal life and work.

Whereas differentiated (DTCs) malignancies are sensitive to radioiodine therapy, anaplastic (ATCs) and medullary (MTCs) tumors do not uptake radioactive iodine and display aggressive features associated with a poor prognosis. Moreover, in a majority of DTCs, disease evolution leads to the progressive loss of iodine sensitivity. Hence, iodine-refractory DTCs, along with ATCs and MTCs, require alternative treatments reflective of their different tumor biology. In the last decade, the molecular mechanisms promoting thyroid cancer development and progression have been extensively studied. This has led to a better understanding of the genomic landscape, displayed by thyroid malignancies, and to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Indeed, several pharmacological compounds have been developed for iodine-refractory tumors, with four multi-target  kinase inhibitors already available for DTCs (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and MTCs (cabozantib and vandetanib), and a plethora of drugs currently being evaluated in clinical trials. In this review, we will describe the genomic alterations and biological processes intertwined with thyroid cancer development, also providing a thorough overview of targeted drugs already tested or under investigation for these tumors. Furthermore, given the existing preclinical evidence, we will briefly discuss the potential role of  as an additional therapeutic strategy for the treatment of thyroid cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177576>Association between musk antibody concentrations and the myasthenia gravis composite score in 3 patients: A marker of relapse?</a></h1><p>Muscle-specific  kinase (MuSK) autoantibody related myasthenia gravis is characterized by bulbar and respiratory manifestations, a poor response to anticholinergics, and a generally good response to plasma exchange and rituximab. It is not known if MuSK-antibody (Ab) levels could be used to predict the clinical course Methods: Three patients for whom frequent long-term monitoring of MuSK-Ab levels and the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores were performed are described.A close relationship existed between the MuSK-Ab concentrations and the MGC score. Furthermore, a rise in Ab concentration preceded a more serious clinical relapse in all patients Conclusions: These findings suggest that MuSK-Ab concentrations may be a useful biomarker for the long-term monitoring of MuSK myasthenia gravis, particularly while in clinical remission. This may allow preemptive escalation of therapy to prevent clinical relapse, and conversely permitting greater weaning of unnecessary immunosuppression.

This results in cancer progression and resistance to anticancer drugs ( kinase inhibitor; TKI). Therefore, the imaging analysis of EGFR mutations is required for the treatment planning for non-small cell lung cancers. This study focused on the imaging analysis of a single nucleotide substitute in EGFR mutated cancer cells. We developed three novel peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-DNA probes for recognizing and detecting the following three gene mutations in EGFR gene mutations. The PNA-DNA probes consist of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated PNA as a detection probe and Dabcyl conjugated DNA as a quencher probe. The PNA-DNA probes were used to validate the feasibility for detecting three EGFR mutated sequences: exon19del E746-A750, T790M, and L858R. The three probes emitted fluorescent dose-dependent signals against three target DNA and RNA. Using the three PNA-DNA probes, we succeeded in distinguishing three kinds of lung-cancer cell lines (H1975, PC-9, and A549) which have different EGFR mutations by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143189>Myo1f, an Unconventional Long-Tailed Myosin, Is a New Partner for the Adaptor 3BP2 Involved in Mast Cell Migration.</a></h1><p>Mast cell chemotaxis is essential for cell recruitment to target tissues, where these cells play an important role in adaptive and innate immunity. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a major chemoattractant for mast cells. SCF binds to the KIT receptor, thereby triggering  phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain and resulting in docking sites for SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as Lyn and Fyn, and the subsequent activation of the small GTPases Rac that are responsible for cytoskeletal reorganization and mast cell migration. In previous works we have reported the role of 3BP2, an adaptor molecule, in mast cells. 3BP2 silencing reduces FcεRI-dependent degranulation, by targeting Lyn and Syk phosphorylation, as well as SCF-dependent cell survival. This study examines its role in SCF-dependent migration and reveals that 3BP2 silencing in human mast cell line (LAD2) impairs cell migration due to SCF and IgE. In that context we found that 3BP2 silencing decreases Rac-2 and Cdc42 GTPase activity. Furthermore, we identified Myo1f, an unconventional type-I myosin, as a new partner for 3BP2. This protein, whose functions have been described as critical for neutrophil migration, remained elusive in mast cells. Myo1f is expressed in mast cells and colocalizes with cortical actin ring. Interestingly, Myo1f-3BP2 interaction is modulated by KIT signaling. Moreover, SCF dependent adhesion and migration through fibronectin is decreased after Myo1f silencing. Furthermore, Myo1f silencing leads to downregulation of β1 and β7 integrins on the mast cell membrane. Overall, Myo1f is a new 3BP2 ligand that connects the adaptor to actin cytoskeleton and both molecules are involved in SCF dependent mast cell migration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788361>Third-generation  kinase inhibitor in the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor mutated squamous cell lung cancer: a tailored therapy approach.</a></h1><p>We reported the case of a male patient suffering from a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, harboring a complex inframe deletion in exon 19 of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), treated with erlotinib and osimertinib and subsequently with . A 54-year-old male, with a light smoking history, presented in October 2015 with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC). Deletion p.E746_S752>V in EGFR exon 19 was found and after progression to erlotinib treatment, the liquid biopsy-based re-assessment highlighted a p.T790M EGFR mutation. Osimertinib was then started. After 5 cycles disease progression was detected and nivolumab was started. A subsequent clinical and radiological progression occurred after 3 nivolumab administrations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis, performed on metastatic tissue, confirmed the original EGFR deletion and showed also the presence of EGFR p.G724S and TP53 p.P152L mutations. Patient died in December 2017. The reported case highlighted tumor's molecular features prominent role over histology, offering further insights about druggable mutations in SqCLC.

There is 100% homology between the juxtamembrane domain of human and canine CD117, and many cancer-causing mutations occur in this region in both species. Thus, CD117 is an important target for cancer treatment in dogs and for comparative oncology studies. Currently, there is no monoclonal antibody (mAb) specifically designed to target the exposed region of canine CD117, although there exist some with species cross-reactivity. We panned a naïve phage display library to isolate antibodies against recombinant CD117 on whole cells. Several mAbs were isolated and were shown to bind recombinant canine CD117 at low- to sub-nanomolar affinity. Additionally, binding to native canine CD117 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and by flow cytometry. Competitive binding assays also identified mAbs that competed with the CD117 receptor-specific ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF). These results show the ability of our cell-based biopanning strategy to isolate a panel of antibodies that have varied characteristics when used in different binding assays. These in vitro/ex vivo assessments suggest that some of the isolated mAbs might be promising candidates for targeting overexpressed CD117 in canine cancers for different useful applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742119>Immune and genomic correlates of response to anti-PD-1  in glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been successful across several tumor types; however, their efficacy has been uncommon and unpredictable in glioblastomas (GBM), where <10% of patients show long-term responses. To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1  in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations, immune expression signatures, and immune infiltration that reflect the tumor's clonal evolution during treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331834>Quantitative proteomics reveals reduction of endocytic machinery components in gliomas.</a></h1><p>Gliomas are the most frequent and aggressive malignancies of the central nervous system. Decades of molecular analyses have demonstrated that gliomas accumulate genetic alterations that culminate in enhanced activity of receptor  kinases and downstream mediators. While the genetic alterations, like gene amplification or loss, have been well characterized, little information exists about changes in the proteome of gliomas of different grades.We performed unbiased quantitative proteomics of human glioma biopsies by mass spectrometry followed by bioinformatic analysis.Various pathways were found to be up- or downregulated. In particular, endocytosis as pathway was affected by a vast and concomitant reduction of multiple machinery components involved in initiation, formation, and scission of endocytic carriers. Both clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis were changed, since not only clathrin, AP-2 adaptins, and endophilins were downregulated, but also dynamin that is shared by both pathways. The reduction of endocytic machinery components caused increased receptor cell surface levels, a prominent phenotype of defective endocytosis. Analysis of additional biopsies revealed that depletion of endocytic machinery components was a common trait of various glioma grades and subclasses.We propose that impaired endocytosis creates a selective advantage in glioma tumor progression due to prolonged receptor  kinase signaling from the cell surface.

In contrast, little is known of the subpopulation of patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who exhibit clinical outcomes that require treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, to identify eligible cases to treat with ICIs, we retrospectively analyzed the correlation between clinical features and the efficacy of ICIs in patients with EGFR mutations.We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who were treated with ICIs after developing resistance to EGFR-TKIs between February 2016 and April 2018 at 6 institutions in Japan. The association between clinical outcomes and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated.We enrolled 27 patients who harbored EGFR-activating mutations. The objective response and disease control rates were higher in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations than in those with common EGFR mutations (71% vs 35.7% and 57% vs 7%, P = 0.14 and P < 0.01, respectively). Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations or without T790M mutations exhibited a significantly longer median progression-free survival than those with common EGFR mutations or with T790M mutations (P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively).Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and without T790M mutations are associated with the best outcomes for treatment with  among those with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis.

MALT lymphoma, developed at the expense of lymphoid tissue associated with the mucosa, is usually localized to a given organ, but can also disseminate. Some patients with MALT lymphoma can be treated by eradicating the associated infectious agent, whereas local treatment should be preferred for other cases ; disseminated forms and relapsed patients are eligible for anti-CD20 antibodies associated with cytotoxic agents. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have benefited from many advances, including the use of cytarabine and bendamustine, anti-CD20 antibodies, intensive treatments (autograft) and recently targeted therapy (ibrutinib, inhibitor or the Bruton  kinase). Patients with splenic nodal marginal zone lymphomas should be evaluated for different options, of which immunochemotherapy remains important.

However, pancreatic cancers are still intractable and difficult to treat once recurrence or metastasis occurs; thus, novel combined use of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with molecular targeted drugs is considered a therapeutic option. Previously, we developed a novel humanized MHC-double knockout (dKO) NOG mouse model and demonstrated that an anti-PD-1 antibody or a STAT3 inhibitor showed anti-tumor effects through an immunological mechanism. In the current study, using a humanized mouse model, we aimed to develop a combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 antibody and a STAT3 inhibitor (STX-0119) for use in vivo against pancreatic cancer. In an in vitro investigation, STX-0119 showed weak to moderate cytotoxic activity against several pancreatic cancer cell lines, which exhibited activated pSTAT3 and weak PD-L1 expression. However, unexpectedly, an in vivo study indicated that the combination of the anti-PD-1 antibody with STX-0119 remarkably reduced the anti-tumor effect and TIL numbers despite the effective anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer was produced individually by STX-0119 and the anti-PD-1 antibody. These results suggested that the combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody with specific signal inhibiting drugs should be carefully evaluated to avoid unexpected side effects, and such studies might contribute to the development of an effective combination regimen of ICB with cancer-targeting drugs such as  kinase inhibitors (TKIs).Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

These range from percutaneous ablative techniques to arterial embolization, and varied radiotherapy strategies. They are now used for local disease control, symptom palliation, and bold curative strategies. The big challenge in the face of these innovative and sometimes overlapping technologies is to identify the best opportunity of use. In real practice, many patients may take benefit from LDT used as a bridge to curative treatment such as resection and liver transplantation. Varying trans-arterial embolization strategies are used, and comparison between established and developing technologies is scarce. Also, radioembolization utilizing yttrium-90 (Y-90) for locally advanced or intermediate-stage HCC needs further evidence of clinical efficacy. There is increasing interest on LDT-led changes in tumor biology that could have implications in systemic therapy efficacy. Foremost, additional to its apoptotic and necrotic properties, LDT could warrant changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and release. However, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) used alongside -kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib has had its efficacy contested. Most recently, interest in associating Y-90 and TKI has emerged.

Using isogenic in vivo murine models across five different tumor histologies-bladder, breast, colon, sarcoma, and melanoma-we show that DDR2 depletion increases sensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment compared to monotherapy. Combination treatment of tumor-bearing mice with anti-PD-1 and dasatinib, a  kinase inhibitor of DDR2, led to tumor load reduction.

This scoring system is simply calculated by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum albumin concentration. The aim of our study was to determine whether GRIm-Score is a practically useful prognostic biomarker for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).This retrospective and single institutional study collected 185 adenocarcinomas without active EGFR mutation, 115 squamous cell carcinomas treated with first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 140 NSCLCs with mutant EGFR treated with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI monotherapy. These treatments were initiated between July 2007 and March 2018 at our hospital. We compared overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between high and low GRIm-Score groups. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, we also found prognostic factors of survival times.The OS and PFS of low GRIm-Score group were significantly longer than those of high-score group in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (low vs. high; median OS, 18.4 vs. 5.1 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS, 5.8 vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.01) and EGFR-mutant NSCLC (median OS, 38.9 vs. 10.4 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS, 15.9 vs. 5.0 months, P < 0.01). Subsequent multivariate analyses detected high GRIm-Score in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma as a poor prognostic factor of OS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.20, 95% CI 1.47 - 3.31, P < 0.01), and in the EGFR-mutant NSCLC as a poor prognostic factor of PFS (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00 - 3.55, P = 0.049).High GRIm-Score was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS of first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma and of PFS of first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Therefore, GRIm-Score is not only a specific selection marker for experimental  trials, but may also be a promising and useful pretreatment prognostic maker for specific NSCLC subsets in the real-world practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451142>[Basis of Tumor Microenvironment Relevant to Immunotherapies for Brain Metastases of NSCLC].</a></h1><p>Brain is the most frequent site for distant metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Although L-asparaginase-based chemotherapy has resulted in improved response rates, relapse occurs in up to 50% of patients with disseminated disease. There is hence an urgent need for effective targeted therapy, especially for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Novel insights gleaned from high-throughput molecular and genomic profiling studies in recent years have contributed significantly to the understanding of the molecular biology of ENKTL, which exemplifies many of the hallmarks of cancer. Deregulated pro-proliferative signaling pathways, such as the Janus-associated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Aurora kinase, MYC, and NF-κB, have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. The discovery of the non-canonical function of EZH2 as a pro-proliferative transcriptional co-activator has shed further light on the pathogenesis of ENKTL. Loss of key tumor suppressor genes located on chromosome 6q21 also plays an important role. The best-studied examples include PR domain zinc finger protein 1(PRDM1), protein  phosphatase kappa (PTPRK), and FOXO3. Promoter hypermethylation has been shown to result in the downregulation of other tumor suppressor genes in ENKTL, which may be potentially targeted through hypomethylating agents. Deregulation of apoptosis through p53 mutations and upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, survivin, may provide a further growth advantage to this tumor. A deranged DNA damage response as a result of the aberration of ataxia telangiectasia-related (ATR) kinases can lead to significant genomic instability and may contribute to chemoresistance of ENKTL. Recently, immune evasion has emerged as a critical pathway for survival in ENKTL and may be a consequence of HLA dysregulation or STAT3-driven upregulation of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1).  via inhibition of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 checkpoint signaling holds great promise as a novel therapeutic option. In this review, we present an overview of the key molecular and pathogenic pathways in ENKTL, organized using the framework of the "hallmarks of cancer" as described by Hanahan and Weinberg, with a focus on those with the greatest translational potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354261>A sensitive and rapid chemiluminescence immunoassay for point-of-care testing (POCT) of copeptin in serum based on high-affinity monoclonal antibodies via cytokine-assisted immunization.</a></h1><p> Antibodies are key reagents in the development of immunoassay. We attempted to develop high-performance CPP immunoassays using high-affinity monoclonal antibodies prepared via cytokine-assisted immunization.  We used fetal liver  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), CC subtype chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to assist traditional subcutaneous immunization of preparing high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, and further to develop high-performance immunoassay methods for CPP.  This novel immune strategy significantly enhanced immune response against CPP. Six anti-CPP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity were successfully screened and selected for application in a fully automated magnetic chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). This robust and rapid assay can efficiently detect CPP in the range of 1.2-1250 pmol L with a detection limit of 6.25 pmol L. Significantly, the whole incubation process can be completed in 30 min as compared to about 4.5 hr for the control ELISA kit. Furthermore, this assay exhibited high sensitivity and specificity, low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs < 15%). The developed assay was applied in the detection of CPP in 115 random serum samples and results showed a high correlation with data obtained using a commercially available ELISA kit (correlation coefficient, 0.9737).  Our assay could be applied in the point-of-care testing of CPP in the serum samples, and also the method developed in this study could be adopted to explore the detection and diagnosis of other biomarkers for various diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830521>: Current Status and Future Perspectives.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an increasing incidence and dismal prognosis, with few systemic treatments approved, including several small molecule  kinase inhibitors.

Despite the slow pace of development, the interest continues in these treatment modalities.

In very rare cases, the BCR-ABL1 IS measurement fails to detect BCR-ABL1 chimeric messages for unknown reasons. Such a situation was also experienced in our study; therefore, molecular analysis of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene was performed. A breakpoint in the ABL1 gene was identified in the middle of the a2 exon, leading to generation of chimeric messages lacking a nucleic acid sequence encoded by this exon (e14a3 chimeric message). The ABL1 a2 exon is critical for quantification of BCR-ABL1 chimeric messages with the measurement scales used in medical laboratories. Absence of this referred nucleic acid sequence was the reason why BCR-ABL1 IS measurement failed to detect the chimeric messages in our study. In the future, such rare cases of CML, with BCR-ABL1 chimeric messages not detected by standard IS measurements, in Japan should be collected and their molecular structures should be analyzed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30855193>Can increased immunogenicity in chronic myeloid leukemia improve outcomes?</a></h1><p>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has long been thought to be the model disease for  with its characteristic BCR-ABL fusion protein. Although targeted therapy using  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is highly effective at inducing remission, most patients require life-long TKI to decrease the risk of relapse. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to finding ways to eliminate CML stem cells (LSCs); the source of disease persistence. Areas covered: In this review, the authors present recent immunologic findings pertinent to CML, vaccinations targeting leukemia antigens, interferon combination therapies, and other emerging strategies aimed at increasing immunogenicity and improving outcomes in patients with CML. Recent publications and abstracts found in Pubmed and hematology/oncology meetings related to these topics were identified and incorporated into this review. Expert commentary: Further understanding of the immune system and antigenic composition of LSCs has allowed for novel therapeutic development. Immunotherapies are effective at the malignant stem cell level and combining these approaches with TKI is a promising option. Despite ongoing challenges, it is increasingly recognized that a cure may be achievable through immunotherapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451482>TAM Family Receptor Kinase Inhibition Reverses MDSC-Mediated Suppression and Augments Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Melanoma.</a></h1><p>Myeloid cell receptor  kinases TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK and their ligands, GAS6 and PROTEIN S, physiologically suppress innate immune responses, including in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we showed that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) dramatically upregulated TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK and their ligands [monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSC)>20-fold, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSC)>15-fold] in tumor-bearing mice. MDSCs from tumor-bearing  , and  mice exhibited diminished suppressive enzymatic capabilities, displayed deficits in T-cell suppression, and migrated poorly to tumor-draining lymph nodes. In coimplantation experiments using TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK MDSCs, we showed the absence of these RTKs reversed the protumorigenic properties of MDSCs  Consistent with these findings,  pharmacologic TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK inhibition diminished MDSC suppressive capability, slowed tumor growth, increased CD8 T-cell infiltration, and augmented anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor . Mechanistically, MERTK regulated MDSC suppression and differentiation in part through regulation of STAT3 serine phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Analysis of metastatic melanoma patients demonstrated an enrichment of circulating MERTK and TYRO3 M-MDSCs, PMN-MDSCs, and early-stage MDSCs (e-MDSC) relative to these MDSC populations in healthy controls. These studies demonstrated that TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK control MDSC functionality and serve as promising pharmacologic targets for regulating MDSC-mediated immune suppression in cancer patients.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30878834>Novel multitarget inhibitors with antiangiogenic and immunomodulator properties.</a></h1><p>By means of docking studies, seventeen compounds T.1-T17 have been designed and evaluated as multitarget inhibitors of VEGFR-2 and PD-L1 proteins in order to overcome resistance phenomena offered by cancer. All these designed molecules display a urea moiety as a common structural feature and eight of them (T.1-T8) further contain a 1,2,3-triazol moiety. The antiproliferative activity of these molecules on several tumor cell lines (HT-29, MCF-7, HeLa, A549, HL-60), on the endothelial cell line HMEC-1 and on the non-tumor cell line HEK-293 has been determined. The urea derivatives were also evaluated for their antiangiogenic properties, whereby their ability to inhibit tubulogenesis and kinase activity employing flow cytometry, ELISA, immunofluorescence and western blot techniques was measured. In addition, these techniques were also employed to investigate the immunomodulator action of the synthetic compounds on the inhibition of PD-L1 and c-Myc proteins.

These agents have been associated with vascular adverse events. Surgical revascularization was done in the first 2 patients, as they were suffering from cerebral ischemia. The third patient had suffered a significant brain hemorrhage, and therapeutic options were limited. In the first 2 patients, treatments also included antiplatelet agents and stopping/changing the TKI. In one of these patients we demonstrated regression of arterial stenosis after changing the TKI.Possibilities for treatment in this population, beyond the usual medical and surgical administrations, may include stopping or changing cancer drugs that may be related to the development of arterial pathology. Collaboration with oncologists is essential in this subset of patients. While aware of the potential for vascular toxicity, oncologists are often not fully appreciative of the fact that their therapeutic agents can cause stroke.Copyright © 2019.

The incidence of uncommon EGFR mutations is growing, due to the wider adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for diagnostic purposes, which enables the identification of rare variants, usually missed with available commercial kits that only detect a limited number of EGFR mutations. However, the sensitivity of uncommon mutations to first- and second-generation EGFR  Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) is widely heterogeneous and less well known, compared with classic mutations (i.e., exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R point mutation), since most of the pivotal studies with EGFR TKIs in the first line, with few exceptions, excluded patients with rare and/or complex variants. Recently, the third generation EGFR TKI osimertinib further revolutionized the therapeutic algorithm of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, but its role in patients harboring EGFR mutations besides exon 19 deletions and/or L858R is largely unknown. Therefore, a better knowledge of the sensitivity of uncommon mutations to currently available EGFR TKIs is critical to guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations with currently approved therapies and to discuss the emerging therapeutic opportunities in this peculiar subgroup of patients, including chemo- combinations, next-generation EGFR TKIs, and novel targeted agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31057615>Current Status of  for Localized and Locally Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Systemic therapy strategies in the setting of localized and locally advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have continued to evolve in two directions: as adjuvant therapy (to reduce risk of recurrence or progression in high risk localized groups), or as neoadjuvant therapy as a strategy to render primary renal tumors amenable to planned surgical resection in settings where radical resection or nephron-sparing surgery was not thought to be safe or feasible. In the realm of adjuvant therapy, the results of phase III randomized clinical trials have been mixed and contradictory; nonetheless based on the findings of the landmark S-TRAC study, the  kinase inhibitor Sunitinib has been approved as an adjuvant agent in the United States. In the realm of neoadjuvant therapy, presurgical tumor reduction has been demonstrated in a number of phase II studies utilizing targeted molecular agents.

The interaction between IL-23 and IL-23R is necessary for exerting cardinal biological effects upon certain cell types, including promotion of memory T cell proliferation and Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 secretion. Accordingly, dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the main sources for IL-23 secretion. Interestingly, IL-23R is also present on the DC plasma membrane, suggesting that IL-23 potentially acts on DCs via an autocrine manner. In this review, we have summarized a variety of IL-23-mediated effects on the intracellular signaling pathways such as Janus kinase 2,  kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and so forth, which may underlie numerous processes such as DC maturation, antigen presentation, T cell proliferation/activation, and cytokine secretion, which may be implicated in many immune-related diseases through IL-23/DC interactions. Accordingly, these signaling pathways are extensively involved in the pathogenesis and progression of numerous diseases, including autoimmune disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis) and infection (e.g., bacterial, fungal, and viral infections). Taken together, they are potentially applicable to novel but promising strategies for treating numerous diseases associated with the mutual attachment of IL-23 and DCs.Copyright © 2019.

Amphiphilic egg phosphatidylglycerol (EPG) structure and strong IBR-EPG interactions render these nanocomplexes high IBR loading capacity, prolonged blood circulation, and optimal particle sizes (∼30 nm), which can effectively deliver IBR to the tumor, followed by subsequent internalization of IBR by TAMs through SA-mediated active targeting. In vitro and in vivo tests showed that the prepared SA/IBR/EPG nanocomplexes could preferentially accumulate in TAMs and exert potent antitumor activity.

The identification of activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (deletions in exon 19 [Del19] and point mutation L858R in exon 21) has been the first important step toward molecularly guided precision therapy in lung cancer. Several randomized trials comparing EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) to standard chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and in response rate, with lower rates of adverse events (AEs) and better symptom control. However, none of these trials showed significant improvement in overall survival (OS). Despite impressive responses with EGFR-TKI, disease invariably progresses after 9 to 13 months, due to acquired resistance. Dacomitinib is a potent, irreversible, highly selective, second-generation EGFR-TKI, which inhibits the signaling from both heterodimers and homodimers of all the members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family. Here, we review the clinical development of dacomitinib from phase I to phase III, with particular attention to its toxicity and on its activity on T790M mutation. Then, we critically examine the results of ARCHER 1050, a study that was crucial for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. ARCHER 1050 was the first randomized phase III study comparing dacomitinib with gefitinib, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Dacomitinib was superior to gefitinib in terms of primary end-point (14.7 vs 9.2 months) and OS (34.1 vs 26.8 months). The incidence of diarrhea, skin rash, mucositis and, consequently, dose reductions was higher with dacomitinib, while hepatic toxicity was higher with gefitinib. Dacomitinib constitutes one of the standard first-line options in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC.© 2019 Lavacchi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311765>Folic Acid: A New Weapon for Mucositis?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171773>PRL3-zumab as an  to inhibit tumors expressing PRL3 oncoprotein.</a></h1><p>Tumor-specific antibody drugs can serve as cancer therapy with minimal side effects.

Here we show that PRL3-zumab specifically inhibits PRL3 cancer cells in vivo, but not in vitro. PRL3 antigens are detected on the cell surface and outer exosomal membranes, implying an 'inside-out' externalization of PRL3. PRL3-zumab binds to surface PRL3 in a manner consistent with that in classical antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis tumor elimination pathways, as PRL3-zumab requires an intact Fc region and host FcγII/III receptor engagement to recruit B cells, NK cells and macrophages to PRL3 tumor microenvironments. PRL3 is overexpressed in 80.6% of 151 fresh-frozen tumor samples across 11 common cancers examined, but not in patient-matched normal tissues, thereby implicating PRL3 as a tumor-associated antigen.

They are associated with a very poor prognosis and near 100% mortality. This has been the case for decades, largely because we lack effective therapeutics to augment surgery and radiotherapy. Notwithstanding improvements in the precision and efficacy of these life-prolonging treatments, with no reliable options for adjunct systemic therapy, brain recurrences are virtually inevitable. The factors limiting intracranial efficacy of existing agents are both physiological and molecular in nature. For example, heterogeneous permeability, abnormal perfusion and high interstitial pressure oppose the conventional convective delivery of circulating drugs, thus new delivery strategies are needed to achieve uniform drug uptake at therapeutic concentrations. Brain metastases are also highly adapted to their microenvironment, with complex cross-talk between the tumor, the stroma and the neural compartments driving speciation and drug resistance. New strategies must account for resistance mechanisms that are frequently engaged in this milieu, such as HER3 and other receptor  kinases that become induced and activated in the brain microenvironment. Here, we discuss molecular and physiological factors that contribute to the recalcitrance of these tumors, and review emerging therapeutic strategies, including agents targeting the PI3K axis, immunotherapies, nanomedicines and MRI-guided focused ultrasound for externally controlling drug delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996332>CARD9 microglia promote antifungal immunity via IL-1β- and CXCL1-mediated neutrophil recruitment.</a></h1><p>The C-type lectin receptor-Syk (spleen  kinase) adaptor CARD9 facilitates protective antifungal immunity within the central nervous system (CNS), as human deficiency in CARD9 causes susceptibility to fungus-specific, CNS-targeted infection. CARD9 promotes the recruitment of neutrophils to the fungus-infected CNS, which mediates fungal clearance. In the present study we investigated host and pathogen factors that promote protective neutrophil recruitment during invasion of the CNS by Candida albicans. The cytokine IL-1β served an essential function in CNS antifungal immunity by driving production of the chemokine CXCL1, which recruited neutrophils expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR2. Neutrophil-recruiting production of IL-1β and CXCL1 was induced in microglia by the fungus-secreted toxin Candidalysin, in a manner dependent on the kinase p38 and the transcription factor c-Fos. Notably, microglia relied on CARD9 for production of IL-1β, via both transcriptional regulation of Il1b and inflammasome activation, and of CXCL1 in the fungus-infected CNS. Microglia-specific Card9 deletion impaired the production of IL-1β and CXCL1 and neutrophil recruitment, and increased fungal proliferation in the CNS. Thus, an intricate network of host-pathogen interactions promotes antifungal immunity in the CNS; this is impaired in human deficiency in CARD9, which leads to fungal disease of the CNS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102038>Targeted Therapies for the Treatment of Glioblastoma in Adults.</a></h1><p>Targeted therapies are part of biomarker-driven strategies that exploit actionable molecular targets and have gained traction following survival benefits demonstrated in various systemic malignancies.

To date, for aggressive PitNETs, temozolomide (TMZ) has been the most used therapeutic option, and has resulted in an improvement in the five-year survival rate in responders. However, given the fact that roughly only one third of patients showed a partial or complete radiological response on the first course of TMZ, and even fewer patients responded to a second course of TMZ, other treatment options are urgently needed. Emerging therapies consist predominantly of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (20 cases), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy (12 cases),  kinase inhibitors (10 cases), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (six cases), and more recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (one case). Here, we present the available clinical cases published in the literature for each of these treatments. The therapies that currently show the most promise (based on the achievement of partial radiological response in a certain number of cases) are immune checkpoint inhibitors, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy. In the future, further improvement of these therapies and the development of other novel therapies, their use in personalized medicine, and a better understanding of combination therapies, will hopefully result in better outcomes for patients bearing aggressive PitNETs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245042>Molecular remission using low-dose  for relapsed refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia post-allogeneic stem cell transplant.</a></h1><p>Adults with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a poor prognosis.

We conducted a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in ten Spanish centres among mRCC patients whose disease progressed on first-line TKI. Patients received pazopanib until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. Twenty-seven patients were included (median age 62 yr, 51.9% male). The objective overall response rate was 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-28.2%). Median progression-free survival was 6.7 mo (95% CI 3.7-11.2) and median overall survival was 20.6 mo (95% CI 12.6-27.4). Lower circulating levels of IL-10 (p =  0.002) were observed in responding patients at 8 wk after treatment. The median pazopanib treatment duration was 6.0 mo (range 1.0-47.0). Most patients (48.1%) had mild or moderate adverse events (AEs), while 44.4% had severe AEs. Pazopanib was clinically active and well tolerated as a second-line treatment in mRCC patients after TKI failure, and circulating IL-10 levels could predict response. PATIENT SUMMARY: Pazopanib could be used as a second-line therapy for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma after failure of  kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy when drugs such as nivolumab and cabozantinib are not available. Now that  plus antiangiogenic therapy is a first-line option, IL-10 levels deserve further exploration as a potential predictor of response to sequential TKI-TKI therapy.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

Repeat chemotherapy shows decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity with each course. Newer therapies targeting BRAF/MEK or Bruton's  kinase are effective but generally leave MRD. Rituximab has modest activity as a single agent and can achieve MRD-negative CR in combination with purine analogs, but there is significant toxicity from the chemotherapy. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (Moxe) is a biologic containing an antibody fragment (Fv) binding to CD22, attached to a portion of  exotoxin A. Binding to CD22 enables the toxin to enter and kill cells. Moxe is administered by 30-minute infusions on days 1, 3, and 5 of up to six cycles spaced 4 weeks apart. In phase I testing, 64% of 33 patients at the highest dose level achieved CR, most without MRD. Lack of MRD correlated with prolonged CR duration; of 11 MRD-negative CRs, 10 were still in CR after a median of 42 months of observation. In pivotal testing, 75% of 80 patients had a hematologic response, 41% with CR; 82% (27/33) of CRs were MRD-negative, and only 4 of the 27 MRD-negative patients relapsed during the follow-up period. Hemolytic uremic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome were each observed in 9% of patients, all reversible. In September 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Moxe for the treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL after ≥2 prior therapies. Moxe is undergoing further development in combination with rituximab. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has effective treatments including purine analogs with and without rituximab, and oral inhibitors of BRAF, MEK and Bruton's  kinase (BTK). Despite these therapies, relapse occurs, and moxetumomab pasudotox has an important role in relapsed and refractory HCL because of its ability to achieve high rates of complete remissions (CRs) without chemotherapy; most of these CRs are without minimal residual disease (MRD). CR duration is enhanced in patients who achieve eradication of MRD. To improve the efficacy of this recombinant immunotoxin, a phase I trial is underway in combination with rituximab to reduce tumor burden and decrease immunogenicity.Published 2019.

Except for immune checkpoint inhibition, the mode of action of many antibodies is to recognize overexpressed or specific tumor antigens and initiate either direct F(ab')-mediated tumor cell killing, or Fc-mediated effects such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC/P) after binding to activating Fc receptors. All antibodies used in the clinic are of the IgG isotype. The IgA isotype can, however, also elicit powerful anti-tumor responses through engagement of the activating Fc receptor for monomeric IgA (FcαRI). In addition to monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils as FcαRI expressing immune cells, neutrophils are especially vigorous in eliminating IgA opsonized tumor cells. However, with IgG as single agent it appears almost impossible to activate neutrophils efficiently, as we have visualized by live cell imaging of tumor cell killing. In this study, we investigated Fc receptor expression, binding and signaling to clarify why triggering of neutrophils by IgA is more efficient than by IgG. FcαRI expression on neutrophils is ~2 times and ~20 times lower than that of Fcγ receptors FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb, but still, binding of neutrophils to IgA- or IgG-coated surfaces was similar. In addition, our data suggest that IgA-mediated binding of neutrophils is more stable compared to IgG. IgA engagement of neutrophils elicited stronger Fc receptor signaling than IgG as indicated by measuring the p-ERK signaling molecule. We propose that the higher stoichiometry of IgA to the FcαR/FcRγ-chain complex, activating four ITAMs (Immunoreceptor -based Activating Motifs) compared to a single ITAM for FcγRIIa, combined with a possible decoy role of the highly expressed FcγRIIIb, explains why IgA is much better than IgG at triggering tumor cell killing by neutrophils. We anticipate that harnessing the vast population of neutrophils by the use of IgA monoclonal antibodies can be a valuable addition to the growing arsenal of antibody-based therapeutics for cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862891>Real-world evidenceand clinical observations of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>To summarize the therapeutic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting, we attempted to identify potential molecular biomarkers or clinical factors that reflected the therapeutic effect. The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24 patients (61.5%) were still undergoing , and 7 patients (17.9%) had died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%). Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%. The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical trials; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive more benefits from ; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from  after treatment with a  kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1 intracranial efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884247>Novel agents may positively impact chemotherapy and transplantation in subsets of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</a></h1><p>: Molecular and biologic heterogeneity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has resulted in a broad range of clinical outcomes. While standard frontline chemoimmunotherapy cures majority of patients with DLBCL, treatment failure in certain DLBCL subsets remains high. Prognosis in these patients is dismal. Therefore, optimization of front-line therapy, as well as development of more effective salvage treatments, is an unmet medical need. : This article reviews the treatment advances in DLBCL with novel and targeted agents that are aimed to improve efficacy especially in those with high-risk features. : Incorporation of novel therapies such as immunomodulatory agents and Bruton  kinase (BTK) inhibitors in the treatment of higher-risk DLBCL subgroups have shown to be effective; however, confirmatory data are required to change the standard of care. While autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting CD19-positive B-cells have revolutionized the outcomes of refractory DLBCL, the complexity of its production, post-infusion care, and the associated cost, currently has limited its use to select academic centers in the US. A multitude of other targeted agents and combinations as well as cellular and immunotherapeutic agents are under investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526368>Role of the dynamic tumor microenvironment in controversies regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations.</a></h1><p> has been incorporated into the first- and second-line treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), profoundly ushering in a new treatment landscape. However, both adaptive signaling and oncogenic (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven) signaling may induce PD-L1 upregulation in NSCLC. Nevertheless, the superiority of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC is only moderate. ICIs appear to be well tolerated, but clinical activity for some advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients has only been observed in a small proportion of trials. Hence, there are still several open questions about PD-L1 axis inhibitors in patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations, such as the effect of EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or EGFR mutations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Finding the answers to these questions requires ongoing trials and preclinical studies to identify the mechanisms explaining this possible increased susceptibility and to identify prognostic molecular and clinical markers that may predict benefits with PD-1 axis inhibition in this specific NSCLC subpopulation. The presence of multiple mechanisms, including dynamic immune TME profiles, changes in PD-L1 expression and low tumor mutational burdens, may explain the conflicting data regarding the correlation between PD-L1 axis inhibitors and EGFR mutation status. We conducted a review of this currently controversial topic in an attempt to aid in the decision-making process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867899>Genomic aberrations in cell cycle genes predict progression of -mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).</a></h1><p>Activating mutations of the receptor  kinase  are early events in the development of most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Although GISTs generally remain dependent on oncogenic  during tumor progression,  mutations alone are insufficient to induce malignant behavior. This is evidenced by -mutant micro-GISTs, which are present in up to one-third of normal individuals, but virtually never progress to malignancy.We performed whole exome sequencing on 29 tumors obtained from 21 patients with high grade or metastatic -mutant GIST (discovery set). We further validated the frequency and potential prognostic significance of aberrations in  and  in an independent series of 71 patients with primary GIST (validation set).Using whole exome sequencing we found significant enrichment of genomic aberrations in cell cycle-associated genes (Fisher's Exact p = 0.001), most commonly affecting  in our discovery set. We found a low mutational tumor burden in these 29 advanced GIST samples, a finding with significant implications for the development of  for GIST. In addition, we found mutation of spliceosome genes in a minority of cases, implicating dysregulation of splicing as a potential cancer promoting mechanism in GIST. We next assessed the prognostic significance of  or  mutation/copy loss in an independent cohort of 71 patients with primary GIST. Genetic events (mutation, deletion, and/or LOH) involving at least one of the three genes examined were found in 17% of the very low-risk, 36% of the low-risk, 42% of the intermediate risk, 67% of the high-risk/low mitotic-count, and in 86% of the high-risk/high mitotic-count group. The presence of cell cycle-related events was associated with a significantly shorter relapse-free survival (median 67 months versus not reached;  < 0.0001) and overall survival (Log Rank, = 0.042).Our results demonstrate that genomic events targeting cell cycle-related genes are associated with GIST progression to malignant disease. Based on this data, we propose a model for molecular pathogenesis of malignant GIST.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367543>Treatment of uncommon  mutations in non-small cell lung cancer: new evidence and treatment.</a></h1><p>Sensitizing mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with positive responses to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy, leading to a new era of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitutions are the most common mutations, accounting for approximately 90% mutations in NSCLC; these are termed classic mutations and result in high sensitivity to  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Other  mutations are termed uncommon  mutations, of which G719X, S768I, L861Q, exon 20 insertions, and complex mutations are the most frequent. G719X, S768I, and L861Q are point mutations and those that exist with complex mutations are sensitive to first-generation TKIs. A prospective analysis demonstrated that afatinib, a second-generation TKI, led to a better prognosis in some patients with NSCLC compared to first-generation TKIs. Chemotherapy used to be the traditional choice for patients carrying exon 20 insertions; however, with the development of novel targeted drugs, the role of chemotherapy is changing. Tremendous progress has also been made in clinical trials on  treatment of uncommon  mutations. The treatment for patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon  mutations remains a subject of debate and the sensitivity of uncommon  mutations to TKIs is still unclear. Here, we summarized recent data in the literature and provide an overview of the clinical characteristics, incidence, and outcomes of patients harboring G719X, S768I, L861Q, exon 20 insertions, and complex mutations who were treated with TKIs, chemotherapy, or .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425728>Safety Evaluation of PQ Birch Allergy  to Support Product Development.</a></h1><p>PQ Birch represents an allergen-specific  for the treatment of birch pollinosis. It consists of native birch pollen extract chemically modified with glutaldehyde adsorbed to  in its microcrystalline form with addition of the adjuvant Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL®). A nonclinical safety testing strategy was designed based upon interpretation of current legislation and regulatory intelligence and comprised genotoxicity studies (bacterial reverse mutation and Chinese hamster ovary micronucleus assays), a rat repeat dose toxicology study and a rabbit local tolerance study. No safety findings of concern were found. Thus, no evidence of genotoxicity was found. Relatively minor, immunostimulatory effects were seen following repeated subcutaneous dosing (once every 2 weeks for 13 weeks) as reversible increased white cell count (notably neutrophils), increased globulin level (resulting in decreased albumin/globulin [A/G] ratio) and increased fibrinogen, as well as minor dose site reaction in the form of inflammatory cell infiltrate. These findings are likely due to the immunostimulatory nature of MPL® and/or the presence of  within the adjuvanted vaccine. Similar dose site inflammatory changes to the injected formulation were also noted in the rabbit local tolerance study.Copyright © 2019.

Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting angiogenic and stromal receptor  kinases. We evaluated whether regorafenib augments the antitumor effect of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric cancer.Patients with previously untreated metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) every 14 days and regorafenib 160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 of each 14-day cycle. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). To identify predictive biomarkers of outcome, we examined correlations between genomic characteristics of sequenced pretreatment tumors and PFS.Between August 2013 and November 2014, 36 patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer were accrued to this single-center phase II study (). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (36%), leucopenia (11%) and hypertension (8%). The 6-month PFS was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-71%), the objective response rate was 54% (95% CI, 37%-70%), and the disease control rate was 77% (95% CI, 67%-94%). Next-generation sequencing did not identify any genomic alterations significantly correlated with response, and there was no association between homologous recombination deficiency and PFS with platinum-based chemotherapy.Regorafenib (one week on-one week off schedule) is well tolerated in combination with first-line FOLFOX but does not improve 6-month PFS relative to historical control.Prognosis for metastatic esophagogastric cancer remains poor despite modern systemic therapy regimens. This phase II trial indicates that the combination of regorafenib and FOLFOX is well tolerated but does not add to the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic esophagogastric cancer. Notably, recently reported data suggest potential synergy between regorafenib and the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. As this study demonstrates that regorafenib plus FOLFOX is safe, and combined chemotherapy and  show favorable toxicity profiles, future studies combining  with regorafenib and chemotherapy may be feasible.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881514>Metastatic renal cell carcinoma regains sensitivity to  kinase inhibitor after nivolumab treatment: A case report.</a></h1><p>Sequential therapy using  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors is the mainstay of treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

In the present report, two cases of TKI-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma which regained sensitivity to TKI after  with nivolumab were described. In one case, a third challenge with axitinib after nivolumab treatment resulted in tumor shrinkage, although the second challenge with axitinib immediately before nivolumab treatment had no effect. In another case, a second challenge with pazopanib after nivolumab slightly reduced lung metastasis, which was refractory to pazopanib before nivolumab treatment.

However, methodology varies across studies, especially regarding the use of dose escalation.A literature search was conducted in Pubmed and major oncology meetings libraries for phase 1 trials reported between 2011 and 2018, containing at least one CPI (CLTA-4 blocking antibody or a PD(L)1 blocking antibody) plus at least one second agent (e.g.  kinase inhibitor, chemotherapy). Dose escalation schemes, target doses and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) were captured in our database for each study. Combination RP2D (combo-RP2D) was compared to target dose.We identified 113 different studies comprising a total of 120 individual cohorts. The backbone was an anti-CTLA-4 in 40 cohorts and an anti-PD(L)1 in 80 cohorts. Dose escalation was used for the CPI in 29 (24%) cohorts (11% for anti-PD(L)1 and 50% for anti CTLA-4) and for the second agent in 55 cohorts (46%). For 31 second agents (26%), the combo-RP2D was significantly lower than the expected target dose. Failure to reach the target dose was explained by the type of second agent form (e.g. small molecules versus monoclonal antibodies) (p < 0.001) and the choice of trial design for the second agent by investigators.Design of studies investigating new CPI-based combinations must consider the type of second agent. Dose escalation is required for combinations with small molecules but is unnecessary with vaccine/virus/dendritic therapies and monoclonal antibodies.© The Author 2019.

Nowadays, targeting angiogenesis has achieved success in various carcinomas by several mechanisms, including the use of anti-angiogenic small molecule receptor  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The development of TKIs targeting pro-angiogenic receptors, mainly vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family, have significantly improved the outcome of certain types of cancers, like renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. However, the general response rate is not very satisfactory. The particular toxicity profile and resistance to anti-angiogenic targeted agents are unavoidable, and no specific marker is available to screen responsive patients to TKIs for precision therapy. To date, about 11 anti-angiogenic TKIs with different binding capacities to angiogenic receptor  kinase have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers.

Multiple-dimensional types of data, including clinical, genomic and transcriptomic data of 408 bladder cancer patients were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Based on the median values of  and , the tumor samples were grouped into four tumor microenvironment immune types (TMIT). The RNA sequencing profiles, somatic mutation and  amplification data of bladder cancer were analyzed by different TMITs.  Our research demonstrated that 36.8% of the evaluated bladder cancer belonged to TMIT I (high /high ). TIMT subtypes were not significantly associated with overall survival or disease free survival in urothelial cancer. TMIT I facilitates CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activates T-effector and interferon gamma () associated gene signature. The number of somatic mutations, cytolytic activity,  mRNA expression and  mRNA expression in TMIT I was remarkably higher than those in other TMIT groups. Our results showed a high rate of C>T transversion and a high rate of transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) in TMIT I bladder tumors. The  mutation was significantly associated with TMIT I bladder cancer and be significantly co-occurring with the  mutation. However,  mutation and  mutation were mutually exclusive in TMIT II bladder tumors. More importantly, different amino acid changes by  mutations were also found between TMIT I and TMIT II bladder cancer, such as amino acid changes in "Immunoglobulin I-set domain (260-356)"and "Protein  kinase (472-748)". We also detected 9 genes as significantly cancer-associated genes in TMIT I bladder cancer, of which,  has been reported to play an important role in DNA damage responses. Further analysis concentrated on the potential molecular mechanism found that TMIT I was significantly associated with anti-tumor immune-related signaling pathway, and  was present on chromosome 21 in TMIT I bladder tumors.  The classification of bladder cancer into four TMITs on the bases of the  expression and the CD8+ CTLs statuses is an appropriate approach for bladder tumor . TMIT I (high /high ) is significantly correlated with more somatic mutation burden, and facilitates CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activates T-effector and  associated gene signature.

The pathway is frequently activated in cancer, driving cell division and influencing the activity of other signaling pathways, such as the MAPK, JAK-STAT and TGFβ pathways, to enhance tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Drugs that inhibit the pathway at various locations, e.g., receptor  kinase (RTK), PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors, are clinically available. To predict drug response versus resistance, tests that measure PI3K pathway activity in a patient sample, preferably in combination with measuring the activity of other signaling pathways to identify potential resistance pathways, are needed. However, tests for signaling pathway activity are lacking, hampering optimal clinical application of these drugs. We recently reported the development and biological validation of a test that provides a quantitative PI3K pathway activity score for individual cell and tissue samples across cancer types, based on measuring Forkhead Box O (FOXO) transcription factor target gene mRNA levels in combination with a Bayesian computational interpretation model. A similar approach has been used to develop tests for other signaling pathways (e.g., estrogen and androgen receptor, Hedgehog, TGFβ, Wnt and NFκB pathways).

We analyzed MAGE-A3 expression of sarcoma subtypes available in the Cancer Genome Atlas and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and show that undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/myxofibrosarcoma (UPS/MFS) expresses this potential target gene. We have identified high protein expression by tissue microarray of 106 UPS cores. We also found that high MAGE-A3 mRNA and protein expression is associated with worse overall survival in UPS/MFS.

Gene co-expression network analysis and pathway analysis using RNA sequencing data were used to identify lenvatinib-driven combined activity with anti-PD-1 antibody (anti-PD-1). Lenvatinib showed potent antitumor activity in the immunocompetent tumor microenvironment compared with the immunodeficient tumor microenvironment. Antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 was greater than that of either single treatment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that lenvatinib reduced tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increased the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells secreting interferon (IFN)-γ+ and granzyme B (GzmB). Combination treatment further increased the percentage of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, among CD45+ cells and increased IFN-γ+ and GzmB+ CD8+ T cells. Transcriptome analyses of tumors resected from treated mice showed that genes specifically regulated by the combination were significantly enriched for type-I IFN signaling. Pretreatment with lenvatinib followed by anti-PD-1 treatment induced significant antitumor activity compared with anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Our findings show that lenvatinib modulates cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment by reducing TAMs and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, shows enhanced antitumor activity via the IFN signaling pathway. These findings provide a scientific rationale for combination therapy of lenvatinib with PD-1 blockade to improve cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008116>Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells with High ROR1 Expression Serve as a New Prophylactic Vaccine for Ovarian Cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumor vaccines offer a number of advantages for cancer treatment. In the study, the vaccination with cancer stem cells (CSCs) with high expression of the type I receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR1) was evaluated in a murine model for the vaccine's immunogenicity and protective efficacy against epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). CD117CD44 CSCs were isolated from human EOC HO8910 cell line using a magnetic-activated cell sorting system; murine ID8 EOC suspension sphere cells, which are collectively known as cancer stem-like cells, were acquired from serum-free suspension sphere-forming culture. Mice were subcutaneously immunized with the repeat cycles of freezing and thawing whole HO8910 CD117CD44 CSCs and ID8 cancer stem-like cells, respectively, followed by a challenge with HO8910 or ID8 cells at one week after final vaccination. The results showed that the CSC vaccination significantly induced immunity against EOC growth and markedly prolonged the survival of EOC-bearing mice in the prophylactic setting compared with non-CSC vaccination. Flow cytometry showed significantly increased immunocyte cytotoxicities and remarkably reduced CSC counts in the CSC-vaccinated mice. Moreover, the protective efficacy against EOC was decreased when the ROR1 expression was downregulated by shRNA in CSC vaccines. The findings from the study suggest that CSC vaccines with high ROR1 expression were highly effective in triggering immunity against EOC in vaccinated mice and may serve as an effective vaccine for EOC immunoprophylaxis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485984>CD47: role in the immune system and application to cancer therapy.</a></h1><p>CD47 is a widely expressed cellular receptor well known for its immunoregulatory functions. By interacting with its ligands, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), integrins, and SH2-domain bearing protein  phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1), it modulates cellular phagocytosis by macrophages, transmigration of neutrophils and activation of dendritic cells, T cells and B cells. Ample studies have shown that various types of cancer express high levels of CD47 to escape from the immune system. Based on this observation, CD47 is currently considered as a prominent target in cancer therapy.Here, we review the role of CD47 in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. We also depict three emerging CD47-targeting strategies for cancer therapy, including the use of mimicry peptides, antibodies, and gene silencing strategies. Among these approaches, the most advanced one is the use of anti-CD47 antibodies, which enhances cancer cell phagocytosis via inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα axis. These antibodies can also achieve higher anti-cancer efficacies when combined with chemotherapy and  and hold promise for improving the survival of patients with cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846699>Bioengineered bacterial vesicles as biological nano-heaters for optoacoustic imaging.</a></h1><p>Advances in genetic engineering have enabled the use of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to deliver vaccines, drugs and  agents, as a strategy to circumvent biocompatibility and large-scale production issues associated with synthetic nanomaterials. We investigate bioengineered OMVs for contrast enhancement in optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging. We produce OMVs encapsulating biopolymer-melanin (OMV) using a bacterial strain expressing a tyrosinase transgene. Our results show that upon near-infrared light irradiation, OMV generates strong optoacoustic signals appropriate for imaging applications. In addition, we show that OMV builds up intense heat from the absorbed laser energy and mediates photothermal effects both in vitro and in vivo. Using multispectral optoacoustic tomography, we noninvasively monitor the spatio-temporal, tumour-associated OMV distribution in vivo. This work points to the use of bioengineered vesicles as potent alternatives to synthetic particles more commonly employed for optoacoustic imaging, with the potential to enable both image enhancement and photothermal applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480591>MET Receptor  Kinase Regulates the Expression of Co-Stimulatory and Co-Inhibitory Molecules in Tumor Cells and Contributes to PD-L1-Mediated Suppression of Immune Cell Function.</a></h1><p>The MET  receptor kinase is essential for embryonic development and tissue regeneration by promoting cell survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. It also contributes to tumor development and progression through diverse mechanisms. Using human cancer cell lines, including Hs746T (-mutated/amplified), H596 (-mutated), and H1993 (-amplified) cells, as well as BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells, we investigated whether MET is involved in the regulation of immune checkpoint pathways. In a microarray analysis, MET suppression using a MET inhibitor or siRNAs up-regulated co-stimulatory molecules, including 4-1BBL, OX40L, and CD70, and down-regulated co-inhibitory molecules, especially PD-L1, as validated by measuring total/surface protein levels in Hs746T and H1993 cells. MET activation by HGF consistently increased PD-L1 expression in H596 and BEAS-2B cells. Co-culture of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Hs746T cells suppressed interferon-γ production by the immune cells, which was restored by MET inhibition or PD-L1 blockade. A significant positive correlation between MET and PD-L1 expression in lung cancer was determined in an analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and in an immunohistochemistry study. The former also showed an association of MET overexpression in a PD-L1 tumor with the decreased expressions of T-cell effector molecules. In summary, our results point to a role for MET overexpression/activation in the immune escape of tumors by PD-L1 up-regulation. MET-targeted-therapy combined with  may therefore be an effective treatment strategy in patients with MET-dependent cancer.</p></html>
