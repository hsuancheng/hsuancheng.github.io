Because fatty acids can inhibit aldosterone synthesis, we hypothesized that increases in plasma lipids restrain aldosteronogenesis in the hypoxic neonate. We exposed rats to 7 days of hypoxia from birth to 7 days of age (suckling) or from 28 to 35 days of age (weaned at day 21). Plasma was analyzed for lipid content, and steroidogenesis was studied in dispersed whole adrenal glands untreated and treated to wash away lipids. Hypoxia increased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids in the suckling neonatal rat only. Washing away lipids increased aldosterone production in cells from 7-day-old rats exposed to hypoxia, but not in cells from normoxic 7-day-old rats or from normoxic or hypoxic 35-day-old rats. Addition of  or linolenic  to washed cells inhibited both aldosterone and corticosterone production, although cells from hypoxic 7-day-old rats were less sensitive. We conclude that hypoxia induces  in the suckling neonate and that elevated nonesterified fatty acids inhibit aldosteronogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201523>Development of an in vitro model to study hepatitis C virus effects on hepatocellular lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is common in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as . However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "metabolic" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of palmitic  (C16:0) or  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with palmitic  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic palmitic and  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with  may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Nonesterified fatty  concentrations were lower up to 3 h after lard and IPO meals than after control or PO meals. Triacylglycerol increased less steeply after lard and IPO meals than after control and PO meals; the incremental AUCs (iAUCs) were 34% (95% CI: 7%, 124%; P < 0.05) and 26% (95% CI: 16%, 132%; P < 0.05) lower after lard than after control and PO meals, respectively. In men, the maximal increment in apolipoprotein B48 was 14% (95% CI: 3%, 25%; P < 0.05) and 16% (95% CI: 2%, 30%; P < 0.05) lower for lard and IPO, respectively, compared with control. The postprandial iAUC in triacylglycerol was 51% lower in women (P = 0.001) than in men. Plasma IL-6 increased postprandially, but IL-8, TNF-α, and E-selectin decreased after all meals.Fats with a higher proportion of palmitic  in the sn-2 position decrease postprandial lipemia in healthy subjects.

The antihyperlipidemic and anti-ulcer activities for both oils were also assayed. The principal fatty  of L. decipiens pulp oil was  (53.4 %) and of L. chinensis pulp oil palmitic  (47.4 %). In relation to anti-hyperlipidemic properties, the pulp oil of L. decipiens presented a better profile than that of L. chinensis, in comparison with the reference standard (simvastatin).

A total of 13 subjects (age range 46-78 years) with an LDL cholesterol concentration >3.36 mmol/l consumed each of four diets for 32-day periods. The diets contained 30% energy as fat of which 2/3 was either corn oil or beef tallow with and without 115 mg/4.2 MJ of supplemental cholesterol in the form of cooked egg yolk. The susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was assessed during a challenge with hemin and hydrogen peroxide, and results are expressed as lag time to oxidation in minutes. Addition of moderate amounts of cholesterol to either the corn oil or beef tallow enriched diet resulted in increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation (decreased lag time): 69+/-22 min versus 96+/-24 min in the corn oil diet with versus without supplemental cholesterol, respectively, P = 0.006; 82+/-20 min versus 96+/-26 min in the beef tallow diet with versus without supplemental cholesterol, respectively, P = 0.025. A stepwise equation indicated that as plasma  concentrations increased and/or linoleic  concentrations decreased, lag time increased (decreased susceptibility to oxidation), whereas as dietary cholesterol concentrations increased, lag time decreased (increased susceptibility to oxidation). In conclusion, these data suggest that addition of a moderate amount of dietary cholesterol to a reduced fat diet rich in polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acids increased the in vitro susceptibility of LDL to oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648399>Human studies using isotope labeled fatty acids: answered and unanswered questions.</a></h2><p>Human studies using deuterium-labeled fatty acids have answered many questions related to the metabolism and health effects of dietary fats. These studies also raised a number of unanswered questions and unresolved issues. For example, studies with cis and trans positional isomers dispelled concerns and allegations that the isomers in partially hydrogenated fats were poorly absorbed, accumulate in undesirable phospholipid acyl positions, mimic stearic  and competed with . Trans 18:1 isomers were metabolically intermediate between 16:0 and 18:0, so the unanswered question is why are the metabolic properties of trans fatty acids not consistent with their physiological effects? Results from ²H-18:0 studies address questions regarding stearic  absorption and desaturation. Contrary to accepted dogma, stearic  was well absorbed and less than 10% was desaturation to . The still unanswered question is what is the metabolic basis for why 18:0 is less hypercholesterolemic than other saturated fatty acids? The question of whether humans convert 18:3n-3 to EPA and DHA was investigated by feeding male subjects a mixture of ²H-18:3n-3 and ²H-18:2n-6. The unequivocal answer was that 18:3n-3 is converted to EPA and DHA and the conversions for 18:3n-3 to 20:5n-3 and 18:2n-6 to 20:4n-6 were about equal. A major issue that remains unresolved is the wide variability between studies for the estimated conversion of 18:3n-3 to 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. The commercial availability of liquid oils hardened by interesterified with 18:0 has raised the question of whether fatty acids in the sn-2 and sn-1,3 TAG positions are metabolically equivalent. To answer this question, subjects were fed triglycerides containing ²H-16:0 and ²H-18:2n-6 at specific sn-1(3) and sn-2 acyl positions. The result was that dietary fatty acids at the sn-1(3) and sn-2 triacylglycerol positions are essentially metabolically equivalent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110815>Protective role of 20-OH ecdysone on lipid profile and tissue fatty  changes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p> is an associated complication of diabetes mellitus. The association of hyperglycemia with an alteration of lipid parameters presents a major risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes. The present study was designed to examine the antihyperlipidemic effect of 20-OH ecdysone on lipid profile and tissue fatty  changes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. The levels of blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, lipoprotein lipase, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase, 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and fatty  composition were estimated in plasma, liver and kidneys of control and experimental groups of rats. Oral administration of 20-OH ecdysone at a dose of 5mg/kg bodyweight per day to STZ-induced diabetic rats for a period of 30 days resulted in a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and elevation of high density lipoprotein, lipoprotein lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferasein comparison with diabetic untreated rats. Moreover, administration of 20-OH ecdysone to diabetic rats also decreased the concentrations of fatty acids, viz., palmitic, stearic (16:1) and  (18:1), whereas linolenic (18:3) and arachidonic  (20:4) were elevated. The antihyperlipidemic effect of 20-OH ecdysone was compared with glibenclamide a well-known antihyperglycemic drug. The result of the present study indicates that 20-OH ecdysone showed an antihyperlipidemic effect in addition to its antidiabetic effect in experimental diabetes.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Rats received one of the six different diets: AIN-93G (control, C); extra virgin olive oil (OO) + C; high- sunflower oil (HOSO) + C or atherogenic diet (AT) for 8 weeks; the remaining two groups received AT for 3 weeks and then, the saturated fat was replaced by an oil mixture of soybean oil added with OO or HOSO for 5 weeks. Rats consuming MUFA-rich diets showed the highest body fat, hepatic index and epididymal, intestinal and perirenal fat, and triglycerides. T-chol and non-HDL-chol were increased in HOSO rats but decreased in OO rats. Bone mineral content and density were higher in both OO and HOSO groups than in AT rats.

Comparing with HFD fed hamsters, WS070117 (2 mg/kg per day and above) reduced serum triglyceride (TAG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride contents. Oil Red O staining of liver tissue also showed that WS070117 improved lipid accumulation. We then carried out an experiment in the  (OLA)-induced steatosis model in HepG2 cell to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of WS070117.  (0.25 mM) markedly induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, but WS070117 (10 μM) inhibited cellular lipid accumulation. In OLA-treated HepG2 cells, WS070117 (above 1 μM) treatment reduced lipid contents which synthesized from [1-(14)C] labeled acetic . Because WS070117 is an analog of adenosine, we evaluated the effect of WS070117 on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. The results showed that the activation of AMPK in OLA-induced steatosis in HepG2 cells was up-regulated by treatment with 0.1, 1 and 10 μM WS070117. The hepatic cellular AMPK phosphorylation is also up regulated by WS070117 (6 and 18 mg/kg) treatment in HFD fed hamsters.These new findings identify WS070117 as a novel molecule that regulates lipid metabolism in the  hamster model. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that WS070117 may regulate lipid metabolism through stimulating the activation of AMPK and its downstream pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16843991>Effects of fat emulsions with different fatty  composition on plasma and hepatic lipids in rats receiving total parenteral nutrition.</a></h2><p>Effects of different fatty acids on the development of hepatic steatosis were studied in rats receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 65 rats, with internal jugular catheters, were divided into one control group (n = 8), and four experimental groups (n = 13-15 each). The control group was fed a chow diet and all experimental groups received TPN. TPN provided 300 kcal/kg/day with 40% of the non-protein energy provided as fat. All TPN solutions were isonitrogenous and identical in nutrient composition except for the fatty  composition of the fat emulsion. Four kinds of fat emulsions rich in: 1) medium chain fatty acids (C8:0,C10:0), 2)  (C18:1 n-9), 3) linoleic  (C18:2 n-6), 4) eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3)/docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3), were used. These fat emulsions were prepared with: 1) a mixture of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and soybean oil (9:1), 2) olive oil, 3) safflower oil, 4) fish oil, respectively. The results of the study demonstrated a higher hepatic lipid content in the olive oil and safflower oil groups than in the control group, whereas no significant difference was seen between the MCT and control groups. Also, no difference was observed between the fish oil and control groups. With regard to the plasma lipids, the MCT group and olive oil group produced . The plasma of the safflower oil and fish oil groups, however, had a low lipid concentration comparable to the control group.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the proatherogenic effect of TFA has not been completely elucidated. To obtain better understanding of the impact of TFA on vascular diseases, this study investigated the effect of TFA on oxidative stress using a mouse model of atherosclerosis.Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor knockout mice were fed with diet containing 0.5% cholesterol (control), 0.5% cholesterol+5% elaidic acids (Trans group), and 0.5% cholesterol+5%  acids (Cis group) for 8 weeks. Atherosclerotic lesion and oxidative stress in aortic wall were evaluated. In vitro experiments using smooth muscle cells were performed to corroborate in vivo findings.The atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly larger in Trans group than that in control or Cis group. Lipoprotein fractionation was similar among groups, while plasma oxidized LDL level and superoxide production in the vessel wall were markedly increased in Trans group. Elaidic acids were accumulated in a variety of tissues including liver and adipose tissue, which was associated with the high level of inflammatory cytokines in these tissues and plasma. Aortic wall from Trans group showed augmented expression of reactive oxygen species and NAPDH oxidase (p22phox) in smooth muscle cells. In vitro experiments confirmed that elaidic acids upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase and inflammatory cytokines in cultured smooth muscle cells.Excessive intake of TFA contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis by evoking inflammation and oxidative stress in mice.Copyright © 2017 Japanese College of Cardiology.

Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) are closely associated with blood lipid metabolism as well as many diseases including metabolic syndrome. This study is to investigate whether mangiferin has effects on FFA metabolism in hyperlipidemic rats. Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet and administered mangiferin simultaneously for 6 weeks. Mangiferin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg BW) decreased dose-dependently FFA and triglycerides (TG) levels in plasma, and their accumulations in liver, but increased the β-hydroxybutyrate levels in both plasma and liver of hyperlipidemic rats. HepG2 cells were treated with  (OA, 0.2 mmol/L) to simulate the condition of high level of plasma FFA in vitro, and were treated with different concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h. We found that mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake, significantly decreased intracellular FFA and TG accumulations in HepG2 cells. Mangiferin significantly increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and its downstream proteins involved in fatty  translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), but significantly decreased acyl-CoA: diacylgycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) expression and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity by increasing its phosphorylation level in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Furthermore, these effects were reversed by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor in HepG2 cells. For upstream of AMPK, mangiferin increased AMP/ATP ratio, but had no effect on LKB1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, mangiferin decreased plasma FFA levels through promoting FFA uptake and oxidation, inhibiting FFA and TG accumulations by regulating the key enzymes expression in liver through AMPK pathway. Therefore, mangiferin is a possible beneficial natural compound for metabolic syndrome by improving FFA metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16782068>Palmitic -induced activation of human T-lymphocytes and aortic endothelial cells with production of insulin receptors, reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Diabetic conditions are associated with hyperglycemia and , but the role of saturated fatty acids (SFA) vs. unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in activation of T-lymphocytes and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) is not known.

Hypercholesterolemia has been associated with enhanced in vitro oxidation of LDL, and lipid-lowering therapy reduces LDL oxidizability. In the present study, we investigated whether LDL apheresis performed with different techniques affects in vitro diene formation (lag phase) and modification of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB). Baseline and posttreatment diene formation was correlated with the baseline pattern of plasma total fatty acids. We then performed a computer-simulation study to test the hypothesis that LDL apheresis-induced changes in LDL oxidizability are related to changes in the mass ratio between freshly produced and older LDL. In 19 patients aged 49+/-7 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) regularly treated with either immunoadsorption, heparin-induced LDL precipitation (HELP), or dextran sulfate (DS) adsorption, we determined lipoprotein levels, the lag phase, apoB modification, and the fatty  pattern in plasma samples drawn at the onset and termination of one LDL apheresis. LDL apheresis significantly decreased total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides by 50.4%, 14.9%, 62.6%, and 33.6%, respectively. The lag phase increased by a significant mean of 9.8%; the charge of apoB was not altered. The lag phase before treatment positively correlated with the baseline concentration of plasma total palmitic, myristic, and . The increase in the lag phase during treatment correlated with a high pretreatment concentration of lauric, linoleic, and docosahexanoic . The simulation study indicates that a temporary imbalance between two LDL compartments, one representing freshly secreted LDL and the other representing older LDL, could explain the observed increase in the lag phase after LDL apheresis. In conclusion, in patients with heterozygous FH, LDL apheresis performed with different techniques decreases the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. This decrease may be related to a temporary mass imbalance between freshly produced and older LDL particles. Furthermore, the baseline fatty  pattern influences pretreatment and posttreatment susceptibility to oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21711508>Postprandial lipid responses to an alpha-linolenic -rich oil, olive oil and butter in women: a randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Postprandial lipaemia varies with gender and the composition of dietary fat due to the partitioning of fatty acids between beta-oxidation and incorporation into triacylglycerols (TAGs). Increasing evidence highlights the importance of postprandial measurements to evaluate atherogenic risk. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic  (ALA) in women are poorly characterized. We therefore studied the postprandial lipid response of women to an ALA-rich oil in comparison with olive oil and butter, and characterized the fatty  composition of total lipids, TAGs, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in plasma.A randomized crossover design (n = 19) was used to compare the postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g fat. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals for 7 h. Statistical analysis was carried out with ANOVA (significant difference = P < 0.05).No significant difference was seen in incremental area under the curve (iAUC) plasma-TAG between the meals. ALA and  levels were significantly increased in plasma after ALA-rich oil and olive oil meals, respectively. Palmitic  was significantly increased in plasma-TAG after the butter meal. The ratios of 18:2 n-6 to18:3 n-3 in plasma-TAGs, three and seven hours after the ALA-rich oil meal, were 1.5 and 2.4, respectively. The corresponding values after the olive oil meal were: 13.8 and 16.9; and after the butter meal: 9.0 and 11.6.The postprandial p-TAG and NEFA response in healthy pre-menopausal women was not significantly different after the intake of an ALA-rich oil, olive oil and butter.

This impairment can be simulated in vitro by chronic culture of 832/13 insulinoma cells with high concentrations of free fatty acids, or by study of lipid-laden islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Here we show that impaired GSIS is not a simple result of saturation of lipid storage pathways, as adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a cytosolically localized variant of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in either cellular model results in dramatic lowering of cellular triglyceride stores but no improvement in GSIS. Instead, the glucose-induced increment in "pyruvate cycling" activity (pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates measured by (13)C NMR), previously shown to play an important role in GSIS, is completely ablated in concert with profound suppression of GSIS in lipid-cultured 832/13 cells, whereas glucose oxidation is unaffected. Moreover, GSIS is partially restored in both lipid-cultured 832/13 cells and islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats by addition of a membrane permeant ester of a pyruvate cycling intermediate (dimethyl malate). We conclude that chronic exposure of islet beta-cells to fatty acids grossly alters a mitochondrial pathway of pyruvate metabolism that is important for normal GSIS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130822>High-fat diet-dependent modulation of the delayed rectifier K(+) current in adult guinea pig atrial myocytes.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with , electrical remodeling of the heart, and increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmias in both male and female patients. The delayed rectifier K(+) current (IK), is an important regulator of atrial repolarization. There is a paucity of studies on the functional role of IK in response to obesity. Here, we assessed the obesity-mediated functional modulation of IK in low-fat diet (LFD), and high-fat diet (HFD) fed adult guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were randomly divided into control and obese groups fed, ad libitum, with a LFD (10 kcal% fat) or a HFD (45 kcal% fat) respectively. Action potential duration (APD), and IK were studied in atrial myocytes and IKr and IKs in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. HFD guinea pigs displayed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol and total triglycerides within 50 days. Atrial APD at 30% (APD30) and 90% (APD90) repolarization were shorter, while atrial IK density was significantly increased in HFD guinea pigs. Exposure to palmitic  (PA) increased heterologously expressed IKr and IKs densities, while  (OA), severely reduced IKr and had no effect on IKs. The data are first to show that in obese guinea pigs abbreviated APD is due to increased IK density likely through elevations of PA.

(HDT) was known to have anti-fatigue, anti-diabetes, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective effects. In the present study, the anti-fatty liver mechanism of HDT was elucidated in  (OA)-treated Hep G2 cells and acute  mouse model using Triton WR-1339. Here, HDT activated p-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), proliferator activated receptor-α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase and also inhibited the expression of lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis proteins, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, SREBP-2, and fatty  synthase in OA-treated Hep G2 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C blocked the anti-fatty liver effect of HDT to induce AMPK phosphorylation and decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and lipid accumulation by oil red O staining in OA-treated Hep G2 cells. Additionally, HDT pretreatment protected against the increase of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in an acute  mouse model with enhancement of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities. Taken together, HDT inhibits OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation via activation of AMPK and proliferator activated receptor-α/carnitine palmitoyltransferase signaling and enhancement of antioxidant activity as a potent candidate for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and .Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27126072>Hepatosteatosis and estrogen increase apolipoprotein O production in the chicken.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a recently discovered plasma apolipoprotein that may also play a role in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Possibly due to this complexity, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. To gain insight from a non-mammalian experimental system, we have investigated the regulation of ApoO levels in an alternative, well-suited model for studies on lipid metabolism, the chicken. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with our rabbit anti-chicken ApoO antiserum demonstrated ApoO in the liver of chickens fed a control or a fat-enriched diet, as well as in 2 chicken hepatoma cell lines, LMH cells and the estrogen-responsive LMH-2A cells, under conditions of lipid loading by incubation with BSA-complexed . Induced triglyceride accumulation in both the liver and the hepatic cells was associated with significantly increased levels of ApoO mRNA and protein. Furthermore, upon treatment for 24 h with estrogen of the estrogen receptor-expressing LMH-2A cells, quantitative analysis of ApoO transcripts and Western blotting revealed increases of ApoO expression. Finally, upon a single administration of estrogen to roosters that leads to , higher hepatic levels of both ApoO transcript and protein were observed within 24 h. Based on these data, we propose that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones. The findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Compared to statins, SQS inhibitors have shown a very significant lipid-lowering effect and do not cause myotoxicity. Thus, the paper aims to discover potential SQS inhibitors from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by the combination of molecular modeling methods and biological assays. In this study, cynarin was selected as a potential SQS inhibitor candidate compound based on its pharmacophoric properties, molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Cynarin could form hydrophobic interactions with PHE54, LEU211, LEU183 and PRO292, which are regarded as important interactions for the SQS inhibitors. In addition, the lipid-lowering effect of cynarin was tested in sodium oleate-induced HepG2 cells by decreasing the lipidemic parameter triglyceride (TG) level by 22.50%. Finally. cynarin was reversely screened against other anti- targets which existed in HepG2 cells and cynarin was unable to map with the pharmacophore of these targets, which indicated that the lipid-lowering effects of cynarin might be due to the inhibition of SQS.

Male OLETF rats were fed powdered chow (510 g fat/kg) alone (n 8) or chow supplemented with 10 g EPA- (n 8) or OA- (n 8) rich oil/kg per d from 5 weeks until 30 weeks of age. An oral glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp was performed at 25 and 30 weeks of age. EPA supplementation resulted in significantly (P<0.05) reduced plasma lipids, hepatic triacylglycerols, and abdominal fat deposits, and more efficient in vivo glucose disposal compared with OA supplementation and no supplementation. OA supplementation was associated with significantly increased insulin response to oral glucose compared with EPA supplementation and no supplementation. Inverse correlation was noted between glucose uptake and plasma triacylglycerol levels (r -086, P<0.001) and abdominal fat volume (r -0.80, P<0.001). The result of oral glucose tolerance test study showed that the rats fed EPA tended to improve glucose intolerance, although this was not statistically significant. Levels of plasma insulin at 60 min after glucose was significantly increased in rats fed OA compared with the other two groups. The results indicate that long-term feeding of EPA might be effective in preventing insulin resistance in diabetes-prone rats, at least in part, due to improving hypertriacylglycerolaemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534819>Ginsenoside Rb2 Alleviates Hepatic Lipid Accumulation by Restoring Autophagy via Induction of Sirt1 and Activation of AMPK.</a></h2><p>Although Panax ginseng is a famous traditional Chinese medicine and has been widely used to treat a variety of metabolic diseases including hyperglycemia, , and hepatosteatosis, the effective mediators and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study we found that ginsenoside Rb2, one of the major ginsenosides in Panax ginseng, was able to prevent hepatic lipid accumulation through autophagy induction both in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of male db/db mice with Rb2 significantly improved glucose tolerance, decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, and restored hepatic autophagy. In vitro, Rb2 (50 µmol/L) obviously increased autophagic flux in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes, and consequently reduced the lipid accumulation induced by  in combination with high glucose. Western blotting analysis showed that Rb2 partly reversed the high fatty  in combination with high glucose (OA)-induced repression of autophagic pathways including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and silent information regulator 1 (sirt1). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the sirt1 or AMPK pathways attenuated these beneficial effects of Rb2 on hepatic autophagy and lipid accumulation. Taken together, these results suggested that Rb2 alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation by restoring autophagy via the induction of sirt1 and activation of AMPK, and resulted in improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and glucose tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26620373>Docosahexaenoic  Attenuates Cardiovascular Risk Factors via a Decline in Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) Plasma Levels.</a></h2><p>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a circulating protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism by promoting LDL receptor degradation in the liver and has recently been proposed as a therapeutic target in the management of . We investigated the impact of dietary fat on the metabolism of sterols and on plasma PCSK9 concentrations to explore likely clinical usefulness. In a post hoc analysis of a double-blind randomised crossover controlled feeding trial, the Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial (COMIT), volunteers (n = 54) with at least one condition related to metabolic syndrome consumed diets with one of the following treatment oils in beverages: (1) conventional canola oil (Canola); (2) canola oil rich in docosahexanoic  (DHA) (CanolaDHA); and (3) high- canola oil (CanolaOleic). The enrichment in  resulted in lower plasma cholesterol concentration compared with diets enriched in DHA. Contrarily, DHA-enriched oil significantly decreased plasma PCSK9 and triacylglycerols levels, but increased circulating levels of sterols. The variations in lathosterol, sitosterol, and campesterol indicate that plasma PCSK9 levels are sensitive to changes in cholesterol synthesis and/or absorption. There was a significant correlation between plasma PCSK9 levels and plasma triacylglicerol and apolipoprotein B levels, which was not affected by dietary fat. Therefore, our results suggest that the impact of dietary fats should not be discarded as complementary treatment in the management of patients with .

Using cultured human and rat hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice, we demonstrate that protease inhibitor treatment inhibits proteasomal degradation of nascent apolipoprotein B, the principal protein component of triglyceride and cholesterol-rich plasma lipoproteins. Unexpectedly, protease inhibitors also inhibited the secretion of apolipoprotein B.

One of the expected outcomes is a positive impact on the lipoprotein spectrum, but also other benefits are to be expected.The analysis was conducted on 28 outpatients older than 50 years of age (mean age 68.1, 95%CI 64.9-71.3). The supplement was taken for 6 weeks and involved daily consumption of 2 tablespoons (approx. 20 g) of extra-virgin olive oil as part of the subjects' habitual diets, without changing their usual total energy and fat c onsumption. This phase was followed by a 2-month wash-out.After dietary supplementation with olive oil, serum total- and LDL-cholesterol mean concentrations were lowered by 0.818 mmol/l (p<0.00002; 95% CI -1.142 to -0.493 mmol/l) and 0.782 mmol/l (p=0.00013; 95% CI -1.141 to -0.423 mmol/l), respectively. There was also a significant decline in the total-to-HDL and LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratios (p<0.03 and p<0.015). Linolic and ar achidonic  content in serum phospholipids decreased significantly (p<0.01 andcl p<0.001, respectively). The n-3 PUFAs were not affected.These results point to an overwhelmingly beneficial influence of olive oil on the lipoprotein spectrum.

This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of MG against  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammatory damage in HepG2 cells and in a tyloxapol (Ty)-induced  mouse model. Our findings indicated that MG can effectively inhibit OA-stimulated tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion, reactive oxygen species generation, and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Further study manifested that MG significantly suppressed OA-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways and that these inflammatory responses can be negated by pretreatment with inhibitors of extracellular regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (U0126 and SP600125, respectively). In addition, MG dramatically upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) translocation and reduced sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) protein synthesis and excretion, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and AKT kinase (AKT). However, MG suspended the activation of PPARα expression and was thus blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 and compound c (specific inhibitors of AKT and AMPK). Furthermore, MG clearly alleviated serum TG and total cholesterol release; upregulated AKT, AMPK, and PPARα expression; suppressed SREBP-1c generation; and alleviated hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia in Ty-induced  mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MG exerts protective effects against steatosis, , and the underlying mechanism, which may be closely associated with AKT/AMPK/PPARα activation and MAPK/NF-κB/SREBP-1c inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327761>Distinctive roles of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>To investigate how the saturated and unsaturated fatty  composition influences the susceptibility of developing acute pancreatitis.Primary pancreatic acinar cells were treated with low and high concentrations of different saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and changes in the cytosolic Ca(2+) signal and the expression of protein kinase C (PKC) were measured after treatment.Unsaturated fatty acids at high concentrations, including , linoleic , palmitoleic , docosahexaenoic , and arachidonic , induced a persistent rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations in acinar cells.

We did this using four types of size-calibrated (10 μm diameter) and metastable (3 days) emulsions with 20% of an -rich sunflower oil and 1% of either synthetic emulsifiers (Tween 80 or sodium 2-stearoyl-lactylate) or two proteins (β-lactoglobulin or sodium caseinate). An oral fat tolerance test was performed in fasted rats by oral administration of each of these formulations in continuous or emulsified forms. Kinetic parameters (AUC, AUC, C, T, and T) for the description of the plasma triacylglycerol responses were calculated. AUC and AUC calculated for the protein groups were significantly lower than those of the control and the synthetic groups. These lower values were associated with significant decreases in the C, exacerbated by the emulsion form and with marked decreases in the T as compared to the control group. T values were differentially affected by the lipid administration forms and by the nature of the emulsifiers. As compared with the control group, T was largely increased in the sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate group, but on the contrary, largely lowered in the casein group. We concluded that the use of proteins as natural emulsifiers in lipid emulsions decreased the magnitude of post-prandial triacylglycerolemia for the same amount of ingested lipids, when the emulsion size is controlled for. Proteins could be a promising alternative to the widespread use of synthetic emulsifiers in the food industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646799>Effects of ferulic  and γ-oryzanol on high-fat and high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.</a></h2><p>The high morbidity of metabolic dysfunction diseases has heightened interest in seeking natural and safe compounds to maintain optimal health. γ-Oryzanol (OZ), the ferulic  (FA) ester with phytosterols, mainly present in rice bran has been shown to improve markers of metabolic syndrome. This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced metabolic syndrome parameters.Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in -stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and lipogenesis-related gene expressions.In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, , hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect.OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Thus, FA and OZ could be used as dietary supplements to alleviate the deleterious effects of HFFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609924>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and phytocomponent investigation of Basella alba leaf extract as a treatment for hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol.

Our previous studies have shown that the n-butanol extract of PTF is rich in caffeoylquinic acids and has an adequate therapeutic effect on dyslipidemic animals induced by high-fat diet. In this work, seven caffeoylquinic acids isolated from PTF were screened for the lipid-lowering activity in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Oil-Red O staining, microscopy and intracellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) quantification showed that 3-O-caffeoylquinic  (3-CQA), 3, 5-di-O-caffeoylquinic  (3,5-CQA), and 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic  (3,4,5-CQA) significantly inhibited lipid accumulation induced by  and decreased intracellular levels of TC and TG in a dose-dependent manner. These three caffeoylquinic acids showed no significant cytotoxicity at concentrations of 1 -50 μmol x L(-1) as determined by MTT assay.

We examined HL-regulated GLUT4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma gene expression in human cardiac muscle. Compared with control patients, GLUT4 protein levels were 30% lower in human cardiac muscle biopsies from patients with HL and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas GLUT4 mRNA levels were unchanged. PPARgamma mRNA levels were 30-50% lower in patients with HL and/or diabetes mellitus type 2 than in controls. Reporter studies in H9C2 cardiomyotubes showed that HL in vitro, induced by high levels of arachidonic (AA) stearic, linoleic, and  acids (24 h, 200 mum) repressed transcription from the GLUT4 promoter; AA also repressed transcription from the PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2 promoters. Co-expression of PPARgamma2 repressed GLUT4 promoter activity, and the addition of AA further enhanced this effect. 5'-Deletion analysis revealed three GLUT4 promoter regions that accounted for AA-mediated effects: two repression-mediating sequences at -443/-423 bp and -222/-197 bp, the deletion of either or both of which led to a partial derepression of promoter activity, and a third derepression-mediating sequence at -612/-587 bp that was required for sustaining this derepression effect. Electromobility shift assay further shows that AA enhanced binding to two of the three regions of cardiac nuclear protein(s), the nature of which is still unknown. We propose that HL, exhibited as a high free fatty  level, modulates GLUT4 gene expression in cardiac muscle via a complex mechanism that includes: (a) binding of AA mediator proteins to three newly identified response elements on the GLUT4 promoter gene and (b) repression of GLUT4 and the PPARgamma genes by AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14697232>Increased expression and activity of 11beta-HSD-1 in diabetic islets and prevention with troglitazone.</a></h2><p>To determine if increased local production of glucocorticoids by the pancreatic islets might play a role in the spontaneous noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of obesity, we compared islet 11beta-HSD-1 mRNA and activity in islets of obese prediabetic and diabetic Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) (fa/fa) rats and lean wild-type (+/+) controls.

We conclude that 11beta-HSD-1 expression and activity are increased in islets of diabetic, but not prediabetic ZDF rats, and that TGZ prevents both the increase in 11beta-HSD-1 and the diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919362>The effect of omega-3 carboxylic acids on apolipoprotein CIII-containing lipoproteins in severe hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>Lipoprotein subspecies containing apoCIII adversely affect cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; for example, low density lipoprotein (LDL) with apoCIII is a stronger CVD predictor than LDL without apoCIII. The Epanova for Lowering Very High Triglycerides (EVOLVE) trial showed that Epanova (omega-3 carboxylic acids [OM3-CA]) significantly lowered TG and apoCIII but raised LDL-C. However, it is unknown what subspecies of LDL were affected by treatment.To determine how lipoprotein subspecies are affected by omega-3 fatty  treatment, we studied the effect of OM3-CA on apoCIII concentrations in high density lipoprotein (HDL), LDL, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and on the concentrations of subspecies of HDL, LDL, and VLDL that contain or do not contain apoCIII.We analyzed plasma from a subset of subjects from the EVOLVE trial, a 12-week double-blind study of 399 subjects with fasting TG of 500 to 2000 mg/dL who were randomized to OM3-CA 2, 3, or 4 g/d or olive oil (placebo).OM3-CA significantly reduced plasma apoCIII relative to placebo, as well as apoCIII in HDL, and apoCIII in LDL. Treatment did not significantly affect the concentration of LDL with apoCIII, a subspecies highly associated with CVD risk. OM3-CA increased selectively the concentration of LDL that does not contain apoCIII, a subspecies with a weak relation to coronary heart disease. The reduction in apoCIII was associated with plasma increases in eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic , and arachidonic  and decreases in linoleic, palmitic, and  acids.Reduction in apoCIII may be a mechanism for the TG-lowering effects of OM3-CA. The increase in LDL-C seen in the EVOLVE trial may not be associated with increased risk of CVD.Copyright Â© 2016 National Lipid Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thus, suppressing CD73 may attenuate AS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CD73 during AS development and further explored cellular and molecular mechanism in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In a mouse model of carotid artery ligation, inactivation of CD73 inhibited migration and proliferation of vascular SMCs. In in vitro experiments, RNA interference of CD73 inhibited migration, proliferation, and foam cell transformation of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells. Further, we established an atherosclerotic model using ApoE-/- mice fed with a western diet for 16 weeks. Inactivation of CD73-attenuated AS and  in ApoE-/- mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD73 facilitates AS by promoting migration, proliferation, and foam cell transformation of vascular SMCs and elevating serum lipid levels. Thus, inhibition of CD73 may be beneficial for prevention and treatment of AS.© 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977920>Untargeted Metabolite Profiling of Adipose Tissue in  Rats Exposed to Hawthorn Ethanol Extracts.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to explore the metabolic changes of adipose tissue of  rats with hawthorn ethanol extracts (HEE) consumption by a high-throughput metabolomics approach. HEE were mainly composed of chlorogenic , hyperoside, isoquercitrin, rutin, vitexin, quercetin, and apigenin by HPLC analysis. HEE administration significantly lowered levels of the total cholesterols, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as compared to the high-fat diet model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify adipose metabolite profiles. Numerous endogenous molecules were altered by high-fat diet and restored following intervention of HEE. Metabolites elevated in adipose, including l-threonine, aspartic , glutamine, mannose, inositol and , were detected after HEE consumption. Fifteen metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of . Pathway analysis showed that most of the discriminant metabolites were included in fatty  biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arginine and proline metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and steroid biosynthesis. These metabolites and metabolic networks we found offer new insights into exploring the molecular mechanisms of lipid-lowering of hawthorn ethanol extracts on adipose tissue of rats.

This effect was inhibited by heparin and anti-BSDL antibodies, whereas heat-denaturated and diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated BSDL were inefficient. The mitogenic effect of BSDL was associated with an activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which was inhibited by heparin, and involved several mechanisms, among them diacylglycerol and  production as well as a rapid basic fibroblast growth factor release.Circulating BSDL is associated with SMCs within the intimal arteria and may trigger SMC proliferation, which could contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10512366>Palmitate and oleate induce the immediate-early response genes c-fos and nur-77 in the pancreatic beta-cell line INS-1.</a></h2><p>To better understand the link between fatty  signaling and the pleiotropic effects of fatty acids in the pancreatic beta-cell, we investigated whether fatty acids regulate immediate-early response genes (IEGs) coding for transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Palmitate and oleate, but not long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, caused a pronounced accumulation of c-fos and nur-77 mRNAs in beta-cells (INS cells) to an extent similar to that produced by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The effect was dose dependent and occurred at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/l in the presence of 0.5% albumin. The action of the fatty  occurred at the transcriptional level, and the mRNA accumulation displayed a bell-shaped kinetics with a maximal effect at 1 h. 2-Bromopalmitate was ineffective, indicating that fatty acids must be metabolized to cause their effect. Neither fatty  was able to induce c-fos and nur-77 in PKC-downregulated cells or cells incubated in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, suggesting involvement of the PKC and Ca2+ signaling pathways. Palmitate and oleate also increased c-fos protein expression and DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1. Oleate, but not palmitate, increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS cells. Finally, both palmitate and oleate caused c-fos and nur-77 mRNA accumulation in isolated rat islets. It is suggested that IEG induction by the most abundant circulating fatty acids plays a role in the adaptive process of the beta-cell to .

Oral administration of OKGK at 0.69 or 1.38 g/kg/day significantly reduced the increase of serum triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL). OKGK given as a nutritional supplement (1.25%) in the diet significantly suppressed the increase of serum TG and PL in rats with hypercholesterolemia induced by a cholesterol and fat-enriched diet. These results suggest the effectiveness of OKGK in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia induced by both endogenous and exogenous TG. The mechanism by which OKGK shows antihy-pertriglyceridemic action was investigated in detail. OKGK decreased [(14)C] acetic  incorporation into TG and PL but not fatty acids in primary cultured rat hepatocytes from rats treated with oral OKGK for 1 week. OKGK also reduced [(3)H]  into TG and PL, suggesting OKGK suppresses TG and PL syntheses in the liver. Furthermore, OKGK enhanced the activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic TG lipase (HTGL) in postheparin plasma. These results suggest OKGK inhibits triglyceride synthesis in the liver and stimulates the hydrolysis of TG in lipoprotein.Copyright Â© 1997 Gustav Fischer Verlag. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The aim of this study was to assess the individual relationship between dietary saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids with postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides. We assessed postprandial β-cell function (by the insulinogenic index and the ratio of the insulin to glucose areas under the time-concentration curve) and insulin sensitivity (by the oral glucose and the minimal model insulin sensitivity indices) over four nonconsecutive, randomly assigned, high-fat meals containing a panel of SFA (palmitic and stearic acids), MUFA (palmitoleic and  acids) and PUFA (linoleic and α-linolenic acids) in 14 subjects with normal and in 14 subjects with high fasting triglycerides. The proportions of each fatty  in the meals and the values for surrogate measures of postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity were subjected to a Pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis, which revealed two classes of dietary fatty acids for regulating postprandial glucose homeostasis. We successfully discriminated the adverse effects of SFA palmitic  from the beneficial effects of MUFA  on postprandial β-cell function (r ≥ 0.84 for SFA palmitic  and r ≥ -0.71 for MUFA ; P < 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (r ≥ -0.92 for SFA palmitic  and r ≥ 0.89 for MUFA ; P < 0.001) both in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides. In conclusion, dietary MUFA , in contrast to SFA palmitic , favours the tuning towards better postprandial glycaemic control in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561632>Vaccenic  and trans fatty  isomers from partially hydrogenated oil both adversely affect LDL cholesterol: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Adverse effects of industrially produced trans fatty acids (iTFAs) on the risk of coronary artery disease are well documented in the scientific literature; however, effects of naturally occurring trans fatty acids (TFAs) from ruminant animals (rTFA), such as vaccenic  (VA) and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11-CLA), are less clear. Although animal and cell studies suggest that VA and c9,t11-CLA may be hypocholesterolemic and antiatherogenic, epidemiologic data comparing rTFAs and iTFAs are inconsistent, and human intervention studies have been limited, underpowered, and not well controlled.We determined the effects of VA, c9,t11-CLA, and iTFA, in the context of highly controlled diets (24 d each), on lipoprotein risk factors compared with a control diet.We conducted a double-blind, randomized, crossover feeding trial in 106 healthy adults [mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10.8 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 28.5 ± 4.0; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 3.24 ± 0.63 mmol/L]. Diets were designed to have stearic  replaced with the following TFA isomers (percentage of energy): 0.1% mixed isomers of TFA (control), ∼3% VA, ∼3% iTFA, or 1% c9,t11-CLA. Total dietary fat (34% of energy) and other macronutrients were matched. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein B were higher after VA than after iTFA; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI also were higher after VA. Compared with control, VA and iTFA both increased TC, LDL cholesterol, ratio of TC to HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (2-6% change; P < 0.05); VA also increased HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a) (2-6% change; P < 0.05), whereas iTFA did not. c9,t11-CLA lowered triacylglycerol (P ≤ 0.01) and had no effect on other lipoprotein risk factors.With respect to risk of cardiovascular disease, these results are consistent with current nutrition labeling guidelines, with the requirement of VA, but not c9,t11-CLA, to be listed under TFA on the Nutrition Facts Panel.

However, currently no pharmacological agents have been established for the treatment of NAFLD. In this regard, we sought to evaluate the anti-NAFLD effects of Aralia elata (Miq) Seem (AE) extract and its ability to inhibit hepatic lipid accumulation and modulate cellular signaling in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model.A model of hepatic steatosis in the HepG2 cells was induced by . Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red-O staining, and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), Fatty  synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 and 2, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT-1) was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). And glucose consumption was measured with commercial kit. Furthermore, Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with HFD to induce NAFLD. Groups of mice were given plant extracts orally at 100 and 300 mg/kg at daily for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks of AE extract treatment, we performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Liver tissue was procured for histological examination, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity.In the present study, AE extract was shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and significantly downregulate the level of lipogenic genes and upregulate the expression of lipolysis genes in HepG2 cells. And also, AE extract significantly increased the glucose consumption, indicating that AE extract improved insulin resistance. Subsequently, we confirmed the inhibitory activity of AE extract on NAFLD, in vivo. Treatment with AE extract significantly decreased body weight and the fasting glucose level, alleviated hyperinsulinism and , and reduced glucose levels, as determined by OGTT. Additionally, AE extract decreased PI3K and Akt activity.Our results suggest that treatment with AE extract ameliorated NAFLD by inhibiting insulin resistance through activation of the Akt/GLUT4 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12716474>Free fatty  overload attenuates Ca2+ signaling and NO production in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p> represents a major risk factor for development of vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Although the unfortunate role of low-density lipoprotein has been clearly demonstrated, the mechanistic pathways through which triglyceride-derived free fatty acids (FFAs) contribute to vascular disorders are not completely understood. Thus, the present study was designed to elucidate the effects of FFAs on cultured endothelial cells. The Ca(2+) signaling, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and production of superoxide anions (.O(2)(-)) were monitored in cells treated with bovine serum albumin-conjugated FFA. FFA-loaded cells showed enhanced intracellular Ca(2+) release in response to ATP, histamine, or the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin. This effect corresponded to an overall increase in intracellularly stored Ca(2+). In contrast, autacoid-triggered elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration was blunted in FFA-loaded cells due to inhibition of capacitative Ca(2+) entry. In agreement with the reduced Ca(2+) signaling, the Ca(2+)-dependent activity of eNOS was reduced under basal conditions and if cells were stimulated with ATP, histamine, or thapsigargin. The attenuated eNOS activity was associated with.O(2)(-) release in FFA-loaded cells. These data indicate that FFAs significantly affect endothelial Ca(2+) signaling, eNOS activity, and.O(2)(-) release and, thus, might contribute to vascular dysfunction in atherogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393219>Chylomicron metabolism in an animal model for hyperlipoproteinemia type I.</a></h2><p>Mink homozygous for the mutation Pro214Leu in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) had only traces of LPL activity but amounts of LPL protein in their tissues similar to those of normal mink. In normal mink, lymph chylomicrons from rats given [3H]retinol (incorporated into retinyl esters, providing a core label) and [14C] (incorporated mainly in triglycerides (TG)) were rapidly cleared from the circulation. In the homozygous mink, clearance was much retarded. The ratio of TG to core label in plasma did not decrease and much less [14C] appeared in plasma. Still, half of the labeled material disappeared from the circulating blood within 30;-40 min and the calculated total turnover of TG in the hypertriglyceridemic mink was almost as large as in normal mink. The core label was distributed to the same tissues in hypertriglyceridemic mink as in normal mink. Half to two-thirds of the cleared core label was in the liver. The large difference was that in the hypertriglyceridemic mink, TG label (about 40% of the total amount removed) followed the core label to the liver and there was no preferential uptake of TG over core label in adipose or muscle tissue. In normal mink, only small amounts of TG label (<10%) appeared in the liver, while most was in adipose and muscle tissues.

Delile is used as a traditional anti-diabetic remedy in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and is mentioned in Ayurveda as well.The objective of the study was to evaluate the ethnomedicinal claim of A. nilotica leaf (ANL) extract for its efficiency in ameliorating diabetic complications.ANL was orally administrated (50 and 200mg/kg) to alloxanized mice (blood glucose > 200mg/dL) for 20d. Parameters of glucose metabolism, hepatotoxicity,  and nephrotoxicity were measured with emphasis on elevated oxidative stress. ANL was chemically characterized using GC-MS. Further, docking studies were employed to predict molecular interactions.ANL lowered (65%, P< 0.001) systemic glucose load in diabetic mice, which was otherwise 398% higher than control. ANL lowered (35%) insulin resistance, without any significant effect on insulin sensitivity (P> 0.05). Anti-hyperglycemic properties of ANL was further supported by lowering of HbA1c (34%; P< 0.001) and improved glucose utilization (OGTT). Overall diabetic complications were mitigated as reflected by lowered hepatic (ALT, AST) and renal (creatinine, BUN) injury markers and normalization of dyslipidemia. Elevated systemic oxidative stress was lowered by increased catalase and peroxidase activities in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, resulting in 32% decrease of serum MDA levels. Apart from high phenolic and flavonoid content, tocopherol, catechol and β-sitosterol, identified in ANL, demonstrated substantial binding affinity with Nrf2 protein (5FNQ) reflecting possible crosstalk with intracellular antioxidant defense pathways.The present study revealed the potentials of A. nilotica to alleviate diabetes-related systemic complications by limiting oxidative stress which justified the ethnopharmacological antidiabetic claim.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 26 patients (mean age 69 years) with combined  consumed daily 2 table spoons (approx. 20 g) of extra virgin olive oil for 6 weeks. Plasma lipids, total antioxidant capacity, indices of serum lipid oxidizability (lag time and maximal rate of oxidation) and the content of fatty acids in serum phospholipids were determined before and after dietary supplementation with olive oil. Plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after 6 weeks of dietary intervention. A significant increase in the lag time of conjugated diene formation (p = 0.026) and the decrease in the rate of lipid oxidation (p = 0.030) were observed after olive oil consumption. The changes in the fatty  profile were characterized by an increase in  content (p = 0.005) as well as by a decline in the content of linoleic  (p = 0.020) and arachidonic  (p = 0.022). Linear regression analysis revealed some interesting and significant correlations between indices of serum lipid resistance to oxidation and individual fatty acids, suggesting a protective effects of olive oil in lipoprotein oxidation. In conclusion, the daily consumption of extra virgin olive oil in elderly lipidemic patients favourably affected serum lipoprotein spectrum and fatty  composition that probably contributed to the increased resistance of serum lipids to oxidation.

Subgroups of rats from these groups were treated with eicosapentaenoic -E (EPA) or docosahexaenoic -95E (DHA) for 5 weeks. Although plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were higher in each group fed the HC diet versus each group fed the C diet, EPA administration with the HC diet (HC + EPA) significantly (P < .05) reduced these levels. An isolated working-heart preparation was used to determine cardiac function. Cardiac output (CO) was lower in rats fed the HC diet and HC + DHA versus any of the groups fed the C diet (P < .05). In addition, left ventricular (LV) maximum differentiation of pressure-time curve (dp/dt) was lower in the rats fed the HC diet versus any of the C diet groups (P < .05). After evaluation of cardiac function in each rat, the heart was stored in a histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution for 8 hours at 4 degrees C. The heart was then reperfused, and recovery of cardiac function was evaluated. No significant differences were observed for post-preservative cardiac function within the C diet groups. However, within the HC diet groups, HC + EPA significantly (P < .05) improved the recovery of cardiac function. In addition, HC + DHA also significantly (P < .05) improved the recovery of coronary flow (CF) and LV dp/dt. No significant differences were observed for plasma TC and TG concentrations in the C diet groups. EPA administration significantly decreased cardiac levels of palmitic, , and linoleic acids in the HC diet groups. No significant differences were observed for cardiac levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) within the C diet groups. Cardiac EPA and DHA levels were significantly (P < .05) elevated in EPA- or DHA-treated rats compared with the other diet-fed rats. Cardiac EPA levels were also elevated in DHA-treated rats compared with untreated rats (P < .05).

Palmitic and  VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA.

These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins.

Measurements of LDL oxidation parameters, indicated that hamsters fed the mid- sunflower oil and high- olive oil diets had significantly longer lag phase (+66% and +145%, respectively) and significantly lower propagation rates (-26% and -44%, respectively) and conjugated dienes formed (-17% and -25%, respectively) compared to the hamsters fed the high-linoleic sunflower oil. Relative to the high-linoleic sunflower oil, aortic cholesterol ester was reduced by -14% and -34% in the mid- sunflower oil and high- olive oil groups, respectively, with the latter reaching statistical significance. Although there were no significant associations between plasma lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol with aortic total cholesterol and cholesterol esters for any of the groups, the lag phase of conjugated diene formation was inversely associated with both aortic total and esterified cholesterol in the high- olive oil-fed hamsters (r = -0.69, P < 0.05). The present study suggests that mid- sunflower oil reduces risk factors such as lipoprotein cholesterol and oxidative stress associated with early atherosclerosis greater than the typical high-linoleic sunflower oil in hypercholesterolemic hamsters. The high- olive oil not only significantly reduced oxidative stress but also reduced aortic cholesterol ester, a hallmark of early aortic atherosclerosis greater than the typical high-linoleic sunflower oil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18059528>Lipoprotein electrostatic properties regulate hepatic lipase association and activity.</a></h2><p>The effect of lipoprotein electrostatic properties on the catalytic regulation of hepatic lipase (HL) was investigated. Enrichment of serum or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) with  increased lipoprotein negative charge and stimulated lipid hydrolysis by HL. Similarly, enrichment of serum or isolated lipoproteins with the anionic phospholipids phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic , or phosphatidylserine also increased lipoprotein negative charge and stimulated hydrolysis by HL. Anionic lipids had a small effect on phospholipid hydrolysis, but significantly stimulated triacylglyceride (TG) hydrolysis. High density lipoprotein (HDL) charge appears to have a specific effect on lipolysis. Enrichment of HDL with PI significantly stimulated VLDL-TG hydrolysis by HL. To determine whether HDL charge affects the association of HL with HDL and VLDL, HL-lipoprotein interactions were probed immunochemically. Under normal circumstances, HL associates with HDL particles, and only small amounts bind to VLDL. PI enrichment of HDL blocked the binding of HL with HDL. These data indicate that increasing the negative charge of HDL stimulates VLDL-TG hydrolysis by reducing the association of HL with HDL. Therefore, HDL controls the hydrolysis of VLDL by affecting the interlipoprotein association of HL. Lipoprotein electrostatic properties regulate lipase association and are an important regulator of the binding and activity of lipolytic enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7676394>Nutrition in lipid disorders.</a></h2><p>When various fats and oils are given to humans, marked differences in the concentrations of serum lipids and lipoproteins will be observed. Relative to dietary carbohydrates, lauric, myristic and palmitic , which are saturated fatty acids, but also trans fatty acids from hydrogenated fats elevate the serum total and LDL cholesterol level. Saturated fatty acids with less than 12 carbon atoms or with 18 carbon atoms-stearic -have little effect on the serum cholesterol level. This is also true for , a monounsaturated fatty . Replacement of linoleic  for carbohydrates leads to slightly lower LDL cholesterol levels; however, recent studies suggest that this effect is less than predicted by studies performed in the early sixties. Substitution of carbohydrates by fat will increase the level of HDL cholesterol but decrease that of fasting serum triglyceride. Trans fatty acids, though, are an exception and lower the level of HDL cholesterol relative to other fatty acids. The fish oils may have a small LDL-cholesterol-elevating effect in hypertriglyceridemic patients but have a very specific triglyceride-lowering effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Causes other than hypertension have not previously been investigated longitudinally. The aim of the present study was to determine hemodynamic, metabolic, and psychosocial predictors at 50 years of age for the prevalence of echocardiographic LVH and geometric subtypes at age 70 by use of a large sample of men from the general population followed up for 20 years. Methods and Results-In 1970 to 1973, all men born from 1920 to 1924 and residing in Uppsala County, Sweden, were invited to participate in a health survey aimed at identifying risk factors for cardiovascular disease. At a reinvestigation 20 years later, echocardiographic left ventricular mass index was determined in 475 subjects. A 1-SD increase in body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, fasting LDL/HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, or the serum cholesterol ester proportion of several saturated fatty acids or  at age 50 significantly increased the odds of having LVH at age 70 by 27% to 41%, whereas an increase in linoleic  proportion was protective. Almost all metabolic predictors were independent of ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, and use of antihypertensive medication at age 70.-Dyslipidemia and indices of a low dietary intake of linoleic  and high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats, as well as hypertension and obesity, at age 50 predicted the prevalence of LVH 20 years later in this prospective longitudinal cohort study, thereby suggesting that lipids may be important in the origin of LVH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23725506>Hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects of buckwheat leaf and flower mixture in hyperlipidemic rats.</a></h2><p>As a source of biologically active compounds, buckwheat has beneficial effects in nutrition due to its high content of flavonoids, particularly rutin.

Placental lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is involved in the initial step in transplacental fatty  transport as it hydrolyzes maternal triglycerides (TG) to release free fatty acids (FFA). We investigated LPL activity and protein (Western blot) and mRNA expression (real-time RT-PCR) in the placenta of an LPL-deficient mother with marked hypertriglyceridemia. The LPL activity was fourfold lower, LPL protein expression 50% lower, and mRNA expression threefold higher than that of normal, healthy placentas at term (n = 4-7). To further investigate the role of maternal lipids in placental LPL regulation, we isolated placental cytotrophoblasts from term placentas and studied LPL activity and protein and mRNA expression after incubation in Intralipid (as a source of TG) and , linoleic, and a combination of , linoleic, and arachidonic acids as well as insulin. Intralipid (40 and 400 mg/dl) decreased LPL activity by approximately 30% (n = 10-14, P < 0.05) and 400 microM linoleic and linoleic--arachidonic  (n = 10) decreased LPL activity by 37 and 34%, respectively. No major changes were observed in LPL protein or mRNA expression. We found no effect of insulin on LPL activity or protein expression in the cultured trophoblasts. To conclude, the activity of placental LPL is reduced by high levels of maternal TG and/or FFA. This regulatory mechanism may serve to counteract an excessive delivery of FFA to the fetus in conditions where maternal TG levels are markedly increased.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14525677>Dietary fat and postprandial lipids.</a></h2><p>Impaired clearance of chylomicron remnants is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. An intake of 40 to 50 g of fat in a meal results in significant lipemia in healthy adults, with consecutive fat-containing meals enhancing the lipemia. This would suggest that limiting fat intake to approximately 30 g on each eating occasion would minimize postprandial lipemia. Sedentary behavior and obesity independently impair the postprandial metabolism of lipids. Postprandial lipemia causes endothelial dysfunction and results in a transient increase in factor VII activated (FVIIa) concentration. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity is associated with fasting plasma triacylglycerol concentration, but is not influenced by postprandial lipemia. Trans-18:1  appears to increase cholesterol ester transfer activity acutely compared with oleate. Randomized stearic -rich fats result in less postprandial lipemia and a lower postprandial increase in FVIIa, whereas unrandomized cocoa butter results in similar postprandial lipemia and increases in FVIIa compared with oleate. A background diet containing in excess of 3 g/d of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids decreases postprandial lipemia by stimulating lipoprotein lipase expression and decreasing very low-density lipoprotein synthesis, but a diet enriched in alpha-linolenic  (up to 9.5 g/d) does not show these effects.

Additionally, an increment of the HDL-C (53 +/- 4 mg/dL) in the C group and in the D group (53 +/- 5 mg/dL) were observed when compared with group B (44 +/- 3 mg/dL), resulting in a lower ratio of TC/HDL-C (1.5 +/- 0.1).

However, the inhibitory effect of yuja on hepatic lipid accumulation has not been clearly elucidated thus far.The inhibitory effect of yuja on hepatic lipid accumulation was investigated in both cell culture and mouse models. We investigated the inhibitory effect of ethanol extract of yuja peel (YE) using HepG2 cells. We next confirmed the effect of YE in mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 8): a normal diet group (ND), a high-cholesterol diet group (HC), high-cholesterol diet plus 1% YE (YL), high-cholesterol diet plus 5% YE (YH).Seventy percent ethanolic extracts of yuja peel (YE) reduced -induced hepatic lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Treatment with YE at 100, 200 μg/mL up-regulated expression levels of cholesterol metabolism-related proteins such as AMPK, ACC, PPAR-α, and CPT1 and down-regulated the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The hypocholesterolemic effect of YE was further confirmed in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. Compared to ND (normal diet) mice, HC (high-cholesterol diet) mice showed increased body weight, liver fat content, liver weight, and content of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. On the contrary, administrations of YL (HC + 1% YE) or YH (HC + 5% YE) significantly reduced body weight, liver fat content, liver weight, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol compared to those of only HC fed mice group. As a result of in vitro data, protein expressions of PPAR-α and CPT1 were induced in mice fed YE diet compared to HC diet but HMGCR expression was decreased.Yuja peel ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation in both cell culture and mouse models and therefore, could serve as a useful supplement for hypercholesterolemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26388495>GC-TOF-MS-based serum metabolomic investigations of naked oat bran supplementation in high-fat-diet-induced dyslipidemic rats.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to explore the metabolic response of oat bran consumption in dyslipidemic rats by a high-throughput metabolomics approach. Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used: N group (normal chow diet), M group (dyslipidemia induced by 4-week high-fat feeding, then normal chow diet), OL group and OH group (dyslipidemia induced, then normal chow diet supplemented with 10.8% or 43.4% naked oat bran). Intervention lasted for 12weeks. Gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify serum metabolite profiles. Results confirmed the effects of oat bran on improving lipidemic variables and showed distinct metabolomic profiles associated with diet intervention. A number of endogenous molecules were changed by high-fat diet and normalized following supplementation of naked oat bran. Elevated levels of serum unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic  (Log2Fold of change=0.70, P=.02 OH vs. M group), palmitoleic  (Log2Fold of change=1.24, P=.02 OH vs. M group) and  (Log2Fold of change=0.66, P=.04 OH vs. M group) were detected after oat bran consumption. Furthermore, consumption of oat bran was also characterized by higher levels of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Pathway exploration found that most of the discriminant metabolites were involved in fatty  biosynthesis, biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, microbial metabolism in diverse environments and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. These results point to potential biomarkers and underlying benefit of naked oat bran in the context of diet-induced dyslipidemia and offer some insights into the mechanism exploration.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Actually, traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis predispose to endothelial dysfunction, which is manifested as an increase in the expression of specific cytokines and adhesion molecules. There are firm evidence supporting the beneficial effects of olive oil, the most genuine component of the Mediterranean diet. Although the effects of olive oil and other -rich dietary oils on atherosclerosis and plasma lipids are well known, the roles of minor components have been less investigated. Minor components constitute only 1-2% of virgin olive oil (VOO) and are composed of hydrocarbons, polyphenols, tocopherols, sterols, triterpenoids and other components usually found in traces. Despite their low concentration, non-fatty  constituents may be of importance because studies comparing monounsaturated dietary oils have reported different effects on cardiovascular disease. Most of these compounds have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic properties. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the effects of these compounds contained in VOO on vascular dysfunction and the mechanisms by which they modulate endothelial activity. Such mechanisms involve the release of nitric oxide, eicosanoids (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) and adhesion molecules, in most cases by activation of nuclear factor kappaB by reactive oxygen species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28659743> inhibition of lipid accumulation induced by  and  pharmacokinetics of chitosan microspheres (CTMS) and chitosan-capsaicin microspheres (CCMS).</a></h2><p>Chitosan and capsaicin are compounds extracted from natural products and have been indicated to lower body weight and prevent fatty liver. However, their applications are limited by poor oral bioavailability, low compliance and some serious side effects. To solve these problems, we successfully prepared chitosan microspheres (CTMS) and chitosan-capsaicin microspheres (CCMS) in previous study. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the ability of CTMS and CCMS to eliminate lipid accumulation in hepatocytesand also characterized their pharmacokinetic parameters after administration. The results showed that the two microspheres could significantly reduce intracellular lipid accumulation and dose-dependently improve the triglyceride (TG) content in HepG2 cells. A pharmacokinetic study indicated that CTMS and CCMS were distributed in almost all of the measured tissues, especially liver and kidney, and that their absorption was better than those of chitosan and capsaicin. Simultaneously, the prolonged circulating half-lives, the lower clearance and higher plasma concentration of CTMS and CCMS showed that their bioavailability was effectively enhanced. All of the results indicated that the lipid accumulation inhibition of CTMS and CCMS was better than that of chitosan and capsaicin, and that these microspheres can be developed as preventive agents for fatty liver or obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11910049>Increased beef consumption increases apolipoprotein A-I but not serum cholesterol of mildly hypercholesterolemic men with different levels of habitual beef intake.</a></h2><p>The objective of this research was to compare the effects of a lean beef enriched in  to a beef that is typical of the commercial beef consumed in the United States. Ten mildly hypercholesterolemic men, ages 34-58 years old, were selected from the Texas A&M University faculty and staff. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two diets for a 6-week duration followed by a crossover after a 4-week habitual diet washout period. Diets were consumed daily for a 6-week study period. Participants substituted lean beef obtained from Wagyu bullocks or commercial beef for the meat typically consumed. Total cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and B, triacylglycerols, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were measured in serum samples collected weekly. Beef type had no effect on any measured variable. There were no significant differences between baseline HDL or LDL cholesterol concentrations after the consumption of the beef test diets. Apolipoprotein A-I, serum glucose, and uric  concentrations were elevated by the additional dietary beef. Analysis of records of customary diets indicated that one group consumed 160 g of beef daily, whereas the other group consumed only 26 g of beef daily. Therefore, post hoc analyses tested the habitual beef intake x treatment time interaction. LDL cholesterol concentration was markedly higher in the group with low habitual beef intake (180 vs 144 mg/dl), and HDL cholesterol was slightly higher (44 vs 40 mg/dl; post-test values) than for the group with high habitual beef intake, but there were no habitual intake x time interactions for LDL or HDL cholesterol. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations also were greater in the individuals habitually consuming less beef.

NLCs were prepared via emulsification-solvent evaporation technique followed by ultrasonication, and the effect of composition of the nanocarriers on the particle size, size distribution, surface charge, entrapment efficiency, drug release kinetics and physical stability was extensively studied. NLCs exhibited nanosized (<200nm) spherical morphologies with narrow size distribution and high drug entrapment efficiency (>75%), sustained drug release pattern, and negative surface charge (zeta potential of -35-40mV) that imparts sufficient electrostatic physical stability. When tested in vivo, SIM-NLCs of the optimal composition demonstrated improved and prolonged reduction in the total cholesterol and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as compared to the drug suspension. After oral administration of a single dose of SIM-NLC, 4-fold increase in bioavailability was observed, as compared to the SIM suspension.

These experimental diets were designed to reduce blood cholesterol and failed to improve prognosis. By contrast, recent trials were not primarily designed to reduce cholesterol, were conducted in medium- and high-risk patients and used low fat diets supplemented by omega-3 fatty acids from various sources. In two of these trials, the consumption of natural antioxidants, oligoelements and vegetable proteins was increased. Recurrence rate was reduced in the range of 30 to 70%. One conclusion from these well-conducted recent experiments on more than 3000 patients is that new and more specific dietary recommendations are clearly warranted in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. They should be more specific and more clearly defined and therefore different from those generally provided in the U.S.A. and Europe at present. In a recent Consensus Panel statement, authors wrote less than one line to describe a cardioprotective diet in patients with coronary heart disease, summarized as < or = 30% fat, < 7% saturated fat, < 200 mg.day-1 cholesterol. This is both too much (too restrictive to hope that white European and American patients will adhere in the long-term) and insufficient because dietary counselling cannot be restricted to three factors. Ulbricht and Southgate recently emphasized that the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease is more complex than the current cholesterol hypothesis. They identified at least seven major dietary factors, including fibres, although the evidence of an effect on coronary heart disease is weak. However, they did not mention vegetable and fish proteins which are rich in arginine and L-glutamine, major regulators of cardiovascular function. Thus, new dietary advice should include: reduce intake of total (not more than 30% of energy) and saturated (less than 10%) fats maintain intake at least minimally, of the essential omega-6 fatty acids augment consumption of  and moderately increase consumption of omega-3 fatty acids augment intake of natural antioxidants and oligo-elements maintain sufficient intake of vegetable proteins As conceptualized in the 'Mediterranean' and 'Asian-vegetarian' types of diet, it is very important that a healthy diet should be thought of as a whole rather than as a recitation of good and bad components. Although these protective dietary modifications should probably all be used in each patient to obtain maximal efficacy, these scientifically quantitated principles should be adapted to the culture, ethnic origin and 'image of the world' of each patient in order to create an environment favourable to the perception of positive associations between various foods and healthy habits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505108>[How surplus of palmitic fatty  in food initiates hypertriglyceridemia, increases cholesterol of low density lipoproteins, triggers atherosclerosis and develops atheromatosis.]</a></h2><p>In phylogenesis, the first transfer of all fatty acids to cells is implemented by high density lipoproteins.

In blood, under hydrolysis of triglycerides, cells absorb ligand palmitic and  very low density lipoproteins by force of апоЕ/В-100 endocytosis; they are not transformed into low density lipoproteins. The palmitic saturated fatty acids in the form of polyether of cholesterol turn into linoleic very low density lipoproteins from high density lipoproteins at impact of protein transferring polyene ethers of cholesterol. They transform very low density lipoproteins into low density lipoproteins of the same name; the cells absorb them by force of апоЕ/В-100 endocytosis. In physiological sense, amount of  very low density lipoproteins are always more than palmitic of very low density lipoproteins. Under syndrome of insulin-resistance there is no transformation of palmitic saturated fatty  synthesized from glucose in vivo into  mono-saturated fatty . The hepatocytes secrete into blood mainly palmitic very low density lipoproteins which amount exceeds  very low density lipoproteins. Under slow hydrolysis in blood, main mass of palmitic very low density lipoproteins becomes palmitic low density lipoproteins. These very lipoproteins initiate , increase content of cholesterol of cholesterol-low density lipoproteins, lower cholesterol-high density lipoproteins, decrease bio-availability of polyene fatty acids for cells, trigger development of atherosclerosis and formation of atheromatosis in intima of arteries. The aphysiologic effect of surplus of palmitic saturated fatty  in vivo and triglycerides of the same name can't be eliminated under increasing of content of ω-3 polyene fatty acids in food and effect of statines. All this is to be rationally applied in prevention of hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, atheromatosis of coronary arteries, ischemic heart disease and myocardium infarction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387185>Daming capsule, a hypolipidaemic drug, lowers blood lipids by activating the AMPK signalling pathway.</a></h2><p>Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Daming capsule (DMC), a medicine for lowering blood lipids, is marketed in China; however, its mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DMC reduces blood lipids.A rat model of hyperlipidaemia was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet (HFD), and the serum lipid levels were detected with an automatic biochemical analyser. DMC (162 mg/kg) and atorvastatin calcium (10 mg/kg) were orally administered to the hyperlipidaemic rats for 4 weeks. HFD feeding markedly induced increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); however, DMC treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in rats serum. Meanwhile, the hepatic TC and TG levels, liver weight/body weight ratio, and body weight were significantly lower in the DMC-treated rats than in the HFD rats. Moreover, DMC significantly alleviated hepatomegaly, hepatic lipid deposition, and hepatic steatosis. The protein expression level of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (Thr172) in HFD rat livers was lower than that in normal rat livers, whereas it increased in the liver of the DMC-treated rats; however, the protein expression level of total-AMPK in the liver was not different among the groups. The AMPK-activating effect of DMC was blocked by Compound C (a specific AMPK inhibitor) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, DMC considerably increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) transcription and concentration in the liver. This effect of DMC was also inhibited by Compound C in HepG2 cells. DMC also promoted LDL receptor (LDLR) protein expression by activating AMPK. We further found that DMC reduced the levels of TC and TG in -treated HepG2 cells, and it restored the expression levels of p-AMPK, PPARα, LPL, and LDLR compared to the decreased levels observed in -treated HepG2 cells.DMC lowered lipids in serum and the liver by activating AMPK. On the one hand, the activation of AMPK enhanced PPARα expression and LPL transcription to lead to the hydrolysis of TG; on the other hand, it increased LDLR protein expression to promote lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We tested this hypothesis by assessing the chronic effect of  on glucose metabolism and its relationship with glucose-induced insulin release in beta HC9 cells in tissue culture. Our results show: (1) A 4-day treatment with  caused an enhancement of insulin release at 0-5 mmol/l glucose concentrations while a significant decrease in insulin release occurred when the glucose level was greater than 15 nmol/l; (2) Hexokinase activity was increased and a corresponding left shift of the dose-dependency curve of glucose usage was observed associated with inhibition of glucose oxidation in  treated beta HC9 cells, yet the presumed glucose-related ATP generation did not parallel the change in insulin release due to glucose; (3) The rate of cellular respiration was markedly increased in  treated beta HC9 cells both in the absence of glucose and at all glucose concentrations tested. This enhanced oxidative metabolism may explain the increased insulin release at a low glucose level but is clearly dissociated from the blunted insulin secretion at high glucose concentrations. We conclude that a reduction of oxidative metabolism in pancreatic beta cells is unlikely to be the cause of the dramatic effect that high levels of non-esterified fatty acids have on glucose-induced insulin release.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917246>[Laurine fatty acids, medium fatty acids and triglycerides, , resistance to insulin, prevention of atherosclerosis and ateromatosis.]</a></h2><p>Although the biochemistry of the positive effects of medium-chain fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TG) of the same name in vivo is not fully understood, food enriched with medium-chain LC and the same TG is effective in patients with type I diabetes, insulin resistance syndrome and in neurodegenerative pathology. Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of palmitic , an increase in , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21197586>Palm olein and olive oil cause a higher increase in postprandial lipemia compared with lard but had no effect on plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines.</a></h2><p>Postprandial lipemia impairs insulin sensitivity and triggers the pro-inflammatory state which may lead to the progression of cardiovascular diseases. A randomized, crossover single-blind study (n = 10 healthy men) was designed to compare the effects of a high-fat load (50 g fat), rich in palmitic  from both plant (palm olein) or animal source (lard) versus an -rich fat (virgin olive oil) on lipemia, plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines. Serum triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations were significantly lower after the lard meal than after the olive oil and palm olein meals (meal effect P = 0.003; time effect P < 0.001). The greater reduction in the plasma non-esterified free fatty acids levels in the lard group compared to the olive oil meal was mirrored by the changes observed for serum TAG levels (P < 0.05). The magnitude of response for plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and leptin] were not altered by the type of dietary fats. A significant difference in plasma IL-1β was found over time following the three high fat loads (time effect P = 0.036). The physical characteristics and changes in TAG structure of lard may contribute to the smaller increase in postprandial lipemia compared with palm olein. A high fat load but not the type of fats influences concentrations of plasma IL-1β over time but had no effect on other pro-inflammatory markers tested in the postprandial state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23486011>Nitro- protects against adriamycin-induced nephropathy in mice.</a></h2><p>Adriamycin (ADR) administration in susceptible rodents such as the BALB/c mouse strain produces injury to the glomerulus mimicking human focal glomerular sclerosis. The goal of the present study was to use this model to investigate antiproteinuric action of nitro- (OA-NO2), a nitric oxide-derived endogenous lipid product, which has exhibited multiple attractive signaling properties particularly in the kidney. BALB/c mice were pretreated for 2 days with OA-NO2 at 5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) via an osmotic minipump, followed by a single injection of vehicle or adriamycin (10 mg/kg) via the tail vein. Albuminuria and renal function were analyzed at 1 wk post-ADR treatment. ADR mice developed prominent albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, , and severe ascites. In contrast, the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome were greatly improved by OA-NO2 treatment. In parallel, plasma creatinine and plasma urea nitrogen were elevated in the ADR group, and the severity was less in the ADR+OA-NO2 group. OA-NO2 attenuates ADR-induced glomerulosclerosis, podocyte loss, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Indices of oxidative stress, including plasma and urinary thiobarbituric -reactive substances and renal expression of NAD(P)H oxidase p47(phox) and gp91(phox), and inflammation, including renal expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 in response to ADR, were all similarly suppressed. Together, these findings suggest that OA-NO2 exerts renoprotective action against ADR nephropathy likely via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11227032>Eicosanoid production, thrombogenic ratio, and serum and LDL peroxides in normo- and hypercholesterolaemic post-menopausal women consuming two -rich diets with different content of minor components.</a></h2><p>The present paper compares the effects of two monounsaturated oils, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and high- sunflower oil (HOSO), on serum and LDL peroxides, eicosanoid production and the thrombogenic ratio (thromboxane (TX) B2:6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha) in fourteen non-obese post-menopausal women. The subjects, mean age 63 (SD 11) years, were assigned to two consecutive -rich 28 d dietary periods. EVOO and HOSO represented 62 % of the total lipid intake and were used as the only culinary fat during the first and second dietary periods respectively. Serum peroxides, plasma alpha-tocopherol and TXB2 levels in stimulated platelet-rich plasma (PRP-TXB2) were significantly higher (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively) after the HOSO diet than after the EVOO diet. The relationship between the serum cholesterol level (< 6.21 mmol/l or > or = 6.21 mmol/l) and the type of dietary oil on eicosanoids, peroxides and alpha-tocopherol were evaluated by two-way ANOVA. Dietary oil significantly affected (P < 0.05) the PRP-TXB2 level, whereas serum and LDL peroxides were significantly affected (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) by the serum cholesterol level. The plasma alpha-tocopherol level was significantly affected by the serum cholesterol level and the type of dietary oil (both P < 0.001). No significant relationships were found between serum cholesterol levels, serum peroxide or LDL peroxide levels, plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations or alpha-tocopherol intakes with eicosanoid production or the thrombogenic ratio due to dietary changes. However, in spite of their higher alpha-tocopherol levels, hypercholesterolaemic subjects showed increased peroxidation in serum and LDL in comparison with normocholesterolaemic subjects on the HOSO diet in comparison with the EVOO diet. These findings suggest that differences in the type of minor compounds, as well as in the concentration of linoleic , in both these monounsaturated oils may play an important role in modulating eicosanoid production and lipoprotein peroxidation when they constitute a large proportion of the diet of post-menopausal women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26950614>Pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2, chemerin, IP-10 and RANTES in human serum during an oral lipid tolerance test.</a></h2><p>There is a strong coincidence of obesity and a chronic state of modest inflammation. Secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from adipocytes and immune cells represents a key mechanism in this process and is affected by fatty acids.A study cohort of 100 overnight fasted healthy volunteers underwent an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT) by ingestion of 160ml of a protein- and sugar-free lipid emulsion of defined composition. Venal blood was drawn at 0h (fasting) and at 2, 4, and 6h after lipid ingestion. Subjects were characterized by anthropometric and standard laboratory parameters. Serum concentrations of CCL2, IP-10, chemerin, and RANTES were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with free fatty acids (FA) and with sex steroids and concentrations of CCL2 and chemerin in cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA.A significant reduction of circulating CCL2, IP-10, and chemerin concentrations was observed as a consequence of triglyceride ingestion whereas RANTES levels were increased. CCL2 serum concentrations were positively correlated with resistin and visfatin levels and with LDL/HDL ratio and negatively with adiponectin. There were significant differences in chemerin and RANTES serum concentrations in female and male subjects. CCL2 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited by treatment with linoleic (LA) and  (OA) whereas chemerin secretion was induced. Chemerin release from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited by testosterone.Oral lipid loading is linked to reduced circulating pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2, IP-10, and chemerin and to increased RANTES levels, suggesting that dietary lipids affect immune function.Copyright © 2016.

In patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), intestinal TRL overproduction contributes to high systemic TRL levels, and recent studies suggest that systemic changes in MetS such as increases in plasma fatty acids and insulin resistance stimulate intestinal TRL production. The current study has examined whether increases in systemic TRL influence intestinal lipid transport and lipoprotein assembly pathways and evaluates the impact of these changes on the absorption and lymphatic transport of lipids and a model lipophilic drug (halofantrine). Mesenteric lymph-duct or bile-duct cannulated rats were administered IV saline or (14)C-labeled chylomicron (CM) (to increase systemic TRL) and intraduodenal (3)H lipids and drug. Changes to biliary lipid output and lymphatic lipid and drug transport were subsequently examined. Increasing systemic TRL concentrations stimulated a significant increase in lymphatic lipid and drug transport. The increased lipids in lymph were not derived from bile or the intestinal blood supply (fatty  or IV infused (14)C-CM). Rather, an increase in lymphatic transport of duodenally sourced lipids was evident. Increasing plasma levels of TRL therefore stimulated lipid absorption and lymphatic transport via a positive feedback process. The data also suggest that the changes to intestinal TRL formation that result from raised systemic TRL levels may impact on the absorption of highly lipophilic drugs and therefore the reproducibility of drug treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884017>Effects of -rich and omega-3-rich diets on serum lipid pattern and lipid oxidation in mildly hypercholesterolemic patients.</a></h2><p>To evaluate which dietary fat elicits the best response in terms of plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and oxidative processes.After a 4-week run-in period, 14 mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects were fed two balanced diets for 6-week periods. During the first intervention period, patients received a monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA)-enriched diet (olive oil diet). During the second period this diet was supplemented by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (n-3 diet).After the olive oil diet, a significant decrease in total serum cholesterol (-8.54%, P<0.01), and in apolipoprotein B (Apo B) (-10.0%, P<0.01) was observed. With the addition of n-3 fatty acids no further significant changes in serum lipid concentrations were found. However, the n-3 diet was followed by an increase in lipoperoxides in isolated native low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (67.23%, P<0.01).A beneficial effect on the serum lipid pattern was observed with the olive oil-enriched diet. The lack of further beneficial modifications on blood lipids and lipoproteins and the increase in the oxidative susceptibility of LDL observed after the addition of n-3 PUFA to the olive oil diet does not favor the use of this diet in hypercholesterolemic patients if it is not associated with a high intake of antioxidants.Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ten mildly hypercholesterolaemic men consumed five, 114 g hamburger patties per week for two consecutive phases. Participants consumed high-SFA hamburger (MUFA:SFA = 0.95; produced from pasture-fed cattle) for 5 weeks, consumed their habitual diets for 3 weeks and then consumed high-MUFA hamburger (MUFA:SFA = 1.31; produced from grain-fed cattle) for 5 weeks. These MUFA:SFA ratios were typical of ranges observed for retail ground beef. Relative to habitual levels and levels during the high-MUFA phase, the high-SFA hamburger: increased plasma palmitic , palmitoleic  and TAG (P < 0.01); decreased HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL particle diameter percentile distributions (P < 0.05); and had no effect on LDL cholesterol or plasma glucose (P>0.10). Plasma palmitoleic  was positively correlated with TAG (r 0.90), VLDL cholesterol (r 0.73) and the LDL:HDL ratio (r 0.45), and was negatively correlated with plasma HDL-C (r - 0.58), whereas plasma palmitic, stearic and  acids were negatively correlated with LDL particle diameter (all P <or= 0.05).

Trans11-18:1 (vaccenic , VA), the most predominant ruminant TFA and a precursor to conjugated linoleic , has been shown to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia and symptoms of hepatic steatosis in animal models. The objective of this study was to assess the intestinal bioavailability of various VA sources including synthetic free fatty  (FFA) and natural ruminant triglyceride forms, as well as the mechanistic pathways that mediate VA's bioactivity.VA acts as a partial agonist to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ in vitro, with similar affinity compared to commonly known PPAR agonists. It was further confirmed that VA at 30 and 100 μM concentrations suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy vitro in a PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent manner. In vivo, feeding of VA (1%, w/w) resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-γ in the mucosa of JCR:LA-cp rats, a model of the metabolic syndrome (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to control. In addition, VA from a triglyceride source had greater intestinal bioavailability in vivo compared to VA provided in an FFA form (p < 0.01).The activation of PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent pathways provides a mechanistic explanation of how VA improves blood lipids and related metabolic disorders during conditions of .

Twenty-eight hypertriglyceridemic (14 normotensives and 14 hypertensives) and 14 healthy male subjects were placed in a randomized and crossover design on diets enriched in refined olive oil (ROO) or high-palmitic sunflower oil (HPSO) for a 1-week lead-in period. Thereafter, subjects ate the corresponding fat-rich meal as a breakfast and underwent sampling hourly for 8 h. Plasma triglycerides (TG), sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were assayed. sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 postprandial peak levels were significantly higher and occurred later in hypertriglyceridemic subjects (all P<.001) compared with healthy subjects. ROO meal resulted in smaller areas under the curve for sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 in hypertriglyceridemic (normotensive and hypertensive) and healthy subjects compared to HPSO meal. Hypertension did not aggravate the postprandial response of TG, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1.

Serum CETP activity, measured as the rate of radiolabeled cholesteryl esters transferred from HDL toward serum apo B-containing lipoproteins, was higher with the palmitic  diet (25.1+/-2.5%) than with the lauric  (23.7+/-2.4%) and the  (24.0+/-2.7%) diets (P = 0.0028 and 0.0283, respectively). CETP mass concentrations, as measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were increased after the lauric  diet (2.57+/-0.63 mg/l) and the palmitic  diet (2.49+/-0.64 mg/l) as compared with the  diet (2.34+/-0.45 mg/l) (P = 0.0035 and 0.0249, respectively). In contrast with CETP, serum PLTP activity, as measured as the rate of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine transferred from liposomes toward serum HDL, was significantly higher with the lauric  diet (23.5+/2.6%) than with the palmitic  diet (22.5+/-2.5%) (P = 0.0013), while no significant differences were noted when comparing the saturated diets versus the  diet (23.0+/-2.3%). No significant alterations in the mean apparent diameter of LDL, and in the relative proportions of individual HDL subpopulations were observed from one dietary period to another. Nevertheless, lipid transfer activities correlated significantly with the relative abundance of HDL2b, HDL2a, HDL3b, and HDL3c, with opposite tendencies being observed for cholesteryl ester transfer and phospholipid transfer activities. In general, serum CETP activity correlated negatively with HDL cholesterol, but positively with triglyceride concentrations after the dietary interventions, and the relations with serum lipids were just the opposite for PLTP activity. In addition, CETP and PLTP activities correlated negatively when subjects consumed the standardized diets (P < 0.05 in all cases), but not when subjects consumed their habitual diet.

This is an inherited disorder, but environmental factors are also involved. Dietary fats might play a role in the prevention and/or treatment of such abnormality in the kinetic pools of membrane cholesterol. We tested this hypothesis by using a diet (in which 30% of the energy came from fat) rich in olive oil or in high- sunflower oil (as natural sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFAs) and determining their influence on the movement of cholesterol into the lipid bilayer of the erythrocyte membrane after a four-week period. We concluded that dietary olive oil is helpful in normalizing the impaired transbilayer movement of membrane cholesterol in erythrocytes of eight normocholesterolaemic and eight hypercholesterolaemic hypertensive patients. However, the effects cannot be attributed exclusively to the content of MUFAs (mainly ) in the diet, as high- sunflower oil was unable to induce favourable changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781592>Antihyperlipidemic Effect, Identification and Isolation of the Lipophilic Components from Artemisia integrifolia.</a></h2><p> L (Compositae) is a medicinal and edible plant. To investigate its antihyperlipidemic effect, a crude lipophilic extract and the composing compounds were isolated and fractioned from the petroleum ether extract of aerial parts of  using column chromatography on silica gel. The anti- effect was studied in a rat model of acute , which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic  (),  (), linoleic  (), linolenic  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute  model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and linolenic  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively). These compounds (i.e., chamazulene, acetylenes (E)-2, and linolenic ) were considered to be responsible for the bioactive antihyperlipidemic effect. In conclusion, the crude lipid extract of Artemisia integrifolia L could be used as a potential treatment to avert . Further studies to confirm these results in other models of  (e.g., diet-induced obesity) are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921498>Dietary Palmitoleic  Attenuates Atherosclerosis Progression and  in Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic  (palmitoleate; C16:1 n-7), an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) found in plants and marine sources, has been shown to favorably modulate lipid and glucose metabolism. However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with 5% (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, -rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic lipid/lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose metabolism (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose metabolism and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammation. These findings imply the potential role of dietary palmitoleate in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and diet-induced metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and ; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

The control diet was an average American diet (34% fat, 11.2% saturated fatty , 14.9% monounsaturated fatty , 7.8% PUFA). Subjects consumed each diet for 4 weeks with a 2-week compliance break before crossing over to another diet.Lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured, and measures of oxidative stress, including lag time, rate of oxidation, total dienes, and lipid hydroperoxides, were assessed.The mixed model procedure was used to test for main effects of diet, feeding period, and order of diets. Tukey-Kramer adjusted P values were used to determine diet effects.The NuSun sunflower oil diet decreased both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with the average American diet and the olive oil diet. There was no effect of the olive oil diet compared with the average American diet. Total cholesterol decreased 4.7% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 5.8% on the NuSun sunflower oil diet vs the average American diet. There was no effect of the experimental diets on triglyceride levels, rate of oxidation, total dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, or alpha-tocopherol. Lag time was the longest following the olive oil diet and shortest following the NuSun sunflower oil diet.The higher PUFA content appeared to account for the greater total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering and reduction in lag time of the NuSun sunflower oil diet. However, the fact that there were no differences in the resulting oxidation products suggests there were no adverse effects on low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Since PUFAs are important for cholesterol lowering, foods that replace saturated fatty acids should include a balance of unsaturated fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617371> promotes MMP-9 secretion and invasion in breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological and animal studies suggest an association between dietary fatty acids and an increase risk of developing breast cancer. Obesity, which is characterized by  and an elevation of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), is also associated with enhanced cancer risk. In breast cancer cells, the FFA  (OA) induces migration, proliferation, prolong survival, invasion, an increase in cellular Ca(2+) concentration, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, FAK and Src activation. However, the role of OA on MMP-9 secretion and invasion has not been studied in detail. We demonstrate here that stimulation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with 200 μM OA induces an increase on MMP-9 secretion through a PKC, Src, and EGFR-dependent pathway, as revealed by gelatin zymography assays. Furthermore, microtubule network mediates MMP-9 secretion induced by OA. In contrast, OA does not induce an increase on MMP-9 secretion in MCF10A cells, whereas it does not induce MMP-9 secretion in MCF12A mammary non-tumorigenic epithelial cells. In addition, OA induces invasion through an EGFR, Gi/Go proteins, MMPs, PKC and Src-dependent pathway, but it is not able to promote invasion in non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In summary, our findings demonstrate that OA promotes an increase on MMP-9 secretion and invasion through a PKC, Src, and EGFR-dependent pathway in breast cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286368>Cordycepin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via interaction with the γ1 subunit.</a></h2><p>Cordycepin is a bioactive component of the fungus Cordyceps militaris. Previously, we showed that cordycepin can alleviate  through enhancing the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but the mechanism of this stimulation is unknown. Here, we investigated the potential mechanisms of cordycepin-induced AMPK activation in HepG2 cells. Treatment with cordycepin largely reduced  (OA)-elicited intracellular lipid accumulation and increased AMPK activity in a dose-dependent manner. Cordycepin-induced AMPK activation was not accompanied by changes in either the intracellular levels of AMP or the AMP/ATP ratio, nor was it influenced by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibition; however, this activation was significantly suppressed by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) knockdown. Molecular docking, fluorescent and circular dichroism measurements showed that cordycepin interacted with the γ1 subunit of AMPK. Knockdown of AMPKγ1 by siRNA substantially abolished the effects of cordycepin on AMPK activation and lipid regulation. The modulating effects of cordycepin on the mRNA levels of key lipid regulatory genes were also largely reversed when AMPKγ1 expression was inhibited. Together, these data suggest that cordycepin may inhibit intracellular lipid accumulation through activation of AMPK via interaction with the γ1 subunit.© 2013 The Authors.

In previous research, PLs of  were found able to regulate the accumulation of triglycerides. However, none of these involve the function of DHA-containing phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC), which is the main component of PLs derived from  roe. The function by which DHA-PC from  roe exerts its effects has not yet been clarified. Herein, we used purified DHA-PC and  (OA) induced HepG2 cells to establish a high-fat model, and the cell activity and intracellular lipid levels were then measured. The mRNA and protein expression of Fatty  Synthase (FAS), Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1A (CPT1A) and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α (PPARα) in HepG2 cells were detected via RT-qPCR and western blot as well. It was found that DHA-PC can significantly regulate triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells, the effect of which was related to the activation of PPARα receptor activity, upregulation of CPT1A, and downregulation of FAS expression. These results can improve the understanding of the biofunction of hyperlipidemia mediated by DHA-PC from  roe, as well as provide a theoretical basis for the utilization of DHA-PC from  roe as a functional food additive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18938206>Hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of flax and pumpkin seed mixture rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in hypercholesterolemic rats.</a></h2><p>Flax and pumpkin seeds are a rich source of unsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants and fibers, known to have anti-atherogenic and hepatoprotective activities. These effects were evaluated in Wistar rats fed with 1% cholesterol diet. The study was performed on 30 male rats divided into three groups: a control group (CD), CD-chol group fed diet with 1% cholesterol and MS-chol group fed diet enriched with flax and pumpkin seed mixture. In CD-chol group, total cholesterol TC, triacylglycerol TG in plasma and liver, plasma LDL-C, atherogenic index AI and LDL/HDL ratio significantly increased. In MS-chol group lipid parameters decreased significantly, plasma and liver fatty  composition showed an increase of PUFAs (ALA and LA), and MUFAs ( and eicosaenoic ) and a decrease of SFA (palmitic and stearic ). In plasma and liver of MS-chol group, malondialdehyde levels decreased and the efficiency of antioxidant defense system was improved compared to CD-chol group. Liver histological sections showed lipid storage in hepatocytes of CD-chol group and an improvement was noted in MS-chol group. Our results suggested that flax and pumpkin seed mixture had anti-atherogenic and hepatoprotective effects which were probably mediated by unsaturated fatty acids present in seed mixture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11750269>Lipoprotein susceptibility to oxidation in the macromolecular fraction of plasma: relation to plasma lipids and oleate/linoleate ratio in comparison with whole plasma in hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>Susceptibility of lipoprotein to oxidation is usually studied using purified lipoproteins. However, for large clinical studies or routine clinical assessment, a rapid less time-consuming method is desirable. Therefore, we studied copper-mediated oxidation of the macromolecule fraction of plasma in comparison with oxidation directly in whole unfractionated plasma in a group of hyperlipidemic individuals.Lag phase rate (LR), propagation phase rate (PR), lag time (LT), and maximal extent of oxidation were determined for copper-mediated oxidation in plasma from 16 hyperlipidemic individuals. Oxidation parameters obtained for whole plasma (WP) and macromolecules were subjected to correlation analysis with plasma lipid concentrations and with the /linoleic  ratio (18:1/18:2) in phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG), and cholesterol esters (CE).Total cholesterol (TC) concentration was significantly correlated with lag rate (negative, p<0.05), lag time (positive, p<0.01), and with maximal extent of oxidation (positive, p<0.05) for plasma macromolecules (PM). Triglyceride concentration was not significantly correlated with lag rate, lag time, or propagation rate for plasma macromolecules. Triglyceride concentration was positively correlated with the maximal extent of oxidation (p<0.01) for plasma macromolecules. In the cholesterol ester fraction, the 18:1/18:2 ratio was significantly correlated (positive, p<0.05) with lag time. Phospholipid 18:1/18:2 ratio did not correlate with oxidative parameters. This ratio in triglycerides correlated better, but statistical significance was not obtained. Parameters obtained with whole plasma did not significantly correlate with lipid values.Oxidation parameters obtained for plasma macromolecules correlated with lipid parameters known to be associated with oxidative susceptibility of lipoproteins and were unaffected by soluble antioxidants found in whole plasma or serum. Therefore, plasma macromolecules were superior to whole plasma for assessing lipoprotein susceptibility to oxidation. This approach will facilitate larger clinical trials by saving the time and labor involved in lipoprotein isolation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404365>Effect of 12 Weeks High  Peanut Consumption on Cardio-Metabolic Risk Factors and Body Composition.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence indicates an inverse association between nut consumption and obesity, inflammation,  and glucose intolerance. We investigated effects of high  peanut consumption vs. a nut free diet on adiposity and cardio-metabolic risk markers. In a randomised cross-over design, 61 healthy subjects (65 ± 7 years, body mass index (BMI) 31 ± 4 kg/m²) alternated either high  peanuts (15%-20% of energy) or a nut free diet for 12 weeks. Body composition and mass, waist circumference, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipids, glucose and insulin were assessed at baseline and after each phase. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the two diets. Consistent with other nut studies, there were no differences in lipids, CRP, glucose and insulin with peanut consumption. In contrast, some reports have demonstrated benefits, likely due to differences in the study cohort. Energy intake was 10% higher (853 kJ, p < 0.05), following peanut consumption vs. control, attributed to a 30% increase in fat intake (p < 0.001), predominantly monounsaturated (increase 22 g, p < 0.05). Despite greater energy intake during the peanut phase, there were no differences in body composition, and less than predicted increase (0.5 kg) in body weight for this additional energy intake, possibly due to incomplete nutrient absorption and energy utilisation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26598603>Natural Functions of PLIN2 Mediating Wnt/LiCl Signaling and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3)/GSK3 Substrate-Related Effects Are Modulated by Lipid.</a></h2><p>Belonging to the PLIN family, PLIN2 associates with lipid storage droplets (LSDs), but other functions of PLIN2 remain unclear. Here, we suggest that PLIN2 mediates Wnt signaling because PLIN2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppresses activation of Wnt/coreceptor pathways. The mediation in the Wnt/Frizzled pathway seems to occur from Dishevelleds to axin/glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK3)/β-catenin complexes (AGβC) as Wnt decreases Dishevelled/PLIN2 but increases AGβC/PLIN2 associations. Augmenting cellular LSDs that affect PLIN2 associations with these proteins,  (OA) treatment inhibits Wnt-increased AGβC/PLIN2 associations and β-catenin T-cell factor signaling (β-CTS). Revealing that PLIN2 is a GSK3-associated protein, the study explored PLIN2-mediated effects on GSK3/GSK3 substrates. PLIN2 siRNA reduces inhibitory GSK3 levels and lithium chloride (LiCl)-upregulated β-catenin or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (c/EBPα) expression. OA treatment decreases LiCl-increased c/EBPα via PLIN2-c/EBPα dissociation. In addition to PLIN2 overexpression increasing β-CTS, PLIN2 depletion or overexpression drops or adds expression of GSK3 substrates, such as β-catenin, c/EBPα,c-Myc, cyclin D1, and insulin receptor substrate 1, and cell growth/survival. PLIN2 N or C terminus overexpression that is associated with higher levels of the substrates suggests that those substrates bind to specific regions of PLIN2. Mimicking the possible high lipid concentrations in cells in the human body under conditions of /obesity, OA-treated cells gain or reduce GSK3 substrate expression in parallel with a decrease (a Wnt-like effect) or increase in GSK3 activity, likely regulated by GSK3/PLIN2/GSK3 substrate associations.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The aim of this study is to explore the effect of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) on serum cholesterol levels and their mechanism of action. Hyperlipemia, as a model of abnormal lipid hypermetabolism, was established by using a high fat diet in C57BL/6J mice. Forty eight mice with dyslipidemia were randomly divided into 4 groups, 12 mice per group, including the control group, the 2% caprylic  (C8:0)-treated group, 2% capric  (C10:0)-treated group, and 2%  (C18:1)-treated group. All mice were fed with a high fat diet. After 16 weeks, the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The mouse portal vein blood, the liver and the start site of the ileum (1 cm) were collected. The body weight of the mice and blood lipid profiles were measured. Gene transcription and the expression level associated with bile  metabolism in the liver and small intestine were determined by real-time PCR and the western blotting method. The concentrations of bile  metabolites in bile and feces were analysed. After 16 weeks of treatment, the concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the caprylic  group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, CYP7A1, CYP27A1 and ABCG8 in the caprylic  and capric  groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the liver (P < 0.05), however the transcription and expression level of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the caprylic , capric  and  groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the small intestine (P < 0.05). The concentrations of total bile , mainly cholic  and cholesterol in bile and feces were significantly higher in the caprylic and capric  groups than those of in the control group (P < 0.05). Thus, MCFA increased the expression of LXR and ABCG8, enhanced CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 expression, decreased and SHP expression in the liver, thereby promoted liver bile  synthesis and excretion. In addition MCFA increased the expression of ABCG5, ABCG8 and LXR in the small intestine, thereby inhibiting small intestinal bile  absorption, increasing the concentrations of cholesterol and bile  in bile and feces and reducing the level of serum cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21216577>Ameliorative potential of S-allylcysteine: effect on lipid profile and changes in tissue fatty  composition in experimental diabetes.</a></h2><p> is an associated complication of diabetes mellitus. The association of hyperglycemia with an alteration of lipid parameters presents a major risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes. The present study was designed to examine the antihyperlipidemic effect of S-allylcysteine (SAC) in STZ induced diabetic rats. The levels of blood glucose, cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids, phospholipids and fatty  composition were estimated in the liver and kidneys of control and experimental groups of rats. Oral administration of SAC at a dose of 150 mg/kg bodyweight per day to STZ-induced diabetic rats for a period of 45 days resulted in a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, TC, TG, free fatty acids, phospholipids, LDL-C, VLDL-C and elevation of HDL-C in comparison with diabetic control group. Oral administration of SAC to diabetic rats also decreased the concentrations of fatty acids, viz., palmitic, stearic (16:1), and  (18:1), whereas linolenic (18:3) and arachidonic  (20:4) were elevated. The antihyperlipidemic effect of SAC was compared with glyclazide; a well-known antihyperglycemic drug. The result of the present study indicates that SAC showed an antihyperlipidemic effect in addition to its antidiabetic effect in experimental diabetes.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

This study aimed to examine the contribution of alterations in chylomicron synthesis, size and lipid composition to increased lipaemia. Healthy older (60-75 years; n 15) and younger (20-25 years; n 15) subjects consumed a high-fat breakfast. Chylomicron dynamics and fatty  composition were analysed for 5 h in the postprandial state. Plasma TAG levels were elevated following the meal in the older subjects, relative to younger subjects (P<0·01). For older subjects compared with younger subjects, circulating chylomicron particle size was smaller (P<0·05), with greater apoB content (P<0·05) at all postprandial time points. However, total chylomicron TAG concentration between the groups was unaltered post-meal. Compared with younger subjects, the older subjects exhibited a greater proportion of  in the TAG and phospholipid (PL) fraction (P<0·05), plus lower proportions of linoleic  in the TAG fraction of the chylomicrons (P<0·01). Thus, following the ingestion of a high-fat meal, older individuals demonstrate both smaller, more numerous chylomicrons, with a greater total MUFA and lower PUFA contents. These data suggest that the increased postprandial lipaemia of ageing cannot be attributed to increased chylomicron TAG. Rather, ageing is associated with changes in chylomicron particle size, apoB content and fatty  composition of the chylomicron TAG and PL fractions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002411>Mulberry extract inhibits -induced lipid accumulation via reduction of lipogenesis and promotion of hepatic lipid clearance.</a></h2><p>Mulberries are a traditional edible food used to treat hepatic disease. The anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects of mulberry water extracts (MWE) have attracted increasing interest. In the present study, MWE were assessed for their hepatic lipid-lowering potential when administered in fatty  overload conditions in HepG2 cells.We found that MWE significantly reduced lipid accumulation, suppressed fatty  synthesis, and stimulated fatty  oxidation. Furthermore, MWE also inhibited acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase activities by stimulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). MWE attenuated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its target molecules, such as fatty  synthase. Similar results were also measured in the expressions of enzymes involved in triglyceride and cholesterol biosyntheses including glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and SREBP-2. In contrast, the lipolytic enzyme expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 were increased.Our study suggests that the hypolipidemic effects of MWE occur via phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of lipid biosynthesis. Therefore, the mulberry extract may be active in the prevention of fatty liver.Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25138064>Effect of almond consumption on the serum fatty  profile: a dose-response study.</a></h2><p>Consumption of almonds has been shown to be associated with a decreased risk of CHD, which may be related to their fatty  (FA) composition. However, the effect of almond consumption on the serum FA composition is not known. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether almond consumption would alter the serum FA profile and risk of CHD, as calculated using Framingham's 10-year risk score, in a dose-dependent manner in hyperlipidaemic individuals when compared with a higher-carbohydrate control group using dietary interventions incorporating almonds. A total of twenty-seven hyperlipidaemic individuals consumed three isoenergetic (mean 1770 kJ/d) supplements during three 1-month dietary phases: (1) full-dose almonds (50-100 g/d); (2) half-dose almonds with half-dose muffins; (3) full-dose muffins. Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks 0 and 4 for the determination of FA concentrations. Almond intake (g/d) was found to be inversely associated with the estimated Framingham 10-year CHD risk score (P= 0·026). In both the half-dose and full-dose almond groups, the proportions of  (OA) and MUFA in the TAG fraction (half-almond: OA P= 0·003; MUFA P= 0·004; full-almond: OA P< 0·001; MUFA P< 0·001) and in the NEFA fraction (half-almond: OA P= 0·01; MUFA P= 0·04; full-almond: OA P= 0·12; MUFA P= 0·06) increased. The estimated Framingham 10-year CHD risk score was inversely associated with the percentage change of OA (P= 0·011) and MUFA (P= 0·016) content in the TAG fraction. The proportions of MUFA in the TAG and NEFA fractions were positively associated with changes in HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Similarly, the estimated Framingham 10-year CHD risk score was inversely associated with the percentage change of OA (P= 0·069) and MUFA content in the NEFA fraction (P= 0·009).

A cross-over design included mildly hypercholestrolemic subjects (9 men and 6 women) preconditioned on test diets fats at 31% energy for 7 days prior to the postprandial challenge on the 8th day with 50 g test fat. Plasma lipids and lipoproteins were monitored at 0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.5 and 7 hr.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations in response to POL, AHA or PCAN meals were not significant for time x test meal interactions (P > 0.05) despite an observed trend (POL > AHA > PCAN). TAG area-under-the-curve (AUC) increased by 22.58% after POL and 7.63% after PCAN compared to AHA treatments (P > 0.05). Plasma total cholesterol (TC) response was not significant between meals (P > 0.05). Varying P/S ratios of test meals significantly altered prandial high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (P < 0.001) which increased with decreasing P/S ratio (POL > AHA > PCAN). Paired comparisons was significant between POL vs PCAN (P = 0.009) but not with AHA or between AHA vs PCAN (P > 0.05). A significantly higher HDL-C AUC for POL vs AHA (P = 0.015) and PCAN (P = 0.001) was observed. HDL-C AUC increased for POL by 25.38% and 16.0% compared to PCAN and AHA respectively. Plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations was significant (P = 0.005) between meals and significantly lowest after POL meal compared to PCAN (P = 0.004) and AHA (P > 0.05) but not between AHA vs PCAN (P > 0.05). AUC for LDL-C was not significant between diets (P > 0.05). Palmitic (C16:0),  (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) acids in TAGs and cholesteryl esters were significantly modulated by meal source (P < 0.05).P/S ratio of dietary fats significantly affected prandial HDL-C levels without affecting lipemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096013>Novel soybean oils differing in fatty  composition alter immune functions of moderately hypercholesterolemic older adults.</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) are essential fatty acids that play an important role in modulation of T cell proliferation. The effects of consuming novel soybean oils varying in LA:ALA ratios on T cell proliferation and inflammatory responses were assessed in older adults. Eighteen participants (>50 y old) with elevated cholesterol concentrations (3.37-4.14 mmol/L LDL cholesterol) consumed 5 experimental diets in random order for periods of 35 d. Each diet contained 30% of energy as fat, two-thirds of which was high- soybean oil (HiOleic-SO), soybean oil (SO), low-SFA soybean oil (LoSFA-SO), hydrogenated soybean oil (Hydrog-SO), or low-ALA soybean oil (LoALA-SO), resulting in LA:ALA ratios of 2.98, 8.70, 9.69, 15.2, and 18.3, respectively. Participants had higher proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with baseline following consumption of SO (26%; P < 0.05), LoSFA-SO (22%; P < 0.05), or HiOleic-SO (24%; P < 0.05) diets. Proliferative response was similar to the baseline after participants consumed diets with an LA:ALA ratio >10 (Hydrog-SO and LoALA-SO). Post-diet intervention, LA:ALA ratios correlated with proliferative responses to PHA (r = -0.87; P = 0.05). An optimal proliferative response was observed at an LA:ALA ratio of 8.70, with an inverse correlation between proliferative response and LA:ALA ratios >8.70. These effects were independent of changes in the production of PGE(2), inflammatory cytokines, or cytokines involved in growth of lymphocytes. These data suggest that the LA:ALA ratio modulates the proliferative ability of T lymphocytes, which may be due to subtle changes in fatty  composition of the phospholipids in immune cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912103>Chronic consumption of trans-fat-rich diet increases hepatic cholesterol levels and impairs muscle insulin sensitivity without leading to hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia in female Fischer rats.</a></h2><p>The impact of industrial trans fatty acids (TFAs) on lipid metabolism and health remains elusive.We compared the effect of long-term (52 weeks) ingestion of 10% partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, providing 4.2% of total energy from TFAs, on hepatic lipid metabolism and muscle insulin sensitivity in weanling female Fischer rats with that of palmolein (monounsaturated fatty , MUFA), sunflower (n-6 polyunsaturated fatty , PUFA), and a blend of sunflower and fish oil (n-3 PUFA).The proportion of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in total cholesterol and reverse cholesterol transport-associated protein expressions were similar in all the groups. Despite higher lipogenic-pathway protein levels, steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia was not observed in TFA-fed rats. Though TFA ingestion had no effect on fasting plasma glucose, insulin levels or oral glucose tolerance, it significantly decreased muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as compared to PUFAs. Further, TFA ingestion increased adipose tissue retinol-binding protein 4 mRNA as compared to PUFAs (n-6 or n-3). The effects of MUFA () on all these parameters were comparable to those observed for TFAs.Compared to PUFA-rich diets, chronic consumption of a TFA-rich diet did not lead to steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia; however, it significantly impaired muscle insulin sensitivity, while no changes were found in the oral glucose tolerance test.Copyright © 2011 S.

In the present study, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were used to characterize further the lipid-SS relationship by evaluating how lipid, contributes to SS secretion bothin vivo andin vitro. In vivo  was induced for up to 3 h by short-term (2 min) infusion of a triacylglycerol (TG)-rich lipid emulsion (20% Intralipid(®)). Plasma total lipid concentration increased 118 and 155% over control levels 1 h and 3 h, respectively, after infusion; much of this increase was due to elevated plasma fatty acids (FA), which increased 39 and 520%, respectively, over the same time-frame. The hyperlipidemic pattern was attended by a significant increase in the plasma concentration of SS. The specific effects of fatty acids were evaluated on isolated Brockmann bodies. Palmitic  and  stimulated SS release 378 and 82%, respectively, over baseline levels. These results indicate that lipids, and in particular fatty acids, modulate SS secretion in rainbow trout.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891736>Vaccenic  suppresses intestinal inflammation by increasing anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines in the JCR:LA-cp rat.</a></h2><p>Vaccenic  (VA), the predominant ruminant-derivedtransfat in the food chain, ameliorates , yet mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic  (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252956>Low fat-monounsaturated rich diets containing high- peanuts improve serum lipoprotein profiles.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women are at risk for cardiovascular disease and are encouraged to follow low-fat (LF) (< or = 30% energy) diets. However, these diets may have undesirable effects on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and triglycerides, whereas diets high in monounsaturated fats do not. Twenty postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women previously consuming high-fat diets (34% energy) were placed on a low fat-monounsaturated rich diet (LFMR: 26%, 14% energy, respectively) for 6 men. Sixteen women already eating LF diets (24% energy) were also followed to monitor variations in serum lipids due to seasonal variations. Twenty-five women successfully completed the study (LFMR = 12, LF = 13). Serum cholesterol decreased 10% (264 to 238 mg/dL, P < or = 0.01) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased 12% (182 to 161 mg/dL, P < or = 0.01) in the LFMR group, but did not change in the LF group. The reduction in serum cholesterol in the LFMR group was greater than estimated by predictive formulas. Serum triglycerides and apo A-I did not change in the LFMR group. A modest decrease in HDL-C, HDL3-C, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) occurred in both groups, but only the LFMR group showed a trend toward beneficial changes in LDL-C/HDL-C and apo A-Vapo B ratios. Overall, the LFMR diet was well tolerated and resulted in an improved serum lipid and apolipoprotein profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19822001>A high  sunflower oil fatty  esters of plant sterols mixed with dietary diacylglycerol reduces plasma insulin and body fat accumulation in Psammomys obesus.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is associated with subsequent development of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by reduced response to insulin, central obesity, and dyslipidemia. Intake of plant sterols (PS) has been shown to confer a healthier lipid profile and ameliorate cardiovascular disease risk factors in experimental animals and humans. In this study we used an animal model of type 2 diabetes to assess the effects of a preparation of PS esterified to high  sunflower oil fatty acids mixed with dietary diacylglycerol (PS-HOSO) on diabetic related metabolic parameters. Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) were fed high energy (HE) diet supplemented by either PS-HOSO or control oil. Following 4.5 weeks of intervention, animals were divided into fasting and non-fasting modes prior to outcome measurements. Glucose and insulin levels as well as blood lipid profile, body weight, and fat accumulation were evaluated in fasting and non-fasting modes.P. obesus fed with a HE diet displayed a characteristic heterogeneity in their blood glucose and insulin levels with a subset group displaying type 2 diabetes symptoms. PS-HOSO treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol (24%, P < 0.001) and non-HDL cholesterol (34%, P < 0.01) compared to the control diet. Among fasting animals, body weight at end point and epididymal fat-to-liver weight ratio were significantly (P < 0.05 each) reduced (7% and 16%, respectively) compared to controls. Interestingly, fasting blood glucose levels were similar between groups, whereas plasma insulin level at end point was 44% lower in the PS-HOSO group compared to control group (P < 0.0001)PS-HOSO supplementation to diabetes-prone gerbils counteracts the increase in body weight and epididymal fat accumulation, and also results in a drop in circulating insulin levels. These effects are pointing out that PS-HOSO may serve as a functional ingredient for metabolic syndrome or diabetic sufferers, which not only influences body weight, but also prevents or reverses insulin resistance and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16580874>Structured triglycerides containing caprylic (8:0) and  (18:1) fatty acids reduce blood cholesterol concentrations and aortic cholesterol accumulation in hamsters.</a></h2><p>The effects of structured triglycerides containing one long chain fatty  (, C18:1) and one short chain saturated fatty  (caprylic , 8:0) on lipidemia, liver and aortic cholesterol, and fecal neutral sterol excretion were investigated in male Golden Syrian hamsters fed a hypercholesterolemic regimen consisting of 89.9% commercial ration to which was added 10% coconut oil and 0.1% cholesterol (w/w). After 2 weeks on the HCD diet, the hamsters were bled, following an overnight fast (16 h) and placed into one of three dietary treatments of eight animals each based on similar plasma cholesterol levels. The hamsters either continued on the HCD diet or were placed on diets in which the coconut oil was replaced by one of two structured triglycerides, namely, 1(3),2-dicaproyl-3(1)-oleoylglycerol (OCC) or 1,3-dicaproyl-2-oleoylglycerol (COC) at 10% by weight. Plasma total cholesterol (TC) in hamsters fed the OCC and COC compared to the HCD were reduced 40% and 49%, respectively (P<0.05). Similarly, hamsters fed the OCC and COC diets reduced their plasma nonHDL cholesterol levels by 47% and 57%, respectively (P<0.05), compared to hamsters fed the HCD after 2 weeks of dietary treatment. Although hamsters fed the OCC (-26%) and COC (-32%) had significantly lower plasma HDL levels compared to HCD, (P<0.05), the plasma nonHDL/HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly lower (P<0.05) compared to the HCD for the OCC-fed (-27%) and the COC-fed (-38%) hamsters, respectively. Compared to the HCD group, aortic esterified cholesterol was 20% and 53% lower for the OCC and COC groups, respectively, with the latter reaching statistical significance, P<0.05. In conclusion, the hamsters fed the structured triglyceride oils had lower blood cholesterol levels and lower aortic accumulation of cholesterol compared to the control fed hamsters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11880241>Reduction in hepatic non-esterified fatty  concentration after long-term treatment with atorvastatin lowers hepatic triglyceride synthesis and its secretion in sucrose-fed rats.</a></h2><p>The mechanism by which atorvastatin lowers plasma triglyceride (TG) levels is mainly through a decrease in hepatic TG secretion. However, it is not clear why atorvastatin, which does not inhibit TG synthesis in vitro, decreases hepatic TG secretion without a prospective increase in hepatic TG concentration. For the investigation of the mechanisms that underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effects of atorvastatin, we characterized the effect of either a single or an 11 day administration of atorvastatin in sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemic rats. Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg p.o.) strongly decreased the rate of both very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG and VLDL-apolipoprotein B secretion. The inhibitor also decreased hepatic TG concentration. Hepatic TG synthesis activity was also decreased by atorvastatin, and its activity was correlated with both hepatic and plasma TG concentration. There was also a strong correlation between the hepatic TG synthesis and hepatic non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) concentration (r(2)=0.815). These effects required chronic administration of the inhibitor and were not observed by acute treatment. Repeated administration of atorvastatin also strongly reduced hepatic acyl-coenzyme A synthase mRNA levels. These results suggest that the reduced hepatic NEFA most likely lowers hepatic TG synthesis and TG secretion in sucrose-fed hypertriglyceridemic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10599271>[. Concern with the Mediterranean diet].</a></h2><p>Prevention and treatment of dyslipidemias are major aims in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The primary therapeutic objective in secondary prevention should be to avoid vascular and cardiac complications as well as reducing or normalizing lipid levels.There is no single definition of the Mediterranean diet. In terms of nutriments, it can be defined as a diet poor in saturated and polyunsaturated fats but rich in . Despite their low amount in the diet, omega-3 fatty acids are characteristic compounds of the Mediterranean diet as antioxidants of various sources and vitamins of the B group, in particular folates.Adoption of a Mediterranean diet results in a significant reduction of total and LDL-cholesterol with also a significant effect on triglycerides and a small positive or no effect on HDL-cholesterol. However, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to be cardioprotective (for instance, prevention of sudden death) through biological effects (probably induced by omega-3 fatty acids) independent of its effect on blood lipoproteins.The association of these cardioprotective and beneficial effects on blood lipids, in addition to gastronomic properties, renders this type of diet extremely attractive for public health purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968576>Femoral lipectomy increases postprandial lipemia in women.</a></h2><p>Femoral subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) appears to be cardioprotective compared with abdominal SAT, possibly through better triglyceride (TG) sequestration. We hypothesized that removal of femoral SAT would increase postprandial TG through a reduction in dietary fatty  (FA) storage. Normal-weight (means ± SD; BMI 23.9 ± 2.6 kg/m(2)) women (n = 29; age 45 ± 6 yr) were randomized to femoral lipectomy (LIPO) or control (CON) and followed for 1 yr. Regional adiposity was measured by DEXA and CT. A liquid meal labeled with [(14)C] was used to trace the appearance of dietary FA in plasma (6-h postprandial TG), breath (24-h oxidation), and SAT (24-h [(14)C]TG storage). Fasting LPL activity was measured in abdominal and femoral SAT. DEXA leg fat mass was reduced after LIPO vs. CON (Δ-1.4 ± 0.7 vs. 0.1 ± 0.5 kg, P < 0.001) and remained reduced at 1 yr (-1.1 ± 1.4 vs. -0.2 ± 0.5 kg, P < 0.05), as did CT thigh subcutaneous fat area (-39.6 ± 36.6 vs. 4.7 ± 14.6 cm(2), P < 0.05); DEXA trunk fat mass and CT visceral fat area were unchanged. Postprandial TG increased (5.9 ± 7.7 vs. -0.6 ± 5.3 × 10(3) mg/dl, P < 0.05) and femoral SAT LPL activity decreased (-21.9 ± 22.3 vs. 10.5 ± 26.5 nmol·min(-1)·g(-1), P < 0.05) 1 yr following LIPO vs. CON. There were no group differences in (14)C-labeled TG appearing in abdominal and femoral SAT or elsewhere. In conclusion, femoral fat remained reduced 1 yr following lipectomy and was accompanied by increased postprandial TG and reduced femoral SAT LPL activity. There were no changes in storage of meal-derived FA or visceral fat. Our data support a protective role for femoral adiposity on circulating TG independent of dietary FA storage and visceral adiposity.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722377>Chalcones suppress fatty -induced lipid accumulation through a LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Excessive lipid accumulation in the liver has been proposed to cause , diabetes and fatty liver disease. 4-Hydroxyderricin (4HD), xanthoangelol (XAG), cardamonin (CAR) and flavokawain B (FKB) are chalcones that have exhibited various biological effects against obesity, inflammation, and diabetes; however, little is known about the inhibitory effects of these chalcones on fatty liver disease. In the present study, we investigated the ability of 4HD, XAG, CAR, and FKB to reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. When HepG2 cells were treated with a mixture of fatty acids (FAs; palmitic  :  = 1 : 2 ratio), significant lipid accumulation was observed. Under the same experimental conditions, addition of chalcones at 5 μM significantly suppressed the FA-induced lipid accumulation. We found that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a key molecule involved in lipogenesis, was decreased in these chalcone-treated cells. We also found that these chalcones increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is involved in FA oxidation. Moreover, these chalcones increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), upstream regulators of SREBP-1 and PPARα. We confirmed that an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, reversed chalcone-induced changes in SREBP-1 and PPARα expression in the HepG2 cells. Collectively, we found that 4HD, XAG, CAR, and XAG attenuated lipid accumulation through activation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880668>Hypercholesterolemia increases plasma saturated and n-6 fatty acids altering prostaglandin homeostasis and promotes endothelial dysfunction in rabbits.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluated the plasma fatty  levels and the vascular prostaglandin (PG) release in a rabbit model of early hypercholesterolemia with endothelial dysfunction. Rabbits were fed either a control diet (CD) or a diet containing 1 % cholesterol (HD) for 5-6 weeks. The level of fatty acids was measured in plasma. The levels of PG and nitric oxide (NO) released from the aorta were also determined. Vascular morphology of the aorta was characterized by intima and media thickness measurements. The rabbits fed with HD had higher levels of arachidonic  (ARA) and lower levels of . The linoleic  level was unchanged. PGI(2) and NO were diminished and PGF(2α) levels, the PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio and the intima/media ratio were increased in rabbits fed with HD. In conclusion, feeding HD for a short period increased ARA plasma levels and unbalanced release of vasodilator/vasoconstrictor PG redirected the pathway to vasoconstrictor metabolite release. These lipid metabolism alterations in addition to the reduced NO levels and the moderate changes in the vascular morphology contributed to the endothelial dysfunction in this animal model. Therefore, the present findings support the importance of early correction or prevention of high cholesterol levels to disrupt the endothelial dysfunction process that leads to cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29468762>Hypolipidemic activity and mechanisms of the total phenylpropanoid glycosides from Ligustrum robustum (Roxb.)

LRTPG of high (1.2 g/kg), medium (0.6 g/kg), and low (0.3 g/kg) doses was administrated daily for 21 consecutive days in hamsters. We found that in hamsters fed a high-fat diet, LRTPG effectively reduced the concentrations of plasma triglycerides (TG), free fatty , total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hepatic TG and total cholesterol. And the compounds acteoside, ligupurpuroside A, ligupurpuroside C, and ligupurpuroside D significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in HepG2 cell at the concentration of 50 μmol/L. Mechanism research demonstrated that LRTPG increased the levels of phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase and phospho-sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c in liver, further to suppress the downstream lipogenic genes as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. In addition, LRTPG increased the hydrolysis of circulating TG by up-regulating lipoprotein lipase activities.

The authors provided evidence by discriminant analysis where the dependent variables were the lower quintiles (Q1 + Q2) and the upper quintiles (Q4 + Q5) of concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B and the independent variables were FA concentrations in plasma PC, that the total cholesterol concentration was inversely associated with the concentration of docosahexaenic  (22:6n-3). The concentration of LDL-cholesterol correlated inversely with the concentration of palmitoleic  (16:1n-7). Triglyceridaemia was inversely associated with the linoleic  concentration (18:2n-6). The concentration of apolipoprotein B correlated positively with myristic  (14:0) and negatively with concentrations of  (18:1n-9) and linoleic  (18:2n-6).The submitted results indicate that the fatty  concentrations of PC in plasma are significantly and markedly correlated with concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B.

To evaluate the role of oxidative stress in this disorder, we measured plasma levels of ubiquinone-10, ubiquinol-10, free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol esters (CE), and free fatty acids (FFA) in patients with juvenile FM (n=10) and in healthy control subjects (n=67). Levels of FC and CE were significantly increased in juvenile FM as compared with controls, suggesting the presence of hypercholesterolemia in this disease. However, plasma level of ubiquinol-10 was significantly decreased and the ratio of ubiquinone-10 to total coenzyme Q10 (%CoQ10) was significantly increased in juvenile FM relative to healthy controls, suggesting that FM is associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, plasma level of FFA was significantly higher and the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in total FFA was significantly lower in FM than in controls, suggesting increased tissue oxidative damage in juvenile FM. Interestingly, the content of monoenoic acids, such as  and palmitoleic acids, was significantly increased in FM relative to controls, probably to compensate for the loss of PUFA. Next, we examined the effect of ubiquinol-10 supplementation (100 mg/day for 12 weeks) in FM patients. This resulted in an increase in coenzyme Q10 levels and a decrease in %CoQ10. No changes were observed in FFA levels or their composition. However, plasma levels of FC and CE significantly decreased and the ratio of FC to CE also significantly decreased, suggesting that ubiquinol-10 supplementation improved cholesterol metabolism.

Subsequently, target candidates were quantified by quantitative MS. In the schisandrin B-induced hTG mice, we found that the plasma fatty acids, diglyceroids, and phospholipids were significantly increased. Palmitic  and stearic  were increased in the plasma; , linoleic , linolenic , arachidonic , and docosahexaenoic  were increased in both the plasma and the liver. Acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA were increased only in the liver. The changes in levels of these identified markers were also observed in HFD-induced hTG mouse model. The consistent results obtained from both hTG models not only suggest novel biomarkers in hTG pathogenesis, but they also provide insight into the underlying mechanism of the schisandrin B-induced hTG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262934>Modulation of plasma N-acylethanolamine levels and physiological parameters by dietary fatty  composition in humans.</a></h2><p>N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are endogenous lipid-signaling molecules involved in satiety and energetics; however, how diet impacts circulating NAE concentrations and their downstream metabolic actions in humans remains unknown. Objectives were to examine effects of diets enriched with high- canola oil (HOCO) or HOCO blended with flaxseed oil (FXCO), compared with a Western diet (WD), on plasma NAE levels and the association with energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Using a randomized controlled crossover design, 36 hypercholesterolemic participants consumed three isoenergetic diets for 28 days, each containing 36% energy from fat, of which 70% was HOCO, FXCO, or WD. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS was used to measure plasma NAE levels and indirect calorimetry to assess energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. After 28 days, compared with WD, plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and alpha-linolenoyl ethanolamide (ALEA) levels were significantly increased in response to HOCO and FXCO (P = 0.002, P < 0.001), respectively. Correlation analysis demonstrated an inverse association between plasma OEA levels and percent body fat (r = -0.21, P = 0.04), and a positive association was observed between the plasma arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA)/OEA ratio and android:gynoid fat (r = 0.23, P = 0.02), respectively. Results suggest that plasma NAE levels are upregulated via their dietary lipid substrates and may modulate regional and total fat mass through lipid-signaling mechanisms.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21914239>Increasing intake of long-chain n-3 PUFA enhances lipoperoxidation and modulates hepatic gene expression in a dose-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA have a broad range of biological properties that can be achieved at the gene expression level. This has been well described in liver, where LC n-3 PUFA modulate the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. However, the complexity of biological pathway modulations and the nature of bioactive molecules are still under investigation. The present study aimed to investigate the dose-response effects of LC n-3 PUFA on the production of peroxidised metabolites, as potential bioactive molecules, and on global gene expression in liver. Hypercholesterolaemic rabbits received by daily oral administration (7 weeks) either -rich oil or a mixture of oils providing 0.1, 0.5 or 1 % (groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively) of energy as DHA. Levels of specific peroxidised metabolites, namely 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE)-protein adducts, issued from LC n-3 PUFA were measured by GC/MS/MS in liver in parallel to transcription profiling. The intake of LC n-3 PUFA increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the hepatic production of 4-HHE. At the highest dose, LC n-3 PUFA provoked an accumulation of TAG in liver, which can be directly linked to increased mRNA levels of lipoprotein hepatic receptors (LDL-receptor and VLDL-receptor). In groups 1 and 2, the mRNA levels of microsomal TAG transfer protein decreased, suggesting a possible new mechanism to reduce VLDL secretion. These modulations of genes related to lipoprotein metabolism were independent of PPARα signalling but were probably linked to the activation of the farnesol X receptor pathway by LC n-3 PUFA and/or their metabolites such as HHE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16691318>Decreased bodyweight without rebound and regulated lipoprotein metabolism by gymnemate in genetic multifactor syndrome animal.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to find obesity control method without rebound. In our previous studies, gymnemate extracted from Gymnema sylvestre, inhibited  absorption. The Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, a genetic multifactor syndrome model, exhibits progressive overweight,  and hyperglycemia. The effect of gymnemate on obesity in OLETF was investigated.Three groups were divided (n=4-8): (1) OLETF-gymnemate, gymnema water extract (containing gymnemate) diet (62.5 g/kg) and water (2.5 g/kg) were supplied 2 weeks from 26-28 weeks, following it general diet and water were fed 3 weeks to observe if it rebound, (2) OLETF-control and (3) the counterpart Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats as normal-control.With gymnemate treatment, the food and water intake were decreased about 1/3 and 2/3, along with body weight reduced 57.2+/- 6.4 and 75.5+/- 6.3 g during 1 and 2 weeks respectively. In the end of experiment (3 weeks after gymnemate withdrawal), the body weight was decreased to no significant difference with normal-control. The total cholesterol was decreased about 1/3, moreover LDL+VLDL (low-density and very-low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol decreased about 1/2. The proportion of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol to the total cholesterol was increased. The serum triglyceride was decreased to the 1/4 of OLETF control. The level of serum cholesterol and triglyceride was no significant difference in gymnemate group with normal group.Supplementation with gymnemate promoted weight loss by its ability to reduce , which was no withdrawal rebound: an important discovery.

Increased glucose in the medium produced: (1) increased triglyceride in the cells and the medium; (2) no change in cholesterol ester in the cells or the medium; (3) no change in apo B100 secreted into the medium; (4) more apo B100 particles within the VLDL range with an increase in the VLDL triglyceride to apo B100 ratio. By contrast, increased oleate in the medium resulted in: (1) increased triglyceride in the cells and the medium; (2) increased cholesterol ester in the cells and the medium; and (3) increased apo B100 secreted into the medium. Important differences in the intracellular metabolism of triglyceride and cholesterol ester were also documented. Under all circumstances, there was substantially more radiolabelled triglyceride (overall eight times more) in the cell than in the medium, indicating that up to 90% of the newly synthesized triglyceride enters the cellular pool rather than being secreted with apo B100. By contrast, almost half of the newly synthesized cholesterol ester molecules were secreted with apo B100, pointing to an equal probability of entering the cell storage pool as opposed to being secreted. The data establish therefore two patterns of response of the liver to increased triglyceride synthesis depending on whether the substrate drive is glucose or oleate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19256553>Effect of polyphenol-rich extract from walnut on diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia in mice via enhancement of fatty  oxidation in the liver.</a></h2><p>The kernel pellicles of walnut are rich in ellagitannins with antioxidative activity. A polyphenol-rich extract from walnuts (WP, 45% polyphenol) was prepared and evaluated for its hypolipidemic effect in high fat diet fed mice. Oral administration of WP (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced liver weight and liver and serum triglycerides (TG). Hepatic beta-oxidation in cytosol, including peroxisome, was enhanced by WP (50-200 mg/kg). mRNA expressions of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and acyl coenzyme A oxidase (ACOX) 1 were enhanced by WP (50-200 mg/kg). With respect to the hypotriglyceridemic mechanism of WP, it suppressed neither olive oil induced serum TG elevation in mice nor  induced TG accumulation in HepG2 cells. On the other hand, mRNA expressions of PPARalpha, ACOX1, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1A in HepG2 cells were significantly enhanced by addition of WP (100 microg/mL). Moreover, tellimagrandin I, a polyphenolic constituent in WP, enhanced ACOX1 expression at 1-100 microg/mL. In conclusion, WP was found to possess hypotriglyceridemic activity via enhancement of peroxisomal fatty  beta-oxidation in the liver. These results suggest that tellimagrandin I is involved in the hypotriglyceridemic mechanism of WP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20233037>Lipoprotein profile, plasma ischemia modified albumin and LDL density change in the course of postprandial lipemia.

Very little data exists regarding postprandial response in subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The current study was conducted within the LIPGENE EU Integrated Project. Patients were randomized to one of the four isocaloric fatty meals (Oral Fat Tolerance Tests, OFTT): (A) high-fat, saturated fatty  (SFA)-rich (HFSA), (B) high-fat, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA)-rich (HFMUFA), (C) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate with 1.24 g high  sunflower oil supplement (LFHCC) and (D) low-fat high-complex carbohydrate with 1.24 g long chain n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  (LC n-3 PUFA) supplement (LFHCCn-3). The total and incremental areas under the curve (tAUC and iAUC) of plasma lipid and lipoprotein, Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) and LDL density were examined in patients with MetS to define effect of OFTT. All types of OFTT transiently increased plasma triglyceride and LDL density (LDLdens). It was paralleled by temporal decrease in total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). This last effect was partly alleviated in LFHCCn-3 test. A reversible increase of IMA was statistically significant only in the course of HSFA and HMUFA tests. EPA and DHA supplement in combined high complex-carbohydrate meal may attenuate adverse effect of tested meal on LDL particle profile and plasma ischemia modified albumin.

The  in experimental rats was induced by the high-cholesterol diet (HCD) followed by oral administration of various concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) of UME for 6 weeks. As a result, the UME significantly improved the biochemical parameters such as increased the level of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as reduced the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HCD-fed rats. In addition, UME also prevented lipid accumulation through regulating AMPK activity and lipid metabolism proteins (ACC, SREBP1 and HMGCR) in the HCD-fed rats as compared to the controls. Moreover, similar pattern of gene expression levels was confirmed in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells.

Indirect calorimetry measured energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Body composition was analyzed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.After 28 days, resting and postprandial energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were not different after consumption of the HOCO or FXCO diets compared with a typical Western diet. No significant changes in body composition measures were observed between diets. However, the android-to-gynoid ratio tended to increase (P=.055) after the FXCO diet compared with the HOCO diet.The data suggest that substituting a typical Western dietary fatty  profile with HOCO or FXCO does not significantly modulate energy expenditure, substrate oxidation or body composition in hypercholesterolemic males and females.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

They are unlikely capable to manifest pleiotropic effect. It is feasible to evaluate effect of statins by stages: a) initially a specific inhibition of synthesis of cholesterol alcohol; b) further indirect activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density; c) nonspecific activation of cells' receptor absorption of palmitic and  lipoproteins of very low density and then d) linoleic and linolenic lipoproteins of low density with all polyenoic fatty acids. On balance, statins activate absorption ofpolyenoic fatty acids by cells. Just they manifest physiological, specific pleiotropic effect. The statins inhibit synthesis of pool of cholesterol alcohol-lipoproteins of very low density condensed between phosphatidylcholines in polar mono-layer phosphatidylcholines+cholesterol alcohol on surface oftriglycerides. The low permeability of mono-layer separates substrate-triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density and post-heparin lipoprotein lipase in hydrophilic blood plasma. The higher is ratio cholesterol alcohol/phosphatidylcholines in mono-layer of lipoproteins of very low density the slower is lipolysis, formation of ligand lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells under apoB-100-endocytosis. The statins normalize hyperlipemia by force of a) activation of absorption oflipoproteins of very low density by insulin-depended cells and b) activation of absorption of lipoproteins of low density by all cells, increasing of bio-availability of polyenoic fatty acids, activation of apoB-100-endocytosis. The limitation in food of content of palmitic saturated fatty  and increasing of content of ω-3 polyenoic fatty acids improve "bio-availability" of polyenoic fatty acids and their absorption by cells and also decreases cholesterol alcohol/phosphatidylcholines and biological pleiotropic effect of essential polyenoic fatty acids.

The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on  induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated fatty acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately  (54.30%), and saturated fatty acids (palmitic  31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and liver and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO.

In this study we compared the inhibitory effects of MPA and IMPDH2 reduction [by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)] on  (OA)-induced fibronectin secretion and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse MCs. Growth-arrested MCs were stimulated with OA in the presence or absence of MPA, IMPDH2 siRNA, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) antibody or exogenous guanosine. Fibronectin secretion into the medium was examined by Western blot, dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF)-sensitive cellular ROS by fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS), TGF-beta levels in the media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). OA increased fibronectin secretion, TGF-beta and cellular ROS levels. A TGF-beta neutralizing antibody effectively suppressed OA-induced fibronectin secretion. NAC and MPA completely suppressed OA-induced fibronectin secretion and decreased the levels of TGF-beta and cellular ROS. However, IMPDH2 siRNA partly inhibited OA-induced MC activation.

A total of forty-two adult volunteers (nineteen males and twenty-three females) with diagnosed mildly hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol 5·68-7·49 mmol/l) were randomly assigned to eat 90 g/d of a control or enriched cheese for 3 weeks, with a cross-over after 3 weeks of washout. Plasma lipids, endocannabinoids, adipokines and inflammatory markers were measured. The intake of enriched cheese significantly increased the plasma concentrations of CLA, VA, the n-3 fatty acids ALA and EPA, and more remarkably decreased that of the endocannabinoid anandamide. LDL-cholesterol decreased significantly (7%). No changes were detected in the levels of inflammatory markers; however, a significant correlation was found between the plasma levels of anandamide and leptin. The control cheese modified none of the parameters measured. The results obtained do not support the view that intake of dairy fat is detrimental to hypercholesterolaemic subjects.

Relative to the Western diet, the TLC/Step 2 diet resulted in 11% and 7% lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), respectively, with no significant change in TG levels or total cholesterol-HDL-C ratio. Similar responses were observed in the non-fasting state. Linoleic (18:2n-6c) and alpha-linolenic (18:3n-3) acids increased at the expense of  (18:1n-9c) in the cholesteryl ester, TG, and phospholipid subfractions. The dietary changes had no significant effect on fractional esterification rate of HDL, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), or cholesterol ester transfer protein activities, or glucose and insulin levels. Female and male subjects responded similarly. The TLC/Step 2 diet resulted in a decrease in some CVD risk factors and no apparent adverse effects in others.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493191>Dynamics of fat absorption and effect of sham feeding on postprandial lipema.</a></h2><p>Given the importance of postprandial  to increase risk for atherosclerosis, in the present study, stable isotope-labeled meals were fed to healthy subjects (7 males and 3 females) to investigate the kinetics chylomicron synthesis and the effect of sensory exposure to lipid on metabolism.Subjects performed two, 24-hour inpatient studies that entailed consumption of a liquid formula evening meal containing 30 g of oil (+ (13)C(2) triolein) on day 1. Breakfast (day 2) consisted of triacylglycerols (TAGs) fed as capsules (30 g oil + (13)C(7) triolein) to avoid activation of mouth taste receptors. Next, modified sham feeding of cream cheese occurred over 2 hours. In the 2 trials, the stimulus was either higher fat (HF) or lower fat (LF) cream cheese. A liquid meal was consumed at lunch. Blood sampling occurred intermittently, and chylomicron particles S(f) >400 TAGs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.(13)C(2)-Label was found in fasting-state lipoproteins, and persons with higher body fat percentages showed greater dilution of meal TAGs from endogenous sources. For both trials, 13% ± 4% of lipoprotein TAGs  was derived from the previous evening meal. Incremental area under the curve for TAGs during HF was ∼2.5 times higher than after LF exposure (46 ± 15 vs 17 ± 5 μmol/L/h; P = .04). The greater HF morning lipemia occurred with elevated glucose, insulin, and nonesterified fatty acids peak after lunch.These data support a connection between enteral lipid metabolism and oral fat exposure, resulting in elevated postprandial lipemia. The results suggest that the intestine may participate in a mechanism coordinating oral fat signaling with control of subsequent macronutrient disposal in the body.Copyright © 2010 AGA Institute.

Twenty-seven hypercholesterolemic men participated in a double-blind, crossover trial of three margarines: 1) high-linoleic , moderate trans fatty acids; 2) high-palm oil blend (predominantly lauric, myristic, palmitic, , and linoleic acids); and 3) an interesterified form of the high-palm oil margarine. Both high-palm oil margarines led to similar low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations (4.43 +/- 0.94 and 4.54 +/- 0.88 mmol/L, respectively), which were significantly higher than the LDL concentrations after the high-linoleic  margarine (4.02 +/- 0.85 mmol/L, P < 0.001). Interesterification transferred substantial proportions of palmitic  into the sn-2 position of glycerides and unsaturated fatty acids into the sn-1,3 positions, and this was reflected in plasma chylomicrons. This study shows that interesterification of oils used to harden margarines does not raise plasma cholesterol more than does the margarine's constituent fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17634263>Dietary palatinose and  ameliorate disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism in Zucker fatty rats.</a></h2><p>Excessive dietary intake of carbohydrates and fats has been linked to the development of obesity. However, the mechanism by which these dietary factors interact to bring about metabolic changes has not been elucidated. We examined the combined effects of different types of dietary carbohydrates and fats on the etiology of obesity and its complications in the Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rat, a model of obesity. Specifically, these rats were fed an isocaloric diet containing various combinations of carbohydrates [palatinose (P), an insulin-sparing sucrose analogue, and sucrose (S)] and fatty acids [ (O) and linoleic  (L)]. After 8 wk, palatinose feeding (PO and PL) led to significant reductions in visceral fat mass, adipocyte cell size, hyperglycemia, and  compared with sucrose feeding (SO and SL); pancreatic islet hypertrophy was also prevented by palatinose feeding. Linoleic--fed rats (PL and SL) exhibited reduced insulin-immunoreactive staining of the pancreatic islets, enhanced macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, and an elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration when compared with -fed rats (PO and SO). Furthermore, sucrose and linoleic  synergistically increased the expression of genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis [sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and SREBP-2]. In conclusion, a diet containing palatinose and  may prevent diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. The combination of palatinose and  holds promise for a new approach to preventing and treating obesity and its complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12951628>Influence of plasma free fatty acids on lipoprotein synthesis and diabetic dyslipidemia.</a></h2><p>The regulation of hepatic VLDL secretion mainly depends on apolipoprotein (apo) B synthesis, on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, insulin and the availability of triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesteryl ester. Four sources of fatty acids are used for lipoprotein synthesis: de-novo lipogenesis, cytoplasmic triglyceride stores, fatty acids derived from lipoproteins taken up directly by the liver and plasma FFA. Quantitatively, de-novo lipogenesis plays a minor role in regulating VLDL synthesis, but evidently it is elevated under conditions of high carbohydrate feeding. Cytoplasmic triglyceride stores appear to essentially contribute to VLDL triglycerides. Plasma FFA enter the hepatocytes and are either oxidized or esterified. The relationship between oxidation and esterification appears to be important in regulating the VLDL synthesis. An enhanced esterification is accompanied by increased VLDL secretion. The addition of  to hepatocytes has been shown to stimulate production of VLDL triglyceride and apoB. In human beings, an acute experimental elevation of plasma FFA stimulates VLDL production. In healthy men strong positive relations were found between the late increases in large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and plasma FFA concentrations after 6 h following a mixed meal. In contrast, n-3 fatty acids impair VLDL assembly and secretion. Chronic hyperinsulinemia seems to stimulate VLDL production. On the other hand, the short-term addition of insulin has been shown to inhibit VLDL-triglyceride and apoB production in vitro. There is in vivo evidence that acute hyperinsulinemia suppresses VLDL-apoB and VLDL-triglyceride production in insulin-sensitive humans. Part of this action is due to suppression of plasma FFA. In patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), VLDL production was increased when compared with subjects with normal glucose (NGT). When infusing a lipid emulsion, VLDL production could not be further stimulated in IGT patients in contrast to NGT persons. Hypertriglyceridemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually the consequence of a VLDL overproduction. In type 2 diabetic patients, in contrast to normal men, insulin failed to suppress VLDL1 particle release. In normal men, an elevation of blood glucose led to a decrease in fatty  oxidation and an increase in hepatic triglyceride secretion. Under these conditions, approximately 30% of total VLDL triglycerides coming out of the liver did not originate from plasma FFA. In conclusion, plasma FFA seem to play an important role in stimulating hepatic VLDL production. Other factors such as chronic hyperinsulinemia or nutrition modify this effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11001949>Disruption of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in mice results in hepatomegaly and hypertriglyceridemia. Reversal by cholic  feeding.</a></h2><p>Sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) participates in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. We examined lipid metabolism in mice lacking the Cyp27 gene. On normal rodent chow, Cyp27(-/-) mice have 40% larger livers, 45% larger adrenals, 2-fold higher hepatic and plasma triacylglycerol concentrations, a 70% higher rate of hepatic fatty  synthesis, and a 70% increase in the ratio of  to stearic  in the liver versus Cyp27(+/+) controls. In Cyp27(-/-) mice, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity is increased 5-fold, but bile  synthesis and pool size are 47 and 27%, respectively, of those in Cyp27(+/+) mice. Intestinal cholesterol absorption decreases from 54 to 4% in knockout mice, while fecal neutral sterol excretion increases 2.5-fold. A compensatory 2.5-fold increase in whole body cholesterol synthesis occurs in Cyp27(-/-) mice, principally in liver, adrenal, small intestine, lung, and spleen. The mRNA for the cholesterogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and mRNAs for SREBP-2-regulated cholesterol biosynthetic genes are elevated in livers of mutant mice. In addition, the mRNAs encoding the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 and SREBP-1-regulated monounsaturated fatty  biosynthetic enzymes are also increased. Hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and accumulation of triacylglycerols increases in Cyp27(-/-) mice and is associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Cholic  feeding reverses hepatomegaly and hypertriglyceridemia but not adrenomegaly in Cyp27(-/-) mice. These studies confirm the importance of CYP27 in bile  synthesis and they reveal an unexpected function of the enzyme in triacylglycerol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142454>Procyanidin B2 ameliorates free fatty acids-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state.</a></h2><p>Procyanidin B2, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, has been reported to exert multiple beneficial functions. However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including  and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating lipogenesis-related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic fatty acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of palmitic ,  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced liver steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The characteristic decrease from baseline in plasma nonesterified fatty acids after a mixed meal was inhibited after AO (Δ 0-3 h, P < 0.05). HLS increased the augmentation index compared with the other test meals (P < 0.05), although the digital volume pulse-reflection index was not significantly different. Plasma 8-isoprostane F2α analysis revealed opposing effects of FO (increased) and AO (reduced) compared with the control (P < 0.05). No differences in nitric oxide metabolites were observed.These data show differential postprandial 8-isoprostane F2α responses to high-fat meals containing EPA + DHA-rich fish oil compared with DHA-rich AO, but these differences were not associated with consistent effects on postprandial vascular function or lipemia.

Fatty  profile as well as α-tocopherol, sterol, and squalene content was identified directly in rat hearts to distinguish the effect of individual components or to enlighten the potential synergisms.Oils and oil-products with discernible lipid and polar phenolic content were used. Wistar rats were fed a high-cholesterol diet solely, or supplemented with one of the following oils, i.e., EVOO, sunflower oil (SO), and high- sunflower oil (HOSO) or oil-products, i.e., phenolics-deprived EVOO [EVOO(-)], SO enriched with the EVOO phenolics [SO(+)], and HOSO enriched with the EVOO phenolics [HOSO(+)]. Dietary treatment lasted 9 weeks; at the end of the intervention blood and heart samples were collected.High-cholesterol-diet-induced dyslipidemia was shown by increase in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerols. Dyslipidemia resulted in increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, while glutathione and interleukin 6 levels remained unaffected in all intervention groups. Augmentation observed in MDA and TNF-α was attenuated in EVOO, SO(+), and HOSO(+) groups. Heart squalene and cholesterol content remained unaffected among all groups studied. Heart α-tocopherol was determined by oil α-tocopherol content. Variations were observed for heart β-sitosterol, while heterogeneity was reported with respect to heart fatty  profile in all intervention groups.Overall, we suggest that the EVOO-polar phenolic compounds decreased MDA and TNF-α in hearts of cholesterol-fed rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18358236>Links between enhanced fatty  flux, protein kinase C and NFkappaB activation, and apoB-lipoprotein production in the fructose-fed hamster model of insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>In the current study, we show evidence, in a fructose-fed hamster model of insulin resistance, that free fatty  (FFA) can induce hepatic insulin resistance in part via PKC activation leading to increased production of atherogenic apoB100-containing lipoproteins. Interestingly, IkappaB-kinase beta (IKKbeta)-dependent NF-kappaB was activated in hepatocytes from the fructose-fed hamster as an indication for PKC activation. Treatment of hepatocytes with oleate for 16h showed the activation of the PKC isoforms, PKCalpha/betaII, in a dose dependent manner. Strikingly, the general PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide-I, Bis-I (5 microM) was found to ameliorate fructose-induced insulin resistance, restoring the phosphorylation status of PKB and suppressing apoB100 overproduction in ex vivo and in vivo. The data suggest that hepatic PKC activation, induced by increased circulating FFA may be an important factor in the development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia seen in the fructose-fed hamster model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7498102>Postprandial changes in platelet function and coagulation factors after high-fat meals with different fatty  compositions.</a></h2><p>To compare the postprandial effects of three oils differing in their fatty  composition on platelet aggregation and coagulation.

Each subject ingested each meal in three separate mornings after an overnight fast. The order of the meals was randomised. Blood samples were taken before and 1, 2.5, and 5 h after the test meal.All three test meals similarly affected platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation induced by collagen (0.6, 1 and 2.5 micrograms/ml) decreased during the 5-h period after the meals (P = 0.000). ADP-induced aggregation did not change during the follow-up period after any meal (P = 0.105-0.483).

Despite the use of new cholesterol-lowering drugs, atherosclerotic vascular disease will likely continue to be the main cause of death in Western countries. Furthermore, the statistical relationship between cholesterol and cardiovascular mortality only explains a relatively minor component of differences in mortality among diverse countries. For these reasons, the interest in preventive approaches complementary or alternative to cholesterol reduction should be one of the main objectives of cardiovascular research in the years to come. Already in the '70s the very low incidence of atherosclerotic diseases in Mediterranean countries (Greece and Southern Italy) and the importance of the "dietary factor" in such protection were noticed. Diets for people in these countries are, among other components, very rich in , the main constituent of olive oil, with about 29% of daily caloric intake derived from monounsaturated fatty acids. , besides exerting relatively minor effects on the quantitative and qualitative regulation of cholesterol levels, appears to interfere directly with the inflammatory response that characterizes early atherogenesis. The endothelial expression of adhesion molecules for circulating monocytes, induced by inflammatory cytokines, minimally oxidized LDL and the advanced glycation end-products present in diabetes, substantially contributes to the onset and early progression of atherosclerosis. In an in vitro model of early atherogenesis based on cultured endothelial cells stimulated by cytokines, we observed that the incorporation of  in total cell lipids--mostly at the expenses of saturated fatty acids--decreases the expression of several endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules, among which vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, involved in the selective monocyte recruitment in the arterial intima.  also determines a parallel reduction in messenger RNA for this molecule, interfering with the activation of the most important transcription factor controlling endothelial activation, nuclear factor-kappa B. Thus, possibly in concert with other more highly unsaturated fatty acids,  may contribute to the prevention of atherosclerosis also through a modulation of gene expression for endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules. This series of investigations emphasizes the possibility of preventive interventions in atherosclerosis based on the modulation of vascular response to classical "triggers" (cholesterol, advanced glycation end-products of diabetes), an intervention strategy fundamentally different from--and thereby complementary to--those now more in fashion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16483884>Phytosterols mixed with medium-chain triglycerides and high- canola oil decrease plasma lipids in overweight men.</a></h2><p>Phytosterols (PSs) have been recently added to various mediums. Nevertheless, matrices with functional properties, such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), should be precisely examined for supplementary advantages. The objective of this study was to identify the existence of combined biological actions of a functional oil enriched in PSs within MCTs and high- canola (HOC), relative to a control (olive oil), in overweight, hyperlipidemic men using a rigorously controlled dietary intervention. Twenty-three overweight, hyperlipidemic men consumed both types of oil in a randomized, crossover trial for 6 weeks each. Fasted plasma samples were collected on the first and last 2 days of each study period. Body weight decreased -1.22 +/- 0.35 kg (P = .0019) and -1.68 +/- 0.47 kg (P = .0016) after the 6-week study period in the olive oil and functional oil groups, respectively. The end points for total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the functional oil group (P = .0006) were lower than in the olive oil group (P = .0002). Total cholesterol values decreased from comparable baseline to end point of 4.71 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) in the functional oil phase and 5.14 +/- 0.19 mmol/L (P = .0001) in the olive oil phase (P = .0592). In addition, LDL-C demonstrated a similar drop, to an end point of 3.12 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) and 3.54 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (P = .0002), for the functional oil and olive oil groups, respectively, with significant changes (P = .0221). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change in either treatment. Triacylglycerol end points decreased in functional oil and olive oil groups (P = .0195 and .0105, respectively) to the same extent from baseline. Results indicate that PSs mixed within an MCT- and HOC-rich matrix lower plasma LDL-C, without significantly changing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, in hyperlipidemic, overweight men, and may therefore decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12785004>Fatty acids and glucose increase neutral endopeptidase activity in human microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), a membrane-bound metallopeptidase enzyme that degrades neuropeptides, bradykinin, atrial natriuretic factor, enkephalins, and endothelin may regulate response to injury.

We hypothesized that  and hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus may induce excessive NEP activity and thereby diminish normal response to injury. Human microvascular endothelial cells were treated with five different fatty acids (40 microM) with varying degrees of saturation, including , linoleic , palmitic , stearic , and linolenic  and/or glucose (40 mM) for 48 h. The effect of the antioxidative agents vitamin E and C on NEP enzyme activation was determined by treating the cultured cells with alpha-tocopherol succinate and/or L-ascorbic . Cell membrane preparations were assayed for NEP activity by incubation with glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-beta naphthylamide to generate a fluorescent degradation product methoxy 2 naphthylamine.

Antioxidant vitamin E and C treatment significantly reduced NEP enzyme activity after fatty  exposure (P < 0.05). Thus, hyperglycemia and  associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus may increase endothelial cell NEP activity and thereby decrease early pro-inflammatory responses. The modulator effect of vitamin E and C on NEP membrane enzyme activity after exposure to fatty  stimulation suggests that lipid oxidation may activate NEP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15910890>Oleoylethanolamide, an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist, lowers body weight and  in obese rats.</a></h2><p>The fatty- ethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a naturally occurring lipid that regulates feeding and body weight [Rodriguez de Fonseca, F., Navarro, M., Gomez, R., Escuredo, L., Nava, F., Fu, J., Murillo-Rodriguez, E., Giuffrida, A., LoVerme, J., Gaetani, S., Kathuria, S., Gall, C., Piomelli, D., 2001.

OEA reduces food intake in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in PPAR-alpha (PPAR-alpha(-/-)), an effect that is also observed with the PPAR-alpha agonists Wy-14643 and GW7647 [Brown, P.J., Chapman, J.M., Oplinger, J.A., Stuart, L.W., Willson, T.M. and Wu, Z., 2000.

By contrast, specific agonists of PPAR-delta/beta (GW501516) or PPAR-gamma (ciglitazone) have no such effect. In obese Zucker rats, which lack functional leptin receptors, OEA reduces food intake and lowers body-weight gain along with plasma lipid levels. Similar effects are seen in diet-induced obese rats and mice. In the present study, we report that subchronic OEA treatment (5mgkg(-1), intraperitoneally, i.p., once daily for two weeks) in Zucker rats initiates transcription of PPAR-alpha and other PPAR-alpha target genes, including fatty- translocase (FAT/CD36), liver fatty- binding protein (L-FABP), and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2).

Hyperlipidemic rats treated with APNO showed a reduction in the total serum cholesterol similar to those treated with simvastatin, an increased body temperature by 1 °C, and a reduction in the body weight gain and mesenteric depot of white adipose tissue compared to the hyperlipidemic controls rats. There was an increase in the relative liver weight of rats treated with APNO, without, however, any change in the serum markers of hepatic toxicity. In addition, there was an increase in the moisture and lipid content of the feces of the rats treated with APNO compared to the controls.

These data demonstrated that ClC-3 deficiency prevent preadipocytes against palmitate-induced apoptosis via suppressing ER stress, and also suggested that ClC-3 may play a role in regulating cellular apoptosis and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism during T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15811191>Anti-obesity effects of chikusetsusaponins isolated from Panax japonicus rhizomes.</a></h2><p>The rhizomes of Panax japonicus are used as a folk medicine for treatment of life-style related diseases such as arteriosclerosis, , hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as a substitute for ginseng roots in China and Japan. Obesity is closely associated with life-style-related diseases. This study was performed to clarify whether chikusetsusaponins prevent obesity induced in mice by a high-fat diet for 9 weeks.We performed two in vivo experiments. In one, female ICR mice were fed a high-fat diet with or without 1 or 3% chikusetsusaponins isolated from P. japonicus rhizomes for 9 weeks. In the other, lipid emulsion with or without chikusetsusaponins was administered orally to male Wistar rats, and then the plasma triacylglycerol level was measured 0.5 to 5 h after the orally administered lipid emulsion. For in vitro experiments, the inhibitory effects of total chikusetsusaponins and various purified chikusetsusaponins on pancreatic lipase activity were determined by measuring the rate of release of  from triolein in an assay system using triolein emulsified with lecithin.Total chikusetsusaponins prevented the increases in body weight and parametrial adipose tissue weight induced by a high-fat diet. Furthermore, consumption of a high-fat diet containing 1 or 3% total chikusetsusaponins significantly increased the fecal content and triacylglycerol level at day 3 compared with the high-fat diet groups. Total chikusetsusaponins inhibited the elevation of the plasma triacylglycerol level 2 h after the oral administration of the lipid emulsion. Total chikusetsusaponins, chikusetsusaponin III, 28-deglucosyl-chikusetsusaponin IV and 28-deglucosyl-chikusetsusaponin V inhibited the pancreatic lipase activity.The anti-obesity effects of chikusetsusaponins isolated from P. japonicus rhizomes in mice fed a high-fat diet may be partly mediated through delaying the intestinal absorption of dietary fat by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity. The present study clearly indicated that the saponin fractions of P. japonicus rhizomes had a significant anti-obesity action and supports the traditional usage as a substitute drug for ginseng roots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928537>Antihyperlipidemic activity of  flower extract in  induced  in .</a></h2><p>The  herb has been traditionally used in India for medicinal purposes to treat hyperglycemia, diabetes, rheumatism, asthma, and skin diseases. In the present study, ethanolic extract of  flower (Et-CAF) depicted anti-hyperlipidemic effect in the budding yeast cells. The hyperlipidemic conditions were induced in the yeast cells with  which showed an increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) and sterol esters (SE), and was supported by the mRNA expression of LRO1 and DGA1 (involved in TAG formation); as well as ARE1 and ARE2 (involved in SE formation). The anti-hyperlipidemic effect by the Et-CAF was compared with the commercial drug Atorvastatin. The lipid droplets were increased in the hyperlipidemic yeast cell that was observed under the confocal microscope with BODIPY staining; Atorvastatin and Et-CAF reduced the lipid droplets. This study revealed that the anti-hyperlipidemic effect in Et-CAF has gained importance and might be used to fill the gap created by the allopathic drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029479>Altered materno-fetal transfer of 13C-polyunsaturated fatty acids in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity at conception is considered a major predictor of offspring obesity. This could by driven at least in part by an altered placental fat transfer. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We investigated the in vivo materno-fetal transfer of fatty acids (FAs) in obese pregnant women using stable isotopes.Ten obese and ten normo-weight pregnant women (control) received orally a bolus of C-labeled FAs 12 h before elective caesarean section:  (C-OA), linoleic  (C-LA) and docosahexaenoic  (C-DHA). Maternal blood samples were collected at -12 (basal), -8, -4, -2, 0 h relative to the time of cesarean section. At the time of birth, arterial and venous cord bloods as well as placental tissue were collected. FAs composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.Maternal plasma insulin and placental weight tended to higher values in obese pregnant women although they did not present serum . Higher concentrations of C-LA and C-DHA were found in non-esterified FAs fraction in maternal plasma of obese mothers. The ratio of placental uptake for C-LA and C-DHA was lower in obese women compared to normal weight pointing toward a limited capacity of FA placental transfer, especially of essential FAs. Maternal insulin was associated to this lower placenta/maternal plasma ratio for both C-LA (R = -0.563, P = 0.012) and C-DHA (R = -0.478, P = 0.033). In addition, the ratio cord/maternal plasma of C-LA was significantly lower in obese women compared to controls.In conclusion, obese mothers without  showed a reduced materno-fetal transfer of polyunsaturated FAs which could affect fetal development.

At the end of the experiment, blood was prepared for biochemical analysis and leptin ELISA. Aorta, epididymal and mesenteric fat and liver were removed surgically, weighed and observed for histological or immunohistochemical changes.PC significantly prevented body weight gain and lipid accumulation and alleviated  by decreasing triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels and the atherogenic index in serum or by increasing the HDL/TC ratio. Aortic apoE expression and serum leptin levels were suppressed by PC treatment in the HFD-induced obese mouse model. Elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in HFD-fed mice were decreased in the PC groups.

Rutin, a common dietary flavonoid that is consumed in fruits, vegetables, and plant-derived beverages, has various biological functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. However, a hypolipidemic effect of rutin on fatty liver disease has not been reported. In this study, we examined the effect of rutin on reducing lipid accumulation in hepatic cells. Hepatocytes were treated with  (OA) containing with or without rutin to observe the lipid accumulation by Nile red stain. The result showed rutin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation and increased adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in hepatocytes. The expression of critical molecule involved in lipid synthesis, sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1), was attenuated in rutin-treated cells. Moreover, long-term incubation of rutin inhibited the transcriptions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), fatty  synthase (FAS), and acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase (ACC). Besides, we also found out the antioxidative effect of rutin by increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and antioxidative enzymes. Taken together, our findings suggest rutin could attenuate lipid accumulation by decreasing lipogenesis and oxidative stress in hepatocyte.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877525>Phase behavior of cholesterol in mixtures with hypo- and hypercholesterolemic lipids.</a></h2><p>Some lipidic bioactives are largely reported to present hypocholesterolemic effects, for example, , α-tocopherol, and octacosanol, found in rice-bran, olive, and sunflower oils. In contrast, some saturated and trans-unsaturated lipids found in animal fats or partially hydrogenated oils have been associated with the opposite effect. However, the mechanisms in which these lipids act for lowering or increasing cholesterol are not fully understood. In this context, this work was aimed at a fundamental physicochemical comprehension of how cholesterol phase behavior is affected in mixtures with these compounds. The complete solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) phase diagrams of these mixtures were depicted by differential scanning calorimetry and microscopy, and also evaluated by the SLE thermodynamic theory. The minimal melting temperature (eutectic points) of the mixtures followed the order: α-tocopherol <  < elaidic  < stearic  < octacosanol. Among all biocompounds, stearic and trans- acids promoted few changes in the normal thermodynamic behavior of cholesterol when in a mixture. In contrast, α-tocopherol induced a significant temperature depression in the system. Furthermore, at high concentrations of cholesterol (>90% molar fraction), the formation of solid solution was observed in all other systems, to a higher degree for . The higher interactions of these beneficial compounds and the formation of solid solution that literature associates with the alteration of cholesterol enteric absorption probably correlates with their hypocholesterolemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952344>Nuclear receptors and hepatic lipidogenic enzyme response to a dyslipidemic sucrose-rich diet and its reversal by fish oil n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>A sucrose-rich diet (SRD), compared with a starch diet, induces time-dependent metabolic disorders and insulin resistance with hypertriglyceridemia, similar to type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examined the effect of SRD, after 8 mo, on nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), and liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), and Delta6 and Delta5 desaturases mRNA and activity, hepatic enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, and fatty  (FA) composition as well as the reversal produced by cod liver oil. SRD induced triglyceride increase in plasma and liver, increasing the anabolic FA synthase, malic enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, but not the prooxidative enzymes FA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, and correspondingly decreased PPARalpha and increased LXRalpha expressions. Results suggest a contribution of both nuclear receptors' interaction on these enzymatic activities. SRD depressed SCD-1 without altering  proportion and increased Delta6 and Delta5 desaturases and the proportion of n-6 arachidonic . Therefore, the data do not support that SRD hypertriglyceridemia is produced by increased SCD-1-dependent  biosynthesis. The administration of 7% cod liver oil for 2 mo depressed LXRalpha, enhancing PPARalpha in control and SRD-fed rats, reversing the activity of the hepatic enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and therefore the  produced by the SRD. Fish oil increased n-3 PUFA and depressed n-6 PUFA of liver lipids without altering the 18:1/18:0 ratio, suggesting that its effects were produced mainly by competition of dietary n-6 and n-3 FA and not through desaturase activity modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346411>The cold-induced lipokine 12,13-diHOME promotes fatty  transport into brown adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipose tissue combust fuels for heat production in adult humans, and so constitute an appealing target for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes and . Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty  (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23731091>Mulberry anthocyanins inhibit  induced lipid accumulation by reduction of lipogenesis and promotion of hepatic lipid clearance.</a></h2><p>Mulberry (Morus alba L.) has been considered to possess different benefits such as protecting liver; improving fever, urine excretion disorder, hypertension, and diabetic syndrome; and preventing cardiovascular diseases. Recently, mounting evidence has shown that mulberry anthocyanin extract (MAE) is beneficial to ; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. The present study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of MAE on hepatocyte cultured with high fatty  and the underlying mechanisms. By using human hepatoma cell HepG2 as cell model, the results showed that MAE suppressed fatty  synthesis and enhanced fatty  oxidation, contributing to amelioration of lipid accumulation induced by  (OA). Moreover, MAE also inhibited acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) activities by stimulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). MAE attenuated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its target molecules, such as fatty  synthase (FAS). Similar results were also found in the expressions of enzymes involved in triglyceride and cholesterol biosyntheses including glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCoR), adipocyte-specific fatty  binding protein (A-FABP), and SREBP-2. In contrast, the lipolytic enzyme expressions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and carnitinepalmitol- transferase-1 (CPT1) were increased. This study suggests the hypolipidemic effects of MAE occur via phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of lipid biosynthesis and stimulation of lipolysis. Therefore, the mulberry anthocyanins may actively prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12074102>Long-term melatonin administration increases polyunsaturated fatty  percentage in plasma lipids of hypercholesterolemic rats.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate the effect of melatonin on the fatty  composition of plasma and tissue lipids. Melatonin administration to rats fed with a standard diet only increased long-chain n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in total plasma lipids and liver phospholipids but induced significant changes in hypercholesterolemic rats. In plasma, palmitoleic and  acids increased and n-6 and n-3 PUFA decreased in hypercholesterolemic rats; theses changes were reversed by melatonin administration. The analysis of lipid fractions revealed that only the cholesteryl ester fraction was affected by melatonin. Histological studies of the carotid artery intima revealed the appearance, in hypercholesterolemic rats, of fatty streaks produced by a mass of foam cells covered by the endothelium and by a thin layer of mononucleated cells. These changes were prevented by melatonin. We conclude that long-term melatonin administration modifies the fatty  composition of rat plasma and liver lipids and ameliorates the arterial fatty infiltration induced by cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680004>Gemfibrozil reduces lipid accumulation in SMMC-7721 cells via the involvement of PPARα and SREBP1.</a></h2><p>Gemfibrozil (GEM) is a member of the fibrate class of lipid-lowering pharmaceuticals and has been widely used in the therapy of different forms of  and hypercholesterolemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is becoming an important public health concern worldwide. However, there is little knowledge about the effects of GEM on NAFLD. In the present study, oleate-treated human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells were utilized to investigate the role of GEM in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The present results demonstrated that GEM attenuated excessive intracellular triglyceride content in the steatosis model. Upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) protein and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was detected following treatment with GEM. Additionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that GEM increased the downstream genes related to PPARα and SREBP1, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, acyl-coA oxidase 1, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, LIPIN1 and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1. These findings demonstrated that GEM alleviated hepatic steatosis via the involvement of the PPARα and SREBP1 signaling pathways, which enhances lipid oxidation and interferes with lipid synthesis and secretion. Taken together, the data provide direct evidence that GEM may lower lipid accumulation in hepatocellular steatosis cells  and that it may have a potential therapeutic use for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031723>Inhibition of cholinergic potentiation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets by chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids: Protection by casein kinase 2 inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Chronic  and hyperglycemia are characteristic features of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are thought to cause or contribute to β-cell dysfunction by "glucolipotoxicity." Previously we have shown that acute treatment of pancreatic islets with fatty acids (FA) decreases acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion. This acetylcholine response is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, which play a key role in regulating β-cell function. Here we examine whether chronic FA exposure also inhibits acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion using mouse and human islets.Islets were cultured for 3 or 4 days at different glucose concentration with 0.5 mM palmitic  (PA) or a 2:1 mixture of PA and  (OA) at 1% albumin (PA/BSA molar ratio 3.3). Afterwards, the response to glucose and acetylcholine were studied in perifusion experiments.FA-induced impairment of insulin secretion and Ca signaling depended strongly on the glucose concentrations of the culture medium. PA and OA in combination reduced acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion more than PA alone, both in mouse and human islets, with no evidence of a protective role of OA. In contrast, lipotoxicity was not observed with islets cultured for 3 days in medium containing less than 1 mM glucose and a mixture of glutamine and leucine (7 mM each). High glucose and FAs reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca storage capacity; however, preserving ER Ca by blocking the IP3 receptor with xestospongin C did not protect islets from glucolipotoxic effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, an inhibitor of casein kinase 2 (CK2) protected the glucose dependent acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion in mouse and human islets against glucolipotoxicity.These results show that chronic FA treatment decreases acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion and that this effect is strictly glucose dependent and might involve CK2 phosphorylation of β-cell M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and Liver Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937936>Morin reduces inflammatory responses and alleviates lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Morin (MO), a natural bioflavinoid, exists in many herbs. Previous studies have acclaimed MO's anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antifibrotic, anticancer, and antihyperglycemic biological effects. This study aimed to assess the molecular mechanism of MO involved in the  (OA)-induced inflammatory damage and lipid accumulation in HepG2 cell and tyloxapol (Ty)-induced  in mice. We found that MO can efficaciously mitigate reactive tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice. Next, the study testified that MO apparently suppressed OA-excited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways in HepG2 cell. In addition, MO distinctly upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and decreased the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, these results suggest that MO has protective potential against  and steatosis, and the potential mechanism may have a close relation with activation of PPARα and inhibition of SREBP-1c.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8925448>Exogenous hypercholesterolemic rats, compared with their progenitor, Sprague-Dawley rats, promptly alter cholesterol metabolism in the liver and secrete cholesterol-rich particles in response to dietary cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Early responses of cholesterol metabolism to dietary cholesterol were compared between exogenous hypercholesterolemic (ExHC) and Sprague-Dawley rats. Both strains had a similar radioactivity of [14C]cholesterol in the serum half a day after the oral administration, but thereafter the radioactivity disappeared slowly in ExHC rats. ExHC rats promptly altered in response to the dietary cholesterol, activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and fecal excretion of bile acids derived from [14C]cholesterol administered orally. Lymphatic transport for 24 hr [14C]cholesterol was similar between the strains. Triton administration resulted in a marked accumulation of cholesterol in serum d > 1.006 g/mL lipoproteins in ExHC rats; in addition, the formation of cholesteryl esters from [14C] intravenously infused was greater in ExHC rats.

Presumably, the duration of lag period during oxidation of arachidonic  and formation of conjugated dienes is determined also by the content of triglycerides and  fatty  in low density lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9360638>Apolipoprotein E R112; R251G: a carboxy-terminal variant found in patients with  and coronary heart disease.</a></h2><p>A 49 year-old hypercholesterolemic male with marked electrocardiographic ST segment depression on exercise testing was found to have an apo E E3/3 phenotype by isoelectric focusing, but an APOE E4/3 genotype using HhaI restriction isotyping. DNA sequence analysis of the proband's APOE gene found a G-->C point mutation at codon 251. This predicted a change in the amino  encoded by codon 251, from arginine to glycine. The mutation occurred on an allele that encoded arginine at position 112 and this variant was named APOE R112; R251G. The R251G change altered a recognition site for the endonuclease StuI and was the basis for a restriction isotyping method to rapidly screen for this mutation. In relatives of the proband, APOE R112; R251G was consistently found in subjects with both  and atherosclerosis. Apo E R112; R251G-containing very low density lipoproteins bound normally to macrophages in vitro. However, the proband had an abnormal post-prandial lipoprotein response to a dietary fat challenge. The association of APOE R112; R251G with abnormal phenotypes suggests that the amino  change in the carboxy-terminal, perhaps in combination with the common amino  polymorphism at codon 112, has a functional impact upon lipoprotein metabolism in members of this family.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805986>Inhibition of TREM-1 attenuates inflammation and lipid accumulation in diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>In the liver tissues of obese diabetic or nondiabetic patients, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is usually found to be upregulated, thus leading to upregulation of various inflammatory cytokines and lipid accumulation. On the other hand, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excess lipid accumulation, and inflammatory injury in liver, is becoming an epidemic disease, globally. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biological role and the underlying mechanisms of TREM-1 in NAFLD. upregulation of TREM-1 occurred in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice NAFLD model and -treated HepG2 and primary mouse hepatocytes cell model at messenger RNA and protein levels. Functional studies established that overexpression of TREM-1 displayed , and increased in inflammatory indicators and lipid accumulation-related genes, which was ameliorated by knockdown of TREM-1. Our results also showed that obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory injury occurred in the liver tissue of HFD-fed mice, while treatment with lentiviral vector short hairpin TREM showed marked improvement in tissue morphology and architecture and less lipid accumulation, thus deciphering the mechanism through which knockdown of TREM-1 ameliorated the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation of NAFLD mice through inactivation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and PI3K/AKT signal pathways, respectively. In conclusion, TREM-1/NF-κB and TREM-1/PI3K/AKT axis could be an important mechanism in ameliorating the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation, respectively, thus shedding light on the development of novel therapeutics to the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of , the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, lipotoxicity is indicated in GLP-1 secreting cells following long-term exposure to elevated levels of saturated FAs (SFAs) in vivo and in vitro, where in vitro studies indicate that cosupplementation with MUFAs confers lipoprotection. SFAs and MUFAs differentially affect the fate of cells in ways that depend on the cell type, concentration and ratio of the FAs. The present study was designed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of SFAs/MUFAs on GLP-1-producing cells in terms of lipotoxicity/lipoprotection and GLP-1 secretion.Cultured GLP-1 secreting cells were exposed to  simulated by SFA-albumin complexes where the molar ratio was 2:1. The cellular response to simulated  was assessed in the presence/absence of MUFA cosupplementation by determining intracellular ceramide, ROS, neutral lipid accumulation, and cellular respiration. The role for cellular respiration in GLP-1 secretion in response to SFAs/MUFAs was assessed.Generation of intracellular ceramide mediate a detrimental increased in ROS production following long term exposure to SFAs in GLP-1-secreting cells. Cosupplementation with MUFAs increases cellular respiration, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of ceramide kinase, while reducing ceramide synthesis and attenuating ROS production, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Further, acute secretory effects of unsaturated FAs are independent of FAO, but mediated by a FFAR1 induced increase in cellular respiration.This study demonstrates novel data supporting effects of MUFAs on the ceramide biosynthetic pathway, triglyceride storage respiration and secretion in GLP-1 secreting cells. These findings may be of value for nutritional interventions, as well as for identification of novel targets, to help preserve L-cell mass and potentiate GLP-1 secretion in diabesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The aim of this study was to investigate the lipid-modifying potential of organic solvent-partitioned extracts from fruiting bodies of Amauroderma rugosum in vitro using oleate-induced human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results demonstrated that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with ethyl acetate (EA) extract greatly decreased intracellular and secreted total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) compared with other extracts. Further investigation of cellular expression of selected apolipoproteins also revealed that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with the EA extract best attenuated the apolipoprotein (Apo) profile by downregulating ApoB-100 and ApoE while upregulating ApoA1. Because both ApoB-100 and ApoE are key components of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL), which are recognized as "bad cholesterol," this result indicates that treatment with the EA extract inhibited LDL and VLDL production in oleate-induced HepG2 cells. On the other hand, increasing ApoA1 evidence shows antiatherogenic benefits to increasing ApoA1, the key component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), particularly in relation to its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport and preventing LDL oxidation; this indicates that the EA extract upregulated the production of HDL ("good cholesterol"). Hence, the EA extract is a good source of lipid-ameliorating agents in the management of dyslipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875216>High- rapeseed (canola) and flaxseed oils modulate serum lipids and inflammatory biomarkers in hypercholesterolaemic subjects.</a></h2><p>Recently, novel dietary oils with modified fatty  profiles have been manufactured to improve fatty  intakes and reduce CVD risk. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of novel high- rapeseed (canola) oil (HOCO), alone or blended with flaxseed oil (FXCO), on circulating lipids and inflammatory biomarkers v. a typical Western diet (WD). Using a randomised, controlled, crossover trial, thirty-six hypercholesterolaemic subjects consumed three isoenergetic diets for 28 d each containing approximately 36% energy from fat, of which 70% was provided by HOCO, FXCO or WD. Dietary fat content of SFA, MUFA, PUFA n-6 and n-3 was 6, 23, 5, 1% energy for HOCO; 6, 16, 5, 7·5% energy for FXCO; 11·5, 16, 6, 0·5% energy for WD. After 28 d, compared with WD, LDL-cholesterol was reduced 15·1% (P < 0·001) with FXCO and 7·4% (P < 0·001) with HOCO. Total cholesterol (TC) was reduced 11% (P < 0·001) with FXCO and 3·5% (P = 0·002) with HOCO compared with WD. Endpoint TC differed between FXCO and HOCO (P < 0·05). FXCO consumption reduced HDL-cholesterol by 8·5% (P < 0·001) and LDL:HDL ratio by 7·5% (P = 0·008) v. WD. FXCO significantly decreased E-selectin concentration compared with WD (P = 0·02). No differences were observed in inflammatory markers after the consumption of HOCO compared with WD. In conclusion, consumption of novel HOCO alone or when blended with flaxseed oil is cardioprotective through lipid-lowering effects. The incorporation of flaxseed oil may also target inflammation by reducing plasma E-selectin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16132689>Effect of Sargassum polycystum (Phaeophyceae)-sulphated polysaccharide extract against acetaminophen-induced  during toxic hepatitis in experimental rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of Sargassum polycystum crude extract on lipid metabolism was examined against acetaminophen-induced (800 mg/kg body wt., intraperitoneally)  during toxic hepatitis in experimental rats. The animals intoxicated with acetaminophen showed significant elevation in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty  in both serum and liver tissue. The levels of tissue total lipids and serum LDL-cholesterol were also elevated with depleted levels of serum HDL-cholesterol and tissue phospholipid. The acetaminophen-induced animals showed significant alterations in the activities of lipid metabolizing enzymes serum lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL). The levels of liver tissue fatty acids (saturated, mono and polyunsaturated) such as palmitic , stearic , , linoleic , arachidonic  and linolenic  monitored by gas chromatography were considerably altered in acetaminophen intoxicated animals when compared with control animals. The prior oral administration of Sargassum polycystum (200 mg/kg body wt./day for a period of 15 days) crude extract showed considerable prevention in the severe disturbances of lipid profile and metabolizing enzymes triggered by acetaminophen during hepatic injury. Liver histology also showed convincing supportive evidence regarding their protective nature against fatty changes induced during acetaminophen intoxication. Thus the present study indicates that the protective nature of Sargassum polycystum extract may be due to the presence of active compounds possessing antilipemic property against acetaminophen challenge.(Mol Cell Biochem 276: 89-96, 2005).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16756155>[Fibrate-induced changes in the serum lipid contents of individual C16 and C18 fatty acids in patients with ].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10423617>Effect of probucol therapy on plasma fatty  composition during postprandial lipemia in hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of probucol (PR) on fatty  composition of plasma lipids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia during the fasting and postprandial states.Open-label, single-center, 6-week treatment, baseline-controlled trial.Outpatient clinical research center.Six patients with established hypertriglyceridemia and no complicating medical conditions.Step 1 American Heart Association diet and no lipid-lowering medications for at least 4 weeks.

After 6 weeks of treatment with 500-mg of PR twice daily and diet, the meal tests were repeated.The clinical status, 3-day food records, postprandial blood samplings (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours) for lipid and fatty acids in whole plasma, triglyceride (TG), phospholipid (PL), and cholesteryl ester (CE) fractions.PR had the following effects: (1) In plasma, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, and ApoB were decreased postprandially. ApoC111 ratio (heparin-treated plasma versus precipitate) was decreased in the fasting state. (2) The saturated/unsaturated (S/U) fatty  ratios in the PL, TG, and CE fractions were elevated postprandially and increased in CE in the fasting state. In the PL fraction it was due to an increase in the percentage of myristic, palmitic, stearic, and  acids and a decrease in linolenic, eicosatrienoic, and arachidonic acids. In the TG and CE fractions the changes were not due to any particular patterns of fatty acids. The ratio of arachidonic/eicosatrienoic  was decreased postprandially in PL and CE fractions. The ratio of eicosatrienoic/linoleic  was decreased in PL and increased in CE fractions. (3) The S/U ratio in the lipoprotein (Lp) B and LP(a) lipid components decreased in PL and CE. Lp(a) was more saturated with respect to fatty acids than LpB.PR treatment for 6 weeks increased postprandial S/U fatty  ratios. This was due to a combination of an increase in saturated and monounsaturated levels and a decrease in polyunsaturated levels. The effect was most notable in the PL fraction. In those systems dependent on the pattern of fatty acids, the fatty  compositional change could modify biological responses in clinically important ways during lipid-lowering therapy. The change toward saturation of fatty acids in the postprandial state may contribute to the antioxidant properties of probucol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12053756>[Effect of fibrates on VLDL and LDL lipoprotein composition and parameters of their oxidation in hypertriglyceridemia].</a></h2><p>Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies proved that hypertriacylglycerolemia (HTAG) is an independent CHD risk factor. The VLDL lipoproteins, which are the main TAG carrier, are precursors of atherogenic LDL and their increased concentration is related to the decrease of antiatherogenic HDL, increased ratio of small, dense LDL and represents one of the causes of the endothelial dysfunction. According to some authors, HTAG is one of the factors of the oxidation stress.45 patients of the studied group received 200 mg of micronized fenofibrate per day for six weeks. Before the beginning and after the end of treatment, following examinations were carried out: concentration of plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins, composition of fatty acids (FA) in main lipid plasma classes and LDL (phosphatidylcholine--PC, TAG, cholesteryl esters--CE) and lipoperoxidation in VLDL and LDL, isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation.In plasma, the treatment of HTAG led to a significant decrease of TC, TAG and apo-B concentration and to the increase of cholesterol concentration in HDL and in both HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions. In isolated LDL particles we observed a decrease of the TAG portion (by 25%) together with significant lag phase prolongation (by 33%, P < 0.05) and peak time retardation (by 24%, P < 0.05). In VLDL particles the concentration of cholesterol became smaller (by 28%), TAG (by 26%), phospholipids (by 28%) (in all groups P < 0.005) and the lag phase became significantly longer (by 16%, P < 0.01). Treatment with fenofibrate significantly reduced the linoleic  (18:2n-6) in PC and TAG plasma, CE and TG LDL, in a higher ratio of palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) in CE LDL,  (18:1n-9) in PC LDL, in significant concentration of total monoenic FA in PC and CE LDL and to a significant increase of the concentration of myristic  (14:0) in CE and myristic and stearic acids (18:0) in TAG LDL. From our results it is possible to conclude that the six-week long treatment of HTAG with micronized phenofibrate led to significant modification of LDL and VLDL composition accompanied by their lower lipoperoxidation indexes. These favourable changes in oxidability were accompanied with changes in the composition of FA in CE, TAG and PC plasma as well as LDL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8740580>Cholesteryl ester transfer activity in liver disease and cholestasis, and its relation with fatty  composition of lipoprotein lipids.</a></h2><p>Liver disease is accompanied by major qualitative and quantitative disturbances in plasma lipoprotein metabolism, the extent and intensity of which depend on the degree of parenchymal damage, cholestasis, or both. The main objective of this study was to determine the cholesteryl ester transfer CETP activity and its association with the lipoprotein neutral lipid composition in patients with either liver cirrhosis or cholestasis, as compared to normal controls. Lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation, lipids and apolipoproteins were measured by conventional methods, and the fatty  composition was established by gas chromatography; CETP activity in lipoprotein-deficient plasma was measured by determining the transfer of [3H]cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL. Lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities were measured in post-heparin plasma by radiochemical methods. In patients with liver cirrhosis, low levels of VLDL, HDL, apo B, and Lp(a) were observed, as well as a change in the composition of HDL particles, with increases in the relative proportion of triglyceride and free cholesterol. Respectively, the last two changes could be attributed in part to the low hepatic lipase activity observed in this study, and to the low lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity previously observed by others. In patients with cholestasis, a moderate  due to the elevation of LDL was found. In contrast, HDL and apo A-I levels were very low reflecting a low number of HDL particles, which also had altered compositions with increases in the triglyceride and free cholesterol contents relative to apo A-I and esterified cholesterol, respectively. As regards the fatty  composition of lipoprotein lipids, the two groups of patients showed, in general, a lower proportion of linoleic  and a compensating higher proportion of  as compared to the controls, changes that were observed in both cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. In contrast, the proportions of  and palmitoleic acids in phospholipids were increased, whereas that of stearic  was decreased in patients as compared to controls. In patients with liver cirrhosis, as well as in controls, no changes were observed in the fatty  compositions of cholesteryl ester, triglycerides, or phospholipids among the different lipoproteins, which probably reflects the equilibration reached by the action of CETP. In patients with cholestasis, no differences were observed in fatty  composition among the lipoprotein phospholipids but, interestingly, cholesteryl esters from VLDL had a significantly lower linoleic  content than those from HDL, whereas triglycerides from VLDL had significantly higher  and lower linoleic  contents than those from HDL. This distinct fatty  composition of the neutral lipids between lipoproteins was associated with a significant decrease (25%) in the cholesteryl ester transfer activity in patients with cholestasis. We suggest that fat malabsorption due to the biliary defect may induce a decrease in cholesteryl ester transfer protein synthesis or section, which in turn would slow the equilibration of the neutral lipids among plasma lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8988911>Comparison of the effects of medium-chain triacylglycerols, palm oil, and high  sunflower oil on plasma triacylglycerol fatty acids and lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in humans.</a></h2><p>Although medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs, composed of medium-chain fatty acids 8:0 and 10:0) have long been described as having neutral effects on serum cholesterol concentrations, experimental evidence supporting this claim is limited. In a randomized, crossover, metabolic-ward study, we compared the lipid effects of a natural food diet supplemented with either MCTs, palm oil, or high  sunflower oil in nine middle-aged men with mild hypercholesterolemia. Rather than having a neutral effect, MCT oil produced total cholesterol concentrations that were not significantly different from those produced by palm oil (MCT oil: 5.87 +/- 0.75 mmol/L; palm oil: 5.79 +/- 0.72 mmol/L) but significantly higher than that produced by high  sunflower oil (5.22 +/- 0.52 mmol/L). Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations paralleled those of total cholesterol. MCT oil tended to result in higher triacylglycerol concentrations than either palm oil or high  sunflower oil, but this difference was not significant. There were no differences in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The palmitic  and total saturated fatty  content of plasma triacylglycerols in the MCT-oil diet was not significantly different from that in the palm oil diet. On the basis of percentage of energy, this study suggests that medium-chain fatty acids have one-half the potency that palmitic  has at raising total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26000608>CD36 Mediated Fatty -Induced Podocyte Apoptosis via Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>-induced apoptosis mediated by fatty  translocase CD36 is associated with increased uptake of ox-LDL or fatty  in macrophages, hepatocytes and proximal tubular epithelial cells, leading to atherosclerosis, liver damage and fibrosis in obese patients, and diabetic nephropathy (DN), respectively.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 statistical software.CD36 expression was increased in kidney tissue from DN patients with . Palmitic  upregulated CD36 expression and promoted its translocation from cytoplasm to plasma membrane in podocytes. Furthermore, palmitic  increased lipid uptake, ROS production and apoptosis in podocytes, Sulfo-N-succinimidyloleate (SSO), the specific inhibitor of the fatty  binding site on CD36, decreased palmitic -induced fatty  accumulation, ROS production, and apoptosis in podocytes.

Overexpression of PGC-1alpha impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, it is not well known which metabolic events lead to upregulation of PGC-1alpha in the beta-cells under pathophysiological condition. In present study, we have investigated effects of chronic  and hyperglycemia on PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in isolated rat islets. Isolated rat islets are chronically incubated with 0, 0.2 and 0.4 mM /palmitic  (free fatty acids, FFA) or 5.5 and 25 mM glucose for 72 h. FFA dose-dependently increases PGC-1alpha mRNA expression level in isolated islets. FFA also increases PGC-1alpha expression in mouse beta-cell-derived beta TC3 cell line. In contrast, 25 mM glucose decreases expression level of PGC-1alpha. Inhibition of PGC-1alpha by siRNA improves FFA-induced impairment of GSIS in islets.

The analyses of ex vivo complex lipid mixtures were made directly with EASI-MS without accompanying separation steps. Intense ions for phosphatidylcholines and triacylglycerols were observed in the positive ion mode whereas the spectra in the negative ion mode provided profiles of phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositol. EASI-MS was coupled to high-performance thin-layer chromatography for analysis of free fatty acids. Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry was also employed to confirm the identity of the detected lipids. We demonstrated higher incorporation of  in phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol composition, higher relative abundance of arachidonic  containing phosphatidylinositol, and overall distinct free fatty  profile in the livers of genetic hypertriglyceridemic mice. We propose that these alterations in liver lipid composition are related to the higher tissue and body metabolic rates described in these hypertriglyceridemic mice.</p></html>
