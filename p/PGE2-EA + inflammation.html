Pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are important in the generation and maintenance of . While colitis is associated with upregulated COX-2 -derived prostanoids and nitric oxide (NO), the direct activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines on human colonic neuromuscular function is less clear. This study investigated the effects of IBD-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β and LPS on human colonic muscle strip contractility, alone and following inhibition of COX-2 or nitric oxide production. In addition, human colonic epithelial Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with LPS or COX-2 mediators including prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2α) or their corresponding ethanolamides ( or PGF2α-EA) over 48h and trans-epithelial electrical resistance used to record permeability changes. Longitudinal muscle strips were obtained from healthy colonic resection margins and mounted in organ baths following IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β and bacterial LPS incubations in an explant setting over 20h. Contraction in response to acetylcholine (ACh) was then measured, before and after either COX-2 inhibition (nimesulide; 10(-5)M) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition (l-NNA; 10(-4)M). None of the cytokine or LPS explant incubations affected the potency or maximum cholinergic contraction in vitro, and subsequent COX-2 blockade with nimesulide revealed a significant but similar decrease in potency of ACh-evoked contraction in control, LPS and cytokine-incubated muscle strips. Pre-treatment with l-NNA provided no functional differences in the potency or maximum contractile responses to ACh in cytokine or LPS-incubated colonic longitudinal smooth muscle. Only PGE2 transiently increased Caco-2 monolayer permeability at 24h, while LPS (10μg/ml) increased permeability over 24-48h. These findings indicate that cholinergic contractility in the human colon can be decreased by the blockade of COX-2 generated excitatory prostanoids, but major pro-inflammatory cytokines or LPS do not alter the sensitivity or amplitude of this contraction ex vivo. While PGE2 transiently increase epithelial permeability, LPS generates a significant and sustained increase in permeability indicative of an important role on barrier function at the mucosal interface.Crown Copyright © 2016.

The purpose of this study was to establish and characterize an in vitro model of endometrial  using bovine endometrial epithelial (bEEL) and stromal (bCSC) cell lines. We evaluated the effects of the infectious agent (bacterial lipopolysaccharide; LPS) and pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and TNFα) on eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway gene expression and production by bEEL and bCSC cells. Based on concentration-response experiments, the optimal concentrations for responses were 1 μg/mL LPS, 10 ng/mL IL-1β and 50 ng/mL TNFα. Real-time PCR results show that there was an upregulation of relative mRNA expression of PTGS2 when bEEL and bCSC were treated with LPS, IL-1β and TNFα. An increase in PTGES3 expression was observed when bEEL cells were treated with LPS and IL-1β and PTGES2 when treated with IL-1β. In bCSC cells, FAAH relative mRNA was decreased upon treatments. Rate of production of PGE, PGF, PGE-EA and PGF-EA were also determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Our results show that eicosanoid production was increased in both cell lines in response to LPS, IL-1β, and TNFα. We suggest that the characteristics of bEEL and bCSC cell lines mimic the physiological responses found in mammals with endometrial infection, making them excellent in vitro models for intrauterine environment studies.Copyright © 2018 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.

These effects are related, in part, to their metabolism by eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes. For example, -arachidonoyl-ethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol can be metabolized by cyclooxygenase-2 into PG-ethanolamide (PG-EA) and PG-glycerol (PG-G), respectively. Although PGE is a recognized suppressor of neutrophil functions, the impact of cyclooxygenase-derived endocannabinoids such as PGE-EA or PGE-G on neutrophils is unknown. This study's aim was to define the effects of these mediators on neutrophil functions and the underlying cellular mechanisms involved. We show that PGE-G, but not PGE-EA, inhibits leukotriene B biosynthesis, superoxide production, migration, and antimicrobial peptide release. The effects of PGE-G were prevented by EP/EP receptor antagonist AH-6809 but not the EP antagonist ONO-AE2-227. The effects of PGE-G required its hydrolysis into PGE, were not observed with the non-hydrolyzable PGE-serinol amide, and were completely prevented by methyl-arachidonoyl-fluorophosphate and palmostatin B, and partially prevented by JZL184 and WWL113. Although we could detect six of the documented PG-G hydrolases in neutrophils by quantitative PCR, only ABHD12 and ABHD16A were detected by immunoblot. Our pharmacological data, combined with our protein expression data, did not allow us to pinpoint one PGE-G lipase, and rather support the involvement of an uncharacterized lipase and/or of multiple hydrolases. In conclusion, we show that PGE-G inhibits human neutrophil functions through its hydrolysis into PGE, and by activating the EP receptor. This also indicates that neutrophils could regulate  by altering the balance between PG-G and PG levels in vivo.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p></html>
