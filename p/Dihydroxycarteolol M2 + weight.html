Household food insecurity was self-reported using a validated 2-item screener. Dietary intake was assessed using the 26-item National Cancer Institute's Dietary Screener Questionnaire, and dietary behaviors were assessed using a household survey. Data were analyzed using multilevel statistical models, including tests for interaction by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.Children from food-insecure households had higher BMI-z (β: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.21), waist circumference (β: 0.91 cm; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.63), odds of being overweight or obese (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34), consumed more sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages (β: 1.44 g/d; 95% CI: 0.35, 2.54), and less frequently ate breakfast (β: -0.28 d/wk; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.17) and dinner with family (β: -0.22 d/wk; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.06) compared to children from food-secure households. When examined by age groups (4-9 and 10-15 y), significant relationships were observed only for older children. There were no significant interactions by sex or race/ethnicity.Household food insecurity was associated with higher child adiposity-related outcomes and several nutrition behaviors, particularly among older children, 10-15 y old.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321243>Local Administration of Caloric Restriction Mimetics to Promote the Immune Control of Lung Metastases.</a></h2><p>Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs), compounds that mimic the biochemical effects of nutrient deprivation, administered via systemic route promote antitumor effects through the induction of autophagy and the modulation of the immune microenvironment; however, collateral effects due to metabolic changes and the possible  loss might potentially limit their administration at long term. Here, we investigated in mice local administration of CRMs via aerosol to reduce metastasis implantation in the lung, whose physiologic immunosuppressive status favors tumor growth. Hydroxycitrate, spermidine, and alpha-lipoic acid, CRMs that target different metabolic enzymes, administered by aerosol, strongly reduced implantation of intravenously injected B16 melanoma cells without overt signs of toxicity, such as  loss and changes in lung structure. Cytofluorimetric analysis of lung immune infiltrates revealed a significant increase of alveolar macrophages and CD103+ dendritic cells in mice treated with CRMs that paralleled an increased recruitment and activation of both CD3 T lymphocytes and NK cells. These effects were associated with the upregulation of genes related to M1 phenotype, as IL-12 and STAT-1, and to the decrease of  genes, as IL-10 and STAT-6, in adherent fraction of lung immune infiltrate, as revealed by real-time PCR analysis. Thus, in this proof-of-principle study, we highlight the antitumor effect of CRM aerosol delivery as a new and noninvasive therapeutic approach to locally modulate immunosurveillance at the tumor site in the lung.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248020>Behavioral Determinants of Objectively Assessed Diet Quality in Obese Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Interventions to promote healthy pregnancy in women with obesity by improving diet quality have been widely unsuccessful. We hypothesized that diet quality is determined by eating behaviors, but evidence in women with obesity is lacking. We evaluated diet quality and eating behavior in 56 women with obesity (mean ± SEM, 36.7 ± 0.7 kg/, 46% White, 50% nulliparous) early in pregnancy (14.9 ± 0.1 weeks). Diet quality was objectively assessed with food photography over six days and defined by Healthy Eating Index. Eating behaviors were assessed by validated questionnaires. Women reported consuming diets high in fat (38 ± 1% of energy) and the HEI was considered "poor" on average (46.7 ± 1.3), and for 71% of women. Diet quality was independently associated with education level ( 0.01), food cravings ( < 0.01), and awareness towards eating ( 0.01). Cravings for sweets and fast foods were positively correlated with respective intakes of these foods ( < 0.01 and  0.04, respectively), whereas cravings for fruits and vegetables did not relate to diet intake. We provide evidence of the determinants of poor diet quality in pregnant women with obesity. Based on this observational study, strategies to improve diet quality and pregnancy outcomes are to satisfy cravings for healthy snacks and foods, and to promote awareness towards eating behaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246958>Mid-upper arm circumference predicts death in adult patients admitted to a TB ward in the Philippines: A prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>The Philippines is ranked 3rd globally for tuberculosis incidence (554/100,000 population). The tuberculosis ward at San Lazaro Hospital, Manila receives 1,800-2,000 admissions of acutely unwell patients per year with high mortality. Objectives of this prospective cohort study were to quantify the association of under-nutrition (primary) and diabetes (secondary) with inpatient mortality occurring between 3-28 days of hospital admission in patients with suspected or previously diagnosed TB.We enrolled 360 adults (≥18 years); 348 were eligible for the primary analysis (alive on day 3). Clinical, laboratory, anthropometric and enhanced tuberculosis diagnostic data were collected at admission with telephone tracing for mortality up to 6 months post-discharge. In the primary analysis population (mean age 45 years, SD = 15.0 years, 70% male), 58 (16.7%) deaths occurred between day 3-28 of admission; 70 (20.1%) between day 3 and discharge and documented total post-day 3 mortality including follow-up was 96 (27.6%). In those in whom it could be assessed,  mass index (BMI) ranged from 11.2-30.6 kg/ and 141/303 (46.5%) had moderate/severe undernutrition (BMI<17 kg/). A sex-specific cut-off for mid-upper arm circumference predictive of BMI<17 kg/ was associated with inpatient Day 3-28 mortality in males (AOR = 5.04, 95% CI: 1.50-16.86; p = 0.009; p = 0.032 for interaction by sex). The inability to stand for /height for BMI assessment was also associated with mortality (AOR = 5.59; 95% CI 2.25-13.89; p<0.001) as was severe compared to normal/mild anaemia (AOR = 9.67; 95% CI 2.48-37.76; p<0.001). No TB specific variables were associated with Day 3-28 mortality, nor was diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5% or diabetes treatment). Similar effects were observed when the same multivariable model was applied to confirmed TB patients only and to the outcome of all post-day 3 in-patient mortality.This research supports the use of mid-upper arm circumference for triaging acutely unwell patients and the design and testing of nutrition-based interventions to improve patient outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465465>Association of frequency of television watching with overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in India: Evidence from a nationally representative study.</a></h2><p>For women of reproductive age, overweight and obesity are an established risk factor for several medical complications. To address the increasing rate of obesity in India through public health awareness programs, the association between common behaviors and overweight and obesity needs to be investigated. This study aims to determine whether there is any association between the frequency of television watching and overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in India.This is a cross-sectional study that utilized data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which utilized a nationally representative sample from all 29 states and 7 union territories of India. The survey itself followed a two-staged stratified random sampling technique. The primary outcome of interest was overweight (23.0 kg/ to <27.5 kg/) and obesity (≥27.5 kg/), measured by using the Asian  mass index cut-off. The major explanatory variable was the frequency of television watching, measured in days per week. Sample  of NFHS-4 was adjusted during the analysis. Multilevel ordered logistic regression was conducted to identify the factors associated with overweight and obesity. To show the strength of association, both the unadjusted Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) were reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The analysis included weighted data from 644,006 Indian women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Among the respondents, 33.5% were overweight or obese (BMI ≥23.0 kg/). The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with age (p-value <0.0001) and almost half of the women aged 35-49 years were either overweight or obese (48.6%). The prevalence was significantly higher among those living in an urban area compared to a rural area (urban 46.5% vs. rural 26.5%; p-value <0.001). The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with the frequency of watching television and was the highest among the individuals who reported watching television almost every day (p-value <0.0001). Women watching television almost every day had 24% (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.21-1.26; p-value <0.001) increased odds of being overweight and obese compared to their counterparts who never watched television.This study found that the likelihood of being overweight and obese significantly increased with the frequency of watching television; likely due to physical inactivity during leisure time. Further studies should examine the physical activity and food habits of this target group. Public health promotion programs in India should raise awareness regarding the harmful effects of the sedentary lifestyle associated with watching television.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225583>Total energy expenditure in patients with colorectal cancer: associations with  composition, physical activity, and energy recommendations.</a></h2><p>Total energy expenditure (TEE) data in patients with early-stage cancer are scarce, precluding an understanding of energy requirements.The objective was to cross-sectionally characterize TEE in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to compare measured TEE with energy recommendations. It was hypothesized that TEE would differ according to  mass,  composition, and physical activity level (PAL) and current energy recommendations would have poor individual-level accuracy.Patients with newly diagnosed CRC had resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry and TEE by doubly labeled water. Hypermetabolism was defined as REE > 110% of that predicted from the Mifflin St.-Jeor equation.  composition was assessed via DXA. Physical activity was determined as the ratio of TEE to REE (TEE:REE) (PAL) and residual activity energy expenditure (RAEE). TEE was compared with energy recommendations of 25-30 kcal/d and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) using Bland-Altman analyses. Patients were stratified according to median BMI, PAL, and sex-specific ratio of fat mass (FM) to fat-free mass (FFM).Twenty-one patients (M:F 14:7; mean ± SD BMI: 28.3 ± 4.9 kg/, age: 57 ± 12 y) were included. Most (n = 20) had stage II-III disease; 1 had stage IV. Approximately half (n = 11) were hypermetabolic; TEE was not different in those with hypermetabolism and REE as a percentage of predicted was not correlated with TEE. Mean ± SD TEE was 2473 ± 499 kcal/d (range: 1562-3622 kcal/d), or 29.7 ± 6.3 kcal/kg  (range: 20.4-48.5 kcal/kg ). Mean ± SD PAL was 1.43 ± 0.27. The energy recommendation of 25 kcal/kg underestimated TEE (-12.6% ± 16.5%, P = 0.002); all energy recommendations had wide limits of agreement (the smallest was DRI with measured PAL: -21.2% to 29.3%). Patients with higher BMI and FM:FFM had higher bias using kilocalories per kilogram recommendations; bias from several recommendations was frequently lower (i.e. underestimation) in patients with higher PAL and RAEE.TEE variability was not reflected in energy recommendations and error was related to ,  composition, and physical activity.

Simpler modifications such as endoscopic suturing and banding the bypass have had variable efficacy. Distalization of the bypass has resulted in a high risk of malabsorption-related complications as reported by Amor et al. (Obes Surg. 27(1):273-274, 2017); Borbély et al. (Obes Surg. 27(2):439-444, 2017); Thomopoulos et al. (Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech. 0(0):1, 2018); and Tran et al. (Obes Surg. 26(7):1627-1634, 2016). Conversion to a procedure such as duodenal switch (DS) or SADS with greater average  loss would be logical but is technically challenging and is related to a high complication rate especially with the reformation of the stomach. In this video, we present the technique that we have adapted to make this complex case reproducible minimizing operative risk.A 49-year-old female weighing 154 kg (BMI 57 kg/) with sleep apnea disease underwent a laparoscopic RYGB in 2009. She had an initial  loss of 47 kg but had complete recidivism with a  of 151 kg (BMI 56 kg/). Upper gastrointestinal (barium swallow study) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no evidence of fistula, with a normal pouch diameter and length with stoma size of 2 cm. Blood test showed no significant micro/macronutrient deficiencies. With super morbid obesity refractory to RYGB, it was our belief that conversion to SADS was the best alternative.We introduced a subcostal camera trocar with Optiview and we observed epiploic adherences to the previous anastomosis. We placed an additional trocar to remove adhesions in the re-operative field. We measured the 300 cm of the small bowel proximal to the ileocecal valve. We next divided the antecolic Roux limb from the gastric remnant preserving the left gastric artery and divided the pouch proximal to the gastrojejunal anastomosis. We identified and mobilized the remnant stomach preserving the 8 lowest branches of the right gastroepiploic artery. After reaching the angle of His, we were able to separate the remnant and the pouch. The pouch was reshaped using a 42Fr bougie for guidance. A gastrostomy was made and a matching opening was created near the lesser curvature on the remnant. We then began gastrogastric anastomosis. First, the posterior layer was done and then the bougie was placed through into the remnant. The sleeve and fundic resection was done. The bougie was replaced by an oral gastric tube and the anterior layer of the anastomosis completed. This was tested with methylene blue. We next divided the duodenum postpylorus, preserving the right gastric artery. We performed and tested a hand-sewn duodeno-ileal anastomosis with a common limb length of 300 cm. There were no intra- or postoperative complications and the patient was discharged after 2 days.We believe that this video shows a reproducible technique for this complex anastomosis. Preservation of the distal epiploics makes the gastro-gastric anastomosis safer but requires direct dissection of the duodenum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625616>Amelioration of colitis in mice by Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1 by M1 to  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of immune responses by intestine to environmental antigens leads to the chronic inflammatory disease, Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in , colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10.  macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to - macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

We hypothesized that immunosuppression (IS) dosing is a contributing factor.Using Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry data, we included all adult kidney-only transplant recipients over 2000-14 treated with prednisolone, mycophenolate and tacrolimus/cyclosporin (n = 7919). The exposure was BMI and the outcomes were time to: (i) acute rejection, (ii) fatal infection, (iii) cancer and (iv) graft; and (v) patient survival. We modelled BMI and IS dosing (in quartiles) as time-varying covariates in extended Cox models.Compared with a BMI of 25 kg/, a BMI of 35 was associated with acute rejection after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.49]. This association virtually disappeared after correcting for IS (aHR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.93-1.29). A BMI of 35 was non-significantly associated with fewer fatal infections (aHR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.66-1.25), but this reversed after adjusting for IS (aHR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.03-2.28). Results for cancer were not significantly altered after adjusting for IS. Results for lower BMI were similarly not significantly altered though generally associated with worse outcomes.Our findings show that the associations between high BMI, acute rejection and fatal infection after kidney transplantation were significantly altered after correcting for IS suggesting that relative under-dosing of obese patients may partially explain these associations.© The Author(s) 2019.

Interventions or prevention programs aiming at the pre-pregnancy period should be considered. However, how the woman's  change before pregnancy affects fetal growth is not known. We investigated the association between  change over the year before pregnancy and birth .We used the inclusion data of 16,395 women from the ELFE French national birth cohort, a nationally representative cohort in which infants were enrolled at birth with their families in 2011. Maternal  change was self-reported and classified into 3 groups: moderate  variation or stable ,  loss > 5 kg, and  gain > 5 kg or both  loss and gain > 5 kg. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the association between pre-pregnancy  change and a birth  z-score calculated according to the French Audipog reference, adjusted for a large set of maternal characteristics. The analyses were stratified by maternal  mass index (BMI) at conception (<25 versus ≥25 kg/) and adjusted for BMI within these categories. We used the MacKinnon method to test the mediating effect of gestational  gain (GWG) on these associations. Mother's mean age was 30.5 years, 87% were born in France, and 26% had overweight or obesity. For women in either BMI category at conception, GWG was more than 2 kg higher, on average, for women with  loss before pregnancy than for women with stable  or moderate  variation. For women with BMI < 25 kg/ at conception, birth  was significantly higher with  loss than stable  before pregnancy (β = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02; 0.14], p = 0.01), and this total effect was explained by a significant mediating effect through GWG. For women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/ at conception, birth  was not associated with pre-pregnancy  loss during the year before pregnancy. Mediation analysis revealed that in these women, the direct effect of pre-pregnancy  loss that would have resulted in a smaller birth  z-score (β = -0.11 [95% CI -0.19; -0.03], p = 0.01) was cancelled out by the GWG. The mediating effect of GWG was even higher when  loss resulted from a restrictive diet in the year before pregnancy.  gain before pregnancy was not associated with birth . Although we included a large number of women and had extensive data, the only potential cause of pre-pregnancy  loss that was investigated was dieting for intentional  loss. We have no information on other potential causes but did however exclude women with a history of pre-pregnancy chronic disease. Another limitation is declaration bias due to self-reported data.Health professionals should be aware that GWG may offset the expected effect of  loss before conception on fetal growth in overweight and obese women. Further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms in order to develop -control interventions and improve maternal periconceptional health and developmental conditions for the fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256194>Association between regional  fat and cardiovascular disease risk among postmenopausal women with normal  mass index.</a></h2><p>Central adiposity is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, even among people with normal  mass index (BMI). We tested the hypothesis that regional  fat deposits (trunk or leg fat) are associated with altered risk of CVD among postmenopausal women with normal BMI.We included 2683 postmenopausal women with normal BMI (18.5 to <25 kg/) who participated in the Women's Health Initiative and had no known CVD at baseline.  composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Incident CVD events including coronary heart disease and stroke were ascertained through February 2017. During a median 17.9 years of follow-up, 291 incident CVD cases occurred. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, neither whole- fat mass nor fat percentage was associated with CVD risk. Higher percent trunk fat was associated with increased risk of CVD [highest vs. lowest quartile hazard ratio (HR) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-2.74; P-trend <0.001], whereas higher percent leg fat was associated with decreased risk of CVD (highest vs. lowest quartile HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89; P-trend = 0.008). The association for trunk fat was attenuated yet remained significant after further adjustment for waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Higher percent trunk fat combined with lower percent leg fat was associated with particularly high risk of CVD (HR comparing extreme groups = 3.33, 95% CI 1.46-7.62).Among postmenopausal women with normal BMI, both elevated trunk fat and reduced leg fat are associated with increased risk of CVD.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Blood pressure was measured at baseline and after the follow-up. Anthropometry indices included  mass index (BMI),  adiposity index (BAI), the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), the waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR), and waist and hip circumferences (WC and HC). Logistic regression was employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per standard deviation (SD) increment. The operating characteristic analysis was used to derive the best cut-off value for each index.Among original 6504 participants, 2450 subjects who had no cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and HTN at baseline were revisited, and 542 (22.1%) new cases of HTN were detected. There were minimal differences between most indices in the adjusted models; however, the best HTN predictors were BMI (OR per SD 1.32; 95% CI 1.12-1.56) and almost equally WC (1.35; 1.13-1.60) in men and WC (1.20; 1.04-1.39) in women. As a binary predictor, BMI with a cut-off point of 24.9 kg/ in men (1.91; 1.40-2.62) and WC with a cut-off point of 98 cm in women (1.57; 1.17-2.10) were the best in adjusted models. WC, WHpR, and WHtR were significantly associated with an increased risk of HTN only in participants whose  was normal (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/).Therefore, BMI in men and WC in women were the best predictors of HTN, both as continuous and binary factors at their appropriate cut-off points.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340872>Women with a low-satiety phenotype show impaired appetite control and greater resistance to  loss.</a></h2><p>This trial compared  loss outcomes over 14 weeks in women showing low- or high-satiety responsiveness (low- or high-satiety phenotype (LSP, HSP)) measured by a standardised protocol. Food preferences and energy intake (EI) after low and high energy-density (LED, HED) meals were also assessed. Ninety-six women (n 52 analysed; 41·24 (SD 12·54) years; 34·02 (sd 3·58) kg/) engaged in one of two  loss programmes underwent LED and HED laboratory test days during weeks 3 and 12. Preferences for LED and HED food (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) and ad libitum evening meal and snack EI were assessed in response to equienergetic LED and HED breakfasts and lunches. Weekly questionnaires assessed control over eating and ease of adherence to the programme. Satiety quotients based on subjective fullness ratings post LED and HED breakfasts determined LSP (n 26) and HSP (n 26) by tertile splits. Results showed that the LSP lost less  and had smaller reductions in waist circumference compared with HSP. The LSP showed greater preferences for HED foods, and under HED conditions, consumed more snacks (kJ) compared with HSP. Snack EI did not differ under LED conditions. LSP reported less control over eating and reported more difficulty with programme adherence. In conclusion, low-satiety responsiveness is detrimental for  loss. LED meals can improve self-regulation of EI in the LSP, which may be beneficial for longer-term  control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352709>Switching Antipsychotics to Blonanserin in Patients with Schizophrenia: An Open-label, Prospective, Multicenter Study.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of blonanserin in schizophrenic patients who were previously treated with other antipsychotics but, due to insufficient response, were switched to blonanserin.A total of 52 patients with schizophrenia who were unresponsive to treatment with antipsychotic monotherapy or combination therapy were recruited into this 12-week, open-label, prospective, multicenter study. Patients were switched to blonanserin from their existing antipsychotics over a maximum 2-week tapering-off period. Efficacy was primarily evaluated using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Assessments were performed at baseline, and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12.Switching to blonanserin resulted in a significant decrease in the mean total score on the BPRS from baseline (56.8 ± 9.4) to week 12 (42.1 ± 13.8,  > 0.001). The most common adverse events were extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 12, 23.1%), insomnia (n = 10, 19.2%), and emotional arousal (n = 6, 11.5%). Overweight or obese patients ( mass index ≥ 23 kg/m, n = 33) who switched to blonanserin exhibited significant  loss from 75.2 ± 9.3 kg at baseline to 73.5 ± 9.2 kg at week 12 ( = 0.006).

District-specific prevalence of various NCD risk factors and their macrolevel determinants is unknown. We used National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) data to map the syndemics of obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia in Rajasthan, the largest state of the country, and correlated their prevalence with selected social determinants of health- urbanization, human development index (HDI) and literacy.Data on location-adjusted prevalence of various NCD risk factors among women (15-49y) and men (15-54y) were obtained from NFHS-4 data sheets. Heat maps were created to determine geographic distribution of obesity ( mass index, BMI ≥25 kg/), hypertension (known and/or BP ≥140/≥90 mmHg) and hyperglycemia (random glucose >140 mg/dl) in all the districts (n=33).

High prevalence of obesity and hypertension was observed in central and northwestern districts of the state. In women and men respectively, there was a significant positive correlation of obesity with urbanization (r=0.68, 0.51), HDI (r=0.70, 0.66) and female literacy (r=0.46, 0.34). Prevalence of hypertension also showed significant correlation with urbanization (r=0.18, 0.33), HDI (r=0.38, 0.52) and literacy (r=0.32, 0.21) while no correlation was observed with hyperglycemia.There is significant geographic variation in prevalence of obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia in Rajasthan.

Demographic data were compiled from the sample, the  mass index (BMI) was calculated, and the patients were divided according to the response to the surgical treatment.A total of 77.2% of the sample was cured or improved after surgical treatment. Out of the total sample, 75.4% of the women were postmenopausal, and 73.7% denied current or past smoking. The median age was 61 years, the median number of births was 4.0, the median BMI was 28.6 kg/, and 50.9% of the sample was classified as pre-obese. BMI, menopausal status, age, smoking, and sexual activity were not factors associated with the surgical outcome.

Breakfast consumption, and the individual means and the intra-individual standard deviation (isd) of time at first intake of the day, duration of daily intake window and midpoint of daily intake window were collected via six 24-h recalls and examined in relation to BMI, waist circumference (WC) and inflammation (glycoprotein acetyl (GlycA)). Compared with consuming breakfast on all six recalls, linear regression models showed those who consumed breakfast on 4 or 5 of the days had a 1·29 (95 % CI 0·19, 2·38) and 1·64 (95 % CI 0·12, 3·16) kg/ higher BMI; no association was found for consuming breakfast ≤3 d. At 1 h later, the average time of first intake was associated with a 0·44 (95 % CI 0·04, 0·84) kg/ higher BMI. A 1-h increase in the isd of first intake was associated with a 1·12 (95 % CI 0·49, 1·75) kg/ higher BMI; isd in duration and midpoint of intake window were significant prior to additional adjustment for isd in the first intake.

The present study was designed to investigate the anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and toxic activities of celastrol-loaded nanomicelles (nano-celastrol) in diet-induced obese mice. Celastrol was loaded into PEG-PCL nanoparticles, yielding nano-celastrol with optimal size, spherical morphology, good bioavailability, slower peak time and clearance in mice. Nano-celastrol (5 or 7.5 mg/kg/d of celastrol) was administered into diet-induced obese C57BL/6 N male mice for 3 weeks. As result, higher dose nano-celastrol reduced  and  fat mass in an equally effective manner as regular celastrol, although lower dose nano-celastrol showed less activity. Similarly, nano-celastrol improved glucose tolerance in mice equally well as regular celastrol, whereas higher dose nano-celastrol improved the response to insulin. As for macrophage M1/ polarization in liver, nano-celastrol reduced the expression of macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS) in a dose-dependent manner and marginally increased the expression of macrophage  biomarkers (e.g., Arg-1, IL-10). Moreover, celastrol could cause anus irritation and disturb intestinal and colonic integrity, whereas nano-celastrol did not cause any injury to mice. Collectively, nano-celastrol represents a translatable therapeutic opportunity for treating diet-induced obesity in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus it is not surprising that clinical providers are often overwhelmed with the multitude of symptomatology upon initial presentation in patients with obesity. However, despite a "complicated medical history," a systematic, organized approach in obesity medicine utilizes a personalized-tailored treatment strategy coupled with understanding of the disease state, presence of comorbidities, contraindications, side effects, and patient preferences. Here, we present the case of a young patient with Class 3b severe obesity, several obesity-related complications, and extensive psychological history. Through synergistic and additive treatments (behavioral/nutritional therapy combined with anti-obesity pharmacotherapy and concurrent enrollment in our bariatric surgery program), the patient was able to achieve significant -30.5% total  loss with improvement of metabolic parameters. Though these results are not typical of all patients, we must emphasize the need to encompass all available anti-obesity therapies (lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, medical devices, bariatric surgery in monotherapy or combination) in cases of refractory or severe obesity, as we do similarly for other disease modalities such as refractory hypertension or poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes that requires robust escalation in therapy.Copyright © 2019 Srivastava and Apovian.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304406>Height and  changes after deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease: role of clinical subtypes.</a></h2><p>Increased  mass index (BMI) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been repeatedly reported in literature. However, little is known about the effect of PD clinical subtypes on  and height changes after DBS. We aimed to study the differential effect of tremor-predominant versus hypokinetic-rigid disease on  and height changes after DBS.we chart-reviewed PD patients who underwent DBS at our center from 2006 to 2011.  and height data were obtained at the pre-surgical period, at 1-year post-surgery, and at the latest available follow-up (LAF).There were 130 patients in the dataset (70% male, mean age 63+/-9.1). Eighty-eight patients had available data at 1-year post-DBS or longer. Mean LAF was 4.36+/-1.64 years. A BMI increment by 1 Kg/ or more was noticed in 35% after 1-year. Increased height (1cm-or-more) was seen in 24% of patients at 1-year. At 1-year post-DBS, 41.8% of patients with hypokinetic-rigid subtype increased in height compared to only 14.2% in the tremor-predominant group (OR 4.3, 95 % CI 1.3167-14.1246, P=0.015). There was no correlation between PD subtype and  change after DBS.This study confirms BMI increase after DBS in PD patients and reports a novel finding of increased height after DBS in patients with hypokinetic-rigid PD. This might be secondary to improved axial rigidity following DBS. Resolution of tremor is probably unrelated to the increase in  after surgery since  gain did not differ between patients with tremor-predominant and those with hypokinetic-rigid subtype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535137>Effects of indoor stocking density on performance, egg quality, and welfare status of a native chicken during 22 to 38 weeks.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of indoor stocking density on performance, egg quality, and welfare status of a native chicken, Beijing You Chicken (BYC), during 22 to 38 wk. A total of 1,040 19-wk-old BYC pullets were randomly allocated to 4 groups (2 replicates each) and reared in 8 individual floor pens with separate covered shed and uncovered outdoor areas. The indoor stocking densities were 5, 6, 7, and 8 hens/, and the birds were fed corn-soybean based diets. The performance was calculated for 22 to 30, 30 to 38, and 22 to 38 wk, and egg quality indices were measured at the end of weeks 26, 29, and 36. The feather cover and gait score of the birds were assessed at the end of weeks 29 and 36. The results showed that average feed intake (AFI) and mortality rate of BYC in the 8 hens/ group were higher than other groups during 22 to 30 wk (P = 0.001 and P = 0.005); the egg mass and egg-laying rate were higher in groups with lower stocking density, in contrast to the feed egg ratio during 30 to 38 wk. The AFI, mortality rate, and 38-wk  were affected by stocking density during 22 to 38 wk (P < 0.05). Most of egg quality indices were not changed by stocking density (P > 0.05), except for individual indicators, such as Haugh unit at week 26 (P = 0.012) and egg grade at week 29 (P = 0.026). The feather cover and gait scores of birds were affected by indoor stocking density at 36 wk of age, with the 8 hens/ group having lower scores than the 5, 6, and 7 hens/ groups (P = 0.042 and P = 0.039), whereas the 7 hens/ groups having no difference with the 5 and 6 hens/ groups (P > 0.05). Overall, the results suggested that the performance and egg quality of BYC were not significantly affected by equal to or less than 7 hens/ under this system (P > 0.05), but 8 hens/ had an adverse effect on the performance and welfare status of the native chicken during 22 to 38 wk.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499381>The attenuating effects of pyridoxamine on adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation differ by adipocyte location.</a></h2><p>It is known that receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands accumulate in the fat tissues of obese individuals, and RAGE ligands induce M1 macrophage polarization, which in turn induces inflammation. We evaluated the effect of pyridoxamine on RAGE ligand accumulation and M1 polarization in the visceral, subcutaneous, and perivascular fat tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high fat diet (HFD). Pyridoxamine reduced HFD-induced  gain, attenuated adipocyte size increases, RAGE ligand accumulations, RAGE-RAGE ligands binding, decreased macrophage M1 polarization and increased  polarization in visceral fat tissues, but not in subcutaneous tissues. Pyridoxamine induced glyoxalase 1 (Glo-1) expression in visceral fat in the HFD group, whereas pyridoxamine induced Glo-1 expression in perivascular fat tissues was no higher than that observed in the normal fat diet (NFD) controls. In vitro, pyridoxamine suppressed the release of RAGE ligands from AGE treated macrophages, but non-significantly attenuated RAGE ligands release in AGE treated adipocytes. Pyridoxamine was found to suppress  increases and M1 polarization, and to increase Glo-1 expression through the RAGE pathway in perivascular and visceral fat tissues of HFD-induced obese rats. These findings suggest pyridoxamine is a candidate for the treatment of obesity or complications related to obesity-induced inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In majority, hormone secretion (mostly of gonadal steroids and adrenocortical hormone dehydroepiandrosterone - DHEA) undergoes pronounced decrease. This decrease is thought to contribute to the progression of aging. In contrast, the secretion of gonadotropins is sharply increased in the older adults, as the result of gonadal deficiency. The recent data indicate that gonadotropin excess may also by itself influence the aging process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mutual relation between steroid hormones and gonadotropins and their effect on the  mass indices in the older people.In a group of 100 patients (61 women and 39 men) aged over 75 years, blood serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2) testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAs) and cortisol were measured. All the patients have determined  (kg), BMI ( Mass Index) (kg/), WHR (Waist to Height Ratio). The differences of the numerical data were evaluated by Student's t-test and the correlations between them by means of Pearson's test using Dell Statistica ver. 13.The most interesting finding of this study was to show that FSH and LH are negatively correlated with  mass and such indices as BMI and WHR in the older women. Since in older women the mediation of ovary is unlikely, we conclude that gonadotropins may influence the  mass by their direct extra-gonadal action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232239>The effect of  mass index on the risk of surgical site infection.</a></h2><p>Obesity is considered a risk factor for surgical site infection (SSI). We quantified impact of  mass index (BMI) on the risk of SSI for a variety of surgical procedures.We included 2012-2017 data from the Dutch national surveillance network PREZIES on a selection of frequently performed surgical procedures across different specialties. Patients were stratified into 5 categories: underweight (BMI, &lt;18.5 kg/), normal  (BMI, 18.5-25), overweight (BMI, 25-30), obese (BMI, 30-40) and morbidly obese (BMI, ≥40). Multilevel log binomial regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of BMI category on the risk of superficial, deep (including organ-space) and total SSI.Of the 387,919 included patients (ranging from 2,616 for laparoscopic appendectomy to 119,834 for total hip prosthesis), 3,676 (1%) were underweight, 116,778 (30%) had normal , 154,339 (40%) were overweight, 104,288 (27%) had obesity, and 8,838 (2%) were morbidly obese. A trend of increasing risk of SSI when BMI increased from normal to morbidly obese was observed for almost all surgery types. The increase was most profound in surgeries with clean wounds, with relative risks for morbidly obese patients ranging up to 7.8 (95% CI, 6.0-10.2) for deep SSI in total hip prosthesis. In chest and abdominal surgeries, the impact was larger for superficial SSI than for deep SSI.The results of our research provide evidence for the need of preventive programs targeting SSI in overweight and obese patients, as well as for the prevention of obesity in the general population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549605>MRI Diagnosis of Obesity-Related Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis.</a></h2><p>A 61-year-old male presented to our hospital complaining of claudication: bilateral leg weakness impeding mobility.

However, the number of cases in published cohort studies is low. This study was aimed at performing a multicenter collaboration to pool data to obtain more accurate results to quantify the extent of renal impairment in former extremely low birth  (ELBW; <1,000 g) children.We performed a subject-level meta-analysis to pool data from Cracow (64 cases/34 controls) and Leuven (93 cases/87 controls). We assessed and analyzed cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), ultrasound kidney length, and blood pressure (BP) in 11-year-old ELBW children compared with controls born at term. The prevalence of hypertension (HT) and prehypertension (preHT) in both groups was also analyzed.The study group comprised 157 former ELBW children (gestational age 23-33 weeks and birth  430-1,000 g) and 123 children born at term. Former ELBW children had lower mean eGFR (100.62 ± 16.53 vs. 111.89 ± 15.26 mL/min/1.73 ; p < 0.001), smaller absolute kidney length (8.56 ± 0.78 vs. 9.008 ± 0.73 cm; <0.001), and higher systolic (111.8 ± 9.8 vs. 107.2 ± 9.07 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and diastolic (68.6 ± 6.8 vs. 66.3 ± 7.7 mm Hg; p = 0.03) BP. Smaller renal size in former ELBW children was positively associated with lower birth , shorter gestational age, and severity of perinatal complications (intraventricular hemorrhage, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy).ELBW is associated with lower eGFR and a high frequency of preHT and HT.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Thus, we investigated whether semimechanistic conceptual mathematical models (CMM) developed for cattle in temperate areas could be adopted and adjusted to adequately predict VDMI of stall-fed cattle in the (Sub-)Tropics. The CMM of Conrad et al. (1964) (C1) and Mertens (1987) (M1) were identified and adopted for their simplicity in reflecting physicophysiological VDMI regulation. Both CMM use 2 equations that estimate the physiologically and physically regulated VDMI and retain the lower VDMI prediction as actual VDMI. Furthermore, C1 was modified by increasing the daily average fecal dry matter output from 0.0107 to 0.0116 kg/kg , yielding the modified model C2. For M1, the daily neutral detergent fiber intake capacity was increased from 0.012 to 0.0135 kg/kg  and the daily metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance from 0.419 to 0.631 MJ/kg0.75 , whereas the metabolizable energy requirements for gain was reduced from 32.5 to 24.3 MJ/kg  gain, yielding the modified model . Last, also the mean of the physically and physiologically regulated VDMI rather than the lower of both estimates was retained as actual VDMI to generate the models C3 (from C1), C4 (from C2), M3 (from M1), and M4 (from ). The 8 CMM were then evaluated using a data set summarizing results from 52 studies conducted under (sub)tropical conditions. The mean bias, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were used to evaluate adequacy and robustness of all CMM. The M4, C2, and C1 were the most adequate CMM [i.e., lowest mean biases (0.07, -0.22, and 0.14 kg/animal and day, respectively), RMSEP (1.62, 1.93, and 2.0 kg/animal and day, respectively), and CCC (0.91, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively)] and robust of the 8 CMM. Hence, CMM can adequately predict VDMI across diverse stall-fed cattle systems in the (Sub-)Tropics. Adjusting CMM to reflect the differences in feed quality and animal physiology under typical husbandry conditions in the (Sub-)Tropics and those in temperate areas improves the adequacy of their VDMI predictions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Data on previous  and height were retrieved retrospectively from measurements conducted 10, 20, and 40 years prior to baseline. Average  mass index (BMI) over time and  change was calculated. During follow-up, 1149 participants developed AF. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 1.2 (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.4) for average BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/ and 1.6 (1.2-2.0) for average BMI ≥30 kg/ when compared with normal . The association of average BMI with AF risk was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for most recent BMI. In contrast, current BMI was not strongly associated with the risk of AF after adjustment for average BMI earlier in life. Compared with stable BMI, both loss and gain in BMI were associated with increased AF risk. After adjustment for most recent BMI, the association of BMI gain with AF risk was largely unchanged, while the association of BMI loss with AF risk was weakened.Long-term obesity and BMI change are associated with AF risk. Obesity earlier in life and  gain over time exert cumulative effects on AF development even after accounting for most recent BMI.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Whether the lipid response to dietary fat differs between normal- and obese persons is of relevance to dietary recommendations for obese populations.We compared the effect of substituting unsaturated fat for saturated fat on LDL cholesterol and apoB concentrations in normal- (BMI ≤ 25 kg/) and obese (BMI: 30-45) subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol.We randomly assigned 83 men and women (aged 21-70 y) stratified by BMI (normal: n = 44; obese: n = 39) and elevated LDL cholesterol (mean ± SD, normal  4.6 ± 0.9 mmol/L; obese 4.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L) to either a PUFA diet enriched with oil-based margarine ( n = 42) or an SFA diet enriched with butter (n = 41) for 6 wk.Seven-day dietary records showed differences of ∼9 energy percent (E%) in SFA and ∼4 E% in PUFA between the SFA and PUFA groups. In the total study population, the PUFA diet compared with the SFA diet lowered LDL cholesterol (-0.31 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.15 mmol/L, compared with 0.32 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and apoB (-0.08 g/L; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.05 g/L, compared with 0.07 g/L; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.10 g/L; P < 0.001). Tests of the BMI × diet interaction were significant for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB ( P values ≤ 0.009). In normal- compared with obese participants post-hoc comparisons found that the respective changes in LDL cholesterol were 9.7% (95% CI: 5.3%, 14.2%) compared with 5.3% (95% CI: -0.7%, 11.2%), P = 0.206, in the SFA group, and -10.4% (95% CI: -15.2%, -5.7%) compared with -2.3% (95% CI: -7.4%, 2.8%), P = 0.020, in the PUFA group. ApoB changes were 7.5% (95% CI: 3.5%, 11.4%) compared with 3.0% (95% CI: -1.7%, 7.7%), P = 0.140, in the SFA group, and -8.9% (95% CI: -12.6%, -5.2%) compared with -3.8% (95% CI: -6.3%, -1.2%), P = 0.021, in the PUFA group.

This has been demonstrated clearly in the community setting; less clear is the effect of age on this relationship in the inpatient setting.Retrospective analysis of 22,903 electronic records for patients discharged from two large public hospitals in South Australia between January 2015 and September 2018 inclusively. Records were retained if the patient's height and  had been recorded during the admission, BMI was between 10-99 kg/ and it was the patient's first admission during that time. Patients were grouped by BMI (<18.5 kg/ ("underweight"), 18.5-24.9 kg/ ("normal "), 25-29.9 kg/ ("overweight"), >30 kg/ ("obese")) and age (18-59 years, 60-79 years, > 80 years); for each group we measured the relative stay index (RSI) (actual length of stay divided by predicted length of stay), death in hospital and composite adverse outcome after discharge (unplanned readmission within 30 days and/or death within 30 days).Underweight patients across all age groups generally experienced significantly poorer outcomes compared to those not underweight. In those aged 18-59 years there were no significant differences in outcomes between the normal , overweight and obese groups. In those aged 60-79 years overweight patients had a significantly reduced risk of RSI > 2 compared to those of normal  (p=0.014), and both overweight and obese patients had a significantly reduced risk of adverse outcome after discharge when compared to those of normal  (p=0.028 and p=0.009 respectively). In those aged 80 years or older, both overweight and obese patients had a significantly reduced risk of adverse outcome after discharge when compared to those of normal  (p=0.028 and p=0.013 respectively), and obese patients had a significantly reduced risk of inpatient mortality and RSI >2 when compared to those of normal  (p=0.027 and p=0.037 respectively).A BMI > 25 kg/ in older patients is associated with reduced risk of prolonged admission, inpatient mortality and adverse outcomes following discharge. This adds to growing evidence that age-specific BMI guidelines are required for adults because the healthiest BMI in the older hospital patient is seemingly not in the range 18.5-24.9 kg/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474632>[Role of Angiogenesis and Chronic Inflammation in Fat Hypertrophy in NASH Pathology].</a></h2><p>Tissue expansion and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) are closely related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathology. Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits  and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174214>Fiber Intake Predicts  Loss and Dietary Adherence in Adults Consuming Calorie-Restricted Diets: The POUNDS Lost (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Study.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary composition on  loss are incompletely understood. In addition to energy intake, fiber intake, energy density, macronutrient composition, and demographic characteristics have all been suggested to contribute to  loss.The primary aim of this analysis was to assess the role of dietary fiber as a predictor of  loss in participants who consumed calorie-restricted diets (-750 kcal/d from estimated energy needs) for 6 mo, using data from the POUNDS Lost (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Study-a randomized trial that examined the effects of calorie-restricted diets varying in macronutrient composition on  loss in adults.Data were randomly partitioned to a training data set (70%) in which the effects of fiber and other -loss predictors were identified using adjusted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and model averaging. The retained predictors were then fit on the testing data set to assess predictive performance.Three hundred and forty-five participants (53.9% female) provided dietary records at baseline and 6 mo. Mean ± SD age and BMI for the full sample was 52.5 ± 8.7 y and 32.6 ± 3.9 kg/, respectively. Mean ± SD (99% CI)  change at 6 mo for the full sample was -7.27 ± 5.6 kg (-8.05, -6.48 kg). The final, best fit model (R2 = 0.41) included fiber, energy density, fat, age, adherence, baseline , race, and changes from baseline in carbohydrate, fiber, PUFA, and MUFA intake, but the most influential predictor was fiber intake ($\hat{\beta }$ = -0.37; P < 0.0001). In addition, fiber was strongly associated with adherence to the macronutrient prescriptions (P < 0.0001). Interactions between race and adherence, age, baseline , carbohydrate, energy density, and MUFAs were also retained in the final model.Dietary fiber intake, independently of macronutrient and caloric intake, promotes  loss and dietary adherence in adults with overweight or obesity consuming a calorie-restricted diet.

The international evidence base for strategies to prevent obesity is very large and is accumulating rapidly. This is an update of a previous review.To determine the effectiveness of a range of interventions that include diet or physical activity components, or both, designed to prevent obesity in children.We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL in June 2015. We re-ran the search from June 2015 to January 2018 and included a search of trial registers.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet or physical activity interventions, or combined diet and physical activity interventions, for preventing overweight or obesity in children (0-17 years) that reported outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks from baseline.Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk-of-bias and evaluated overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We extracted data on adiposity outcomes, sociodemographic characteristics, adverse events, intervention process and costs. We meta-analysed data as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and presented separate meta-analyses by age group for child 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years for zBMI and BMI.We included 153 RCTs, mostly from the USA or Europe. Thirteen studies were based in upper-middle-income countries (UMIC: Brazil, Ecuador, Lebanon, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, US-Mexico border), and one was based in a lower middle-income country (LMIC: Egypt). The majority (85) targeted children aged 6 to 12 years.Children aged 0-5 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 16 RCTs (n = 6261) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (mean difference (MD) -0.07 kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.14 to -0.01), and had a similar effect (11 RCTs, n = 5536) on zBMI (MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.01). Neither diet (moderate-certainty evidence) nor physical activity interventions alone (high-certainty evidence) compared with control reduced BMI (physical activity alone: MD -0.22 kg/m, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.01) or zBMI (diet alone: MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.04; physical activity alone: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.13) in children aged 0-5 years.Children aged 6 to 12 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 14 RCTs (n = 16,410) that physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (MD -0.10 kg/m, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.05). However, there is moderate-certainty evidence that they had little or no effect on zBMI (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02). There is low-certainty evidence from 20 RCTs (n = 24,043) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced zBMI (MD -0.05 kg/, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01). There is high-certainty evidence that diet interventions, compared with control, had little impact on zBMI (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.01) or BMI (-0.02 kg/, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06).Children aged 13 to 18 years: There is very low-certainty evidence that physical activity interventions, compared with control reduced BMI (MD -1.53 kg/, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.39; 4 RCTs; n = 720); and low-certainty evidence for a reduction in zBMI (MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1; 1 RCT; n = 100). There is low-certainty evidence from eight RCTs (n = 16,583) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, had no effect on BMI (MD -0.02 kg/, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.05); or zBMI (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.07; 6 RCTs; n = 16,543). Evidence from two RCTs (low-certainty evidence; n = 294) found no effect of diet interventions on BMI.Direct comparisons of interventions: Two RCTs reported data directly comparing diet with either physical activity or diet combined with physical activity interventions for children aged 6 to 12 years and reported no differences.Heterogeneity was apparent in the results from all three age groups, which could not be entirely explained by setting or duration of the interventions. Where reported, interventions did not appear to result in adverse effects (16 RCTs) or increase health inequalities (gender: 30 RCTs; socioeconomic status: 18 RCTs), although relatively few studies examined these factors.Re-running the searches in January 2018 identified 315 records with potential relevance to this review, which will be synthesised in the next update.Interventions that include diet combined with physical activity interventions can reduce the risk of obesity (zBMI and BMI) in young children aged 0 to 5 years. There is weaker evidence from a single study that dietary interventions may be beneficial.However, interventions that focus only on physical activity do not appear to be effective in children of this age. In contrast, interventions that only focus on physical activity can reduce the risk of obesity (BMI) in children aged 6 to 12 years, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. In these age groups, there is no evidence that interventions that only focus on diet are effective, and some evidence that diet combined with physical activity interventions may be effective. Importantly, this updated review also suggests that interventions to prevent childhood obesity do not appear to result in adverse effects or health inequalities.The review will not be updated in its current form. To manage the growth in RCTs of child obesity prevention interventions, in future, this review will be split into three separate reviews based on child age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246961>Influenza  virus-like particle vaccination enhances protection in combination with avian influenza HA VLPs.</a></h2><p>Despite the ability to induce a broad range of cross protection, M2e5x virus-like particles (VLPs) alone provide limited vaccine efficacy and confer low efficacy of protection against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection in chickens. Avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) has been a major antigenic target that enhances humoral immunity, but the efficacy of avian HA-based vaccines against HPAIV needs to be further improved. In this study, we evaluated the vaccine efficacy induced by combination of conserved tandem repeat M2e5x VLPs and HA VLPs against an avian influenza virus. We found that combinatorial vaccine elicited higher levels of reassortant H5N1 (rgH5N1) virus-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibody responses compared to M2e5x VLPs in sera and lungs of mice. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination induced higher levels of CD8+ T cell and germinal center B cell responses in lung and spleen compared to M2e5x VLPs. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination showed significantly reduced inflammatory responses and lung viral loads upon rgH5N1 virus challenge infection, resulting in less  loss compared to M2e5x VLPs alone. These results indicate that immune responses to both M2e and HA might provide a strategy of vaccination inducing enhanced protection against avian influenza virus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646765>Conversion of NaHCO to Na CO with a growth of Arthrospira platensis cells in 660 m raceway ponds with a CO bicarbonation absorber.</a></h2><p>The  ratio of Na CO /NaHCO was investigated in order to improve microalgal productivity in large-scale industrial operations by converting NaHCO to Na CO with a growth of Arthrospira platensis cells in 660 m raceway ponds. Two microalgal cultivation systems with a NaHCO by-product (SPBP) and a CO bicarbonation absorber (CBAP) were firstly thoroughly introduced. There was a 13.3% decrease in the initial  ratio of Na CO /NaHCO resulting in a 25.3% increase in the biomass growth rate with CBAP, compared to that of SPBP. Increased sunlight intensity, solution temperature and pH all resulted in both a higher  absorbance and  release, thereby increasing the  ratio of Na CO /NaHCO during the growth of A. platensis.

We implemented extended preoperative nutritional support and one month HEN after discharge for patients randomized into an enhanced nutrition group and implemented standard nutritional support for patients randomized into a conventional nutrition group. Except the nutritional support program, both group patients underwent the same standardized enhanced recovery after surgery programs of esophagectomy based on published guidelines. Patients were assessed at preoperative day, postoperative day 7 (POD7), and POD30 for perioperative outcomes and nutritional status. To facilitate the determination of an effect size for subsequent appropriately powered randomized clinical trials and assess the effectiveness, the primary outcome we chose was the  change before and after esophagectomy. Other outcomes including  mass index (BMI), lean  mass (LBM), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), nutrition-related complications, and quality of life (QoL) were also analyzed. The intention-to-treat analysis of the 50 randomized patients showed that there was no significant difference in baseline characteristics. The  (-2.03 ± 2.28 kg vs. -4.05 ± 3.13 kg, P = 0.012), BMI (-0.73 ± 0.79 kg/ vs. -1.48 ± 1.11 kg/, P = 0.008), and ASMI (-1.10 ± 0.37 kg/ vs. -1.60 ± 0.66 kg/, P = 0.010) loss of patients in the enhanced nutrition group were obviously decreased compared to the conventional nutrition group at POD30. In particular, LBM (48.90 ± 9.69 kg vs. 41.96 ± 9.37 kg, p = 0.031) and ASMI (7.56 ± 1.07 kg/ vs. 6.50 ± 0.97 kg/, P = 0.003) in the enhanced nutrition group were significantly higher compared to the conventional nutrition group at POD30, despite no significant change between pre- and postoperation. In addition, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 scores revealed that enhanced nutritional support improved the QoL of patients in physical function (75.13 ± 9.72 vs. 68.33 ± 7.68, P = 0.009) and fatigue symptom (42.27 ± 9.93 vs. 49.07 ± 11.33, P = 0.028) compared to conventional nutritional support. This pilot study demonstrated that an enhanced nutritional support pathway including extended preoperative nutritional support and HEN was feasible, safe, and might be beneficial to patients who underwent enhanced recovery after esophagectomy.

Metabolic surgery has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment, yet due to demand on government resources has only been performed to a limited extent in public hospitals. The aim of this study was to describe the safety and efficacy of performing metabolic surgery at a single academic hospital in South Africa.This was a single centre retrospective review of 57 metabolic surgery procedures performed from October 2011 to September 2017 at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. The primary outcome was safety including mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included effect of surgery on  and diabetes resolution.A total of 57 patients underwent laparoscopic metabolic surgery, of which 44 (83.0%) were female with a mean age (standard deviation) of 42.8 (8.0) years. Fifty-six patients (98%) underwent Roux-and-Y gastric bypass and one (2%) had a sleeve gastrectomy performed. There were no mortalities and overall morbidity was 14.0%, with 3 (5.3%) classified as major and 5 (8.8%) as minor. The follow-up rate at 1 year was 100%. Mean preoperative  mass index (BMI) was 58.8 kg/, and comorbidities included hypertension (59.6%), Type 2 Diabetes (42.1%), and dyslipidaemia (36.8%).

Twelve Duroc × Landrance × Yorkshire growing pigs with an average initial  (IW) of 14.86 ± 0.20 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: feeding one time per day (M1) and feeding two times per day (); each group consisted of six replicates (pens), with one pig per pen. During the one-month experimental period, pigs in the M1 group were fed on an ad libitum basis at 8:00 am; and the  group was fed half of the standard feeding requirement at 8:00 am and adequate feed at 16:00 pm. The results showed that average daily feed intake, average daily gain, feed:gain, and the organ indices were not significantly different between the two groups ( > 0.05). The total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in the serum, and the TG concentration in the liver in the  groups were significant lower than those in the M1 group, while the T-CHO concentration in the liver were significant higher in the  group ( < 0.05).

Delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention of IH might lead to increased morbidity of patients and impairments in their quality of life.To evaluate the predictive factors for early diagnosis and surgical repair of IH after LRYGB.This study analyzed 38 patients during the postoperative period of LRYGB who presented clinical manifestations suggestive of IH after an average of 24 months following the bariatric procedure.The sample consisted of 10 men and 28 women, with a mean age of 37.5 years and a mean  mass index (BMI) of 39.6 kg/ before LRYGB. All patients presented pain, 23 presented abdominal distension, 10 had nausea and 12 were vomiting; three of them had dysphagia, three had diarrhea and one had gastro-esophageal reflux. The patients presented symptoms for an average of 15 days, varying from 3 to 50 days. Seventeen (45.9%) patients were seen once, while the other 20 (54.1%) went to the emergency room twice or more times. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed on all patients, being converted to laparotomy in three cases. Petersen hernia was confirmed in 22 (57.9%). Petersen space was closed in all patients and the IH correction was performed in 20 (52.6%) cases. The herniated loop showed signs of vascular suffering in seven patients, and two (5.3%) had irreversible ischemia, requiring bowel resection.The presence of recurrent abdominal pain is one of the main indicators for the diagnosis of IH after LRYGB. Patients operated at an early stage, even with negative imaging tests for this disease, benefited from rapid and simple procedures without major complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368422>High calcium intake from fat-free milk,  composition and glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomised crossover clinical trial.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of high-Ca fat-free milk v. low-Ca control diet on adiposity and on glycaemic control. Fourteen subjects with type 2 diabetes (aged 49·5 (sd 8·6) years, BMI 29·4 (sd 4·5) kg/, low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d)) were included in this randomised, crossover clinical trial. Subjects participated in two 12-week experimental sessions (high-Ca fat-free milk (HC) or low-Ca control (LC)) separated by 8-week washout. Subjects daily consumed in the laboratory a breakfast shake containing 700 mg (HC) or 6·4 mg (LC) of Ca. Energy-restricted diets containing 800 mg of dietary Ca/d were prescribed. Dietary records data indicated the consumption of 1200 mg of Ca/d during HC and of 525 mg of Ca/d during LC. There was a greater reduction in ,  fat mass, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio after HC. Serum 25-hydoxyvitamin D and homeostatic model assessment-2 β-cell function (HOMA2-%B) increased, and serum uric acid, parathormone (PTH) and glycated Hb (HbA1c) concentrations reduced after HC. In addition, changes from baseline in terms of serum uric acid, glucose, HbA1c and PTH concentrations were lower, and those of HOMA2-%B, serum Ca and 25-hydoxyvitamin D were higher after the HC than after LC. The consumption of approximately three servings of fat-free milk and 1200 mg of dietary Ca/d enhanced  loss, improved  composition and promoted glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes and low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235718>Oral administration of EPA-rich oil impairs collagen reorganization due to elevated production of IL-10 during skin wound healing in mice.</a></h2><p>Wound healing is an essential process for organism survival. Some fatty acids have been described as modulators of wound healing. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids is unclear. In the present work, we investigate the effects of oral administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich oil on wound healing in mice. After 4 weeks of EPA-rich oil supplementation (2 g/kg of ), mice had increased serum concentrations of EPA (20:5ω-3) (6-fold) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6ω-3) (33%) in relation to control mice. Omega-3 fatty acids were also incorporated into skin in the EPA fed mice. The wound healing process was delayed at the 3 and 7 days after wounding in mice that received EPA-rich oil when compared to control mice but there was no effect on the total time required for wound closure. Collagen reorganization, that impacts the quality of the wound tissue, was impaired after EPA-rich oil supplementation. These effects were associated with an increase of  macrophages (twice in relation to control animals) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations in tissue in the initial stages of wound healing. In the absence of IL-10 (IL-10 mice), wound closure and organization of collagen were normalized even when EPA was fed, supporting that the deleterious effects of EPA-rich oil supplementation were due to the excessive production of IL-10. In conclusion, oral administration of EPA-rich oil impairs the quality of wound healing without affecting the wound closure time likely due to an elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219580>Differences in Trabecular Plate and Rod Structure in Premenopausal Women Across the  Spectrum.</a></h2><p>Premenopausal women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and obesity (OB) have elevated fracture risk.

Trabecular plate and rod structure has not been reported across the  spectrum.To investigate trabecular plate and rod structure in premenopausal women.Cross-sectional study.Clinical research center.A total of 105 women age 21 to 46 years: (i) women with AN (n = 46), (ii) eumenorrheic lean healthy controls (HCs) (n = 29), and (iii) eumenorrheic women with OB (n = 30).Trabecular microarchitecture by ITS.Mean age (±SD) was similar (28.9 ± 6.3 years) and  mass index differed (16.7 ± 1.8 vs 22.6 ± 1.4 vs 35.1 ± 3.3 kg/; P < 0.0001) across groups. Bone was less plate-like and axially aligned in AN (P ≤ 0.01) and did not differ between OB and HC. After controlling for , plate and axial bone volume fraction and plate number density were lower in OB vs HC; some were lower in OB than AN (P < 0.05). The relationship between  and plate variables was quadratic (R = 0.39 to 0.70; P ≤ 0.0006) (i.e., positive associations were attenuated at high ). Appendicular lean mass and IGF-1 levels were positively associated with plate variables (R = 0.27 to 0.67; P < 0.05). Amenorrhea was associated with lower radial plate variables than eumenorrhea in AN (P < 0.05).In women with AN, trabecular bone is less plate-like. In women with OB, trabecular plates do not adapt to high . This is relevant because trabecular plates are associated with greater estimated bone strength. Higher muscle mass and IGF-1 levels may mitigate some of the adverse effects of low  or excess adiposity on bone.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373771>Association between insulin and post-caesarean resuscitation rates in infants of women with GDM: A retrospective study.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and caesarean deliveries independently increase the risk of postoperative complications. There are limited data on the influence of insulin use on the outcomes of neonates who were delivered via caesarean section. We sought to investigate the impact of insulin use in women with GDM on resuscitation rates of infants post caesarean delivery.A retrospective database review of women with singleton term (≥ 37 weeks) pregnancies who were on insulin for GDM delivering between January 2005 and December 2014 at a major metropolitan hospital in Sydney.One thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven women with GDM were identified. The mean age was 31.01 ± 5.63 years and mean gestational period of 39.07 ± 1.00 weeks. 31.0% received insulin treatment for GDM. Women who were on insulin were older (31.9 ± 5.7 vs 30.6 ± 5.6 years, P < 0.001), had a higher  mass index (BMI) (31.2 ± 7.7 vs 29.0 ± 7.4 kg/, P < 0.001), higher rates of preeclampsia (7.3% vs 4.1%, P = 0.004), lower rates of alcohol consumption (0.4% vs 1.7%, P = 0.014), and had infants with lower resuscitation rates (21.2% vs 28.6%, P = 0.001). Infants who required resuscitation had a lower gestational age, lower five-minute APGAR score, and lower birth , length, and head circumferences.

Studies regarding its prevalence, however, are scarce and vary widely in their findings. The population of medical students is a particularly interesting subset for its recurring demand of physical contact during patient examination or procedures, and the potential for professional adversity. We aimed at furthering the comprehension of this disease prevalence and characteristics among medical students.Questionnaires inquiring about the presence and characteristics of Primary Hyperhidrosis (PH) were applied through either written or digital means to all eligible medical students enrolled in three Medical Schools in the State of Rio de Janeiro who agreed to take part in the study. Demographic data regarding gender, ethnicity, current age,  and height was collected in addition to clinical data (sweat site, age of onset, familial history, severity and previous treatments). Severity was evaluated through the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and a symptoms survey.Our response rate was roughly 1/3 of all eligible students (900/2700). PH prevalence was 20.56% (185/900). It was similar between men and women (23.08% and 19.41%, respectively) and strongly associated with family history of the disease (Prevalence Ratio of 4.27). Regarding ethnicity, of the total sample 73.78% (664/900) self-declared white, among which 19.28% (128/664) had PH. Mixed-race and other ethnicities encompassed 26.22% (236/900) of the sample, among which 24.15% (57/236) had PH. Most positive subjects (64.32%) presented associated forms of PH. Overall involvement of each site (both associated and isolated) was: 63.78% axillary, 50.81% palmar, 43.24% plantar, 20.54% craniofacial, 18.38% facial flushing and 2.16% gustatory sweating. Mean current age was 23.11(±4.04) years for PH patients, and age of onset was ≤18 years in 93.94% of cases. Regarding  mass index (BMI), 71.09% of PH patients had BMI<25kg/ and only 4.69% presented BMI≥30kg/, none ≥35kg/. Some degree of life quality impairment was reported by 89.20% of PH patients, and 23.89% had HDSS 3 or 4 (moderate to severe).PH prevalence among Rio de Janeiro medical students was 20.56%, similar between men and women, predominating associated presentations, axillary, palmar and plantar sites, strong familial history, age of onset before 18 years, and some degree of life impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608861>Effects of time-based feed restriction on morbidity, mortality, performance and meat quality of growing rabbits housed in collective systems.</a></h2><p>In rabbit farms, quantitative feed restriction in the post-weaning period is widely used with the aim of reducing the impact of digestive diseases, whereas less information is available about feed restriction strategies based on the reduction of access time to feeders in different housing systems. This study compared morbidity, mortality, growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality of 368 crossbred rabbits fed ad libitum (L) or subjected to a time-based feed restriction programme (R) and housed from 31 to 73 days of age in cages or pens with different dimensions and group sizes, that is, eight conventional cages (0.33 , six rabbits/cage), eight small open-top pens (0.50 , eight rabbits/pen), eight medium open-top pens (1.00 , 16 rabbits/pen) and four large open-top pens (2.00 , 32 rabbits/pen). Feed restriction was attained by progressively reducing the access time to feeders in the 1st week from 14 to 8 h/day, maintaining 8 h in the 2nd week and then by increasing access time by 1 h/day during the 3rd and 4th week up to 24 h/day. In the first 2 weeks, R rabbits showed a lower (P ≤ 0.001) daily  gain, feed intake and feed conversion as compared with L rabbits. During the 3rd and 4th weeks, R rabbits exhibited a greater daily  gain and better feed conversion (P ≤ 0.001). In the last 2 weeks of trial, daily  gain tended (P = 0.06) to be greater in the R than L rabbits. In the whole trial, R rabbits manifested a lower daily  gain, feed intake and feed conversion, as well as lower final live  and the carcass dressing percentage at slaughter (0.05 ≤ P ≤ 0.01). During feed restriction, R rabbits did not show digestive problems, which, however, appeared in the following 2 weeks of refeeding. Thus, R rabbits had a higher health risk index in the whole trial as compared with L rabbits (P ≤ 0.05). The housing system did not affect growth performance, characteristics at slaughter, and carcass and meat quality. Mortality tended to increase with group size (P = 0.06). In conclusion, the time-based feed restriction significantly improved feed efficiency of growing rabbits housed collectively but had somewhat negative effects on characteristics at slaughter and on morbidity and mortality rate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474682>Co-Administration of Curcumin and Artepillin C Induces Development of Brown-Like Adipocytes in Association with Local Norepinephrine Production by Alternatively Activated Macrophages in Mice.</a></h2><p>Classical brown adipocytes, characterized by interscapular depots, have multilocular fat depots and are known to release excess energy. Recent studies have shown that induction of brown-like adipocytes, also referred to as beige or brite cells, in white adipose tissue (WAT) results in the release of excess energy through mitochondrial heat production via uncoupling protein 1. This has potential a therapeutic strategy for obesity and related diseases as well as classical brown adipocytes. In our previous studies, we found that artepillin C (ArtC, 10 mg/kg ), a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis, significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of mice. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that curcumin (Cur, 4.5 mg/kg) also significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in mice. The combined administration of several food-derived factors can enhance their bioactivity and reduce their required functional doses. In this study, we showed that co-administration of Cur and ArtC at lower doses (Cur, 1.5 mg/kg; ArtC, 5 mg/kg) additively induce brown-like adipocyte development in mouse iWAT. Moreover, this induction is associated with the localized production of norepinephrine following accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in iWAT. These findings suggest that co-administration of Cur and ArtC is significantly effective to reduce the dose and enhance the formation of brown-like adipocyte via a unique molecular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461714>Influence of Obesity on Work Ability, Respiratory Symptoms, and Lung Function in Adults with Asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is defined by variable respiratory symptoms and lung function, and may influence work ability. Similarly, obesity may contribute to respiratory symptoms, affect lung function, and reduce work ability. Thus, assessment of the influence of obesity on work ability, respiratory symptoms, and lung function in adults with asthma is needed.We hypothesized that patients with obesity and asthma have more respiratory symptoms and reduced work ability and lung function compared with normal- patients with asthma.We examined 626 participants with physician-diagnosed asthma, aged 18-52 years, recruited from a cross-sectional general population study using a comprehensive questionnaire including work ability score, the asthma control test (ACT), height and , and spirometry with reversibility testing.Participants with a  mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/ (i.e., obese) had a higher symptom score (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.14-2.80), current use of asthma medication (1.60, 1.05-2.46), and incidence of ACT scores ≤19 (poor asthma control) (1.81, 1.03-3.18) than participants with BMI ≤24.9 kg/ (i.e., normal ). Post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC) as a percentage of predicted (β coefficient -4.5) and pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s as a percentage of predicted (FEV1) (β coefficient -4.6) were negatively associated with BMI ≥30 kg/. We found no statistically significant association of BMI >30 kg/ (compared to BMI <24.9 kg/) with sick leave (1.21, 0.75-1.70) or reduced work ability (1.23, 0.74-2.04).There were indications that patients with obesity had a higher symptom burden, poorer asthma control, higher consumption of asthma medication, and reduced lung function, in particular for FVC, compared with normal- patients.© 2019 S.

The present study aimed to confirm the hypothesis that the risk of frailty is positively associated with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/), but the association is mediated by the waist:height ratio (WHtR) in older women and men. A total of 2862 community-dwelling older individuals aged 70-84 years were assessed for frailty using the Korean version of Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, and Loss of  index. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/) was associated with a higher risk of frailty compared with BMI 18·5-<23 kg/ in all the older individuals (OR 1·88; 95 % CI 1·11, 3·17; P = 0·018) and in older women (OR 1·86; 95 % CI 1·01, 3·42; P = 0·047) before adjusting for WHtR but was not associated with BMI after adjusting for WHtR. Additionally, obesity was not significantly associated with the risk of frailty before and after adjusting for WHtR in older men. Mediation analysis revealed that the association between BMI and frailty score was mediated by WHtR. Moreover, the mediating effect of WHtR on frailty score was positive in both women and men, but the frailty score was associated with BMI positively in women and negatively in men. The present study suggests that the risk of frailty is higher in obese women, which is mediated by WHtR, but not in obese men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547048> (PG2) Enhances the M1 Polarization of Macrophages, Functional Maturation of Dendritic Cells, and T Cell-Mediated Anticancer Immune Responses in Patients with Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>Recently, we demonstrated that  (PG2), the active ingredient in dried roots of  ameliorates cancer symptom clusters and improves quality of life (QoL) in patients with metastatic disease by modulating inflammatory cascade against the background roles of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumor initiation, metastasis, and progression. Nevertheless, the role of PG2 in the modulation of anticancer immunogenicity and therapeutic response remains relatively underexplored and unclear.The present study investigates how and to what extent PG2 modulates cellular and biochemical components of the inflammatory cascade and enhances anticancer immunity, as well as the therapeutic implication of these bio-events in patients with lung cancer.Herein, we demonstrated that PG2 significantly increased the M1/ macrophage polarization ratio in non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) H441 and H1299 cells. This PG2-induced preferential pharmacologic up-regulation of tumoral M1 population in vitro positively correlated with the downregulation of tumor-promoting IL-6 and IL-10 expression in NSCLC cell-conditioned medium, with concomitant marked inhibition of cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorsphere formation. Our ex vivo results, using clinical sample from our NSCLC cohort, demonstrated that PG2 also promoted the functional maturation of DCs with consequent enhancement of T cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. Consistent with the in vitro and ex vivo results, our in vivo studies showed that treatment with PG2 elicited significant time-dependent depletion of the tumor-associated  population, synergistically enhanced the anti--based anticancer effect of cisplatin, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in the NSCLC mice models. Moreover, in the presence of PG2, cisplatin-associated dyscrasia and -loss was markedly suppressed.These results do indicate a therapeutically-relevant role for PG2 in modulating the M1/ macrophage pool, facilitating DC maturation and synergistically enhancing the anticancer effect of conventional chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, thus laying the foundation for further exploration of the curative relevance of PG2 as surrogate immunotherapy and/or clinical feasibility of its use for maintenance therapy in patients with lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545844>The erythrocyte membrane stability is associated with sleep time and social jetlag in shift workers.</a></h2><p>The osmotic stability of the erythrocyte membrane (OSEM) has been associated with changes in lipid profile, blood glucose and blood pressure. Changes in these parameters are very frequent in shift workers, possibly because of the lack of synchronization of biological rhythms, which results in the social jetlag. However, the existence of association between OSEM and circadian misalignment has not been investigated in this population. Therefore, this study investigated whether shift work, sleep time and social jetlag (SJL) are associated with biochemical and hematological variables. A population consisting of 79 men working at night (n = 37) or during the day (n = 42), aged between 21 and 65 years and with a mean BMI of 27.56 ± 4.0 kg/, was investigated cross-sectionally in relation to sleep time, SJL, anthropometric (height,  and waist circumference) and blood variables, with emphasis on the OSEM. SJL was calculated by the absolute difference between the midpoint of sleep on work and rest days. The Generalized Linear Model (GzLM) was used to investigate the existence of associations between SJL and average sleep time in relation to the analyzed variables. Workers without SJL presented lower baseline lysis values of erythrocytes in isotonic medium in relation to workers with SJL. In addition, workers who slept on average less than 6 hours had higher OSEM, and higher total and LDL-cholesterol in relation to those who slept more than 6 hours, regardless of the shift. It is possible that the association of sleep deprivation and SJL with erythrocyte membrane stability is mediated through changes in the lipid profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386659>Neonatal, infant, and childhood growth following metformin versus insulin treatment for gestational diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Metformin is increasingly offered as an acceptable and economic alternative to insulin for treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in many countries. However, the impact of maternal metformin treatment on the trajectory of fetal, infant, and childhood growth is unknown.PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane database were systematically searched (from database inception to 26 February 2019). Outcomes of GDM-affected pregnancies randomised to treatment with metformin versus insulin were included (randomised controlled trials and prospective randomised controlled studies) from cohorts including European, American, Asian, Australian, and African women. Studies including pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes or non-diabetic women were excluded, as were trials comparing metformin treatment with oral glucose-lowering agents other than insulin. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk of bias, and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome  were parameters of fetal, infant, and childhood growth, including , height, BMI, and  composition. In total, 28 studies (n = 3,976 participants) met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. No studies reported fetal growth parameters; 19 studies (n = 3,723 neonates) reported  of neonatal growth. Neonates born to metformin-treated mothers had lower birth  (mean difference -107.7 g, 95% CI -182.3 to -32.7, I2 = 83%, p = 0.005) and lower ponderal indices (mean difference -0.13 kg/m3, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.00, I2 = 0%, p = 0.04) than neonates of insulin-treated mothers. The odds of macrosomia (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, p < 0.001) and large for gestational age (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99, p = 0.04) were lower following maternal treatment with metformin compared to insulin. There was no difference in neonatal height or incidence of small for gestational age between groups. Two studies (n = 411 infants) reported  of infant growth (18-24 months of age). In contrast to the neonatal phase, metformin-exposed infants were significantly heavier than those in the insulin-exposed group (mean difference 440 g, 95% CI 50 to 830, I2 = 4%, p = 0.03). Three studies (n = 520 children) reported mid-childhood growth parameters (5-9 years). In mid-childhood, BMI was significantly higher (mean difference 0.78 kg/, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.33, I2 = 7%, p = 0.005) following metformin exposure than following insulin exposure, although the difference in absolute  between the groups was not significantly different (p = 0.09). Limited evidence (1 study with data treated as 2 cohorts) suggested that adiposity indices (abdominal [p = 0.02] and visceral [p = 0.03] fat volumes) may be higher in children born to metformin-treated compared to insulin-treated mothers. Study limitations include heterogeneity in metformin dosing, heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria for GDM, and the scarcity of reporting of childhood outcomes.Following intrauterine exposure to metformin for treatment of maternal GDM, neonates are significantly smaller than neonates whose mothers were treated with insulin during pregnancy. Despite lower average birth , metformin-exposed children appear to experience accelerated postnatal growth, resulting in heavier infants and higher BMI by mid-childhood compared to children whose mothers were treated with insulin. Such patterns of low birth  and postnatal catch-up growth have been reported to be associated with adverse long-term cardio-metabolic outcomes. This suggests a need for further studies examining longitudinal perinatal and childhood outcomes following intrauterine metformin exposure.

The average age was 53.7 (18-95) years old and  mass index (BMI) was 28.2±6.6 Kg/. The prevalence of hypertension was 47.3% (267/566), without gender or living areas differences (both p>0.1) Prevalence of hypertension was lower in those who self-identified as inter-racial ethnicity, in comparison with Afro-Caribbean (33% vs. 48.3%; p=0.04). About third of the hypertensive patients were not aware of the high BP (89/267; 35.6%). Between hypertensive patients, 64.4% (172/267) were receiving antihypertensive drugs. The rate of BP control was 32% of the hypertensive patients and 50% of those receiving anti-hypertensive medication. Significant lower BP control was observed between diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients (34.3% vs. 60%; p<0.001).We found a high prevalence of HTN in this population, especially in patients with diabetes or previous cardiovascular diseases. We report an increase in hypertension awareness in Jamaica but more advances need to be performed to increase hypertension treatment and control.© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2019.

The magnitude of decrease in BMI associated with increasing fruit and vegetable intake was more prominent among participants with high genetic risk than those with low risk. Reproducible interactions were observed for fruits and vegetables separately (both P-interaction <0.001). Based on similar nutritional content, the interaction effect was greatest for berries, citrus fruits, and green leafy vegetables, and the interaction pattern persisted regardless of the different fiber content or glycemic load of fruits and vegetables.Genetically associated increased BMI and  could be mitigated by increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and the beneficial effect of improving fruit and vegetable intake on  management was more pronounced in individuals with greater genetic susceptibility to obesity.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533125>Impact of Obesity on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Early-Stage Cervical Cancer after Radical Hysterectomy with Pelvic Node Dissection.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic role of obesity on oncological outcomes, surgical complications, and postoperative morbidity of patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Between 2000 and 2016, we enrolled 500 patients with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic node dissection (RHND) at Songklanagarind Hospital. For analysis, patients were divided based on their  mass index (BMI) into under-normal  (<25 kg/), overweight (25-29.99 kg/), and obese (≥30 kg/) groups.The median age was 47 years, and the median BMI was 24.3 kg/ (25% quartile, 22.0 kg/; 75% quartile, 27.4 kg/). Patients in the obese and overweight groups were more likely to have comorbidities and adenocarcinoma than patients in the under-normal  group. The median operative time (OT) was significantly longer in the obese and overweight groups than in the under-normal  group. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the under-normal , overweight, and obese groups was 87.5, 86.2, and 97.6%, respectively, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) times were 95.8, 97.8, and 100%, respectively. There were no significant differences in RFS or OS among the 3  groups. Multivariate analysis did not identify BMI as a prognostic factor for RFS and OS.A high BMI was not associated with increased surgical complications or postoperative morbidity; furthermore, it was not associated with the prognosis of patients with early-stage cervical cancer after RHND. However, it was associated with adenocarcinoma and longer OT.© 2019 S.

This research aimed to evaluate midlife  mass index (BMI) trajectory and assess its relationship with frailty 8 years later in Taiwan.A prospective cohort study.Data were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging conducted from 1999 to 2007. The analysis was restricted to respondents aged between 50 to 69 years old, who were not frail in 1999 and were alive in 2007 (n=1609).Frailty was defined using the Fried criteria. The group-based model of trajectory was used to estimate BMI trajectories among elderly participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between BMI change and frailty.Four trajectory classes were identified and each remained stable during the 8-year follow-up. There were 316 participants (20.3%) in the low-normal  group (baseline BMI=20.38 kg/), 737 participants (44.7%) in the high-normal  group (baseline BMI=23.22 kg/), 449 participants (28.4%) in the overweight group (baseline BMI=26.24 kg/), and 107 participants (6.6%) in the obesity group (baseline BMI=30.65 kg/). After adjustment for confounding factors, the low-normal  group and obesity group were associated with increased frailty compared with the high-normal  group.Our results showed that the BMI trajectories of midlife individuals tended to be constant and those in both the low-normal  group and obesity group had an increased risk of developing frailty in later life. Therefore, an optimal -targeting strategy should be considered for Asian elderly individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507109>[ASSOCIATION OF OBESITY, SMOKING AND SOCIOECONOMIC STRATA WITH THE FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME].</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine a possible association between BMI levels, smoking and socio-economic status and the existence of fibromyalgia.Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with devastating impacts on the public's health. There are several indications that obesity might also be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia.Patients who were diagnosed with fibromyalgia were compared to population-based controls, matched in age and gender (by a ratio of 1:5).  mass indices, smoking status and socioeconomic strata were retrieved from computerized medical records of the Clalit Health Services database.  mass index was classified in WHO categories of underweight, normal, overweight and obese (<18.5, 18.5-<25, 25.0-<30, ≥30.0 kg/); χ2, t-tests, and logistic regression models were used to compare the study groups and assess the association between obesity and fibromyalgia.The study included 14,296 patients with fibromyalgia and 71,324 controls. Among patients with fibromyalgia the average BMI ( mass index) was higher than that of the controls 29.1± 6.2 vs. 28.0± 6.01, p<0.001) with every increment of 1 unit of the BMI score, there was an increment of 2.7% of the odds of having coexistent fibromyalgia. The chances of having fibromyalgia was 56% higher among subjects with obesity compared to individuals of normal . The data revealed that patients with fibromyalgia smoke more and belong to lower socioeconomic levels.Our findings demonstrate that obesity is significantly associated with a higher proportion of fibromyalgia. This finding underlines the role that obesity plays in inflammation and chronic pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523295>Nutritional Status as a Risk Factor in COPD.</a></h2><p>The third leading cause of death, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is gaining more and more attention in the literature and clinical practice. Precision medicine, already recognised as a right approach for COPD, requests a special attention to be allocated for nutritional status. Free fat mass index FFMI and visceral fat VFA area measurements should be added to  mass index (BMI) in order to have a complete perspective of the nutritional status and disease prognosis. Prospective medical nutrition therapy should consider caloric intake for achieving a BMI of 20-24 kg/, nutritionally dense, small and frequent meals, choosing the moment for the most important meal when the level of energy is the highest for the patient. A resting period before mealtime is adviced. Obesity paradox in COPD means a lower mortality associated with BMI between 25 and 32. This benefit is mainly related to higher muscular mass, as it has been described by some authors. The main objective in nutritional intervention will be to maintain muscular mass, adviced protein intake should be 1.2 g/kg /day, higher vs general population. In the future, nutritional status evaluation should be included in pulmonary rehabilitation process, and a multidisciplinary team is expected to cooperate in order to achieve best pulmonary results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553996>Prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients with Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: A Prospective, Parallel Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis and etiology of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are largely unknown. Preliminary data from patients with aortic dissection and abdominal aneurysms suggest a causal link of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on aortic disease.The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of OSA in patients with TAA compared to a matched control group.In this prospective parallel-cohort study, we 2-to-1 matched 208 patients with verified TAA (at the aortic sinus and/or ascending aorta) to 104 controls without TAA according to sex, age, height, , and left ventricular ejection fraction. All participants underwent an ultrasound of the thoracic aorta and a level III respiratory polygraphy. OSA was defined as apnea-hypopnea index ≥5/h. The prevalence of OSA was compared with conditional logistic regression and controlling for the matching variables.A total of 312 patients (mean age 65 ± 11 years, 82% male, mean  mass index 27 ± 4 kg/) were successfully 2-to-1 matched in the final model. Prevalence of OSA was significantly higher in the TAA-group when compared to the matched control group (63 vs. 47%; odds ratio 1.87 [95% CI 1.05-3.34]; p = 0.03). When applying a higher apnea-hypopnea index threshold (≥15/h), the odds ratio increased to 3.25 (95% CI 1.65-6.42; p < 0.001). The median apnea-hypopnea index was higher in patients with TAA (9.2/h [3.3-20.0] vs. 4.5/h [2.2-11.1], p < 0.001).Patients with TAA have a higher prevalence of OSA when compared to the general population. Since OSA is effectively treatable and might contribute to the pathogenesis of TAA, further longitudinal trials are needed to assess the association between OSA and TAA.© 2019 S.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified radiation safety protocol in reducing patient dose during paediatric interventional cardiac catheterisation.Radiation dose data were retrospectively extracted from January 2014 to December 2015 (Standard group) and prospectively collected from January 2016 to December 2017 (Low-dose group) after implementation of a modified radiation safety protocol. Both groups included five most common procedures: atrial septal defect closure, patent ductus arteriosus closure, perimembranous ventricular septal defect closure, pulmonary valvuloplasty, and supraventricular tachycardia ablation.Median air Kerma was 48.4, 50.5, 29.75, 149, 218, and 12.9 mGy for atrial septal defect closure, pulmonary valvuloplasty, patent ductus arteriosus closure <20 kg, ventricular septal defect closure <20 kg, ventricular septal defect closure ≧20 kg, and supraventricular tachycardia ablation in Standard group, respectively, which significantly decreased to 18.75, 20.7, 11.5, 41.9, 117, and 3.3 mGy in Low-dose group (p < 0.05). This represents a reduction in dose to each patient between 46 and 74%. Among five procedural types in Low-dose group, dose of ventricular septal defect closure was the highest with median air Kerma of 62.5 mGy, dose area product of 364.7 μGy., and dose area product per  of 21.5 μGy./kg, respectively, along with the longest fluoroscopy time of 9.9 minutes.We provided a feasible radiation safety protocol with specific settings on a case-by-case basis.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of individualized lifestyle interventions on  management in people with SMI were included. Primary outcomes were differences in endpoint  mass index (BMI) and the proportion achieving clinically relevant  loss (≥5%). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, cardiometabolic risk factors, and adverse effects.We included 41 RCTs (n = 4,267). All trials were at high risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The experimental interventions reduced the mean difference in BMI by -0.63 kg/ (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.02 to -0.23; p = 0.002; I2 = 70.7%) compared to the control groups. At postintervention follow-up (17 RCTs), the effect size remained similar but was no longer significant (BMI = -0.63 kg/; 95% CI = -1.30 to 0.04; p = 0.07; I2 = 48.8%). The risk ratio for losing ≥5% of baseline  was 1.51 (95% CI = 1.07-2.13; p = 0.02) compared to the control groups.

However, previous studies indicate that the restricted consumption of red meat in the diet may affect long-term sustainability in non-Mediterranean countries. A 24-week randomised controlled parallel cross-over design compared a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 2-3 serves per week of fresh, lean pork (MedPork) with a low-fat control diet (LF). Thirty-three participants at risk of CVD followed each intervention for 8 weeks, with an 8-week washout period separating interventions. The primary outcome was home-measured systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP),  composition and dietary adherence. During the MedPork intervention, participants achieved high adherence to dietary guidelines. Compared with the MedPork intervention, the LF intervention led to greater reductions in  (Δ = -0·65; 95 % CI -0·04, -1·25 kg, P = 0·04), BMI (Δ = -0·25; 95 % CI -0·03, -0·47 kg/, P = 0·01) and waist circumference (Δ = -1·40; 95 % CI -0·45, -2·34 cm, P < 0·01).

Predictors and severity of hypoglycaemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding were investigated in a large prospective study.This study was performed at an excellence centre for BS at a tertiary care institution. Data of 333 patients (mean BMI: 44.9 ± 9.6 kg/; mean age: 40 ± 10 years; 80.7% women) were analysed in a prospective study with a 2-year observation period after BS. All patients underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurements of blood glucose (BG) and insulin. For the purpose of this study, hypoglycaemia was defined as a post-challenge BG <2.8 mmol/L during the OGTT.72 (25.6%) of 281 patients showed post-challenge hypoglycaemia after surgery. Hypoglycaemia was different after various procedures: 32.6% of patients after RYGB, 22.6% after sleeve gastrectomy, but only 2.3% after gastric banding had hypoglycaemia. In the whole group, patients with hypoglycaemia had lost more  (p = 0.013), had a slightly greater decrease in BMI (p = 0.037), a greater change in 2-hour post-challenge BG (p = 0.001), and a smaller change in 1-hour post-challenge insulin (p = 0.004) compared to patients without hypoglycaemia.This prospective study shows a higher prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia (25.6%) after BS than anticipated from retrospective registers.

To our knowledge, no larger deletions have been reported.A 17-year-old adolescent male was evaluated due to delayed puberty and short stature. He had a height of 154.4 cm (SDS -2.84), a  of 53.3 kg (SDS -1.41), a BMI of 22.4 kg/ (SDS +0.31), a Tanner 2 pubertal stage with a testicular volume of 10 mL, and a bone age of 16 years (SDS -1.33). After biochemical evaluation, low IGF-I levels, undetectable IGFBP-3 levels, and a normal response to the GH stimulation test were observed, suggesting GH insensitivity. ACLSD was confirmed by ALS measurement (116 ng/mL, SDS -3.19) and genetic analysis of IGFALS. An apparently homozygous missense variant, p. Pro624Leu, was found in exon 2 of the proband; this mutation was observed on one allele of the proband's father but was absent in the mother and siblings. Deletion/duplication analysis by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was consistent with a deletion encompassing a significant part of exon 2 on one allele in the proband and in his mother and siblings.This is the first report of a large deletion in a patient with ACLSD. Deletion/duplication analysis should be considered in the genetic study of ACLSD, especially when homozygosity for a pathogenic variant cannot be confirmed by the study of the parents or when no variants are found but ALS concentrations are very low.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Maternal blood samples were also collected. Study B: data from previously-tested samples of TAs collected from preterm newborn infants were re-analyzed in the light of the findings in the new cohort.Study A: 39 preterm newborn infants were studied. A moderate correlation emerged between maternal WBCs and neutrophils and those of their newborn in the first 3 days of life. WBCs and neutrophils correlated in the newborn during the first 8 days of life. Decision rules based on birth  (BW) and gestational age (GA) can be used to predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neutrophil levels were lower in the TAs from the newborn with the lowest GAs and BWs. Study B: after removing the effect of GA on BPD development, previously-tested newborn were matched by GA. Monocyte phenotype 1 (Mon1) levels were lower in the blood of newborn with BPD, associated with a higher ratio of Monocyte phenotype 3 (Mon3) to Mon1. Newborn infants from mothers with histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) had lower levels of classically-activated macrophages (M1) and higher levels of alternatively-activated macrophages () in their TAs than newborn infants from healthy mothers.Immune cell behavior in preterm newborn infants was examined in detail. Surprisingly, neutrophil levels were lower in TAs from the newborn with the lowest GA and BW, and no correlation emerged between the neutrophil and NET levels in TAs and the other variables measured. Interestingly, monocyte phenotype seemed to influence the onset of BPD.

Recent data indicated that a specific diet may affect the course and appearance of acne. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between  mass index (BMI) and acne prevalence and severity. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 143 consecutively recruited adolescents aged between 12 and 18. All participants were physically examined, including measurement of  and height and type and severity of acne. Acne lesions were evaluated as not present (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3). The predominant type of acne lesions was used to classify the acne into one of the following subtypes: comedonic acne, papulo-pustular acne, and nodulo-cystic acne. Acne was present in 123 adolescents (86.0%) being more prevalent in teenagers ≥15 years old than in those between 12 and 14 years old (97.1% vs. 76.0%, respectively, P<0.001). The prevalence of acne did not differ significantly between teenagers with different BMI. However, those teenagers who were overweight or obese suffer from the inflammatory type of acne (papulo-pustular or nodulo-cystic) more often compared with underweight, slim, or normal- teenagers (P=0.03). The mean BMI value in patients with comedonic acne was significantly lower (mean BMI ± Standard Deviation (SD): 20.0±3.5 kg/) when compared with papulo-pustular acne (22.2±3.8 kg/, P=0.04) or nodulo-cystic acne (23.9±5.1 kg/, P<0.01). The BMI value correlated significantly with the severity of acne (ρ=0.33, P<0.001) and with higher number of skin areas involved with acne (ρ=0.23, P<0.01). Our findings clearly indicate the association between overweight/obesity and acne.

In the present prospective cohort study, we sought to determine whether oocyte size and morphology are associated with patient characteristics in non-PCOS women. Oocyte and oolemmal diameter were measured, enlarged perivitelline space (PVS) and ooplasmic granulation were assessed in 308 MII oocytes from 77 IVF/ICSI couples. Statistical analysis was undertaken using SAS version 9.4 (SAS institute Inc., USA). Continuous values are presented as mean ± SD and compared using a two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Categorical parameters are presented as proportions and compared using a Fisher exact test. Logistic and linear regression models were used to control for the effect of age for categorical and continuous variables respectively. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patients presented with a mean age of 40.3±5.0 years, had a BMI of 25.1±6.1 kg/, median AMH levels of 0.6 ng/ml and produced a median of 4 oocytes. Mean total oocyte diameter was 163.2±7.4 μm (range 145.8-182.1 μm), while oolemmal diameter was 109.4±4.1 μm (range 98.5-122.3 μm). After adjusting for age and ovarian reserve increasing BMI was associated with decreased total oocyte diameter (p<0.05). Total oocyte diameter was also inversely associated with AMH levels (p = 0.03) and oocyte yield (p = 0.04). In contrast to total oocyte diameter, oolemmal diameter was not related to patient characteristics. Younger women and those with large oocyte yields demonstrated fewer oocytes with ooplasmic granulation (p<0.05 and p = 0.01). After adjustments for age, ooplasmic granulation was also less frequently observed in oocytes from women with higher AMH (p = 0.03) and increasing BMI (p<0.01). Fertilization was more likely in oocytes with larger oolemmal diameter (p = 0.008). Embryos from oocytes with larger total and ooplasmic diameters were more likely to be transferred or frozen (p = 0.004 and p = 0.01). In non-PCOS infertile women, BMI and ovarian function relate to total oocyte diameter. These results expand on previously observed associations between oocyte size and BMI in women with PCOS. They indicate the importance of detailed oocyte assessments, which may aid the currently used criteria for embryo selection and help to better understand how oocyte status is associated with later embryo development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364586>The CODATwins Project: The Current Status and Recent Findings of COllaborative Project of Development of Anthropometrical  in Twins.</a></h2><p>The COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical  in Twins (CODATwins) project is a large international collaborative effort to analyze individual-level phenotype data from twins in multiple cohorts from different environments. The main objective is to study factors that modify genetic and environmental variation of height,  mass index (BMI, kg/) and size at birth, and additionally to address other research questions such as long-term consequences of birth size. The project started in 2013 and is open to all twin projects in the world having height and   on twins with information on zygosity. Thus far, 54 twin projects from 24 countries have provided individual-level data. The CODATwins database includes 489,981 twin individuals (228,635 complete twin pairs). Since many twin cohorts have collected longitudinal data, there is a total of 1,049,785 height and  observations. For many cohorts, we also have information on birth  and length, own smoking behavior and own or parental education. We found that the heritability estimates of height and BMI systematically changed from infancy to old age. Remarkably, only minor differences in the heritability estimates were found across cultural-geographic regions, measurement time and birth cohort for height and BMI. In addition to genetic epidemiological studies, we looked at associations of height and BMI with education, birth  and smoking status. Within-family analyses examined differences within same-sex and opposite-sex dizygotic twins in birth size and later development. The CODATwins project demonstrates the feasibility and value of international collaboration to address gene-by-exposure interactions that require large sample sizes and address the effects of different exposures across time, geographical regions and socioeconomic status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536528>Trends in maternal prepregnancy  mass index (BMI) and its association with birth and maternal outcomes in California, 2007-2016: A retrospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>To determine recent trends in maternal prepregnancy  mass index (BMI) and to quantify its association with birth and maternal outcomes.A population-based retrospective cohort study included resident women with singleton births in the California Birth Statistical Master Files (BSMF) database from 2007 to 2016. There were 4,621,082 women included out of 5,054,968 women registered in the database. 433,886 (8.6%) women were excluded due to invalid or missing information for BMI. Exposures were underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/), normal  (18.5-24.9 kg/), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/), and obese (≥ 30 kg/) at the onset of pregnancy. Obesity was subcategorized into class I (30.0-34.9 kg/), class II (35.0-39.9 kg/), and class III (≥ 40 kg/), while adverse outcomes examined were low birth  (LBW), very low birth  (VLBW), macrosomic births, preterm birth (PTB), very preterm birth (VPTB), small-for-gestational-age birth (SGA), large-for-gestational-age birth (LGA), and cesarean delivery (CD). Descriptive analysis, simple linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression were performed, and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations were estimated.Over the ten-year study period, the prevalence of underweight and normal  women at time of birth declined by 10.6% and 9.7%, respectively, while the prevalence of overweight and obese increased by 4.3% and 22.9%, respectively. VLBW increased significantly with increasing BMI, by 24% in overweight women and by 76% in women with class III obesity from 2007 to 2016. Women with class III obesity also had a significant increase in macrosomic birth (170%) and were more likely to deliver PTB (33%), VPTB (66%), LGA (231%), and CD (208%) than women with a normal BMI. However, obese women were less likely to have SGA infants; underweight women were 51% more likely to have SGA infants than women with a normal BMI.In California from 2007 to 2016, there was a declining trend in women with prepregnancy normal , and a rising trend in overweight and obese women, particularly obesity class III. Both extremes of prepregnancy BMI were associated with an increased incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes; however, the worse outcomes were prominent in those women classified as obese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302373>Luteolin reduces adipose tissue macrophage inflammation and insulin resistance in postmenopausal obese mice.</a></h2><p>Previously, we showed that loss of ovarian function in mice fed high-fat diet exacerbated insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation. In the current study, we tested whether consumption of luteolin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, could mitigate adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in obese ovariectomized mice. Nine-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 0.005% luteolin (HFD+L) for 16 weeks. Results showed no difference in  or fat mass between mice fed HFD+L and those fed HFD. However, luteolin supplementation resulted in lower CD11c macrophages in gonadal adipose tissue, as well as a trend toward lower macrophage infiltration. Luteolin supplementation also significantly lowered mRNA expression of inflammatory and M1 markers MCP-1, CD11c, TNF-α and IL-6, while maintaining expression of  marker MGL1. Consistent with this, the in vitro luteolin treatment, with or without the presence of estrogen, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced polarization of RAW 264.7 cells toward M1 phenotype. We further found that luteolin supplementation protected mice from insulin resistance induced by HFD consumption; this improved insulin resistance was correlated with reductions in CD11c adipose tissue macrophages. Taken together, these findings indicate that dietary luteolin supplementation attenuates adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance found in mice with loss of ovarian function coupled with an HFD intake, and this effect may be partly mediated through suppressing M1-like polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue. These results have clinical implication in implementing dietary intervention for prevention of metabolic syndrome associated with postmenopause and obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There is a lot of evidence that some polyphenols, such as green tea, have a positive impact on the OS state and consecutively, on inflammation.the purposes of this study were: a) evaluate OS biomarkers in both obese and normal  women; and b) evaluate if green tea supplementation has an impact on OS and inflammatory cytokine biomarkers of obese women.we evaluated obese ( mass index [BMI] ≥ 40 kg/m²) and normal  (BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m²) women. Blood samples were used to access malondialdehyde (MDA), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and inflammatory cytokines. We randomly chose obese patients (18 individuals) and then gave them green tea supplementation for eight weeks. Statistical analysis included the Shapiro-Wilk, Wilcoxon, independent and paired t tests; p < 0.05 were considered as significant.we enrolled 42 obese (BMI: 48.2 ± 9.3kg/) and 21 normal  (BMI: 22.5 ± 2 kg/) women with an average age of 36.2 ± 9.1 years old. The serum levels of MDA were higher in obese (2.52 ± 0.31 µmol/l) than in eutrophic women (2.13 ± 0.26 µmol/l; p = 0.000). On the other hand, lower TEAC values were observed in the obese (0.75 ± 0.06 mM/l) than in the eutrophic group (0.78 ± 0.04 mM/l; p = 0.009). After the green tea intervention, MDA decreased 4.7% and TEAC increased 10%. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum levels decreased 12.7% after treatment (p = 0.03).a) the obese group had lower antioxidant capacity than eutrophic; and b) green tea supplementation ameliorated TEAC and MDA and reduced serum levels of IL-6 in obese women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483797>Posturographic characteristics of the standing posture and the effects of the treatment of obesity on obese young women.</a></h2><p>To determine the impact of  on quiet standing postural sway characteristics in young women, this research compared spontaneous oscillations of the center of foot pressure (COP) between 32 obese (BMI: 36.4 ± 5.2 kg/), and 26 normal- (BMI: 21.4 ± 1.5 kg/) women and assessed the influence of obesity treatment and  reduction on postural sway. Trajectories of the COP were assessed while the subjects were standing quietly with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC). Both in the sagittal (AP) and frontal (ML) planes the sway range, average velocity, and maximal velocity of COP were calculated. Moreover, the total average and maximal velocities were computed. In the obese group, the tests were performed twice-before and after the obesity treatment. A greater (18% in EC) AP sway range and a substantial reduction of ML sway (25% in EO, 22% in EC) were observed in the obese women. The total COP velocities (average and maximal) were decreased in obese women (20% and 20% in EO) as well as the velocities in the frontal plane (EO: 33%, 41%; EC: 34%, 40%).  reduction resulted in significant changes in postural sway. The following parameters increased: ML sway range (28% in EO), average (20% in EO, 16% in EC) and maximal ML (20% in EO) velocities. The results indicate that young obese women in the habitual standing position are characterized by the destabilizing influence of mass in the sagittal plane only in the absence of a visual control. This effect is dominated by the stabilizing mass effect in the frontal plane, which affects overall postural stability when standing. The reduction of  mass enables a decrease in ML static stability, likely due to natural changes in the base of support while standing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383241>Information on Bedtimes and Wake Times Improves the Relation Between Self-Reported and Objective Assessments of Sleep in Adults.</a></h2><p>To investigate the correlation between self-reported and objective  of total sleep time (TST) in adults and examine whether sex, race/ethnicity, and  status influence this association.Participants were individuals who screened for sleep intervention studies, providing > 7 days of wrist actigraphy sleep data (TSTobj) and reporting sleep duration (TSTPSQI) using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire (n = 53 men, 60 women; 59% minority/Hispanics; age 30.9 ± 9.7 years;  mass index 26.2 ± 3.2 kg/). In addition, TSTbed/wake was calculated as the difference between bedtime and waketime, minus the time to fall asleep, from the PSQI. Univariate regression analyses were performed to assess the relation between TSTobj and TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake and compare the relation by sex, race, and ethnicity. Bland-Altman tests were done to assess bias by sex, race/ethnicity,  status, and sleep quality.TSTbed/wake correlated with TSTobj ( = .57,  < .0001). TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake were greater than TSTobj (0.63 ± 0.99 hours and 0.79 ± 0.76 hours, respectively, both  < .0001). The difference between TSTPSQI and TSTobj did not vary by sex (β = .12,  = .52), race/ethnicity (β = .15,  = .48), age (β = -.01,  = .27), or  mass index (β = .04,  = .13) whereas that between TSTbed/wake and TSTobj varied by age (β = -.020,  = .0051), BMI (β = .054,  = .0021), race/ethnicity (β = .36,  = .021), and sleep efficiency (β = -.089,  < .0001).Calculating TST using self-reported bedtimes and wake times provided TST estimate that correlated with TSTobj but greater over-reporting occurred in younger and heavier individuals, non-whites or Hispanics, and those with low sleep efficiency. In clinical and research settings, asking individuals to report bedtimes, wake times, and length of time to fall asleep may more accurately estimate TST than asking about sleep duration alone.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of individual characteristics on maximum IVC diameter (IVCmax), Ao, and IVCmax/Ao in healthy Chinese children. From September to December 2015, 200 healthy children from 1 to 13 years of age were enrolled. IVCmax and Ao diameters were measured by 2D ultrasound. We found that age (years), height (cm),  (kg), waist circumference (cm), and BSA () were positively correlated with IVCmax and Ao. Multivariate linear regression showed that age was the only independent variable for IVCmax (mm) in female children, height was the only independent variable for IVCmax in male children, and age was the only independent variable for Ao in both females and males. IVCmax/Ao was not significantly influenced by the subjects' characteristics. In conclusion, IVCmax and Ao were more susceptible to subjects' characteristics than IVCmax/Ao. IVCmax/Ao could be a reliable and practical parameter in Chinese children as it was independent of age, height, and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511803>Association of Obesity Indicators with Hypertension in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.</a></h2><p>To study the association of waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and  mass index (BMI) with hypertension in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in a tertiary care hospital.The anthropometric  of patients were recorded in the Diabetic Outdoor of Nishtar Hospital Multan from 2013 to 2018 after taking approval from the Institutional Ethical Review Committee.

Traditional Chinese medicine could be an alternative therapeutic option for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula that combines Rhizoma Coptidis and Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluated YH1 as an add-on medication for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.Forty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned 1:1 to the YH1 or placebo group. Before the trial, all subjects had received three or more classes of OHAs with HbA1c > 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a  mass index ≥ 23 kg/. During the 12-week trial, participants continued to take OHAs without any dose or medication changes. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in HbA1c level. Per-protocol analysis was applied to the final evaluation.At week 12, there was an 11.1% reduction in HbA1c from baseline and a 68.9% increase in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of β cell function in the YH1 group, which also exhibited significant reductions in two-hour postprandial glucose (-26.2%), triglycerides (-29.5%), total cholesterol (-21.6%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.4%),  (-0.5%), and waist circumference (-1.1%). The changes in fasting plasma glucose, HOMA insulin resistance and symptom scores were not significantly different between the YH1 and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred during this clinical trial.This pilot study indicates that YH1 together with OHAs can improve hypoglycemic action and β-cell function in overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a safe add-on medication for OHAs and has beneficial effects on  control and lipid metabolism.

Outcome assessment occurred at weeks 0 and 24. Energy intake, activity, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were measured with doubly labeled water (DLW; with and without adjustments for change in RMR), armband accelerometers, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Appetite and compensatory health beliefs were measured by self-report.A per-protocol analysis included 171 participants (72.5% women; mean ± SD baseline  mass index: 31.5 ± 4.7 kg/). Significant (P < 0.01) compensation occurred in the 8 KKW (mean: 1.5 kg; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.2 kg) and 20 KKW (mean: 2.7 kg; 95% CI: 2.0, 3.5 kg) groups, and compensation differed significantly between the exercise groups (P = 0.01). Energy intake by adjusted DLW increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the 8 KKW (mean: 90.7 kcal/d; 95% CI: 35.1, 146.4 kcal/d) and 20 KKW (mean: 123.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: 64.5, 182.7 kcal/d) groups compared with control (mean: -2.3 kcal/d; 95% CI: -58.0, 53.5 kcal/d). Results were similar without DLW adjustment. RMR and physical activity (excluding structured exercise) did not differentially change among the 3 groups. Participants with higher compared with lower compensation reported increased appetite ratings and beliefs that healthy behaviors can compensate for unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, they increased craving for sweet foods, increased sleep disturbance, and had worsening bodily pain.Compensation resulted from increased energy intake and concomitant increases in appetite, which can be treated with dietary or pharmacological interventions. Compensation was not due to activity or metabolic changes.

Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones.We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with obesity (mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10 y; BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg ] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and insulin AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01).A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating insulin.

In a randomized crossover study, 9 healthy men (BMI: 23.0 ±2.1 kg/, 26.6 ±3.5 y) passed 3x3 days in a metabolic chamber: 3 levels of ET (low, medium and high; physical activity level = 1.3-1.4, 1.5-1.6 and 1.7-1.8) were performed at zero energy balance (EB), caloric restriction (CR), and overfeeding (OF) (100%, 75%, 125% of individual energy requirement). Different levels of ET were obtained by walking (4 km/h) on a treadmill (0, 165, 330 min). 24-h macronutrient oxidation and relative macronutrient balance (oxidation relative to intake) were calculated and free fatty acids, 24-h insulin and catecholamine secretion were analyzed as determinants of fat oxidation. During EB and OF, 24-h fat oxidation increased with higher ET. This resulted in a higher relative fat balance at medium ET (EB: +17%, OF: +14%) and high ET (EB: +23%, OF: +17%) compared to low ET (all p<0.05). In contrast, CR led to a stimulation of 24-h fat oxidation irrespective of ET (no differences in relative fat balance between ET levels, p>0.05). In conclusion, under highly controlled conditions a higher energy turnover improved relative fat balance in young healthy men during overfeeding and energy balance compared to a sedentary state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322697>The effect of sex and  on lung volumes during sleep.</a></h2><p>Low lung volumes are thought to contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is worse in the supine versus lateral  position, men versus women, obese versus normal- (NW) individuals and REM versus NREM sleep. All of these conditions may be associated with low lung volumes. The aim was to measure FRC during wake, NREM, and REM in NW and overweight (OW) men and women while in the supine and lateral  positions.Eighty-one healthy adults were instrumented for polysomnography, but with nasal pressure replaced with a sealed, non-vented mask connected to an N2 washout system. During wakefulness and sleep, repeated measurements of FRC were made in both supine and right lateral positions.Two hundred eighty-five FRC  were obtained during sleep in 29 NW ( mass index [BMI] = 22 ± 0.3 kg/) and 29 OW (BMI = 29 ± 0.7 kg/) individuals. During wakefulness, FRC differed between BMI groups and positions (supine: OW = 58 ± 3 and NW = 68 ± 3% predicted; lateral OW = 71 ± 3, NW = 81 ± 3% predicted). FRC fell from wake to NREM sleep in all participants and in both positions by a similar amount. As a result, during NREM sleep FRC was lower in OW than NW individuals (supine 46 ± 3 and 56 ± 3% predicted, respectively). FRC during REM was similar to NREM and no sex differences were observed in any position or sleep stage.Reductions in FRC while supine and with increased  may contribute to worsened OSA in these conditions, but low lung volumes appear unlikely to explain the worsening of OSA in REM and in men versus women.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common comorbidity in patients with MO. The aim is to study T2DM remission and to develop a prediction model for T2DM remission after two-stage surgical treatment of patients with MO.Materials and methods: The study included 97 patients with MO. The mean BMI was 68.08 (95% CI: 66.45 - 69.71) kg/. 70 (72,2%) patients with MO were diagnosed with T2DM. The first stage of treatment for the main group (n=60) included the IGB placement, for the control group (n=37) - conservative therapy. In the second stage of treatment the patients underwent bariatric surgery. The study addresses such indicators as BMI, percentage of  loss, percentage of excess  loss, ASA physical status class, fasting glucose level, HbA1c, C-peptide.Results: Two-stage treatment of morbidly obese patients with T2DM promotes complete T2DM remission in 68.1% of patients. The risk prediction model for failure to achieve complete T2DM remission 12 months after LRYGB based on a baseline C-peptide level has a high predictive value, AUC = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.93), OR = 0.23 ( 95% CI: 0.08-0.67).Conclusions: Two-stage treatment of patients with MO promotes improvement of carbohydrate metabolism indicators. With a C-peptide level > 3.7 ng/ml, prediction of complete T2DM remission 12 months after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is favorable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612206>Effects of environmental complexity on welfare indicators of fast-growing broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Increasing environmental complexity, e.g., by providing environmental enrichment, has been suggested as a way to increase activity levels and improve leg health in broilers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of environmental complexity on leg health and  of welfare of fast-growing broilers housed according to conventional European legislation. A total of 58 pens with approximately 500 broilers each (Ross 308), corresponding to a stocking density of 40 kg/, were used. A total of 8 treatment groups, of which 5 were enrichment treatments (roughage, vertical panels, straw bales, and elevated platforms at 5 and 30 cm) and 3 were standard resources manipulations [increased distances between feed and water (7 m and 3.5 m), stocking density reduced to 34 kg/, and 1 control group (1.5 m distance between feed and water and no enrichment objects)] were randomly assigned to each pen. At 35 D of age, 60 birds from each pen were assessed for gait, footpad dermatitis, hock burns, plumage cleanliness, presence of scratches, and leg deformities. Birds housed with 30 cm elevated platforms had worse gait compared to those housed with straw bales and at the lower stocking density of 34 kg/ (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001). Broilers from the control group also had worse gait compared to those housed at 34 kg/ stocking density. In addition, birds housed with access to a 30 cm elevated platform had healthier footpads compared to birds housed with access to straw bales (P = 0.0001) and with increased distance between feed and water (P = 0.011). Furthermore, birds housed with straw bales had worse footpad condition compared to birds with access to a 5 cm elevated platform (P = 0.002). There were no observed treatment effects on scratches, plumage cleanliness, leg deformities and  (P > 0.05). Based on the welfare indicators used in the present study, decreased stocking density has the potential of improving animal welfare, whereas the effects of elevated platforms need to be further studied before a final conclusion can be drawn, as footpad health was positively affected, but walking ability was impaired.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603914>The effectiveness of a community-based, type 2 diabetes prevention programme on health-related quality of life. The DE-PLAN study.</a></h2><p>The DE-PLAN was a European multicenter study, with the primary objective of testing whether a community-based lifestyle modification programme could serve as a means of primary prevention for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk individuals (based on the FINDRISC questionnaire). The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a 1-year community-based lifestyle intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals from four participating European centers (Athens, Barcelona, Krakow, Kaunas), through a post-hoc analysis.Each center was allowed to implement different intervention strategies specifically tailored to the needs of their corresponding population sample. Before and after the intervention, participants underwent clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, an oral glucose tolerance test and lipid profile measurements. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the validated HRQOL-15D questionnaire. A difference of ±0.015 in the 15D questionnaire score was set as the threshold of clinically meaningful change.Data from 786 participants (67% females, mean age 59.7±9.4 years, BMI 31.5±4.5 kg/) with complete data regarding the HRQOL were analyzed (Athens: 104, Barcelona: 434, Krakow: 175, Kaunas: 70). After 1 year, a significant overall improvement in HRQOL was shown, as depicted by a change of 15D score from baseline value (0.88±0.9) to post-intervention (0.90±0.87, P<0.001), achieving the threshold of clinically meaningful change. A significant  reduction was also observed (-0.8±4.0 kg, P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, improvement in HRQOL was independently associated with lower 15D score at baseline (P<0.001) and self-reported increase in overall exercise time (P<0.001) as assessed through specifically designed trial questionnaires.A community-based lifestyle intervention programme aiming at T2D prevention, applied on a heterogeneous population and with varied methods, was shown to improve overall health-related quality of life to a clinically meaningful degree.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430355>Pain interference type and level guide the assessment process in chronic pain: Categorizing pain patients entering tertiary pain treatment with the Brief Pain Inventory.</a></h2><p>Chronic pain patients enter treatment with different problem profiles making careful assessment a necessity for more individualized treatment plans. In this cross-sectional study we assigned 320 patients entering tertiary multidisciplinary pain treatment into four categories based on whether they scored low or high on the activity and the affective pain interference dimensions of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). To determine whether this categorization system delineates issues that should be assessed further, the categories were compared with ANOVA and MANOVA analyses on three domains: variables affecting physical well-being ( mass index, exercise, substance use), psychological resources (mood), and pain-specific psychological factors (pain anxiety, pain acceptance). The results indicated that subjects who scored low on both interference dimensions compared similarly in : mean  Mass Index (BMI) 27.0 (SD 6.0) kg/, and exercise: mean of 2.4 (SD 1.7) exercising sessions over 20 minutes per week, to the general population, had no depressive symptoms on average: mean Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II) score 11.7 (SD 7.5), and had the most favorable psychological reactions to pain relative to the other categories: mean total Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20) score 36.4 (SD 17.9). In contrast, when interference was high on activity, more physical well-being problems were evident e.g. : mean BMI 31.0 (SD 7.3) kg/, diminished exercise: mean of 1.5 (SD 1.6) exercising sessions per week, and avoidance behavior: mean PASS-20 Escape/Avoidance subscale 3.7 (95% CI: 1.7 to 5.8) scores higher in comparison to activity interference remaining low. With high affective interference, more depressive symptoms: mean BDI-II score 17.7 (SD 7.3), and more cognitive pain anxiety: mean PASS-20 Cognitive Anxiety subscale 2.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 4.8) scores higher in comparison to affective interference remaining low, emerged. Having high interference on both dimensions indicated accumulated risks for reduced physical well-being: mean BMI 29.9 (SD 6.1) kg/, mean of 1.2 (SD 1.7) exercising sessions per week, mood problems: mean BDI-II 20.3 (SD 10.6), and negative psychological reactions to pain: mean total PASS-20 score 53.2 (18.4). The results suggest that low interference on both dimensions may allow assessment with only physician consultations, while high interference on either dimension may call attention to distinct issues to be addressed with the help of a physiotherapist or a psychologist, whereas high interference on both dimensions highlights the need for a full multidisciplinary assessment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166482>Lipid profile and statin use in critical care setting: implications for kidney outcome.</a></h2><p>To determine whether pre-hospital statin use is associated with lower renal replacement therapy requirement and/or death during intensive care unit stay.Prospective cohort analysis.

Males gained more  (Male:3.8 kg; Female:1.8 kg), fat mass (Male:2.7 kg; Female:1.5 kg), lean mass (Male:1.1 kg; Female:0.3 kg) and BMI (Male:1.2 kg/; Female:0.7 kg/; p≤0.001 for interactions), and had greater increases in waist circumference (Male:2.7 cm; Female:1.1 cm) and waist:hip ratio (Male:0.02; Female:0.004; p<0.05 for interactions) than females. Energy intake remained the same over the year in both sexes, accompanied by an increase in alcohol (ethanol) in both sexes but more so in males than females (p = 0.011 interaction). Diet quality decreased, characterized by a reduced intake of healthy foods/beverages (p<0.05) in both sexes such as yogurt, cheese, oatmeal, breads, rice, pasta, vegetables, green salad, fruits, steak, fish, nuts and milk, and an increased consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages (p<0.05) such as donuts/cakes, fried chicken, beer and liquor. Significant interactions between sexes indicated that males displayed a more adverse and lower quality eating pattern which included greater intakes of donuts/cakes, fried chicken, beer and liquor, as well as decreased intakes of eggs and vegetables compared to females. Lastly, some dietary intake changes significantly correlated with fat mass and waist circumference change indicating that poor dietary choices were associated with increased adiposity.Our study demonstrated that during first-year university, both male and female students undergo unfavorable changes in nutrition and /composition that significantly differ between sexes, with males showing more adverse changes. Our results can be used to inform effective sex-specific strategies and interventions to improve dietary habits during the transition to university life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658911>Prevalence of undernutrition in Bangladeshi children.</a></h2><p>Child undernutrition is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in developing countries. The main objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for acute undernutrition among under-5 children in Bangladesh. Data were taken from the nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic Health and Survey conducted in 2014. The study sample comprised 7131 under-5 children. Of these, 4.6% were found to be severely wasted (Z-score < -3.0), 11.1% moderately wasted (-3.0≤Z-score < -2.0) and 84.3% adequately nourished (Z-score ≥-2.0). Chi-squared analysis was used to investigate the association between child nutrition status and selected covariates. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to identify the risk factors for acute undernutrition. The selected factors division, place of residence, sex of child, place of delivery, child age, respiratory illness, size at birth, measles vaccination, fever, diarrhoea, maternal BMI, maternal education, paternal occupation, wealth index and household toilet facilities were found to be highly significant (p < 0.05) in the analysis.

Hospital records were retrospectively reviewed. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, haemodynamic parameters, airway and anaesthetic management and complications.The study included 95 patients (mean age, 37.4±12.1 years; mean  mass index, 46 Kg/). Despite high airway assessment scores in some patients, 93 patients (98%) were conventionally intubated using our modified ramp position. Anaesthesia induction involved propofol, and anaesthesia maintenance involved inhalation anaesthetics (remifentanil supplementation). Additionally, rocuronium and sugammadex were used. Postoperative pain was managed with multimodal analgesia. Dose calculations were mostly based on lean/ideal . Significant differences were found in the mean arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation before induction and 5 min after induction. Intraoperatively, 3 patients (3.2%) developed bronchospasm and 1 (1.1%) developed bradycardia. There were no postoperative complications.Inhalational anaesthesia with remifentanil and rocuronium-sugammadex is a safe option in bariatric surgery. Although conventional techniques are sufficient to establish the airway in most cases, preparations for difficult intubation should be made.

We investigated the association between a high-protein diet, RHF and declining kidney function.A total of 9226 subjects from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, a community-based prospective study (2001-14), were enrolled and classified into quartiles according to daily amount of protein intake based on food frequency questionnaires. RHF was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with residuals of >95th percentile after adjustment for age, sex, history of hypertension or diabetes, height and . Rapid decline of renal function was defined as decline rate of eGFR >3 mL/min/1.73 /year.The relative risk of RHF was 3.48-fold higher in the highest than in the lowest protein intake quartile after adjustment for confounding factors [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-8.71]. The mean eGFR decline rate was faster as quartiles of protein intake increased. Furthermore, the highest quartile was associated with 1.32-fold increased risk of rapid eGFR decline (95% CI 1.02-1.73). When subjects were divided into two groups with or without RHF, the highest quartile was associated with a rapid decline in renal function only in RHF subjects (odds ratio 3.35; 95% CI 1.07-10.51). The sensitivity analysis using the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-15) data with 40 113 subjects showed that higher quartile was associated with increased risk for RHF.A high-protein diet increases the risk of RHF and a rapid renal function decline in the general population. These findings suggest that a high-protein diet has a deleterious effect on renal function in the general population.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

QCT In Postmenopausal Females With Central Obesity.</a></h2><p>Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis, several reports have shown discordant T-score values measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and DXA especially in obese subjects, but it is still not clear whether BMD measurement by two modalities is affected by overall obesity or central obesity in postmenopausal females. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare BMD and T-scores by DXA and QCT and to evaluate whether these two osteoporosis assessment modalities yield different T-score values in postmenopausal females with obesity and central obesity.This cross-sectional study enrolled 44 postmenopausal females, referred for osteoporosis screening. Anthropometric indices (BMI- mass index, WC-waist circumference and ICO-index of central obesity) were measured and females underwent assessment of bone mineral density by DXA and QCT.Lumbar spine (LS) T-score values were significantly lower by DXA compared to qCT in females with BMI >25 kg/, (-1.9±1.5 vs. -2.3±1.2; p=0.039), in females with WC>88 cm(-1.9±1.5 vs. -2.4±1.2; p=0.008) and in females with ICO>0.5(-1.96±1.4 vs. -2.5±1.2; p=0.004). However, in normal  females and in those without central obesity, LS T-scores by DXA were not different than qCT.

The Mother and Infant Nutritional Assessment (MINA) cohort is a 3-year follow-up study of pregnant women and their children in Qatar and Lebanon. This study reports on the characteristics and determinants of pre-pregnancy BMI and Gestational  Gain (GWG) of MINA particiants, as well as birth outcomes. A total of 272 pregnant women were recruited during their first trimester from primary healthcare centers as well as private clinics in Beirut (n = 194) and Doha (n = 147). During the first visit, data collection included pre-pregnancy , sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. The  before delivery and neonatal outcomes were extracted from the medical records. GWG was calculated as the difference between  before delivery and pre-pregnancy  and was classified into insufficient, adequate, and excessive, as per the IOM criteria. Overall, 42.1% of women had a pre-pregnancy BMI≥25 Kg/ (58% in Qatar vs 30.8% in Lebanon, p<0.001). Only 30.2% of women had adequate GWG, while 25.7% and 44.1% of women had insufficient and excessive GWG, respectively. In the cohort 68.7% of infants had a  adequate-for-gestational age (AGA), 6.7% were SGA and 24.6% were LGA. The proportions of LGA were higher with greater GWG (p<0.05). After adjustment, Qatari women were 3 times more likely to be overweight or obese before pregnancy while a higher education level was associated with significantly lower odds of pre-pregnancy BMI≥25 Kg/. Pre-pregnancy BMI≥25 Kg/ and regular breakfast consumption were predictors of excessive GWG (OR: 3.20, CI: 1.48-6.91; OR: 2.84, CI: 1.15-7.02, respectively). The high prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight and excessive GWG among MINA participants underscores the need for culture-specific intervention programs to promote healthy  in women of childbearing age, and prevent excessive  gain during pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242980>A Multicenter Study of the Impact of  Mass Index (BMI) on the incidence of Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Among Saudi Patients with locally advanced Breast cancer (LABC) post Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC).</a></h2><p>Obesity was reported to be a poor prognostic factor for breast cancer. There is a growing evidence of increasing prevalence of obesity among Saudi women across all age groups (44%). Since the prognostic significance of obesity was not studied in Saudi patients with breast cancer, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of BMI on pCR in LABC patients post NAC.This is a retrospective study between May 2005 to July 2010; 246 consecutive female patients who were diagnosed of LABC (Stage II & III) and underwent surgery in three tertiary care centers, representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (King Saud Medical City, Riyadh; King Abdullah Hospital, Mecca and King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam) were included in this study. All included patients have received NAC (Anthracycline/Taxane based combination chemotherapy and ± Herceptin). Patients who were diagnosed to have stage IV breast cancer due to presence of distant metastasis were excluded. Patients were categorized as normal (BMI <25 kg/), overweight (BMI of 25 to <30 kg/) and obese (BMI >30 kg/). pCR was defined as no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary tissue. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the statistical associations between pCR and BMI with respect to the other previously established prognostic factors, namely age, tumor grade, stage, ER/ PR /Her-2neu status, molecular subtypes, and lympho-vascular invasion (LVI).The median age was 50 years (range 24-68). Molecular subtypes were as follows: luminal A; 23.2%, luminal B; 45.1%, triple negative; 16.7% and Her-2 neu positive; 15%. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma represents the majority of our cohort (92.7%). Eighty-six (35%) were stage II and 160 (65%) were stage III. Intermediate and high-grade malignancies were found in 52% and 44.3% of the patients respectively. Positive lymph vascular invasion was detected in 41.5%. Obese patients constitute 55.7% of our cohort. Pathologic complete response was achieved in 62 patients (25.2%). In Univariate analysis LVI and overweight /obesity were negatively correlated with pCR (P= 0.037 and 0.000 respectively) while tumor grade was positively correlated with pCR (P= 0.008). In multivariate analysis, Overweight/ obesity was the only significant independent factor correlating with pCR (P=0.000). No impact of BMI has been demonstrated on both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.93, 0.18 respectively).In this study, Overweight/Obesity (which represent more than half of the patients =81.3 %) had a negative impact on pCR in Saudi patients with LABC treated with NAC.

We reviewed the medical records of 374 T2DM patients aged between 20 and 75 years who were prescribed empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg as add-on therapy for more than 90 consecutive days. Changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline levels and the reduction in   of the study participants were assessed.

Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that a shorter duration of T2DM, higher baseline levels of HbA1c, and higher eGFR were positively associated with HbA1c reduction. Higher BMI and lower HbA1c levels were predictors of a more significant reduction in  among patients taking empagliflozin.

Our aim was to explore the effect of a regular maternal meal on fetal liver blood flow at two timepoints during the third trimester, representing the start and towards the end of the fetal fat accretion period. We also sought to explore the influence of prepregancy  mass index on how the maternal meal affects fetal liver blood flow.Using ultrasound Doppler, we examined 108 healthy women with singleton pregnancies in gestational weeks 30 and 36. At each visit, the first examination was performed with the participant in a fasting state at 08.30 a.m., followed by a standard breakfast meal of approximately 400 kcal. The examination was repeated after 105 minutes. Umbilical vein and ductus venosus blood flow was estimated from diameter and blood flow velocity measurements. Fetal liver flow was calculated as umbilical vein flow minus ductus venosus flow, and change in liver blood flow as flow after minus before the meal. The total group was divided into a normal- group (prepregancy  mass index 18.5-25.0 kg/; n = 83) and an overweight group (prepregancy  mass index >25.0 kg/; n = 21). Four women with prepregancy  mass index <18.5 kg/ were excluded from these analyses. Non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests were used for group comparisons.For the total group, we observed a significant increase in median (10th - 90th percentile) liver flow 28.9 (‒67.9-111.6) ml/min (p = 0.002) following the meal in week 36, but not in week 30, ‒2.63 (‒53.2-65.0) ml/min (p = 0.91). This result in turn yielded a statistically significant increase in delta liver flow from weeks 30 to 36 of 26.0 (‒107.1-146.6) ml/min (p = 0.008). The increase in postprandial liver flow was observed only in the normal- group in week 36. Accordingly, the delta liver flow values between the two  groups were significantly different in week 36 (p = 0.006) but not in week 30 (p = 0.155). Among the normal- women, the increase in delta liver blood flow from weeks 30 to 36 was 39.3 (‒83.0-156.1) ml/min (p<0.001); in contrast, we observed no statistically significant change in the overweight group (‒44.5 (‒229.0-123.2) ml/min; p = 0.073). As a substitute for liver size, we divided the delta liver flow values by abdominal circumference and found no changes in the statistical significance results within or between the two  groups.In our healthy study population, we observed a statistically significant difference in liver blood flow after maternal intake of a regular meal. This effect depended on gestational age and maternal prepregancy  mass index, but apparently was independent of liver size, based on abdominal circumference as a proxy measure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405702>The most appropriate cut-off point of anthropometric indices in predicting the incidence of metabolic syndrome and its components.</a></h2><p>The association of individuals' anthropometric indices with their development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been investigated in several studies. Taking into account the ethnic differences, this study aimed to determine the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices in predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in Ahvaz.This study is part of a cohort study conducted at the Diabetes Research Center of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences on a population of over 20 in Ahvaz during 2009-2014. Of the 592 patients, 505 patients who were not diagnosed with MetS in 2009, were entered into this study. The data analyzed involved demographic information including age and sex, anthropometric information including height, , waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and the ratios between them, laboratory data including blood levels of Triglyceride (TG), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and clinical data including systolic(S) and diastolic(D)blood pressure(BP). After 5 years, the subjects were re-evaluated for MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria and the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices for the prediction of the incidence of MetS using the Receiver Operative Characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained.Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) index with a cut-off point of 0.53 followed by WC with a cut-off point of 87.5 cm had the highest power to predict the incidence of MetS. The cut-off points of WC and  mass index (BMI) were respectively 89.5 cm and 26 kg/ for men, and 83.5 cm and 27.5 kg/ for women. All anthropometric indices were able to predict the components of this syndrome (with the exception of low HDL-C). The cut-off point of WC in predicting High FBS, High TG and High BP was 84.5, 84.8, and 86.5 cm, respectively.Overall, it seems that given its ease of measurement, the WC index is preferred to other indices for predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in clinical screening.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to  gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against  gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "browning" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low  in CT individuals. This knowledge could ultimately allow more targeted approaches for  management treatment strategies.

Our aim was to evaluate the separate and concomitant effects of GDM and maternal overweight/obesity on perinatal outcomes.We used the Finnish Medical Birth Register to identify all 24,577 women with a singleton pregnancy who delivered in 2009 in Finland and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Women were divided into groups according to the result of OGTT (GDM/no GDM) and pre-pregnancy  mass index (BMI): normal  (≤24.9 kg/), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/), and obese (≥30.0 kg/). Primary outcomes included macrosomia, caesarean delivery, and treatment at neonatal ward. Normal  women without GDM constituted the reference group.Compared to reference group, overweight or obese women without GDM had an increased risk of macrosomia [odds ratio adjusted for age, parity, smoking and socio-economic status (aOR)1.18 (95% CI 1.09-1.28) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.19-1.88)], and caesarean delivery [aORs 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.28) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.37-1.69)], respectively. In normal  GDM women the risk of macrosomia [aOR 1.17 (95% CI 0.85-1.62)] and caesarean delivery [aOR 1.10 (95% CI 0.96-1.27)] was not significantly increased as compared to normal  women without GDM. GDM increased the risk of treatment at neonatal ward in all BMI categories and maternal obesity without GDM was also a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward. Interaction p values between BMI and GDM on these outcomes were <0.001.Maternal overweight and obesity without GDM increased the risk of macrosomia and caesarean delivery when compared to the reference group. These risks were amplified when overweight/obesity was accompanied by GDM. Obesity without GDM was a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward; GDM increased this risk in all BMI categories. Our results suggest that especially maternal obesity should be considered as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and GDM further amplifies this risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648297>Augmented renal clearance of aminoglycosides using population-based pharmacokinetic modelling with Bayesian estimation in the paediatric ICU.</a></h2><p>To evaluate augmented renal clearance (ARC) using aminoglycoside clearance (CLAMINO24h) derived from pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling.A retrospective study at two paediatric hospitals of patients who received tobramycin or gentamicin from 1999 to 2016 was conducted. Compartmental PK models were constructed using the Pmetrics package, and Bayesian posteriors were used to estimate CLAMINO24h. ARC was defined as a CLAMINO24h of ≥130 mL/min/1.73 . Risk factors for ARC were identified using multivariate logistic regression.The final population model was fitted to 275 aminoglycoside serum concentrations. Overall clearance (L/h) was=CL0 × (TBW/70)0.75 × AGEH/(TMH + AGEH) + CL1 (0.5/SCr), where TBW is total , H is the Hill coefficient, TM is a maturation term and SCr is serum creatinine. Median CLAMINO24h in those with versus without ARC was 157.36 and 93.42 mL/min/1.73 , respectively (P < 0.001). ARC was identified in 19.5% of 118 patients. For patients with ARC, median baseline SCr was lower than for those without ARC (0.38 versus 0.41 mg/dL, P = 0.073). Risk factors for ARC included sepsis [adjusted OR (aOR) 3.77, 95% CI 1.01-14.07, P = 0.048], increasing age (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1-1.23, P = 0.04) and low log-transformed SCr (aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.52, P = 0.002). Median 24 h AUC (AUC24h) was significantly lower in patients with ARC at 45.27 versus 56.95 mg·h/L, P  < 0.01.ARC was observed in one of every five patients. Sepsis, increasing age and low SCr were associated with ARC. Increased clearance was associated with an attenuation of AUC24h in this population.

We investigated risk factors for death and prolonged mechanical ventilation (>7 days) and a threshold PA size for these outcomes.This retrospective 2-centre cohort study included 68 patients with complete repair between January 1996 and December 2015.Median age at repair was 3.9 months (1.3-8.7 months), and median  was 5 kg (4-7 kg). The mortality rate before hospital discharge was 12%, and the mortality rate at last follow-up was 19%. In multivariable analysis, risk factors for death were higher Nakata index [hazard ratio (HR) 1.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001-1.002; P < 0.001] and lower SpO2 (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09; P = 0.002). The accuracy of the Nakata index to predict death was excellent (area under the curve at 6 months: 0.92; P = 0.010). A Nakata index above 1500 mm2/ predicted mortality at 6 months with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 82%. Twenty-five patients (37%) had prolonged mechanical ventilation. The only multivariable risk factor for prolonged ventilation was lower  at repair (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.7; P = 0.008). Neither PA plasty nor the LeCompte manoeuvre had a protective effect on mortality or prolonged ventilation. A Nakata index above 1500 mm2/ remained a risk factor for mortality (P = 0.022) in patients who had a PA plasty or the LeCompte manoeuvre.In patients with absent pulmonary valve syndrome, the Nakata index predicts mortality with a cut-off of 1500 mm2/. Lower  at repair is the only multivariable risk factor for prolonged ventilation. Neither PA plasty nor the LeCompte manoeuvre had a protective effect on these outcomes.© The Author(s) 2019.

T2DM remission,  loss, postoperative nutrition status, and complications at 1- and 3-year follow-up were assessed. Remission of T2DM was defined as a fasting blood glucose <7 mmol/L and HbA1C <6.5% for 1 year without pharmacological intervention.At 1-year follow-up after LDJB-SG, the T2D remission rate was 75% (21/28), and the mean total  loss was 23.6%. The 3-year T2D remission rate and percent of total  loss were 68.4% (13/19) and 20.3%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that duration of T2D was the only risk factor associated with T2D remission (P < .05). LDJB-SG improved the metabolic syndrome by increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = .0157), decreasing waist circumference (P < .0001), and decreasing triglycerides (P = .0053). Postoperative complications of LDJB-SG included malodorous flatus (64.3%), accidental diarrhea induced by greasy food (57.1%), de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (28.6%), anemia (25%), fatigue (21.4%), underweight (17.9%), intolerance to cooked rice (10.7%), constipation (7.1%), and steatorrhea (3.6%).LDJB-SG resulted in acceptable T2D remission and metabolic improvement at 1- and 3-year follow-up in Chinese T2D patients with a BMI of 20 to 32.5 kg/m.

They determine their dietary choices, which are important from the point of view of human health. Unconventional diets are still considered as effective  loss methods. The use of alternative diets may cause shortages of an essential nutrients, increase the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases and lead to the formation of incorrect eating habits. Balanced diet, in contrast to the alternative diet, takes into account the principles of rational nutrition and nutritional recommendations of the Institute of Food and Nutrition (IŻŻ). The aim: To investigate the influence of popular dietary trends on nutrition of high school adolescences.Material and methods: Subjects were adolescences in the age of 17-21 years attending high schools in Ruda Slaska (262 students, including 157 women and 105 men). Self-constructed questionnaire was applied in the study. Participation in the study was anonymous and voluntary.Results: In more than a half of young women (54,8%) and men (52,4%) the  mass deficiency was revealed (BMI<18 kg/). 33,6% of the respondents were on the non-balanced diets at least once in their lives. High school students knew gluten-free and lactose-free products but dietary trends, such as the consumption of gluten-free and lactose-free products, did not affect their diet. The main source of nutritional knowledge among respondents were their friends (78,2%).Conclusions: The results of the conducted research indicate the need to implement educational programs on the principles of proper nutrition. The increasing awareness of the youth in this regard may contribute to reducing the interest in still popular alternative diets among young people and taking appropriate health behaviors by them.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444005>Donation approval among obese living kidney donor candidates: The impact of metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>The scarcity of organs available for transplantation has increased attempts to augment transplantation by utilizing obese living kidney donors. The literature has suggested that these donors have increased risks postdonation. Not surprising, the threshold for living kidney donor approval among obese persons is typically higher and the process more costly. Therefore, a screening tool to predict the likelihood of approval among obese living kidney donor candidates was created.A single-center retrospective study was performed among obese ( mass index ≥ 30 kg/) living kidney donor candidates evaluated in clinic (January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017). Approved candidates were compared with those not approved using multivariable logistic regression, and a prediction tool was generated.Among 389 obese living kidney donor candidates, there were no significant differences in sex or race and ethnicity by approval status. However, nonapproved candidates had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. In the prediction model, glucose impairment and hypertension were most predictive of nonapproval.Among obese living kidney donor candidates, several metabolic syndrome components were associated with decreased odds of approval. This tool may serve as a useful initial screening for obese living kidney donor candidates, permitting more cost-effective evaluation processes. The tool could also be used to promote expeditious interventions in the preclinical setting, including  management programs, to improve the likelihood of donation and postdonation outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we synthesized mesoporous Prussian blue (MPB) NPs with low molecular  hyaluronic acid (LMWHA) surface modification (LMWHA-MPB), and discovered that LMWHA-MPB could be used as an in situ macrophages converter and O generator.   results showed after uptake by  macrophages, LMWHA-MPB displayed the potential in remodeling tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) phenotype (pro-tumor →anti-tumor M1), and anti-metastatic effect on 4T1 cells. Furthermore,  visualized near-infrared (NIR) imaging data proved IR783 labeled LMWHA-MPB NPs could selectively accumulate in tumor sites. Then plenty of O generated to alleviate tumor hypoxia via catalytic decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (HO). Based on these outstanding characteristics, LMWHA-MPB NPs were adopted as multifunctional nanocarriers to load sonosensitizer hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) for O self-provided sonodynamic therapy (SDT).  anti-tumor results showed LMWHA-MPB/HMME could effectively inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of 4T1 tumors by improving tumor microenvironment.

Here, we report that machilin A (MA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding site of LDHA, suppresses growth of cancer cells and lactate production in various cancer cell types, including colon, breast, lung, and liver cancers. Furthermore, MA markedly decreased LDHA activity, lactate production, and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels induced by hypoxia-induced LDHA expression in cancer cells, and significantly inhibited colony formation, leading to reduced cancer cell survival. In mouse models inoculated with murine Lewis lung carcinoma, MA significantly suppressed tumor growth as observed by a reduction of tumor volume and ; resulting from the inhibition of LDHA activity. Subsequently, the suppression of tumor-derived lactic acid in MA-treated cancer cells resulted in decrease of neovascularization through the regulation of alternatively activated macrophages () polarization in macrophages. Taken together, we suggest that the reduction of lactate by MA in cancer cells directly results in a suppression of cancer cell growth. Furthermore, macrophage polarization and activation of endothelial cells for angiogenesis were indirectly regulated preventing lactate production in MA-treated cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505515>The Determinants of the Preferred Walking Speed in Individuals with Obesity.</a></h2><p>The preferred walking speed (PWS), also known as the "spontaneous" or "self-selected" walking speed, is the speed normally used during daily living activities and may represent an appropriate exercise intensity for  reduction programs aiming to enhance a more negative energy balance.The aim of this study was to examine, simultaneously, the energetics, mechanics, and perceived exertion determinants of PWS in individuals with obesity.Twenty-three adults with obesity (age 32.7 ± 6.8 years,  mass index 33.6 ± 2.6 kg/) were recruited. The participants performed 10 min of treadmill familiarization, and PWS was determined. Each subject performed six 5-min walking trials (PWS 0.56, 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, and 1.67 m/s). Gas exchanges were collected and analyzed to obtain the gross energy cost of walking (GCw), rated perceived exertion (RPE) was measured using a 6-20 Borg scale, and the external mechanical work (Wext) and the fraction of mechanical energy recovered by the pendular mechanism (Recovery) were computed using an instrumented treadmill. Second-order least-squares regression was used to calculate the optimal walking speed (OWS) of each variable.No significant difference was found between PWS (1.28 ± 0.13 m/s) and OWS for GCw (1.28 ± 0.10 m/s), RPE cost of walking (1.38 ± 0.14 m/s), and Recovery (1.48 ± 0.27 m/s; p > 0.06 for all), but the PWS was significantly faster than the OWS for Wext (0.98 ± 0.56 m/s; p < 0.02). Multiple regression (r = 0.72; p = 0.003) showed that ∼52% of the variance in PWS was explained by Recovery, Wext, and height.The main finding of this study was that obese adults may select their PWS in function of several competing demands, since this speed simultaneously minimizes pendular energy transduction, energy cost, and perceived exertion during walking. Moreover, recovery of mechanical work, external work, and height seem to be the major determinants of PWS in these individuals.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

With the aging of society, poor diet control, social, psychological and other risk factors in our country, the incidence of myocardial infarction and hypertension is reported to increase yearly. Many treatment methods have effectively delayed the occurrence of ventricular remodeling. However, in order to prevent and delay the occurrence and development of ventricular remodeling, the new treatment strategy cannot be ignored.In this study, we used male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old),  23 g-27 g, SPF grade. According to the established methods of the research group, the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery (LAD) was used to make the model of myocardial ischemia, and which was evaluated by the change of EF value in mice. The experiment included seven groups: sham operation group, model group, metoprolol group, puerarin group, tanshinone IIA group, tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 group, tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:2 group. The changes of cardiac function in each group were observed by echocardiography and hemodynamics after the drug delivery cycle was 3d, 7d, 14d and 28d. Detection of 3d serum enzyme indexes LDH, CK and CK-MB by automatic biochemical analyzer. The expression of CD11b, F4/80, Ly6C in cardiac tissues were detected by flow cytometry at 3d and 7d. The expression of IL-1β and TNF- α in serum were detected by ELISA. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, iNOS and other related genes were detected by RT-PCR method. HE, Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining were used to observe the changes of myocardial histomorphology in mice. We also examined the effects of different drug treatments on the proliferation and function of Raw264.7 cells, H9C2 cells and HUVECs. Western blot examined the effects of different drug treatments on the expression of inflammatory pathway related proteins TLR4 and C/EBP-β.1. Echocardiographic results showed that with the prolongation of ischemic time, the ejection fraction of the model group, the shortening rate of the short axis of the left ventricle, the flow rate of the outflow tract were significantly decreased, and the structure of the ventricle was significantly changed. Hemodynamic tests showed that the maximum and maximum rate of decline in the post-ischemia model group were significantly reduced, with increased systolic and diastolic volume, and a decrease in pressure difference. After treatment with drugs, all groups improved, but tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 group can significantly improve the above indicators after 28d of administration, which can effectively relieve the deterioration of cardiac function caused by acute myocardial infarction. 2. After administration for 3 and 7 days, the inflammatory cell CD11b monocytes and the F4/80 phenotype macrophages in heart tissue were detected by flow cytometry, and it was found that tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 can inhibit the release of inflammatory cells. The results of RT-PCR showed that the tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 group significantly improved the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and iNOS. In the immunohistochemical analysis of iNOS and Arg-1, the tanshinone IIA and puerarin 1:1 treatment group was able to inhibit the expression of M1 macrophages in the early stage of inflammation and promote the expression of  macrophages. 3. The cardiac index increased significantly and the serum TGF-β increased after 28d. The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin could significantly reduce these indexes. HE, Masson, Sirius red and immunohistochemical staining were found in the combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin can significantly reduce the structure of acute ischemic myocardial cell damage and interstitial edema, reduce collagen synthesis, and fibroblasts release, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and heart remodeling. 4. MTT assay showed a significantly greater proliferation of above two cells types treated with tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 and more nodes and meshes were found in tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 group compared with other groups. 5. The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin could regulate inflammation through inhibiting the expression of TLR4 protein, but up-regulating the expression of C/EBP-β protein.The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin inhibits the immersion of inflammatory cells. Improving hemodynamics by improving cardiac function, reducing the destruction of cardiac myocytes, reducing collagen synthesis, inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling. Through the whole experiment, tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 is the best.Copyright © 2019.

This nonrandomized, therapeutic, open, single-arm study investigated the effects of progressive resistance training (PRT) on obesity indices in women with PCOS, and the relationship between obesity indices and telomere content.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 52 with non-PCOS (controls), aged 18 to 37 years, with  mass indexes of 18 to 39.9 kg/, performed three 1-hour sessions of PRT per week, for 16 weeks. Before and after PRT,  included anthropometric indices and regions of interest of fat mass distribution, quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, metabolic and hormonal parameters, and telomere content. The general linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of PRT.PRT did reduce the waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and the index of conicity among PCOS (P < .01). However, PRT did not influence regions of interest,  mass index, and WHR. After PRT, the telomere content was associated with regions of interest and anthropometric indices in whole group independent of PCOS (P < .05).Resistance exercise improves obesity indices in PCOS, independent of changes in , and the relationship between telomeres and obesity parameters in PCOS remain to be fully clarified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237934>Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and timing of puberty in sons and daughters: a population-based cohort study.</a></h2><p>In many countries, an increased prevalence of obesity in pregnancy has coincided with a declining pubertal age. We aimed to explore the potential effect of maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity on timing of puberty in sons and daughters.Between 2012 and 2018, 15 819 of 22 439 invited children from the Danish National Birth Cohort, born 2000-03, provided half-yearly information from the age of 11 years on the pubertal milestones: Tanner stages, voice break, first ejaculation, menarche, acne and axillary hair. We estimated adjusted mean monthly differences (with 95% confidence intervals) in age at attaining the pubertal milestones for children exposed to maternal pre-pregnancy obesity [ mass index (BMI) ≥30.0 kg/] or overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/) with normal  (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/) as reference. In mediation analysis, we explored whether childhood BMI at age 7 years mediated the associations.Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with earlier age at attaining most pubertal milestones in sons, and pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with earlier age at attaining all pubertal milestones in daughters. When combining all pubertal milestones, pre-pregnancy obesity [sons: -1.5 (-2.5, -0.4) months; daughters: -3.2 (-4.2, -2.1) months] and overweight [daughters only: -2.6 (-3.3, -1.8) months] were associated with earlier timing of puberty. The associations in sons were completely mediated by higher childhood BMI and partly so in daughters.Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity appears to lower timing of puberty through childhood obesity in sons and mainly through other mechanisms in daughters.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the harm of antibiotics can't be ignored. The effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) supplementation to basal diet instead of antibiotics (CSP, Chlortetracycline, sulphonamide dimethazine and procaine penicillin, 1:1:1) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and blood profile in growing pigs were studied. A total of 140 growing pigs (Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) with an average  of 27.84 ± 0.42 kg were allotted to four treatments of seven replicates/treatment and five pigs/replicate. The four experimental diets included: CON (basal diet, non-antibiotic, negative control); CSP (CON + CSP 0.1%, positive control); M1 (CON + MCFA 0.15%) and  (CON + MCFA 0.3%). After 5 weeks, the fresh faecal and blood samples were collected from rectum and jugular vein respectively. The average daily gain (ADG) was significantly improved for pigs fed 0.3% MCFAs in relation to basal diet. Meanwhile, CSP supplementation had comparable effect on ADG. The lymphocyte percentage and IgG concentration were higher in blood of pigs-fed MCFAs in relation to that of CON and CSP treatment while white blood cell and red blood cell were not affected. In relation to basal diet and CSP treatment, the digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and gross energy (E) were unaffected with MCFAs supplementation. In conclusion, MCFAs improved growth performance on  gain and immune profile.

Recently, we have shown that n-butylidenephthalide (BP) improves human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC) engraftment via attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This prompted us to investigate whether remote transplantation of BP-pretreated hADSCs confers attenuated LVH at an established phase of hypertension. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) aged 12 weeks were randomly allocated to receive right hamstring injection of vehicle, clinical-grade hADSCs, and BP-preconditioned hADSCs for 8 weeks. As compared with untreated SHRs, naïve hADSCs decreased the ratio of LV  to tibia, cardiomyocyte cell size, and collagen deposition independent of hemodynamic changes. These changes were accompanied by attenuated myocardial ROS production and increased p-STAT3 levels. Compared with naïve hADSCs, BP-preconditioned hADSCs provided a further decrease of ROS and LVH and an increase of local hADSC engraftment, STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 activity, STAT3 nuclear translocation, myocardial IL-10 levels, and the percentage of  macrophage infiltration. SIN-1 or S3I-201 reversed the effects of BP-preconditioned ADSCs increase on myocardial IL-10 levels. Furthermore, SIN-1 abolished the phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas superoxide levels were not affected following the inhibition of STAT3. Our results highlighted the feasibility of remote transplantation of hADSCs can be considered as an alternative procedure to reverse cardiac hypertrophy even at an established phase of hypertension. BP-pretreated hADSCs polarize macrophages into  immunoregulatory cells more efficiently than naïve hADSCs via ROS/STAT3 pathway.Copyright © 2019.

During the development of heart failure, adaptive intracellular metabolic processes that evolve prior to macro-anatomic remodelling, could provide an early signal of impending failure. We hypothesized that metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized magnetic resonance would detect the early development of heart failure before conventional echocardiography could reveal cardiac dysfunction.Five 8.5 kg piglets were subjected to pulmonary banding and subsequently examined by [1-13C]pyruvate hyperpolarization, conventional magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and blood testing, every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. They were compared with a  matched, healthy control group. Conductance catheter examination at the end of the study showed impaired right ventricular systolic function along with compromised left ventricular diastolic function. After 16 weeks, we saw a significant decrease in the conversion ratio of pyruvate/bicarbonate in the left ventricle from 0.13 (0.04) in controls to 0.07 (0.02) in animals with pulmonary banding, along with a significant increase in the lactate/bicarbonate ratio to 3.47 (1.57) compared with 1.34 (0.81) in controls. N-terminal pro-hormone of brain natriuretic peptide was increased by more than 300%, while cardiac index was reduced to 2.8 (0.95) L/min/ compared with 3.9 (0.95) in controls. Echocardiography revealed no changes.Hyperpolarization detected a shift towards anaerobic metabolism in early stages of right ventricular dysfunction, as evident by an increased lactate/bicarbonate ratio. Dysfunction was confirmed with conductance catheter assessment, but could not be detected by echocardiography.

Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had WC,  and height measurements at both time-points; those with a self-reported history of CVD or cancer,  mass index < 18.5 kg/ or missing data on covariates were excluded, leaving 12,337 participants for analyses. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 16.4 (15.7, 17.2) years. Hazard Ratios (HRs) for all-cause (2866 deaths) and CVD mortality (822 deaths), by categories of WC change, were determined using Cox proportional hazards analyses.After multivariable adjustment, the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality for men and women with a WC gain (WCG) >  5 cm were 1.51 (1.29-1.75) and 1.25 (1.06-1.46) respectively. For CVD mortality in men and women with a WCG >  5 cm, the HRs were 1.84 (1.39-2.43) and 1.15 (0.85-1.55) respectively.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they conducted any bridging intervention for  loss in patients with BMI greater than 50 kg/m prior to bariatric surgery. Primary outcome was the change in BMI before and after bridging intervention. Secondary outcomes included comorbidity status after bridging interventions and resulting complications. Pooled mean differences (MD) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis.13 studies including 550 patients met inclusion criteria (mean baseline BMI of 61.26 kg/m).

Obesity-associated chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is considered a focal point and a therapeutic target in insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. We evaluate the effect of  (PF) on insulin resistance and its mechanism based on inflammatory responses in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and then administered PF. , epididymal fat and liver , glucose, lipid, insulin, and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the effect of PF on insulin resistance by analyzing the proportion of macrophages in epididymal fat and liver and measured inflammatory gene expression. PF administration significantly decreased the fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, total-cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The epididymal fat tissue and liver showed a significant decrease of fat accumulation in histological analysis. PF significantly reduced the number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), F4/80 Kupffer cells, and CD68 Kupffer cells, increased the proportion of  phenotype macrophages, and decreased the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that PF could be used to improve insulin resistance through modulation of macrophage-mediated inflammation and enhance glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186834>Differential Activation of Fetal Hofbauer Cells in Primigravidas Is Associated with Decreased Birth  in Symptomatic Placental Malaria.</a></h2><p>Placental malaria is a leading global cause of low birth  neonates, especially in first-time mothers.

Although certain cytokines like interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are capable of inducing  macrophage polarization, their therapeutic potential in vivo is suffering from low efficacy due to their instability and poor access to target cells. Here, we report the synthesis of IL-4-loaded hyaluronic acid (HA) particle for the targeted delivery of cytokines through the high affinity of HA to CD44 receptors of macrophages. HA carriers composed of low, middle, and high molecular  (MW) polymers were synthesized using divinyl sulfone (DVS) cross-linking. The MW of HA had a negligible effect on the physicochemical properties and biocompatibility of the macrophages, but as an indicative of  polarization, a significant change in the arginase-1 (Arg-1) activity, TNF-α release, and IL-10 secretion was observed for the HA particles prepared with high MW polymers. Therefore, these particles were loaded with IL-4 for simultaneous macrophage targeting and M1 to  reprogramming, evidenced by a remarkable increase in the Arg-1 to iNOS ratio, as well as CD163 and CD206 upregulation in the M1 macrophages, which were initially triggered by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580732>Evaluation of the Efficacy of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) in Comparison to Warfarin in Morbidly Obese Patients.</a></h2><p>Purpose There is limited clinical data evaluating anticoagulation with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in morbidly obese patients. We sought to examine the efficacy and safety of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, in comparison to warfarin in patients with either a -mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/ and/or a  over 120 kg. Methods After approval from IRB, we collected retrospective data from our institution's records on 180 patients. We analyzed the rates of ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction (MI), and major bleeding in morbidly obese patients receiving apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban in comparison to warfarin for anticoagulation due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, postoperative thrombus prophylaxis, or DVT/PE treatment and/or reduction in risk for recurrence. Results The final analysis included 90 patients in both arms. Fifty-two percent (n=41) of patients in the DOAC group were on apixaban therapy, 12% (n=11) on dabigatran, and 37% (n=33) on rivaroxaban. The average BMI and  in the DOAC group were 46.7 kg/ and 139.3 kg, respectively. In the warfarin group, average BMI and  were 45.8 kg/ and 135.9 kg, respectively. There were 11 patients who developed a cardiovascular or thromboembolic event in the DOAC group and 10 in the warfarin group (OR: 1.11, 95% CI 0.45-2.78; p=0.82). The events in the DOAC group consisted of three patients who developed ischemic stroke, three patients who developed DVTs, one who developed a PE, and four patients who developed MIs. There were two major bleeding events in the DOAC group and three events in the warfarin group (p=0.65).

This research aimed to measure the cardiovascular risk management and cardiovascular risk factor outcomes of the health check programme during six years' follow-up.A controlled interrupted time series study was conducted. Participants were registered with general practices in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in England and received health checks between 1 April 2010 and 31 December 2013. Control participants, who did not receive a health check, were matched for age, sex, and general practice.

Analyses estimated the net effect of health check by year, allowing for the underlying trend in risk factor values and baseline differences between cases and controls, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, and clustering by general practice. There were 127,891 health check participants and 322,910 matched controls. Compared with controls, health check participants had lower BMI (cases mean 27.0, SD 4.8; controls 27.3, SD 5.6, Kg/), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (cases 129.0, SD 14.3; controls 129.3, SD 15.0, mm Hg), and smoking (21% in health check participants versus 27% in controls), but total and HDL cholesterol were similar. Health check participants were more likely to receive  management advice (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.03, 4.98 to 5.08, P < 0.001), smoking cessation interventions (HR 3.20, 3.13 to 3.27, P < 0.001), or statins (HR 1.24, 1.21 to 1.27, P < 0.001). There were net reductions in risk factor values up to six years after the check for BMI (-0.30, -0.39 to -0.20 Kg/, P < 0.001), SBP (-1.43, -1.70 to -1.16 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and smoking (17% in health check participants versus 25% in controls; odds ratio 0.90, 0.87 to 0.94, P < 0.001). The main study limitation was that residual confounding may be present because randomisation was not employed; health check-associated measurement introduced differential recording that might cause bias.Our results suggest that people who take up a health check generally have lower risk factor values than controls and are more likely to receive risk factor interventions. Risk factor values show net reductions up to six years following a health check in BMI, blood pressure, and smoking, which may be of public health importance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162597>Glucose- and Lipid-Related Biomarkers Are Affected in Healthy Obese or Hyperglycemic Adults Consuming a Whole-Grain Pasta Enriched in Prebiotics and Probiotics: A 12-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Synbiotic foods, which combine the action of prebiotics and probiotics along the gastrointestinal tract, can affect inflammatory and glucose-related markers.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on inflammatory and glycemia-related markers of a whole-grain pasta containing barley β-glucans and Bacillus coagulans BC30, 6086 in healthy overweight or obese volunteers.A single-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary intervention study was carried out. Forty-one healthy sedentary overweight ( mass index [BMI] 25-29.9 kg/) and obese (BMI ≥30) volunteers, aged 30-65 y and low consumers of fruit and vegetables, ate 1 serving/d of whole-grain control (CTR) or innovative (INN) pasta for 12 wk and maintained their habitual diets. Biological samples were collected at baseline and every 4 wk for primary (plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and fasting plasma lipid profile) and secondary outcomes (glycemia-related markers, blood pressure, fecal microbiota composition, and ). Between (CTR compared with INN) and within (among weeks) group differences were tested for the whole population and for subgroups stratified by baseline values of BMI (≥30) and glycemia (≥100 mg/dL).INN or CTR pasta consumption had no effect on primary and secondary outcomes over time, except for a significant increase in plasma γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) after 12 wk of CTR pasta consumption. Comparisons between intervention groups revealed differences only at 12 wk: plasma GGT was higher in the CTR group; plasma hs-CRP, plasma LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, and Bifidobacterium spp. were lower in the INN subgroup of obese volunteers; plasma resistin was lower and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance was higher in the INN subgroup of hyperglycemic volunteers.A daily serving of a synbiotic whole-grain pasta had limited effects on primary and secondary outcomes in the entire group of volunteers but affected glycemia- and lipid-related markers and resistin in a subgroup of healthy obese or hyperglycemic volunteers.

According to the most recent data available, the estimated lifetime prevalence of BED among US adults in the general population is 0.85% (men 0.42% and women 1.25%). Among psychiatric treatment populations, prevalence is several-fold higher. Although many people with BED are obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/), roughly half are not. In the DSM-5, BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time, an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. BED often goes unrecognized and thus untreated; in one study, 344 of 22,387 (1.5%) survey respondents met DSM-5 criteria for BED, but only 11 out of the 344 had ever been diagnosed with BED by a health-care provider. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with most adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders, suggesting that clinicians have patients in their practice with unrecognized BED. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been suggested for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews; however, access to such treatments may be limited because of local availability and/or cost, and these treatments generally lead to little to no  loss, although successfully eliminating binge eating can protect against future  gain. Routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED, but there are approved and emerging medication options, lisdexamfetamine and dasotraline, respectively, that specifically address the core drivers behind binge eating, namely obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors regarding food, resulting in marked decreases in binge eating behaviors as well as  loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321562>Whole-Genome Sequencing Identifies a Rice Grain Shape Mutant, gs9-1.</a></h2><p>Breeding for genes controlling key agronomic traits is an important goal of rice genetic improvement. To gain insight into genes controlling grain morphology, we screened M plants derived from 1,000 whole-genome sequenced (WGS) M Kitaake mutants to identify lines with altered grain size.In this study, we isolated a mutant, named fast-neutron (FN) 60-4, which exhibits a significant reduction in grain size. We crossed FN60-4 with the parental line Kitaake and analyzed the resulting backcross population. Segregation analysis of 113 lines from the BCF population revealed that the mutant phenotype is controlled by a single semi-dominant locus. Mutant FN60-4 is reduced 20% in plant height and 8.8% in 1000-grain  compared with Kitaake. FN60-4 also exhibits an 8% reduction in cell number and a 9% reduction in cell length along the vertical axis of the glume. We carried out whole-genome sequencing of DNA pools extracted from segregants with long grains or short grains, and revealed that one gene, LOC_Os09g02650, cosegregated with the grain size phenotype in the BCF and BCF populations. This mutant allele was named grain shape 9-1 (gs9-1). gs9-1 carries a 3-bp deletion that affects two amino acids. This locus is a new allele of the BC12/GDD1/MTD1 gene that encodes a kinesin-like protein involved in cell-cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis. The GA biosynthesis-related gene KO2 is down-regulated in gs9-1. The dwarf phenotype of gs9-1 can be rescued by adding exogenous GA. In contrast to the phenotypes for the other alleles, the gs9-1 is less severe, consistent with the nature of the mutation, which does not disrupt the open reading frame as observed for the other alleles.In this study, we isolated a mutant, which exhibits altered grain shape and identified the mutated gene, gs9-1. Our study reveals that gs9-1 is a semi-dominant gene that carries a two-amino acid mutation. gs9-1 is allelic to the BC12/GDD1/MTD1 gene involved in GA biosynthesis. These results demonstrate the efficiency and convenience of cloning genes from the whole-genome sequenced Kitaake mutant population to advance investigations into genes controlling key agronomic traits in rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598593>Comparison of Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy and Traditional Physiotherapy in Rotator Cuff Calcific Tendinitis Treatment.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the efficacy of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) in relieving pain and improving range of motion (ROM) and functionality besides conventional physiotherapy methods in the treatment of chronic rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (RCCT).We studied 80 patients (35 males, 45 females; mean age 53.3±9.6 years; range, 40 to 70 years) with chronic RCCT. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: rESWT group (n=40) treated with conventional physiotherapy and rESWT, and control group (n=40) treated only with a conventional physiotherapy program. The traditional physiotherapy program included ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, shoulder joint ROM and stretching exercises, and ice applications. All patients received a total of 20 treatments, five days a week for four weeks. rESWT was applied once a week for four weeks in total. Before and after treatment, all patients were evaluated for age, height, ,  Mass Index (BMI), pain intensity with a Visual Analog Scale, shoulder ROM, and functional disability status with the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH).Mean BMI value of the participants was 26.1±3.0 kg/. Although all parameters of the patients in both groups improved significantly, patients in the rESWT group had a statistically significant improvement in pain, ROM and QuickDash scores (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively).We assume that rESWT is an effective and noninvasive method of reducing pain and increasing ROM and functional status without the need for surgery.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610207>β-Caryophyllene protects against ischemic stroke by promoting polarization of microglia toward  phenotype via the TLR4 pathway.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to determine whether β-caryophyllene (BCP) exerts a neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by inhibiting microglial activation and modulating their polarization via the TLR4 pathway.Wild-type (WT) and TLR4 knockout (KO) C57BL/6J mice were subjected to cerebral I/R injury and neurologic dysfunction, cerebral infarct volume, brain edema, microglia activation and polarization, and TLR4 expression were determined. In vitro, primary microglia were stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ or IL-4 to induce polarization of microglia toward M1 or  phenotypes.BCP reduced cerebral infarct volume, brain edema, and neurologic deficits in WT mice after I/R. The optimal dose of BCP, 72 mg/kg , inhibited microglial activation and reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 by microglia of WT mice. BCP inhibited the level of TLR4 in WT mice, and partially reduced neurologic deficits, infarct volume, and brain edema in TLR4 KO mice. Importantly, BCP reduced the number of activated M1-type microglia and increased the number of -type microglia in the ipsilateral cortex of both WT and TLR4 KO mice. In vitro, BCP decreased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS plus IFN-γ, downregulated the level of TLR4 protein, and polarized microglia towards the  phenotype.The decrease in TLR4 activity mediated, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory effects of BCP and its ability to shift microglia polarization from the M1 to  phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study examined secular trends in obesity prevalence by socioeconomic position and the resulting obesity inequalities in the German adult population.Data were drawn from three national examination surveys conducted in 1990-1992, 1997-1999 and 2008-2011 (n = 18,541; age range: 25-69 years). Obesity was defined by a  mass index ≥30 kg/ using standardised measurements of  height and . Education and equivalised household disposable income were used as indicators of socioeconomic position. Time trends in socioeconomic inequalities in obesity were examined using linear probability and log-binomial regression models.In each survey period, the highest socioeconomic groups had the lowest prevalence of obesity. The low and medium socioeconomic groups showed increases in obesity prevalence, whereas no such trend was observed in the high socioeconomic groups. Absolute inequalities in obesity by income increased by an average of 0.53 percentage points per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-1.05, p = 0.047) among men and 0.47 percentage points per year (95% CI 0.05-0.90, p = 0.029) among women. Absolute inequalities in obesity by education increased on average by 0.64 percentage points per year (95% CI 0.19-1.08, p = 0.005) among women but not among men (0.33 percentage points, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.92, p = 0.283).These findings suggest a widening obesity gap between the top and the bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. This has the potential to have adverse consequences for population health and health inequalities in coming decades.

The primary endpoint was all-cause death at 5 years. Secondary endpoints were cardiac and non-cardiac death, target (TLR) and non-target lesion revascularization (NTLR), myocardial infarction (MI), and definite/probable stent thrombosis. Despite adjustment for multiple confounders, overweight and Class I obesity were associated with lower all-cause mortality vs normal  (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.71-0.96 and HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.69-0.96 respectively); however, non-cardiac death was the major contributor to this effect (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94 for overweight). Conversely, cardiac mortality was higher in severely obese individuals (HR 1.62; 95%CI 1.05-2.51 for Class III obesity). Obesity was associated with higher rates of NTLR (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.04-1.58 for Class II obesity) but not with TLR, MI and stent thrombosis.Moderately increased BMI is associated with improved survival post-PCI, mostly due to lower non-cardiac but not cardiac mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640791>Effects of eating with an augmented fork with vibrotactile feedback on eating rate and : a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Eating rate is a basic determinant of appetite regulation: people who eat more slowly feel sated earlier and eat less. A high eating rate contributes to overeating and potentially to  gain. Previous studies showed that an augmented fork that delivers real-time feedback on eating rate is a potentially effective intervention to decrease eating rate in naturalistic settings. This study assessed the impact of using the augmented fork during a 15-week period on eating rate and .In a parallel randomized controlled trial, 141 participants with overweight (age: 49.2 ± 12.3 y; BMI: 31.5 ± 4.48 kg/) were randomized to intervention groups (VFC, n = 51 or VFC+, n = 44) or control group (NFC, n = 46). First, we measured bite rate and success ratio on five consecutive days with the augmented fork without feedback (T1). The intervention groups (VFC, VFC+) then used the same fork, but now received vibrotactile feedback when they ate more than one bite per 10 s. Participants in VFC+ had additional access to a web portal with visual feedback. In the control group (NFC), participants ate with the fork without either feedback. The intervention period lasted four weeks, followed by a week of measurements only (T2) and another measurement week after eight weeks (T3).  was assessed at T1, T2, and T3.Participants in VFC and VFC+ had a lower bite rate (p < .01) and higher success ratio (p < .0001) than those in NFC at T2. This effect persisted at T3. In both intervention groups participants lost more  than those in the control group at T2 (p < .02), with no rebound at T3.The findings of this study indicate that an augmented fork with vibrotactile feedback is a viable tool to reduce eating rate in naturalistic settings.

We previously reported that in adolescent girls at-risk for T2D with moderately elevated depression, randomization to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) produced greater decreases in depression at post-treament and greater decreases in fasting/2-h insulin at 1 year, compared to health education (HE). The current study is a secondary analysis of this parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We examined whether decreasing depression explained intervention effects on  composition and insulin outcomes. We hypothesized that decreases in depression would be an explanatory mediator and that indirect effects would be strongest at higher levels of baseline depression.Participants were 12-17 years girls with overweight/obesity and family history of T2D randomized to 6-week group CBT (n = 58) or HE (n = 61). Procedures took place at an outpatient pediatric clinic. At baseline, post-treatment, and 1 year, adolescents completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale to assess depression symptoms;  mass index (BMI [kg/]) was measured from height/fasting ; insulin resistance was derived from 2-h oral glucose testing. Adiposity was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 1 year. Indirect effects of intervention were tested on 1-year changes in BMI, adiposity, and insulin through decreases in depression. Baseline depression was tested as a moderator of mediation.There was an indirect effect of CBT on decreased 1-year fasting insulin via decreases in depression during treatment, among adolescents with more elevated baseline depression.Decreasing elevated depression may be one mechanism in the targeted prevention of T2D in at-risk adolescents.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology 2019.

We retrospectively analyzed how BMI trajectories during the transition to adulthood were associated with a measure of pain interference obtained at age 29 in a longitudinal birth cohort study.Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort (follow-up from 1997 to 2015), were used to determine BMI trajectories from age 14 to 29 via group trajectory modeling. At age 29, respondents described whether pain interfered with their work inside and outside the home over the past four weeks (not at all, a little, or a lot). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate pain interference according to BMI trajectory and study covariates.Among 7,875 respondents, 11% reported "a little" and 4% reported "a lot" of pain interference at age 29. Four BMI trajectory groups were identified, varying in starting BMI and rate of  gain. The "obese" group (8% of respondents) had a starting BMI of 30 kg/ and gained an average of 0.7 kg//y. On multivariable analysis, this group was the most likely to have greater pain interference, compared with "high normal " (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14-1.88), "low normal " (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.13-1.87), and "overweight" trajectories (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.73).Obesity and rapid  gain during the transition to adulthood were associated with higher risk of pain interference among young adults.© 2019 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

Phenotyping of activated and regulatory B cells, T lymphocytes and macrophages was performed by flow cytometry on isolated spleen and peritoneal cells. Cytokines were assayed by ELISA.Btk inhibitor Ibrutinib prevented lesion growth, reduced mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase-2, alpha smooth muscle actin and type I collagen in the lesions and skewed activated B cells toward Bregs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity of mice with endometriosis. In addition, the number of  macrophages decreased in the peritoneal cavity of Ibrutinib-treated mice compared to anti-CD20 and control mice. Depletion of B cells using an anti-CD20 antibody had no effect on activity and growth of endometriotic lesions and neither on the macrophages, compared to control mice.N/A.It is still unclear whether B cell depletion by the anti-CD20 or inactivation by Ibrutinib can prevent establishment and/or progression of endometriosis in humans.Further investigation may contribute to clarifying the role of B cell subsets in human endometriosis.This research was supported by a grant of Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale and Paris Descartes University.

Metabolite profiling offers an opportunity to systematically discover new predictors for  gain that are relatively easy to measure compared to traditional approaches.Using baseline metabolite profiling data of middle-aged individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS; n = 1,508), we identified 42 metabolites associated (p < 0.05) with longitudinal change in  mass index (BMI). We performed stepwise linear regression to select 8 of these metabolites to build a metabolite risk score (MRS) for predicting future  gain. We replicated the MRS using data from the Mexico City Diabetes Study (MCDS; n = 768), in which one standard deviation increase in the MRS corresponded to ~0.03 increase in BMI (kg/) per year (i.e. ~0.09 kg/year for a 1.7 m adult). We observed that none of the available anthropometric, lifestyle, and glycemic variables fully account for the MRS prediction of  gain. Surprisingly, we found the MRS to be strongly correlated with baseline insulin sensitivity in both cohorts and to be negatively predictive of T2D in MCDS. Genome-wide association study of the MRS identified 2 genome-wide (p < 5 × 10-8) and 5 suggestively (p < 1 × 10-6) significant loci, several of which have been previously linked to obesity-related phenotypes.We have constructed and validated a generalizable MRS for future  gain that is an independent predictor distinct from several other known risk factors. The MRS captures a composite biological picture of  gain, perhaps hinting at the anabolic effects of preserved insulin sensitivity.

The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX), considered the gold standard test for this evaluation, is costly and difficult to be accessed by the general population. In order to make this evaluation more accessible, and to better reflect the performance of daily life activities, alternative tests were proposed. Morbidly obese patients present limitations that impair physical performance assessment and could benefit from a test of shorter duration, provided it is validated. This observational study aimed to validate the two-minute step test (2MST) as a tool to evaluate functional capacity (FC) in obese with comorbidities and morbidly obese patients, compared the 2MST with CPX as a measure of physical performance, and developed a predictive equation to estimate peak oxygen uptake (VO2) in the 2MST. The CPX and the 2MST were performed and metabolic and ventilatory parameters were recorded in 31 obese individuals (BMI>35 kg/). Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the peak VO2 best predictors. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to assess the agreement between the two methods. Peak VO2 measured by CPX and 2MST showed a strong correlation (r=0.70, P<0.001) and there was a moderate correlation between peak VO2 of the 2MST and the number of up-and-down step cycles (UDS) (r=0.55; P=0.01). The reference equation obtained was: VO2 (mL·kg-1·min-1) = 13.341 + 0.138 × total UDS - (0.183 × BMI), with an estimated standard error of 1.3 mL·kg-1·min-1. The 2MST is a viable, practical, and easily accessible test for FC.

Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces  and adipose tissue  in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The trial period lasted for 14 D with 21 ± 1°C and 60 ± 7% relative humidity, wind speed < 0.5 m/s, ammonia level<5 ppm. The results indicated that average daily food intake and average daily gain in HSD group showed significantly lower than other 2 groups (P < 0.05). Besides, the HSD group significantly reduced breast muscle yield, tibial length, tibial width, and tibial  of broilers (P < 0.05). The HSD group increased the mRNA expression level of myostatin, and reduced the mRNA expression levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and myogenic determination factor 1 (P < 0.05). The HSD group significantly reduced the expression of parathyroid hormone-related protein in tibial growth plate (P < 0.05). The HSD group increased the serum corticosterone levels of broilers (P < 0.05), and decreased the serum IGF-1 and thyroxine (T4) levels of broiler chickens (P < 0.05) than other stocking density groups. Moreover, the serum alkaline phosphatase levels were decreased (P < 0.05) with increasing stocking density, whereas there were no significant effects on the serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in 3 groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, under appropriate environments HSD reduced the growth performance of broilers and this negative effect was likely associated with decreased growth of muscle and bone.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494654>Effects of  Loss on Sweet Taste Preference and Palatability following Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Women with Obesity.</a></h2><p>Current evidence suggests that obesity is associated with alteration of sweet taste perception. The purpose of this study was to determine if nonsurgical cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based  loss can cause a change in sweet taste perception.This case-control study consisted of 51 women aged 21-64 years. Twenty-seven with obesity or overweight were assigned to an obesity (OB) group (BMI: 29.8 ± 0.5 kg/) and 24 to a normal control (NC) group (BMI: 20.9 ± 0.3 kg/). The OB group underwent a 30-week  loss intervention using CBT-based group therapy. The results of measurement of detection threshold, suprathreshold perceived intensity, preference, and palatability, elements of sweet taste perception, were compared before and after the intervention. Psychological variables and appetite-related hormonal levels were measured.Twenty-three patients and 22 controls completed the study. The OB group showed a 14.6%  loss after the intervention. At baseline, the OB group preferred significantly higher sucrose concentrations than did the NC group; however, this difference was no longer significant after intervention. In the OB group, persistent pleasure and reduced desire for other taste, measured by repeated exposure to sweetness, normalized after  loss to levels comparable to those seen in the NC group. No significant difference in discriminative perception of the threshold concentration or the suprathreshold sensory value was found between the two groups before or after intervention. A significant correlation was found between the basal preferred sucrose concentration and the serum leptin level of the OB group after adjusting for confounding factors, such as BMI, depressive symptom score, and trait-anxiety scores. loss induced by CBT-based nonsurgical intervention resulted in the normalization of the sucrose preference and palatability of women with obesity. Leptin activity may be associated with the altered sweet taste preference of people with obesity.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term effect of anthracycline chemotherapy on the biventricular function in childhood cancer survivors using tissue Doppler imaging and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography.The study included 45 survivors of childhood cancers and 50 healthy age-matched control patients. Cardiac function was prospectively studied with conventional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, and speckle tracking echocardiography after completion of treatment. The same analysis was performed on matched controls.There was no difference in age, gender, height, and  between the study and control groups. The mean anthracycline dose was 240 ± 106 mg/ and the mean remission duration was 8.2 ± 5 years (1-20 years) in the study group. Conventional echocardiography showed similar ejection fraction, shortening fraction, and left ventricle end-diastolic diameter in both groups. Mitral lateral and septal tissue Doppler imaging showed normal but according to control group relatively sub-normal systolic and diastolic function in patient group. The global longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain rates were significantly lower in the patient group compared to control group. Correlation analysis revealed a negative and significant correlation between total anthracycline dose and global longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain rates.Sub-clinical systolic and diastolic dysfunction may not be detected by conventional echocardiographic methods which are frequently used in daily practice. Sub-clinical systolic and diastolic dysfunction may be detected more sensitively by echocardiographic method such as speckle tracking echocardiography in childhood cancer survivors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260613>What Is the Effect of  Mass Index on Subjective Outcome Following Vaginal Hysterectomy for Prolapse?</a></h2><p>Obesity is a significant risk factor for pelvic organ prolapse (POP), but the effects of obesity on outcomes of surgery for POP are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between POP symptomatology, subjective outcomes of surgery and  mass index (BMI) in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for POP.Pre- and postoperative data from a validated pelvic floor questionnaire (electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire-Pelvic Floor) were collected prospectively from 60 women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for POP. Of these, 20 were normal  (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/), 20 were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/), and 20 were women with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/). The relationship between BMI and symptom scores for prolapse, impact on vaginal symptoms on quality of life (VS-QoL) and 'overall change in condition' was assessed. Pre- and postoperative symptom scores were compared using repeated mixed analysis of variance test for BMI as a categorical variable (normal, overweight, and obese). Spearman rank order correlation test was carried out to evaluate BMI as a continuous variable. All women underwent vaginal hysterectomy using a standardized technique.Overall, 93% of women reported improvement in their condition. The main finding was that 'overall change in condition' was negatively correlated with increasing BMI (rs=-0.324, P=0.028). Irrespective of BMI, significant improvements were observed in symptoms of prolapse and VS-QoL at 3-month postoperation.With increasing BMI, women are likely to report lower levels of satisfaction following prolapse surgery, despite reporting equivalent improvements in symptoms. BMI is known to affect how individuals perceive their general health and well-being with obese individuals reporting poorer levels of subjective health status. Women with obesity may perceive change in their condition after prolapse surgery differently to women of normal . Reduction of  prior to prolapse surgery could be considered in obese women to improve subjective outcomes of surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277386>Patterns of Diet, Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep Are Associated with Socio-Demographic, Behavioural, and Health-Risk Indicators in Adults.</a></h2><p>Our understanding of how multiple health-behaviours co-occur is in its infancy. This study aimed to: (1) identify patterns of physical activity, diet, sitting, and sleep; and (2) examine the association between sociodemographic and health-risk indicators. Pooled data from annual cross-sectional telephone surveys of Australian adults (2015-2017, n = 3374, 51.4% women) were used. Participants self-reported physical activity, diet, sitting-time, sleep/rest insufficiency, sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol use, height and  to calculate  mass index (BMI), and mental distress frequency. Latent class analysis identified health-behaviour classes. Latent class regression determined the associations between health-behaviour patterns, sociodemographic, and health-risk indicators. Three latent classes were identified. Relative to a 'moderate lifestyle' pattern (men: 43.2%, women: 38.1%), a 'poor lifestyle' pattern (men: 19.9%, women: 30.5%) was associated with increased odds of a younger age, smoking, BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/, frequent mental distress (men and women), non-partnered status (men only), a lower Socioeconomic Index for Areas centile, primary/secondary education only, and BMI = 25.0-29.9 kg/m (women only). An 'active poor sleeper' pattern (men: 37.0%, women: 31.4%) was associated with increased odds of a younger age (men and women), working and frequent mental distress (women only), relative to a 'moderate lifestyle' pattern.

Also, little is known about the comparative efficacy of  loss interventions that use SMS coupled with brief, technology-mediated contact with health coaches, an important issue when considering the scalability and cost of interventions. We examined the efficacy of a 1-year intervention designed to reduce  among overweight and obese English- and Spanish-speaking adults via SMS alone (ConTxt) or in combination with brief, monthly health-coaching calls. ConTxt offered 2-4 SMS/day that were personalized, tailored, and interactive. Content was theory- and evidence-based and focused on reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. Monthly health-coaching calls (5-10 minutes' duration) focused on goal-setting, identifying barriers to achieving goals, and self-monitoring.English- and Spanish-speaking adults were recruited from October 2011 to March 2013. A total of 298 overweight ( mass index [BMI] 27.0 to 39.9 kg/) adults (aged 21-60 years; 77% female; 41% Hispanic; 21% primarily Spanish speaking; 44% college graduates or higher; 22% unemployed) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ConTxt only (n = 101), ConTxt plus health-coaching calls (n = 96), or standard print materials on  reduction (control group, n = 101). We used computer-based permuted-block randomization with block sizes of three or six, stratified by sex and Spanish-speaking status. Participants, study staff, and investigators were masked until the intervention was assigned. The primary outcome was objectively measured percent of  loss from baseline at 12 months. Differences between groups were evaluated using linear mixed-effects regression within an intention-to-treat framework. A total of 261 (87.2%) and 253 (84.9%) participants completed 6- and 12-month visits, respectively. Loss to follow-up did not differ by study group. Mean (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) percent  loss at 12 months was -0.61 (-1.99 to 0.77) in the control group, -1.68 (-3.08 to -0.27) in ConTxt only, and -3.63 (-5.05 to -2.81) in ConTxt plus health-coaching calls. At 12 months, mean (95% CI) percent  loss, adjusted for baseline BMI, was significantly different between ConTxt plus health-coaching calls and the control group (-3.0 [-4.99 to -1.04], p = 0.003) but not between the ConTxt-only and the control group (-1.07 [-3.05 to 0.92], p = 0.291). Differences between ConTxt plus health-coaching calls and ConTxt only were not significant (-1.95 [-3.96 to 0.06], p = 0.057). These findings were consistent across other -related secondary outcomes, including changes in absolute , BMI, and percent  fat at 12 months. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that Spanish speakers responded more favorably to ConTxt plus health-coaching calls than English speakers (Spanish contrast: -7.90 [-11.94 to -3.86], p < 0.001; English contrast: -1.82 [-4.03 to 0.39], p = 0.107).

The following data was obtained from staff records: sociodemographic characteristics; and  and height, recorded during pre-employment and periodic medical examinations. The latter was used to calculate  mass index (BMI).The final sample consisted of 386 workers (76.4% women and 88.1% white) with a mean age of 29.3 ± 7.3 years. Mean  and BMI at admission were highest in the 2000 cohort (W = 66.3 ± 12.5kg; BMI = 21.3 ± 2.5 kg/), compared to 1980 (W = 56.7 ± 10.2 kg; BMI = 21.3 ± 2.5 kg/)and 1990 (W = 62.2 ± 11.5 kg; BMI = 22.9 ± 3.3 kg/) cohorts.

Hence, this study aimed at overweight adolescent boys to explore the effect of high intensity intermittent training (HIIT) on these anti-inflammatory cytokines and  composition parameters. Materials and methods Twenty overweight adolescent boys [aged: 18.0 ± 1.5 years, : 81.8 ± 4.3 kg,  mass index (BMI): 27.6 ± 0.8 kg/] completed this study. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups of control (CG, n = 10) and training (TG, n = 10). Subjects in the TG performed their training sessions 3 days/week for 6 weeks. The baseline serum values of IL-4 and IL-13 and anthropometric features were measured 1 day before the beginning of exercise intervention and 1 day after the last training session in a fasting state. Results Six weeks of HIIT significantly increased the baseline serum levels of IL-4 (p = 0.022) and IL-13 (p = 0.014) in overweight adolescent boys. In addition,  (BW), BMI and  fat percent (BF%) were reduced in response to HIIT. Moreover, significantly negative correlations were found between changes of IL-4 and IL-13 with changes of BW, BMI and BF%.

Women >180 kg were excluded as their care was managed in a tertiary centre. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were analysed by BMI group. Statistical analysis was performed using χ , Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression with a significance level of 0.05.Of the 18 518 births between 2011 and 2016, 99.4% had a maternal BMI recorded. The prevalence of BMI ≥50 kg/m was 0.5%. Highest complication rates were observed among women with BMI ≥50 kg/m , including gestational diabetes (29%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (20%) and caesarean section (48%). Of infants born to women with BMI ≥50 kg/m , 12% were late-pre-term, 23% required special or intensive care and 20% had birth  ≥4.0 kg. When compared with obese women with BMI 30-49 kg/m , women with BMI ≥50 kg/m were significantly more likely to develop a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (preeclampsia adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.98 (1.93-8.18), pregnancy-induced hypertension aOR 3.55 (1.79-7.03)) and deliver a late pre-term infant (aOR 2.45 (1.31-4.58)).The prevalence of severe maternal obesity in our non-tertiary setting is higher than previous national estimates. Women with BMI ≥50 kg/m are an important subgroup of the obese obstetric population who experience high rates of complications and interventions.

The objective was to establish whether (i) birthweight and BMI across the life-course, (ii) BMI gains at specific life-stages and (iii) age of obesity onset were associated with PF at 50 y.In the 1958 British birth cohort (n = 8674), BMI (kg/) was calculated using height and  [measured (7, 11, 16, 33 and 45 y); self-reported (23 and 50 y)]. PF was assessed at 50 y using the validated PF subscale of the Short-form 36 survey; the bottom (gender-specific) 10% was classified as poor PF. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Associations were examined using logistic regression, adjusting for health and social factors.Birthweight was not associated with PF. At each adult age, odds of poor PF were highest for obese (vs normal), e.g. for 23 y obesity the odds ratio (OR)adjusted for poor PF was 2.28 (1.34, 3.91) and 2.67 (1.72, 4.14) in males and females respectively. BMI gains were associated with poor PF, e.g. for females, ORadjusted per standard deviation (SD) in BMI gain 16-23 y was 1.28 (1.13, 1.46); for BMI gains 45-50 y it was 1.36 (1.11, 1.65). Longer duration of obesity was associated with poor PF, e.g. in males, ORadjusted was 2.32 (1.26, 4.29) for childhood obesity onset and 1.50 (1.16, 1.96) for mid-adulthood onset (vs never obese, P-trend < 0.001).Obesity, BMI gains, and earlier obesity onset were associated with poor PF in mid-adulthood, reinforcing the importance of preventing and delaying obesity onset.© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

Metabolic surgery represents the operative treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Metabolic surgery does not focus on  loss, as many mechanisms, which are responsible for the improvement of the glycemic control are independent from  loss. There are many studies, which show the efficient effect of metabolic surgery in diabetic patients with class II obesity. Furthermore, there is growing evidence, that metabolic surgery does also work in patients with a BMI below 35 kg / . Multiple surgical and endocrinological associations have endorsed these facts and adopted their guidelines.

The study aim was to determine the relationship between PMS, and state of nutrition expressed as  Mass Index (BMI) and  composition in 18-year-old females.The study was conducted on 476 women divided into two groups i.e. those suffering from PMS (n = 233) and those without symptoms (n = 243). The women were examined during their luteal phase using bioelectrical impedance analysis to determine their  composition. Height and  were measured using digital medical scales with an electronic height rod. BMI was calculated thus: BMI =  mass () (kg)/height (). The subjects were di- vided into two sub-groups: BMI < 25 kg/ and BMI ≥ 25 kg/. Statistical analysis was carried out using STATISTICA 10 PL software and the Mann-Whitney test.The women with normal BMI suffered from PMS twice as often as the women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/ (68.2% vs. 31.8%). There were significantly higher values for Fat Mass (FM) (%) (p < 0.01) and FM (kg) (p < 0.001) in women without PMS, and significantly higher values for Fat-Free Mass (FFM) (%) (p < 0.001) and Total  Water (TBW) (%) (p < 0.001) in women with PMS. Higher values were reported for FFM (kg) and TBW (kg) (p < 0.05) in girls with PMS and BMI ≥ 25.These results show PMS is more frequent in patients with BMI < 25, and less frequent in patients with higher FM (kg) and FM (%).

A proximate series of postcranial bones (designated KNM-ER 64061) derives from the same siltstone unit and may be associated with the dentition, but their separation on the surface of the site leaves some room for doubt. KNM-ER 64060 is one of fewer than ten hominin specimens from the Early Pleistocene of East Africa that comprises a full or nearly complete mandibular dentition. Its taxonomic attribution is potentially significant, especially if the postcranial elements are related. At least three, and probably four hominin species, including Paranthropus boisei and Homo erectus (= H. ergaster), are known at about this time in East Africa. Other penecontemporaneous fossils have been referred to a single, highly variable species, H. habilis, or two taxa, namely H. habilis and H. rudolfensis. Although the  of evidence supports the attribution of these specimens to two species, there is notable lack of agreement over the assignation of individual fossils. We take a conservative approach and group all such specimens under the designation "early Homo sp." for comparative purposes. KNM-ER 64060 is clearly attributable to Homo rather than Paranthropus. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that the affinities of KNM-ER 64060 are with fossils assigned to the early Homo sp. category rather than with H. erectus. This is indicated by the overall sizes of the KNM-ER 64060 canine, premolar and molar crowns, the size relationships of the P to P, the relative narrowness of its premolar crowns, the cusp proportions of the M and especially those of the M and M, and seemingly the possession of a two-rooted P. Some of these comparisons suggest further that among the fossils comprising the early Homo sp. sample, the KNM-ER 64060 dentition exhibits greater overall similarity to specimens such as OH 7 and OH 16 that represent Homo habilis sensu stricto.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There might be differences in the fatty acid (FA) handling in adipose tissue when both ethnicities are exposed to high-fat overfeeding. The objective of the present study was to investigate the molecular adaptation in relation to FA metabolism in response to overfeeding with a high-fat diet (OHFD) in South Asian and Caucasian men. Ten South Asian men (BMI 18-29 kg/) and ten Caucasian men (BMI 22-33 kg/), matched for  fat percentage, aged 20-40 years were included. A -maintenance diet (30 % fat, 55 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) was given for 3 d followed by 3 d of overfeeding (150 % energy requirement) with a high-fat diet (60 % fat, 25 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) while staying in a respiration chamber. Before and after overfeeding, abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken. Proteins were isolated, analysed and quantified for short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1α (CPT1a), adipose TAG lipase, perilipin A (PLINA), perilipin B, lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid binding protein 4 using Western blotting. OHFD decreased the HADH level (P < 0·05) in Caucasians more than in Asians (P < 0·05), but the baseline and after intervention HADH level was relatively higher in Caucasians. The level of CPT1a decreased in South Asians and increased in Caucasians (P < 0·05). PLINA did not change with diet but the level was higher in South Asians (P < 0·05). The observed differences in HADH and PLINA levels as well as in CPT1a response may be important for differences in the long-term regulation of energy (fat) metabolism in these populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616161>Efficacy of a new oncolytic adenovirus armed with IL-13 against oral carcinoma models.</a></h2><p>The efficacy of traditional therapies for oral carcinoma (OC) is limited. Oncolytic adenovirus, a novel strategy of cancer therapy, shows potential use in OC treatment. However, its clinical application is limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. Thus, this study aimed to examine the efficacy of a new modified adenovirus against OC in vitro and in vivo.A multiple modified adenovirus (MMAD) armed with IL-13 (MMAD-IL-13) was constructed, and its effect on Cal-27 cells was examined. The potency of MMAD-IL-13 was examined in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiment, CCK-8 kit was used to determine the IC50 of MMAD-IL-3 in OC cell lines. For in vivo experiment, Cal-27 xenograft models were used to determine the antitumor effect of MMAD-IL-13. Apoptosis was measured in Cal-27 cells by Western blotting assay. Immunity response was detected in Cal-27 xenograft models 7 days after intratumoral injection with MMAD-IL-13. The potency of MMAD and MMAD-IL-13 was compared in Cal-27 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) models.MMAD-IL-13 was successfully constructed; the harvested virus could be replicated and they overexpressed human IL-13 in Cal-27 cells. Compared with MMAD, MMAD-IL-13 showed enhanced antitumor effect in vitro by inducing apoptosis and reducing percentage of  macrophages in tumor environment in vivo. MMAD-IL-13 also showed potent antitumor effect in Cal-27, SCC-4, and Tca8113 cells in vitro and in Cal-27 xenograft models in vivo. However, MMAD-IL13 did not harm normal human oral epithelial cells in vitro and exhibited no effect on  in Cal-27 xenograft models. In Cal-27 PBMC models, MMAD-IL-13 showed stronger antitumor effect than MMAD.A new oncolytic adenovirus carrying the human IL-13 gene was constructed. This virus effectively led to remission of tumor development and death of OC cells in vivo and in vitro, showing its potential as a clinical cancer therapy.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664291>Synthesis of new multivalent metal ion functionalized mesoporous silica and studies of their enhanced antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activities.</a></h2><p>In the present study, we have reported the synthesis of a transition metal (Me = Ti, V, and Pd) incorporated into MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves (Si/Me = 20) synthesized by the sol-gel method. Their physicochemical properties were studied in detail by standard techniques like low angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption studies, and thermogravimetric-differential thermal (TG-DTA) analysis and spectral studies like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis (UV-Visible-DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD patterns prove that the material's phase identity is the same irrespective of metal incorporation. SEM displayed the uniform shape and size of the nanoparticles. The presence of elements such as Ti, V, Pd, Si and O in respective materials is revealed using the EDXS analysis. Around 30%  loss arose upon calcination from room temperature to 800 °C. BET surface area analysis presented that the parent materials have a high surface area (1024  g-1) which was reduced upon metal incorporation. FT-IR analysis exhibited the framework vibrations of the synthesised materials. UV-Visible-DRS analysis indicated the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions. The multivalent-metal-ion-functionalized mesoporous materials showed significant enhancement in potent antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The antimicrobial activity is because of its low lipophilicity, which no longer allows the materials to enter via the lipid membrane. Thus, the new materials neither obstruct the metal-binding sites nor inhibit the growth of microbe enzymes. Further, the results show that the transition metal ion-containing mesoporous materials possessing good anticancer activity arising from their excessive surface area to volume ratio provided appropriate association with a tumour cell due to the direct penetration of mesoporous materials into the cell wall, causing membrane damage and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491698>Infiltration behavior of heavy metals in runoff through soil amended with biochar as bulking agent.</a></h2><p>Biochar as a porous carbon material could be used for improving soil physical and chemical properties, while insufficient attention has been paid to potential risks induced by infiltration of heavy metals in the runoff water flowing through biochar-amended soil. Four different soil-biochar matrices with same volumes were constructed including soil alone (M1), biochar alone (), soil-biochar layering (M3) and soil-biochar mixing (M4). Leaching experiments were conducted with Pb, Cu, and Zn contaminated runoff water. Results showed that biochar amendment greatly improved the water permeation, and the infiltration rates in , M3, and M4 were 2.85-23.0 mm min, being much higher than those in M1 (1.33-4.05 mm min), though the rates decreased as the leaching volumes increased. However, biochar induced more Pb, Cu, and Zn infiltrated through soil-biochar matrix. After 350-L leaching, M1 retained about 95% Pb, 90% Cu, and 36% Zn, while  only retained 4.80% Pb, 17.4% Cu, and 4.01% Zn; about 30% Pb, 80% Cu, and 15% Zn were retained in M3 and M4. Notably, Zn was trapped first and then re-leached into the filtrate, which resulted in a much higher effluent Zn than the influent Zn at the later stage. However, the unit  of biochar showed a higher capacity for retaining heavy metals compared to per unit of soil. Under the dynamic water flow, all benefits and disadvantages induced by biochar were weakened with its physical disintegration. Biochar as soil amendment can enhance plant growth via ameliorating soil structure, while it would pose risks to environment because of large penetration of heavy metals. If biochar was compacted to form a denser physical structure, perhaps more heavy metals could be retained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The increments in energy expenditure were similar by HULA and WALK.  composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and after HULA and WALK. The primary endpoint was the change in fat % in the android region.A total of 53subjects (waist 92 ± 1 cm,  mass index 28 ± 1 kg/) completed the study.  changed similarly (-0.6 ± 0.2 vs. -0.5 ± 0.2 kg, nonsignificant; HULA vs. WALK). During the intervention the subjects hula-hooped on average 12.8 ± 0.5 min/day and walked 9,986 ± 376 steps/day. The % fat in the android region decreased significantly by HULA but not by WALK (between-group change p < 0.001). Trunk muscle mass increased more by HULA than by WALK (p < 0.05). Waist circumference decreased more by HULA than by WALK (-3.1 ± 0.3 cm vs. -0.7 ± 0.4 cm, p < 0.001; HULA vs. WALK). WALK but not HULA significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and increased HDL cholesterol while HULA significantly decreased LDL cholesterol.Hula-hooping with a weighted hula-hoop can be used to decrease abdominal fat % and increase trunk muscle mass in overweight subjects. Its LDL lowering effect resembles that described for resistance training.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Analysis of the effectiveness in terms of  loss is fundamental to understand the real potential of digital technologies as tools for delivery of  loss interventions. For this, we need accurate and reliable anthropometric data. For reasons of convenience, self-reported  and height often replace actual measurements in these interventions. This might lead to misclassification of BMI status during selection of participants and to bias in the assessment of the outcomes. Therefore, it is fundamental to have validation studies of self-reported web-based data.We aimed to validate online self-reported height,  and BMI in a POEmaS trial subsample.We included 12.5% of the POEmaS' population (n=159). Anthropometric data reported on the web-platform were compared to measured data by paired T-tests. Agreement was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. Multinomial regression was used to investigate factors associated with self-reported  validity.There was no significant difference between reported and measured  (0.4 kg, SD 1.7; p=0.13) and BMI (0.03 kg/, SD 0.87; p=0.06). Reported height was on average 0.4 cm (SD 1.2) higher than the measured ones (p<0.001). For all anthropometric data, >=95% of the cases were within the limits of agreement. Higher measured BMI was the only factor associated with low accuracy of  report. Each unit increase in BMI increased the odds that the reported  was lower than the one measured (OR 1.13; 95%CI 1.01-1.26).Self-reported  and BMI change showed good agreement with measured ones. Since these are the primary outcomes of the POEmaS trial, the findings of the validation study suggest that the outcomes' accuracy is high and that it does not vary across gender, age, study group. These findings are relevant to digital health researchers and assessors and suggest that digital health interventions for  loss might rely on self-reported assessment of outcomes. This might be particularly useful when other modes of assessment, such as anthropometry and e-scales, are not feasible or not available. However, we acknowledge that these results might not be applicable to low educated populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394746>The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) Mediates the Counter-Regulatory Effects of Pelargonidins in Models of Inflammation and Metabolic Dysfunctions.</a></h2><p>Pelargonidins are anthocyanidins thought to be beneficial for the human health, although controversies exist over the doses needed and the unclear mechanism of action, along with poor systemic bioavailability. One putative target of pelargonidins is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). A synthetic pelargonidin (Mt-P) was synthesized by the methylation of the pelargonidin (the natural compound indicated as P). Mt-P transactivated the AhR with an EC of 1.97 µM and was ~2-fold more potent than the natural compound. In vitro Mt-P attenuated pro-inflammatory activities of Raw264.7 macrophage cells in an AhR-dependent manner. In vivo, administration of the Mt-P in Balb/c mice resulted in a dose-dependent attenuation of signs and symptoms of colitis induced by TNBS. A dose of 5 mg/kg Mt-P, but not the natural compound P, reversed intestinal inflammation and increased expression of Tnf-α, Ifn-ƴ, and Il-6, while promoted the expansion of regulatory T cells and  macrophages. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), Mt-P attenuated  gain, intestinal and liver inflammation, and ameliorated insulin sensitivity, while worsened liver steatosis by up-regulating the liver expression of Cd36 and Apo100b. These effects were abrogated by AhR gene ablation. Mt-P is a synthetic pelargonidin endowed with robust AhR agonist activity that exerts beneficial effects in murine models of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504898>Influence of free-range days on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, lymphoid organ indices, and blood biochemistry of Wannan Yellow chickens.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of free-range days on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, lymphoid organ indices, and blood biochemical parameters of Wannan Yellow chickens. A total of 1,000 one-day-old male Wannan Yellow chickens were reared to 56 D. At 56 D of age, 960 birds with similar  (BW) were randomly allocated to free-range treatment at 56, 70, 84, and 98 D of age (assigned to free-range treatment for 42, 28, 14, and 0 D, respectively); 6 replicates with 40 chickens per treatment. In the free-range system, chickens were reared in indoor floor pens with an outdoor free-range paddock measuring 4 × 7 m (28 , 1.5 birds/). Results showed that BW of birds decreased significantly in the first 2 wk after birds were assigned to free-range treatment compared with those in the conventional treatment (P < 0.05). Average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) for chickens assigned to free-range treatment from 56 to 70 D of age, while feed conversion ratio increased significantly (P < 0.05). Breast yield increased linearly with increasing free-range days (P < 0.05), whereas leg and foot yields decreased linearly (P < 0.05). Drip loss and L* value of thigh muscle decreased linearly with increasing free-range days (P < 0.05), while shear force improved linearly (P < 0.05). Additionally, the absolute thymus  and thymus to BW ratio showed significant increasing and then decreasing quadratic responses to increasing free-range days (P < 0.05). Furthermore, serum glucose, total protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride content declined linearly, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) content increased linearly with increasing free-range days (P < 0.05). In conclusion, increasing free-range days had positive effects on breast yield, shear force, thymus , and HDL-C content, but negatively affected leg yield, foot yield, drip loss, L* value of thigh muscle, glucose, total protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels of Wannan Yellow chickens.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442601>Efficacy and Safety of Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is the most successful treatment for obesity. However, many patients avoid surgery due to its perceived invasive nature and fear of complications. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a seemingly less invasive option for patients with obesity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESG in adults.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library through July 2019. Investigated outcomes included the percent total  loss (TBWL),  mass index reduction, percent excess  loss (EWL), and adverse events.We extracted data from 8 original studies, published from 2016 through 2019, which included a total of 1772 patients. At 6 months, mean TBWL was 15.1% (95% CI, 14.3-16.0), mean decrease in  mass index was 5.65 kg/ (95% CI, 5.07-6.22), and mean excess  loss was 57.7% (95% CI, 52.0-63.4).  loss was sustained at 12 months and 18-24 months with a TBWL of 16.5% (95% CI, 15.2-17.8) and 17.2% (95% CI, 14.6-19.7), respectively. The pooled post-ESG rate of severe adverse events was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.6%-3.1%], including pain or nausea requiring hospitalization (n = 18, 1.08%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n=9, 0.56%), and peri-gastric leak or fluid collection (n = 8, 0.48%).In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found ESG to produce clinically significant  loss that was reproducible among independent centers and to have a low rate of severe adverse events. ESG appears to be an effective intervention for patients with obesity, although comparative studies and randomized controlled trials are necessary.

We estimated the proportion of PTC incidence in the United States attributable to overweight/obesity during 1995-2015.NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort data (n = 457,331 participants, 50-71 years and cancer-free at baseline) were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PTC across  mass index categories. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated using estimated HRs and annual overweight/obesity prevalence estimates from the National Health Interview Survey. PAF estimates were combined with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-13 data to calculate annual percent changes (APC) in PTC incidence rates attributable (and unrelated) to overweight/obesity.Overweight (25.0-29.0 kg/) and obesity (≥30.0 kg/) were associated with 1.26-fold (95% CI 1.05-1.52) and 1.30-fold (95% CI 1.05-1.62) increased risks of PTC, respectively, and nearly 3-fold (HR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.25-6.87) and >5-fold (HR = 5.42, 95% CI 2.24-13.1) increased risks of large (>4 cm) PTCs, compared to normal- (18.5-24.9 kg/). During 1995-2015, PAF estimates for overweight/obesity increased from 11.4 to 16.2% for all PTCs and 51.4 to 63.2% for large PTCs. Overweight/obesity accounted for 13.6% and 57.8% of the APCs in total (5.9%/year) and large (4.5%/year) PTC incidence rates, respectively, during 1995-2015.Overweight/obesity may have contributed importantly to the rapid rise in PTC incidence during 1995-2015. By 2015, we estimate that one of every six PTCs diagnosed among adults ≥60 years, including nearly two-thirds of large PTCs, were attributable to overweight/obesity.© The Author(s) 2019.

The dietary intervention in these patients is aimed at maintaining proper , obtaining target fasting and post meal blood glucose levels, optimizing lipid profiles.The aim of the study was to assess dietary habits in a homogeneous group of adults with T1DM treated with personal insulin pumps.The study included 141 adult patients (57% women) with type 1 diabetes treated with personal insulin pumps. The surveyed population was characterized by an average age of 25.8 ± 6.2 years, an average duration of diabetes 13.9 ± 6.9 years, and treatment with a personal pump for 8.2 ± 4.1 years and mean BMI 23.0 ± 2.8 g/. All were dwellers of south-eastern Poland. The validated KomPAN questionnaire was used to assess the frequency of consumption of individual food products.The mean percentage of HbA1c in the study group was 7.3% [56 mmol/mol]. The mean total cholesterol level was 4.4 mmol/l, HDL - 1.7 mmol/l, LDL - 2.3 mmol/l and triglycerides - 0.8 mmol/l. In the multivariate regression model, no correlation was found between dietary quality parameters and metabolic compensation measured with HbA1c or lipidogram and the place of residence (village, small town, big city). However, there were differences in the quality of the diet depending on the sex. Women were characterized by higher index of a healthy diet (pHDI-10) (26.3 vs 21.4, p=0.005) and lower index of unhealthy diet (nHDI-14) (13.3 vs 18.6, p <0.001) than men.The results of this study clearly suggest, that despite good metabolic control, patients require more education on the choice of healthy product groups.Copyright by the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504693>Lipolysis and Fat Oxidation Are Not Altered with Presleep Compared with Daytime Casein Protein Intake in Resistance-Trained Women.</a></h2><p>To date, no studies have directly compared the differences between presleep and daytime protein (PRO) consumption on localized and systemic fat metabolism in active women.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of presleep compared with daytime PRO supplementation on subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) lipolysis and whole- substrate utilization in women.Thirteen young (mean ± SE age: 22 ± 1 y; BMI: 24.3 ± 0.8 kg/), resistance-trained [1 repetition maximum (1RM) squat percentage of : 135% ± 6%; 1RM bench press percentage of : 82% ± 4%] women volunteered.

SCAAT lipolysis, resting metabolism (indirect calorimetry), and plasma biomarkers (glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol) were measured at baseline, overnight, and the next morning.There were no differences in overnight SCAAT lipolysis between conditions indicated by interstitial glycerol concentrations (PRO-PLA: baseline, 669 ± 137; next morning, 321 ± 77.1; PLA-PRO: baseline, 524 ± 109; next morning, 333 ± 68.0 μM), fat oxidation (PRO-PLA: baseline, 5.70 ± 0.35; next morning, 5.00 ± 0.28; PLA-PRO: baseline, 6.59 ± 0.32; next morning, 5.44 ± 0.27 g/min), or any other measure.There was no difference between the effects of daytime and presleep PRO supplementation on SCAAT lipolysis or whole- substrate utilization in resistance-trained women. Presleep PRO is a viable option for increasing PRO consumption in resistance-trained women because it does not blunt overnight lipolysis, and will therefore likely not lead to increases in subcutaneous abdominal fat.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as .Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365625>Metabolic phenotypes of obese, overweight, and normal  individuals and risk of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk is inconsistent in the normal-, overweight, and obese individuals due to the heterogeneity of metabolic status.

Four conditions of energy balance (ad libitum energy intake, zero energy balance, -25% caloric restriction, and +25% overfeeding) were each performed at three levels of ET (PAL 1.3 low, 1.6 medium, and 1.8 high ET; by walking on a treadmill). Levels of appetite hormones ghrelin, GLP-1, and insulin (total area under the curve) were measured during 14 hours. Subjective appetite ratings were assessed by visual analog scales.Compared with high ET, low ET led to decreased GLP-1 (at all energy balance conditions: P < 0.001) and increased ghrelin concentrations (caloric restriction and overfeeding: P < 0.001), which was consistent with higher feelings of hunger (zero energy balance: P < 0.001) and desire to eat (all energy balance conditions: P < 0.05) and a positive energy balance during ad libitum intake (+17.5%; P < 0.001).Appetite is regulated more effectively at a high level of ET, whereas overeating and consequently  gain are likely to occur at low levels of ET. In contrast to the prevailing concept of  control, the positive impact of physical activity is independent from burning up more calories and is explained by improved appetite sensations.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556659>Associations between self-monitoring and  change in behavioral  loss interventions.</a></h2><p>The current study is a secondary analysis of the Live SMART trial, a randomized controlled trial comparing a behavioral  loss (BWL) condition delivered via smartphone (SMART) to a group-based BWL condition (GROUP) and a control condition (CONTROL). Given the established importance of self-monitoring for  loss, the aims were to evaluate bidirectional associations between adherence to self-monitoring and  change and to examine the moderating effect of treatment condition on these associations.Adults with overweight/obesity (n = 276; 83% women; 92.8% White; Mage = 55.1 years; Mbody mass index = 35.2 kg/) were instructed to self-monitor dietary intake, daily , and physical activity minutes via paper diaries in GROUP and CONTROL and via a smartphone application in SMART. All participants were weighed monthly at the research center. Adherence to self-monitoring was assessed via examination of self-monitoring records.Generalized linear mixed models revealed that adherence to self-monitoring of dietary intake, self-weighing, and physical activity for each month was associated with  change throughout that month, such that increased frequency of self-monitoring led to greater  loss (ps < .001). For the GROUP condition only, poorer  losses in 1 month were prospectively associated with poor adherence to self-monitoring the following month (ps ≤ .01).Results provide evidence of a bidirectional association between self-monitoring and  change. Better self-monitoring was consistently associated with better  loss across intervention and tracking modalities. Poorer  loss was prospectively associated with poorer self-monitoring in group treatment, suggesting that social influences could drive adherence in this form of treatment.

To assess heart rate variability (HRV), participants remained in a supine position with a 30-degree head elevation for 20 minutes. Electrocardiographic signal (protocol with three derivations) was collected from 600 Hz sample rate to obtain beat-to-beat intervals (R-R interval). This assessment was performed before, after one hour and after 24 hours of the exercise session. All patients underwent a 35 minutes aerobic exercise session (AES) (low-moderate intensity) on the cycle ergometer.Significant differences were found in the time domain, with positive changes in root mean square of successive RR interval differences (rMSSD) (ms) (parasympathetic component) (one [P=0.017] and 24 hours [P=0.007] post-session). In the frequency domain, we found a significant difference in high frequency (HF) (ms2) (parasympathetic component) (one hour [P=0.048] post-session). The low frequency (LF)/HF ratio (sympathetic and parasympathetic components with a predominance of the sympathetic component) reached statistical significance only 24 hours (P=0.018) post-session. Additionally, the largest effect size was observed only for the LF/HF ratio at one (d=-0.8) and 24 hours (d=-1.3) after one AES.The practice of (acute) aerobic exercise improved autonomic cardiac control in patients undergoing CABG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344206>[Clinical features and management of 205 adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus].</a></h2><p>Few studies have evaluated the details of insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in Chile.To describe clinical features and treatment details of adults with T1D and its association with metabolic control.Review of medical records of patients with T1D treated in a clinical network. Demographic and clinical features, types and doses of insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels were registered. The use flash glucose monitors (FGM) and insulin pumps (CSII) were also recorded.205 records were reviewed, with T1d lasting 12 ± 10 years. Twenty six percent had hypothyroidism, 1% had celiac disease, 12% had hypertension, 20% had dyslipidemia; 13% had diabetic retinopathy, 2% had diabetic nephropathy, 8% had neuropathy and 2% cardiovascular diseases. Mean  mass index was 25 kg/  and mean glycated hemoglobin was 8%. Eighty-two percent used multiple daily injections, 18% used CSII and 24% used FGM. As basal insulin, 35% used slow acting analogs and 65% used ultra-slow analogs. As rapid acting insulin, 69 patients used Lispro, 79 Aspart and 50 Glulisin. Bolus doses were calculated using only capillary glucose in 22%, while 78% also considered carbohydrate consumption. Variables significantly associated to better control were the use of carbohydrates for dosing rapid insulin (A1c 7,85% vs 8,59%, p = 0,008), use of CSII (A1c 7,36% vs 8,16%, p = 0,008), and basal dose < 0,4 U/kg (A1c 7,81% vs 8,58%, p = 0,003).

The objective was to verify the effectiveness of a combined school and home-based obesity prevention program on excessive  gain in adolescents. Teachers delivered the school-based primary prevention program to fifth and sixth graders (9 schools, 48 control classes, 49 intervention classes), which included encouraging healthy eating habits and physical activity. A subgroup of overweight or obese adolescents also received a home-based secondary prevention program delivered by community health professionals. Schools were randomized to intervention or control group. Intent-to-treat analysis used mixed models for repeated continuous  and considered the cluster effect. The main outcomes were changes in  mass index (BMI) and percent  fat (% fat) after one school-year of intervention and follow-up. Against our hypothesis, BMI increased more in the intervention group than in the control group (Δ=0.3kg/; p=0.05) with a greater decrease in % fat among boys (Δ=-0.6%; p=0.03) in the control group. The intervention group increased physical activity by 12.5 minutes per week compared with the control group. Female adolescents in the intervention group ate healthier items more frequently than in the control group. The subgroup who received both the school and home interventions had an increase in % fat than in the control group (Δ=0.89%; p=0.01).

The objective of the present study was to evaluate physical activity levels during the pregnancy and postpartum periods and the influence of  mass index (BMI) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or low risk pregnancy. The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ), translated and validated for Portuguese, was used for the evaluation of physical activity (PA) level. The sample was stratified according to preconception BMI and the presence or absence of diagnosis of GDM, resulting in four groups with 66 participants each: low risk pregnancy (LRP) with normal  (BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 24 kg/), LRP and overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/), GDM with normal  and GDM with overweight/obese. The level of PA of each participant was measured as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) during the preconceptional period (T0), in the third trimester of gestation (T1), and three months after delivery (T2). The comparison of the MET values showed that the values found in the evaluation three months after delivery (T2) were higher than 1.00 (1.10 MET for the LRP-normal , 1.06 MET for LRP-overweight/obese, 1.02 MET for the GDM- normal , 1.07 MET for the GDM-overweight/obese).

Line OR_LS was selected by ovulation rate (OR) and LS to improve LS more efficiently. In this study, growth traits of line OR_LS were evaluated by estimating the correlated response on weaning  (WW), slaughter  (SW) and GR during fattening period as well as their variability (DWW, DSW and DGR, respectively). Data were analyzed using Bayesian inference methods. Heritability estimates were low for growth traits (0.09, 0.13 and 0.14 for WW, SW and GR, respectively) and negligible for growth traits variability (0.01, 0.004 and 0.01 for DWW, DSW and DGR, respectively). Moderate common litter effect ratio (c2; 0.35, 0.28 and 0.27) and low maternal effect ratio (; 0.11, 0.05 and 0.01) were obtained for WW, SW and GR, respectively. Both c2 and  were lower at slaughter than at weaning. In addition, low common litter effect and negligible maternal effect were observed for growth traits variability. Genetic correlations between LS and both growth traits and their variability were close to zero. Positive genetic correlations were observed between OR and growth traits (0.19, 0.38 and 0.36 for WW, SW and GR, respectively) as well as between OR and growth traits variability (0.35, 0.62 and 0.20 for DWW, DSW and DGR, respectively). Positive correlated responses in both periods were obtained for growth traits, WW, SW and GR (0.037, 0.156 and 0.110 kg, respectively). The correlated response found in growth traits might be due to the positive genetic correlations between OR and these traits. However, selection for OR and LS using independent culling levels did not modify the growth traits variability. Therefore, no negative consequences on growth traits can be expected in current commercial maternal lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344165>[Maximum aerobic power output in overweight and obese individuals].</a></h2><p>The evaluation of physical fitness is important to determine workloads and to assess the effectiveness of exercise interventions in obese people.To determine the maximum aerobic power output (MAPO) in overweight and obese individuals and to establish reference parameters for the Chilean population.One hundred five men and 218 women performed a cycle ergometer test up to 85% of their maximum heart rate. MAPO was determined by linear extrapolation of the theoretical maximum heart rate.Among men, MAPO values were 234.9 ± 48.4 w for  mass index (BMI) values between 30 and 34.9 kg/, 235.1 ± 69.7 w for BMI between 35 and 39.9 kg/, 270.2 ± 86.5 w for BMI over 40 kg/. MAPO relative values were 2.27 ± 0.5, 2.16 ± 0.6 and 1.96 ± 0.8 w/kg, respectively. Among women, MAPO was 172.6 ± 36.1 w for a BMI < 30 kg/, 169.2 ± 39.4 w for BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/, 179.5 ± 48.8 w f179.5 ± 48.8 w for BMI between 35 and 39.9 kg/ and 202.3 ± 57.3 w for BMI of 40 kg/ or over.

We have designed this study to compare the effects of  reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/ was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for  reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of  reduction, ≥ 5%  reduction and ≥ 7%  reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups,  reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups,  reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7%  reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of  reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Methods The derivation part (n = 200) prospectively explored 10 variables to create the best-fit algorithms (70% correct estimates within ±10% of actual BW) for prediction of BW at term; vertex presentation with engagement. The algorithm was then cross validated with samples of unrelated cases (n = 280) to compare the accuracy with the routine abdominal palpation method. Results The best-fit algorithms were parity-specific. The derived simplified algorithms were (1) BW (g) = 100 [(0.42 × symphysis-fundal height (SFH; cm)) + gestational age at delivery (GA; weeks) - 25] in nulliparous, and (2) BW (g) = 100 [(0.42 × SFH (cm)) + GA - 23] in multiparous. Cross validation showed an overall 69.3% accuracy within ±10% of actual BW, which exceeded routine abdominal palpation (60.4%) (P = 0.019). The algorithmic BW prediction was significantly more accurate than routine abdominal palpation in women with the following characteristics: BW 2500-4000 g, multiparous, pre-pregnancy  <50 kg, current  <60 kg, height <155 cm,  mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/, cervical dilatation 3-5 cm, station <0, intact membranes, SFH 30-39 cm, maternal abdominal circumference (mAC) <90 cm, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <25 cm and female gender of the neonates (P < 0.05).

Materials and methods In this clinical trial, 20 adolescent girls with hypothyroidism [age: 12.10 ± 1.94 years;  mass index (BMI): 25.25 ± 2.91 kg/] were selected and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was treated with 8 weeks of concurrent aerobic [60-80% heart rate reserve (HHR)] and resistance (40-65% of 1RM) training. Blood was sampled before and after training. Data were analyzed using a pairwise t-test and an independent t-test (α < 0.05). Results Within-group comparison revealed significant decline of  index, BMI, fat percentage, fasting blood sugar, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) in the experimental group (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.03, and p = 0.02, respectively). Also, inter-group comparisons indicated significant differences in , BMI, fat percentage and HOMA (p = 0.001). But, no significant difference was observed in the blood sugar index (p > 0.05).

First, continuous exercise (CEx) on an ergometer for 30 minutes at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and interval exercise (IEx) at 80% VO2max for 2 minutes were performed. This was followed by exercise performed at 40% VO2max for 1 minute and at 80% VO2max for 3 minutes, performed 6 times repeatedly for a total of 26 minutes. The accumulation of short duration exercise (AEx) was performed for 3-bouts of 10 minutes each at 60% VO2max.The major findings were as follows: energy consumption during the exercises showed no significant difference between CEx, IEx, and AEx; EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx as compared to CEx for all dependent variables (e.g. total oxygen consumption, total calorie, summation of heart rate, and EPOC duration); and the lipid profile showed no significant difference.Our study confirmed that when homogenizing the energy expenditure for various exercises in NWO individuals, EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx than in CEx.

The current state of knowledge supports the need to better integrate mechanistic approaches through effective studies of energy balance in the cancer population because of an observed significant lack of adherence to healthy lifestyle recommendations. To stimulate changes in breast cancer survivors' lifestyles based on energy balance, our group developed the BENECA (Energy Balance on Cancer) mHealth app. BENECA has been previously validated as a reliable energy balance monitoring system.Based on our previous results, the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of BENECA mHealth in an ecological clinical setting with breast cancer survivors, by studying (1) its feasibility and (2) pretest-posttest differences with regard to breast cancer survivor lifestyles, quality of life (QoL), and physical activity (PA) motivation.Eighty breast cancer survivors diagnosed with stage I to IIIA and with a  mass index over 25 kg/ were enrolled in this prospective test-retest quasi-experimental study. Patients used BENECA mHealth for 8 weeks and were assessed at baseline and the postintervention period. Feasibility main outcomes included percentage of adoption, usage, and attrition; user app quality perception measured with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS); satisfaction with the Net Promoter Score (NPS); and barriers and facilitators of its use. Clinical main outcomes included measuring QoL with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire Core 30 (EORT QLQ-C30), PA assessment with accelerometry, PA motivation measure with a Spanish self-efficacy scale for physical activity (EAF), and  composition with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Statistical tests (using paired-sample t tests) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed.BENECA was considered feasible by the breast cancer survivors in terms of use (76%, 58/76), adoption (69%, 80/116), and satisfaction (positive NPS). The app quality score did not make it one of the best-rated apps (mean 3.71, SD 0.47 points out of 5). BENECA mHealth improved the QoL of participants (global health mean difference [MD] 12.83, 95% CI 8.95-16.71, P<.001), and EAF score (global MD 36.99, 95% CI 25.52-48.46, P<.001), daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (MD 7.38, 95% CI 0.39-14.37, P=.04), and reduced  (MD -1.42, 95% CI -1.97 to -0.87, P<.001).BENECA mHealth can be considered feasible in a real clinical context to promote behavioral changes in the lifestyles of breast cancer survivors, but it needs to be enhanced to improve user satisfaction with use and functionality. This study highlights the importance of the use of mobile apps based on energy balance and how the QoL of breast cancer survivors can be improved via monitoring.©Mario Lozano-Lozano, Irene Cantarero-Villanueva, Lydia Martin-Martin, Noelia Galiano-Castillo, Maria-José Sanchez, Carolina Fernández-Lao, Paula Postigo-Martin, Manuel Arroyo-Morales.

The objectives of this cross-sectional study were: (1) to describe anthropometry,  composition, appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI; appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height2), and prevalence of low ASMI in older people with normal nutritional status (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool score = 0); (2) to determine factors associated with ASMI, and odds ratios of having low ASMI.SHIELD is a study of community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and above in Singapore. ASMI was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis and low ASMI was defined as <7.0 kg/ for males and <5.7 kg/ for females (Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia, 2014).A total of 400 older people (183 males and 217 females) took part in this study. The overall prevalence of low ASMI was 20.6% (15.5% in males and 24.9% in females). Females had significantly lower ASMI than males (P < 0.0001), age was inversely associated with ASMI (P = 0.0024) while BMI and calf circumference were positively associated with ASMI (both P < 0.0001) in the total cohort. In addition, ASMI was positively associated with bone mass in both genders (both P < 0.0001). After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratios of having low ASMI with every 1 year and 10 years increase in age were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.20) and 3.36 (95% CI: 1.82, 6.21) respectively.The high prevalence of low ASMI in community-dwelling older people with normal nutritional status highlights the need for early screening. There was a strong inverse association between age and ASMI while BMI, calf circumference and bone mass were positively associated with ASMI.

The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of 2 different SD and 2 supplemental levels of dietary Trp. A total of 1,140 Ross 308 broiler chickens at 21 d of age were allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 5 replicates. Low SD (9 birds/) and high SD (18 birds/) were achieved by raising different number of birds per identical floor pen (2.0 m × 2.4 m). The basal diet was formulated with no supplemental Trp in diets to meet or exceed nutrient recommendation of the Ross 308 manual. The calculated concentrations of total Trp and digestible Trp in the basal diet were 0.19 and 0.16%, respectively. The other diet was prepared by adding 0.16% crystalline Trp to the basal diet. Diets were fed to birds for 21 d. At the end of the experiment, 2 birds per replicate were euthanized to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that there were no interactions between SD and dietary Trp for all measurements. For the main effects, birds raised at a low SD had greater (P < 0.01)  gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency than those raised at a high SD. However, supplementation of dietary Trp had no effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, there were no main effects of SD and dietary Trp on intestinal barrier functions. In conclusion, broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with a high SD (18 birds/) have decreased growth performance with little changes in intestinal barrier functions. Supplementation of dietary Trp at 0.16% has no positive effect on broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with either a low or high SD.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554529>Critical Care Management of Status Epilepticus at a Tertiary Care University Hospital.</a></h2><p>Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to review the critical care management of patients with SE focusing on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as well as to determine the optimal dosing strategies of phenytoin (PHT) and predictors of its effectiveness.A retrospective chart review of adult patients with SE admitted to the University of Alberta Hospital, Canada, was conducted.Fifty-six admissions were included. Benzodiazepines (BDZs) were initially given in 89% of our patients. Following BDZs, PHT and levetiracetam were the most commonly initiated AEDs as first- and second-line agents and were deemed effective in 30/44 and 5/11 patients, respectively. Patients who received a PHT loading dose (LD) of 1000 mg were less likely to reach target levels compared with a -based LD ≥15 mg/kg (29% vs. 60%). Likewise, patients who received a maintenance dose (MD) of 300 mg/day were less likely to reach target compared with 400 mg/day or >5 mg/kg per day; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Three variables were found to be associated with PHT effectiveness: tonic-clonic SE (OR 5.01, 95% CI 1.02-24.7, p = 0.048), history of seizures and BMI <30 kg/ (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-1.07, p = 0.059).Further studies of the predictors of PHT effectiveness, specifically obesity, are necessary to help individualize care. Finally, we suggest that PHT should be loaded according to the guidelines as 20 mg/kg followed by an MD of at least 400 mg/day or >5 mg/kg per day.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504108>A Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis to Partition BMI Into Components of  Composition: An Application to Head and Neck Cancer Survival.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have suggested a "J-shaped" relationship between  mass index (BMI, kg/) and survival among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. However, BMI is a vague measure of  composition. To provide greater resolution we used Bayesian sensitivity analysis, informed by external data, to model the relationship between predicted fat mass index (FMI, kg adipose tissue/), lean mass index (LMI, kg lean tissue/) and survival. We estimated posterior median hazard ratios (HR) and 95% credible intervals for the BMI-mortality relationship in a Bayesian framework using data from 1,180 adults in North Carolina with HNC diagnosed between 2002 and 2006. Risk factors were assessed by interview shortly after diagnosis and vital status through 2013 via the National Death Index. The relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality was convex with a nadir at 28.6 with greater risk observed throughout the normal  range. The sensitivity analysis indicated that this was consistent with opposing increases in risk with FMI (1 kg/ increase, HR = 1.04 [1.00, 1.08]) and decreases with LMI (1 kg/ increase, HR = 0.90 [0.85, 0.95]). Patterns were similar for HNC-specific mortality but associations were stronger.  of  composition, rather than BMI, should be considered in relation to mortality risk.© The Author(s) 2019.
