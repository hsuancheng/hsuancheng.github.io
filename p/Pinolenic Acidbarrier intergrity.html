We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus . To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233818>Mass Spectrometric Confirmation of γ- Ester-Linked Ceramide 1 in the Epidermis of Borage Oil Fed Guinea Pigs.</a></h1><p>Ceramide 1 (Cer1), a Cer species with eicosasphingenine (d20:1) amide-linked to two different ω-hydroxy fatty acids (C30wh:0:C32wh:1), which are, in turn, ester-linked to linoleic  (LNA; 18:2n-6), plays a critical role in maintaining the structural  of the epidermal . Prompted by the recovery of a disrupted epidermal  with dietary borage oil [BO: 36.5% LNA and 23.5% γ- (GLA; 18:3n-6)], in essential fatty  (EFA)-deficient guinea pigs, we further investigated the effects of BO on the substitution of ester-linked GLA for LNA in these two epidermal Cer1 species by LC-MS in positive and negative modes. Dietary supplementation of BO for 2 weeks in EFA-deficient guinea pigs increased LNA ester-linked to C32wh:1/d20:1 and C30wh:0/d20:1 of Cer1. Moreover, GLA ester-linked to C32wh:1/d20:1, but not to C30wh:0/d20:1, of Cer1 was detected, which was further confirmed by the product ions of m/z 277.2 for ester-linked GLA and m/z 802.3 for the deprotonated C32wh:1/d20:1. C20-Metabolized fatty acids of LNA or GLA were not ester-linked to these Cer1 species. Dietary BO induced GLA ester-linked to C32wh:1/d20:1 of epidermal Cer1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29510469>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Intestinal Damage and Inflammation by Regulating Necroptosis and TLR4/NOD Signaling Pathways Following Lipopolysaccharide Challenge in a Piglet Model.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed oil is a rich source of α- (ALA), which is the precursor of the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). This study investigates the protective effect of flaxseed oil against intestinal injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Twenty-four weaned pigs were used in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment with dietary treatment (5% corn oil vs 5% flaxseed oil) and LPS challenge (saline vs LPS). On day 21 of the experiment, pigs were administrated with LPS or saline. At 2 h and 4 h post-administration, blood samples were collected. After the blood harvest at 4 h, all piglets were slaughtered and intestinal samples were collected. Flaxseed oil supplementation led to the enrichment of ALA, EPA, and total n-3 PUFAs in intestine. Flaxseed oil improved intestinal morphology, jejunal lactase activity, and claudin-1 protein expression. Flaxseed oil downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal necroptotic signals. Flaxseed oil also downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and its downstream signals myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins 1, 2 (NOD1, NOD2) and its adapter molecule, receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2).These results suggest that dietary addition of flaxseed oil enhances intestinal  and  function, which is involved in modulating necroptosis and TLR4/NOD signaling pathways.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
