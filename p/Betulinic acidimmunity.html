The mice received oral administration of EEDd (30-300mg/kg) in carrageenan models of , and EEDd (10-1000mg/kg) was assayed by the comet, micronucleus, and phagocytosis tests and by the peripheral leukocyte count.Phenols (204.04mg/g), flavonoids (89.17mg/g), and tannins (12.05mg/g) as well as sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside,  and betulin were present in the EEDd. The value of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EEDd was 62.5µg/mL. The EEDd induced a significant decrease in the edema, mechanical hypersensitivity and leukocyte migration induced by carrageenan. The comet and micronucleus tests indicated that the EEDd was not genotoxic. The EEDd also did not change the phagocytic activity or the leukocyte perLipheral count.The EEDd does not display genotoxicity, phagocytosis and could act as an antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory agent. This study should contribute to ensuring the safe use of EEDd.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The underlying molecular mechanism for let-7f regulation in these cells remains largely unclear.let-7f was knocked down in End1/E6E7 cells using siRNA, and differential gene expression was analyzed by microarray. Differentially expressed genes were validated by qPCR and Western blot. Expression of let-7f was studied by qPCR after inhibition of C/EBPβ with  (BA) and pCMVβ plasmid and after overexpression of C/EBPβ with pCMVβ+ plasmid. ChIP assay was performed to confirm binding of C/EBPβ to let-7f promoter. Levels of Lin28A/B were checked by qPCR after similar treatment.let-7f knockdown (KD) affects the expression of many transcription factors (eg, C/EBPβ) which are important regulators of immune responses. We observed let-7f-1 promoter to contain 6 C/EBPβ binding sites. KD of C/EBPβ led to decreased let-7f expression while overexpression of C/EBPβ increased its expression. Treatment of End1/E6E7 cells with TLR-3 ligand, poly(I:C) increased binding of C/EBPβ at binding sites 3, 5, and 6. Expression of Lin28A/B also changed upon inhibition and overexpression of C/EBPβ. Its expression is opposite to that of let-7f in End1/E6E7 cells.let-7f-1 is a direct target of transcription factor, C/EBPβ in End1/E6E7 cells.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The concept of immunostimulatory activity of SA-BA is based on the activation of immune system against cancer antigen. This study showed that SA-BA, a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the bark of the Ziziphus jujube tree, elevated the immunological functions of cancer antigen in anticancer . We found that, SA-BA pulsed human macrophages secreted elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines with an increased CD4(+) cell population. Pulse macrophages were also significantly arrested the KG-1A and K562 cell growth in vitro setup at 1:10 ratio for 48h. The use of TNF-α inhibitors confirmed the association between SA-BA with TNF-α function. SA-BA pulsed macrophages displayed substantial T cell allostimulatory capacity and promoted the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The adjuvanticity of SA-BA was proved by the generation of in vivo IgG response. Collectively, these findings will enrich the biomedical applications of SA-BA as a potent immune stimulating agent. Moreover, the macrophage stimulating efficacy of SA-BA might be an effective way in the cancer .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is found in different plant organs, both as a free aglycon and as glycosyl derivatives. A wide range of pharmacological activities has been described for this triterpenoid, including antiviral and antitumor effects. In addition, several other interesting properties have been identified in the fields of immunity and metabolism, namely antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Taken together, these latter three properties make  a highly interesting prospect for treating metabolic syndrome. The present review focuses on the therapeutic potential of this agent, along with several of its semisynthetic derivatives, which could open new frontiers in the use of natural product-based medicines.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28734166>Naturally occurring immunomodulators with antitumor activity: An insight on their mechanisms of action.</a></h1><p>Natural products with immunomodulatory activity are widely used in treatment of many diseases including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders in addition to cancer. They gained a great interest in the last decades as therapeutic agents since they provide inexpensive and less toxic products than the synthetic chemotherapeutic agents. Immunomodulators are the agents that have the ability to boost or suppress the host defense response that can be used as a prophylaxis as well as in combination with other therapeutic modalities. The anticancer activity of these immunomodulators is due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and induction of apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-metastasis effect. These natural immunomodulators such as genistein, curcumin, and resveratrol can be used as prophylaxis against the initiation of cancer besides the inhibition of tumor growth and proliferation. Whereas, immunostimulants can elicit and activate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the tumor that facilitate the recognition and destruction of the already existing tumor. This review represents the recent studies on various natural immunomodulators with antitumor effects. We have focused on the relationship between their anticancer activity and immunomodulatory mechanisms. The mechanisms of action of various immunomodulators such as polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, organosulfur compounds, capsaicin, vinca alkaloids, bromelain,  and zerumbone, the affected cancerous cell lines in addition to the targeted molecules and transcriptional pathways have been review and critically analyzed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Current treatment for  relies on conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating  with potentially less side effects.  (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on . The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action. A murine model of imiquimod-induced  was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4 and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4FoxP3 Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4 T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates  and inhibits Th17 development.Copyright © 2019.

Here we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of eight semi-synthetic amide derivatives of . Screening of derivatives BA1-BA8 led to the identification of compounds with superior immunomodulatory activity than BA on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. BA5, the most potent derivative, inhibited nitric oxide and TNFα production in a concentration-dependent manner, and decreased NF-κB activation in Raw 264.7 cells. Additionally, BA5 inhibited the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and the secretion of IL-2, IL-4 IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IFNɣ, in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with BA5 induces cell cycle arrest in pre-G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, BA5 also inhibited the activity of calcineurin, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the progression of cell cycle and T lymphocyte activation. BA5 has a synergistic inhibitory effect with dexamethasone on lymphoproliferation, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, we observed immunosuppressive effects of BA5 in vivo in mouse models of lethal endotoxemia and delayed type hypersensitivity. Our results reinforce the potential use of  and its derivatives in the search for potent immunomodulatory drugs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
