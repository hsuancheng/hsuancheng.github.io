Strain H4420N was cultured for 6 h in Luria-Bertani broth amended with individual fatty acids at 20 mmol/L, with pH adjusted to 7.0, 4.3, or 2.5. None of the fatty acids exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 7.0 (p >0.05). At pH 4.3, only capric, lauric, and linoleic acids reduced viability of H4420N (p < 0.05). At pH 2.5, oleic (C18:1) and  (C18:3) acids had modest effects on H4420N viability, whereas capric (C10:0), lauric (C12:0), and linoleic (C18:2) acids resulted in a reduction > or =5 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (p < 0.05). Capric and lauric acids were examined further at pH 2.5 over a range of concentrations (0.15-20 mmol/L). After 10 min of exposure, 5 log10 CFU/mL reductions (p < 0.05) were achieved by lauric  at 2.5 mmol/L and by capric  at 0.31 mmol/L.  stress increased the sensitivity of -tolerant E. coli O157:H7 strain H4420N to fatty acids. Including sources of these fatty acids in diets for cattle might impair the ability of this zoonotic pathogen to survive passage through the stomach, possibly reducing the potential for its  in the lower gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23980847>Functional textiles for atopic dermatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing inflammatory skin disease with a considerable social and economic burden. Functional textiles may have antimicrobial and antipruritic properties and have been used as complementary treatment in AD. We aimed to assess their effectiveness and safety in this setting. We carried out a systematic review of three large biomedical databases. GRADE approach was used to rate the levels of evidence and grade of recommendation. Meta-analyses of comparable studies were carried out. Thirteen studies (eight randomized controlled trials and five observational studies) met the eligibility criteria. Interventions were limited to silk (six studies), silver-coated cotton (five studies), borage oil, and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) fiber (one study each). Silver textiles were associated with improvement in SCORAD (2 of 4), fewer symptoms, a lower need for rescue medication (1 of 2), no difference in quality of life, decreased Staphyloccosus aureus  (2 of 3), and improvement of trans-epidermal water loss (1 of 2), with no safety concerns. Silk textile use was associated with improvement in SCORAD and symptoms (2 of 4), with no differences in quality of life or need for rescue medication. With borage oil use only skin erythema showed improvement, and with EVOH fiber, an improvement in eczema severity was reported. Recommendation for the use of functional textiles in AD treatment is weak, supported by low quality of evidence regarding effectiveness in AD symptoms and severity, with no evidence of hazardous consequences with their use. More studies with better methodology and longer follow-up are needed.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

After six months of growth, the rate of photosynthesis, carboxylation efficiency, transpiration and stomatal conductance in mycorrhizal (M) plants was significantly higher than that of non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants. The inoculation treatment increased the foliar P and Mg but not N. The amount of glycolipids in the leaves of M plants was significantly higher than that of NM plants. However, the amount of phospholipids in the leaves of M plants was not significantly different to that in the leaves of NM plants. Also, we observed a significant increase in the level of α- (C18:3ω3) in glycolipids of M plants. This work supports the view that increased glycolipids level in the leaves of M plants could be involved, at least in part, in the beneficial effects of mycorrhizal  on photosynthesis performance of olive trees. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of AM fungi on the amount of glycolipids in the leaves of mycorrhizal plants.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

In the first study, fresh perennial ryegrass was subjected to a range of sample preparation methods before incubation in the rumen for 2 or 7 h. In the second study, fresh perennial ryegrass was chopped into 1-cm lengths and incubated in polyester bags in the rumen for 2, 8, and 24 h. After removal of bags from the rumen, 4 different washing methods, ranging from manual squeezing to machine washing, were applied. Fatty acids were extracted from washed residues and determined, as methyl esters, by gas chromatography. The main odd-chain fatty acids (with the exception of anteiso C(15:0)) were not found in fresh grass and were useful markers of the effects of incubation time, sample preparation method, and washing method on microbial /contamination. The concentration of these and other odd-chain fatty acids increased with incubation time in both studies. The results indicate rapid and continued microbial  of freshly ingested forages, although patterns of odd-chain fatty acids did not reveal any further information about the types of bacteria-colonizing herbage. Principal component, biplot analysis provided a useful overall description of the processes of microbial  and degradation of plant fatty acids on fresh herbage incubated in the rumen. Bolus formation during mastication and ingestion results in extensive damage to herbage; none of the techniques (cutting, crushing, and drying/grinding) investigated in this work was able to replicate the effects of bolus formation in the animal. The study provided further evidence of loss of unfermented feed particles through polyester bag pores, especially when feeds are dried and ground. Biohydrogenation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids of fresh herbage was used principally by solid-associated bacteria to enable them to take up high levels of trans-11 C(18:1) and C(18:0) fatty acids. Although trans-11 C(18:1) was strongly associated with bacterial markers (odd- and branched-chain fatty acids), its precursor (cis-9, trans-11 C(18:2)) was not associated with bacterial variation, suggesting that its production in the rumen under these conditions was mainly extracellular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769519>Relationships Between Oleic and Linoleic  Content and Seed  by Cercospora kikuchii and Diaporthe phaseolorum.</a></h2><p>Compared with standard cultivars, seed of mid-oleic soybean genotypes sometimes have shown increased  by Cercospora kikuchii in the field as judged by increased levels of purple-stained seed. To examine relationships between oleic and linoleic  levels in soybean seed and postharvest seed  by two fungal seed pathogens, we inoculated seed with differing oleic:linoleic  (O/L) ratios. Seed with defined O/L ratios were produced by allowing seed development of two isogenic soybean lines to occur in three different air temperature environments. Seed produced in these environments were harvested, individually analyzed for fatty  composition, and inoculated with mycelium preparations of the fungal seed pathogens C. kikuchii or Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae. Fungal biomass of infected seed was quantified by measuring in vitro ergosterol content. For both soybean lines,  by C. kikuchii was positively correlated with the O/L ratio (r = 0.55, P < 0.03) and oleic  content (r = 0.61, P < 0.02), and negatively correlated with linoleic (r = -0.60, P < 0.02) and  (r = -0.58, P < 0.03)  content. No association was found between the extent of seed  by D. phaseolorum and the seed O/L ratio.

We analyzed a model system consisting of two yeasts with higher (Cryptococcus laurentii LS-28) or lower (Rhodotorula glutinis LS-11) antagonistic activity against the postharvest pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum. LS-28 exhibited faster and greater  of wounds than LS-11. In contrast to LS-28, the number of LS-11 cells dropped 1 and 2 h after application, and then increased only later. In vitro, LS-28 was more resistant to ROS-generated oxidative stress. The combined application of biocontrol yeasts and ROS-deactivating enzymes in apple wounds prevented the decrease in number of LS-11 cells mentioned above, and enhanced  and antagonistic activity of both biocontrol yeasts against B. cinerea and P. expansum. Polar lipids of LS-11 contained the more unsaturated and oxidizable , which was absent in LS-28. Resistance to oxidative stress could be a key mechanism of biocontrol yeasts antagonism against postharvest wound pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28421324>Weathering the storm: how lodgepole pine trees survive mountain pine beetle outbreaks.</a></h2><p>Recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks in western North America killed millions of lodgepole pine trees, leaving few survivors. However, the mechanism underlying the ability of trees to survive bark beetle outbreaks is unknown, but likely involve phytochemicals such as monoterpenes and fatty acids that can drive beetle aggregation and  on their hosts. Thus, we conducted a field survey of beetle-resistant lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees to retrospectively deduce whether these phytochemicals underlie their survival by comparing their chemistry to that of non-attacked trees in the same stands. We also compared beetle attack characteristics between resistant and beetle-killed trees. Beetle-killed trees had more beetle attacks and longer ovipositional galleries than resistant trees, which also lacked the larval establishment found in beetle-killed trees. Resistant trees contained high amounts of toxic and attraction-inhibitive compounds and low amounts of pheromone-precursor and synergist compounds. During beetle host aggregation and , these compounds likely served three critical roles in tree survival. First, low amounts of pheromone-precursor (α-pinene) and synergist (mycrene, terpinolene) compounds reduced or prevented beetles from attracting conspecifics to residual trees. Second, high amounts of 4-allyanisole further inhibited beetle attraction to its pheromone. Finally, high amounts of toxic limonene, 3-carene, 4-allyanisole, α-, and linoleic  inhibited beetle gallery establishment and oviposition. We conclude that the variation of chemotypic expression of local plant populations can have profound ecological consequences including survival during insect outbreaks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076886>Comparative study of the mycorrhizal root transcriptomes of wild and cultivated rice in response to the pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.</a></h2><p>Rice, which serves as a staple food for more than half of the world's population, is very susceptible to the pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. However, common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which is the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), has significant potential as a genetic source of resistance to M. oryzae. Recent studies have shown that the domestication of rice has altered its relationship to symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizae. A comparative response of wild and domestic rice inhabited by mycorrhizae to infection by M. oryzae has not been documented.In the current study, roots of wild and cultivated rice colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus intraradices were used to compare the transcriptomic responses of the two species to infection by M. oryzae. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the  of wild and cultivated rice with R. intraradices improved the resistance of both genotypes to M. oryzae. Wild AM rice, however, was more resistant to M. oryzae than the cultivated AM rice, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots of wild rice. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the mechanisms regulating the responses of wild and cultivated AM rice to M. oryzae invasion were significantly different. The expression of a greater number of genes was changed in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to the pathogen. Both wild and cultivated AM rice exhibited a shared response to M. oryzae which included genes related to the auxin and salicylic  pathways; all of these play important roles in pathogenesis-related protein synthesis. In wild AM rice, secondary metabolic and biotic stress-related analyses indicated that the jasmonic  synthesis-related α- pathway, the phenolic and terpenoid pathways, as well as the phenolic and terpenoid syntheses-related mevalonate (MVA) pathway were more affected by the pathogen. Genes related to these pathways were more significantly enriched in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to M. oryzae. On the other hand, genes associated with the 'brassinosteroid biosynthesis' were more enriched in cultivated AM rice.The AMF R. intraradices-colonized rice plants exhibited greater resistance to M. oryzae than non-AMF-colonized plants. The findings of the current study demonstrate the potential effects of crop domestication on the benefits received by the host via root  with AMF(s), and provide new information on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, results of this study can also help develop guidelines for the applications of AMF(s) when planting rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25422427>In vivo treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection with liposomal  reduces  and ameliorates inflammation.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori infection is marked by a vast prevalence and strong association with various gastric diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. Because of the rapid emergence of H. pylori strains resistant to existing antibiotics, current treatment regimens show a rapid decline of their eradication rates. Clearly, novel antibacterial strategies against H. pylori are urgently needed. Here, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic potential of liposomal  (LipoLLA) for the treatment of H. pylori infection. The LipoLLA formulation with a size of ∼ 100 nm was prone to fusion with bacterial membrane, thereby directly releasing a high dose of  acids into the bacterial membrane. LipoLLA penetrated the mucus layer of mouse stomach, and a significant portion of the administered LipoLLA was retained in the stomach lining up to 24 h after the oral administration. In vivo tests further confirmed that LipoLLA was able to kill H. pylori and reduce bacterial load in the mouse stomach. LipoLLA treatment was also shown to reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which were otherwise elevated because of the H. pylori infection. Finally, a toxicity test demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of LipoLLA to normal mouse stomach. Collectively, results from this study indicate that LipoLLA is a promising, effective, and safe therapeutic agent for the treatment of H. pylori infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521311>Biofunctional catheter coatings based on chitosan-fatty acids derivatives.</a></h2><p>Multifunctional and biofunctional coatings for medical devices are an attractive strategy towards tailoring the interactions of the device with the body, thereby influencing the host response, and the susceptibility to microbial . Here we describe the development of a coating process to yield amphiphilic, lubricious coatings, resistant to bacterial , based on chitosan. Chitosan-fatty  derivatives were obtained by simultaneous N,O-acylation of chitosan with either linoleic, α-, or dilinoleic . Chemical characterization of new materials was carried out using H NMR, FTIR, and XPS. Surface properties of coated polyester samples were studied using SEM and contact angle measurements, which indicated that the incorporation of hydrophobic constituents into chitosan macromolecules led to a decrease of both surface roughness and water contact angle. Importantly, tribological testing demonstrated that these new coatings decrease the coefficient of friction due to the self-organization of fatty  (from 0.53 for the neat chitosan to 0.35 for chitosan-fatty  derivative). Meanwhile, preliminary bacterial  tests indicated significant-over 80%-reduction in E. coli  following coating with chitosan-linoleic and chitosan-α- derivatives. Finally, cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility studies confirmed that all amphiphilic chitosan-fatty  derivatives were non-toxic and non-hemolytic. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of the developed coating strategy, particularly the chitosan-linoleic and chitosan-α- derivatives, for applications as biofunctional catheter coatings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Foc is a soil borne pathogen that causes rot of the roots or wilt of leaves by colonizing the xylem vessels. The dual RNA sequencing is used to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes of pathogen and host. This method greatly helps to understand the responses of pathogen and host to each other and discover the potential pathogenic mechanism.Plantlets of two economically important banana cultivars, Foc TR4 less susceptible cultivar NK and susceptible cultivar BX, were used to research the Foc-banana interaction mechanism. Notably, the infected NK had more significantly up-regulated genes on the respiration machinery including TCA cycle, glyoxylate, glycerol, and glycolysis compared to BX at 27 h post inoculation (hpi). In addition, genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, starch, sucrose,  and sphingolipid metabolisms were uniquely more greatly induced in BX than those in NK during the whole infection. Genes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of SA and JA were greatly induced in the infected NK; while auxin and abscisic  metabolisms related genes were strongly stimulated in the infected BX at 27 hpi. Furthermore, most of fungal genes were more highly expressed in the roots of BX than in those of NK. The fungal genes related to pathogenicity, pectin and chitin metabolism, reactive oxygen scavenging played the important roles during the infection of Foc. CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase 1) was verified to involve in cellulose utilization, oxidative stress response and pathogenicity of fungus.The transcriptome indicated that NK had much faster defense response against Foc TR4 than BX and the expression levels of fungal genes were higher in BX than those in NK. The metabolisms of carbon, nitrogen, and signal transduction molecular were differentially involved in pathogen infection in BX and NK. Additionally, the putative virulence associated fungal genes involved in , nutrition acquirement and transport provided more insights into the infection process of Foc TR4 in banana roots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797604>Lipid metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula.</a></h2><p>The peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, common to all eukaryotes, is mostly catalyzed by members of the lipoxygenase enzyme family of non-heme iron containing dioxygenases. Lipoxygenase products can be metabolized further in the oxylipin pathway by several groups of CYP74 enzymes. One prominent oxylipin is jasmonic  (JA), a product of the 13-allene oxide synthase branch of the pathway and known as signaling substance that plays a role in vegetative and propagative plant development as well as in plant responses to wounding and pathogen attack. In barley roots, JA level increases upon  by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Apart from this first result regarding JA, no information is available on the relevance of lipidperoxide metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Thus we analyzed fatty  and lipidperoxide patterns in roots of Medicago truncatula during mycorrhizal . Levels of fungus-specific fatty acids as well as palmitic  (16:0) and oleic  (18:1 n - 9) were increased in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the degree of arbuscular mycorrhizal  of roots can be estimated via analysis of fungal specific esterified fatty acids. Otherwise, no significant changes were found in the profiles of esterified and free fatty acids. The 9- and 13-LOX products of linoleic and  were present in all root samples, but did not show significant differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, except JA which showed elevated levels in mycorrhizal roots. In both types of roots levels of 13-LOX products were higher than those of 9-LOX products. In addition, three cDNAs encoding CYP74 enzymes, two 9/13-hydroperoxide lyases and a 13-allene oxide synthase, were isolated and characterized. The transcript accumulation of these three genes, however, was not increased in mycorrhizal roots of M. truncatula.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285661> and beneficial effects on annual ryegrass by mixed inoculation with plant growth promoting bacteria.</a></h2><p>Multi-strain inoculants have increased potential to accomplish a diversity of plant needs, mainly attributed to its multi-functionality. This work evaluated the ability of a mixture of three bacteria to colonize and induce a beneficial response on the pasture crop annual ryegrass. Pseudomonas G1Dc10 and Paenibacillus G3Ac9 were previously isolated from annual ryegrass and were selected for their ability to perform multiple functions related to plant growth promotion. Sphingomonas azotifigens DSMZ 18530 was included due to nitrogen fixing ability. The effects of the bacterial mixture were assessed in gnotobiotic plant inoculation assays and compared with single and dual inoculation treatments. Triple inoculation with 3×10 bacteria significantly increased plant dry weight and leaf pigments, indicating improved photosynthetic performance. Plant lipid biosynthesis was enhanced by 65%, mainly due to the rise of , an omega-3 fatty  with high dietary value. Electrolyte leakage, an indicator of plant membrane stability under stress, was decreased pointing to a beneficial effect by inoculation. Plants physiological condition was more favoured by triple inoculation than by single, although benefits on biomass were only evident relative to non-inoculated plants. The  behaviour and coexistence in plant tissues were assessed using FISH and GFP-labelling, combined with confocal microscopy and a cultivation-based approach for quantification. The three strains occupied the same sites, localizing preferentially along root hairs and in stem epidermis. Endophytic  was observed as bacteria entered root and stem inner tissues. This study reveals the potential of this mixture of strains for biofertilization, contributing to improve crop productivity and nutritional value.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The objective of the present study was to establish whether this association is causal. Forty patients with proven infection with H. pylori and endoscopic evidence of past or present duodenal ulcer disease were randomized to receive either polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA group), in the form of capsules and margarine, or a placebo (control). Both groups received concurrent H2 antagonist therapy. Efficacy of therapy was determined endoscopically by assessment of ulcer healing while H. pylori status was determined by antral biopsy, urease (EC 3.5.1.5) culture and histological assessment of the severity of H. pylori infection. Antral levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were quantified. Compliance was monitored. Before treatment, both groups were comparable for severity of H. pylori infection, smoking status and levels of LTB4 and PGE2. Despite a significant difference in consumption of linoleic  (19.9 (SE 1.6) g for PUFA group v. 6.7 (SE 0.8) g for controls (P < 0.01) and  (2.6 (SE 0.2) g v. 0.6 (SE 0.03) g (P < 0.01) there was no significant change in either the severity of H. pylori infection or prostaglandin levels in either group at 6 weeks. Consumption of a considerable amount of PUFA does not inhibit the  of the stomach by H. pylori nor does this alter the inflammatory changes characteristic of H. pylori gastritis. We conclude that the association between duodenal ulceration and a low level of dietary PUFA is likely to be spurious, probably reflecting the effect of confounding factors such as affluence, social class or smoking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26235221>Fungi associated with rocks of the Atacama Desert: taxonomy, distribution, diversity, ecology and bioprospection for bioactive compounds.</a></h2><p>This study assessed the diversity of cultivable rock-associated fungi from Atacama Desert.

Cladosporium halotolerans, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium cf. citrinum were the most frequent species, which occur at least in four different altitudes. The diversity and similarity indices ranged in the fungal communities across the latitudinal gradient. The Fisher-α index displayed the higher values for the fungal communities obtained from the siltstone and fine matrix of pyroclastic rocks with finer grain size, which are more degraded.

The extract of P. chrysogenum afforded the compounds α- and ergosterol endoperoxide, which were active against Cryptococcus neoformans and methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus respectively. Our study represents the first report of a new habitat of fungi associated with rocks of the Atacama Desert and indicated the presence of interesting fungal community, including species related with saprobes, parasite/pathogen and mycotoxigenic taxa.

However, girdling inhibits carbohydrate transport to the root in nearly all of the fruit development periods and consequently decreases root absorption. The mechanism through which carbohydrates regulate root development in arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) remains largely unknown. Carbohydrate content, AM , and transcriptome in the roots were analyzed to elucidate the interaction between host litchi and AM fungi when carbohydrate content decreases. Girdling decreased glucose, fructose, sucrose, quebrachitol, and starch contents in the litchi mycorrhizal roots, thereby reducing AM . RNA-seq achieved approximately 60 million reads of each sample, with an average length of reads reaching 100 bp. Assembly of all the reads of the 30 samples produced 671,316 transcripts and 381,429 unigenes, with average lengths of 780 and 643 bp, respectively. Litchi (54,100 unigenes) and AM fungi unigenes (33,120 unigenes) were achieved through sequence annotation during decreased carbohydrate content. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) showed that flavonoids, , and linoleic  are the main factors that regulate AM  in litchi. However, flavonoids may play a role in detecting the stage at which carbohydrate content decreases;  or linoleic  may affect AM formation under the adaptation process. Litchi trees stimulated the expression of defense-related genes and downregulated symbiosis signal-transduction genes to inhibit new AM . Moreover, transcription factors of the AP2, ERF, Myb, WRKY, bHLH families, and lectin genes altered maintenance of litchi mycorrhizal roots in the post-symbiotic stage for carbohydrate starvation. Similar to those of the litchi host, the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF subunit scon-3 and polyubiquitin of AM fungi were upregulated at the perceived stages. This occurrence suggested that ubiquitination plays an important role in perceiving carbohydrate decrease in AM fungi. The transcription of cytochrome b-245 and leucine-rich repeat was detected in the DEG database, implying that the transcripts were involved in AM fungal adaptation under carbohydrate starvation. The transcriptome data might suggest novel functions of unigenes in carbohydrate shortage of mycorrhizal roots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18227974>Fatty  unsaturation, mobilization, and regulation in the response of plants to stress.</a></h2><p>Stress acclimating plants respond to abiotic and biotic stress by remodeling membrane fluidity and by releasing  (18:3) from membrane lipids.
