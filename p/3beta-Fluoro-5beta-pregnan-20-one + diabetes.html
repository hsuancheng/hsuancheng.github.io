In this study, multi-region whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on early-stage PTC tumors (n = 257 tumor regions) from 79 individuals, including 17 who had developed relapse, to understand the temporal and spatial framework within which subclonal mutations catalyze tumor evolution and its potential clinical relevance. Paired primary-relapse tumor tissues were also available for a subset of individuals. The resulting catalog of variants was analyzed to explore evolutionary histories, define clonal and subclonal events, and assess the relationship between intra-tumor heterogeneity and relapse-free survival. The multi-region WES approach was key in correctly classifying subclonal mutations, 40% of which would have otherwise been erroneously considered clonal. We observed both linear and branching evolution patterns in our PTC cohort. A higher burden of subclonal mutations was significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. We conclude that relapse in PTC, while generally rare, does not follow a predictable evolutionary path and that subclonal mutation burden may serve as a prognostic factor. Larger studies utilizing multi-region sequencing in relapsed PTC case subjects with matching primary tissues are needed to confirm these observations.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

It is unclear whether those names are used for the same or different clinical phenotypes. Unclear terminology may lead to inappropriate treatment and an underestimation of the burden caused by atypical  phenotypes overlapping with classic types of . This review aimed to describe the terms used for atypical forms of  and to investigate whether the terms are used for similar or different phenotypes.PubMed and Scopus were searched for relevant publications in French or English available before 15 September 2015 using the terms: "Atypical ", "Malnutrition Related  (MRDM)", "Fibro-calculus pancreatic  (FCPD)", Protein deficient Pancreatic  (PDPD)", "African ", "Ketosis prone-type 2 ", "tropical ", "Flatbush ", "J-type ". Titles, abstracts screening and quality assessment were performed by two independent authors. Observational studies addressing atypical  in humans aged 14 years and above were included. One author extracted data from selected articles.22 articles among 350 identified articles were retained for data extraction. Two atypical  phenotypes were identified, each of them with a variety of names but similar definitions. One phenotype occurred in very thin people less than 30 years of age, typically from poor socio-economic backgrounds and requires insulin for life. It differs from type 1  in the tolerance of high blood glucose without ketosis in the absence of exogenous insulin. The second phenotype resembles type1  as it presents with ketosis at onset but responds well, as type2 , to oral hypoglycemic drugs after initial stabilization with insulin. It occurs in individuals who are usually over 30 years of age, with normal or overweight and absence of auto antibodies mainly found in type 1 .The scarce existing literature used various terms for similar  phenotypes. Agreement on nomenclature for the various forms of  using the above reported characteristics are needed in populations where atypical forms of  exist as well as better characterization of phenotypes and genotypes to inform evidence based treatment.Copyright © 2019 by the Journal of Global Health.

A 10-residue class G* peptide from apolipoprotein J (apoJ), namely, D-[113-122]apoJ, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. This prompted us to determine its effect on the aggregation process of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, an early event in the development of atherosclerosis. LDL particles with and without [113-122]apoJ peptide were incubated at 37 °C with sphingomyelinase (SMase) or were left to aggregate spontaneously at room temperature. The aggregation process was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), native gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE), absorbance at 405 nm, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). In addition, circular dichroism was used to determine changes in the secondary structure of apoB, and SDS-PAGE was performed to assess apoB degradation. At an equimolar ratio of [113-122]apoJ peptide to apoB-100, [113-122]apoJ inhibited both SMase-induced or spontaneous LDL aggregation. All methods showed that [113-122]apoJ retarded the progression of SMase-induced LDL aggregation at long incubation times. No effect of [113-122]apoJ on apoB secondary structure was observed. Binding experiments showed that [113-122]apoJ presents low affinity for native LDL but binds readily to LDL during the first stages of aggregation. Laurdan fluorescence experiments showed that mild aggregation of LDL resulted in looser lipid packaging, which was partially prevented by D-[113-122]apoJ. These results demonstrate that [113-122]apoJ peptide prevents SMase-induced LDL aggregation at an equimolar ratio and opens the possibility for the use of this peptide as a therapeutic tool.Copyright © 2019.

Currently, parents complete  education at the time of diagnosis. However, this format may not be sustainable as rates of T1D climb. The current study aimed to develop an online platform to provide educational material in the form of video micro-lectures using an iterative, user-centered, design process.In the first stage of development, parents of young children with T1D identified information they felt most important to their child's T1D care. In the second stage, healthcare providers contributed qualitative and quantitative feedback regarding the educational material and video mock-ups. The third stage involved parents of young children with T1D providing feedback on the completed video micro-lectures.Providers and parents reported that the videos were highly useful, important to T1D care, and the majority would recommend them to other parents.The iterative design process used by the research team incorporated multiple perspectives and ultimately developed educational resources that were well-received by providers, researchers, and parents.This study used an iterative, user-centered design to develop a series of web-based videos for parents of young children with type 1 . Primary stakeholders, both healthcare providers and parents, described videos as highly important, useful, enjoyable, and would recommend these resources to others.

In this regard, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) in South Texas is considered as one of the least investigated areas of the state with respect to HIV infection and HIV associated comorbidities. Considering the 115% increase in average HIV incidence rates per 100,000 within the RGV from 2007-2015, it is worth characterizing this population with respect to their HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and the association of treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Moreover, the increased rate of Type-2  (T2D) in the RGV population is intertwined with that of HIV-1 infection facing challenges from lack of knowledge about prevention to inadequate access to healthcare.

The loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells, in patients with type 1 and type 2  respectively, put these cells at the center of the disease initiation and progression. Therefore, major efforts have been taken to restore the β-cell mass by cell-replacement or regeneration approaches. Implementing novel therapies requires deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate β-cells and determine the acquisition of their physiological phenotype. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the postnatal maturation of β-cells and define their functional identity. Furthermore, we discuss different routes by which β-cells lose their features and functionality in type 1 and 2 diabetic conditions. We then focus on potential mechanisms to restore the functionality of those β-cell populations that have lost their functional phenotype. Finally, we discuss the recent progress and remaining challenges facing the generation of functional mature β-cells from stem cells for cell-replacement therapy for  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663293>Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent girls.</a></h2><p>PCOS is already a prevalent endocrinopathy in adolescent girls, and its prevalence is rising further since, in essence, it is the result of a mismatch between an energy-sparing (epi)genetic background and a (relatively) obesogenic environment. This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone (to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT thereby raising energy expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663720>Rational design of a rigid fluorophore-molecular rotor-based probe for high signal-to-background ratio detection of sulfur dioxide in viscous system.</a></h2><p>Many viscous microenvironments exist in living systems. For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in , hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.5-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in mitochondria and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as , and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive oxygen species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of -associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole-2-imine (5) and 1,3-thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds 5 and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco-2 cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019.

Patients who received contrast were compared with unexposed controls before and after propensity score (PS) matching derived from baseline characteristics, admission diagnoses, comorbidities and severity of illness. AKI, defined as initial onset (stage 1) or increased severity, was determined from serum creatinine according to KDIGO guidelines.Based on 2,306 PS-matched pairs obtained from 2,557 cases that received intravenous contrast and 4,776 unexposed controls, the increase in AKI attributable to contrast was 1.3% (19.3 vs. 18.0%, p=0.273) and no association was found between contrast and the pattern of onset and recovery. Hospital mortality increased by 14.3% subsequent to AKI (18.0 vs. 3.6, p<0.001) but the risk ratio in relation to patients with stable AKI did not vary when stratified by contrast. Multivariable regression identified sepsis, metabolic disorders, , history of renal disease, and severity of illness as factors more strongly associated with AKI.In critically ill adults with normal kidney function, low osmolar radiocontrast media did not substantively increase AKI. Rather than limiting the use of contrast in ICU patients, efforts to prevent AKI should focus on the susceptibility of patients with sepsis,  complications, high APACHE score, or a history of renal disease.Copyright © 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

Previous studies have found that high-glucose environments can aggravate BP-induced DNA damage in nerve cells. Ku70 is subunit of the DNA damage repair enzyme DNA-PK. This study was designed to determine whether high-glucose conditions enhance BP neurotoxicity and DNA damage by inhibiting Ku70 expression.We examined the effect of BP on apoptosis and DNA damage in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons under hyperglycaemic conditions. Untreated DRG cells and DRG cells pretreated with NU7441, a DNA-PK inhibitor, were cultured for 3 days under normal culture conditions or with 50 mM glucose, and the cells were then treated with BP for 3 h. DNA damage was investigated via comet assays, the ratio of early to late apoptotic cells was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assays. The protein expression levels of DNA-PK, Ku70, Bax, Bcl-2 and γH2ax were measured by immunofluorescence or Western blotting.Compared to its effect under normal culture conditions, BP treatment led to decreased cell viability and increased DNA damage in DRG cells grown under high-glucose conditions. The rate of DRG cell apoptosis and the expression of γH2ax, the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 also increased under the high-glucose conditions. Furthermore, Ku70 expression was inhibited. The DNA-PK inhibitor, NU7441, could significantly inhibit DNA-PK and Ku70 expression, simultaneously further aggravating BP-induced apoptosis and DNA damage under high-glucose conditions.These data indicate that hyperglycaemia may enhance BP-induced neurotoxicity and DNA damage by inhibiting the DNA repair protein Ku70.Copyright © 2019.

In case 1, 15 mg suvorexant was initiated to manage nocturnal delirium refractory to antipsychotics, antidepressants, and a Japanese herbal medicine, resulting in immediate sleep improvement. However, treatment discontinuation led to recurrence of symptoms, which were reversed by recommencing suvorexant. In case 2, as antipsychotics used for the treatment of nocturnal delirium were ineffective, 15 mg suvorexant was administered. The patient achieved rapid improvement in sleep.

Accumulating data suggest excessive oxidative stress contributes to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in cardiovascular-related diseases. Excessive oxidative stress is also a primary underlying mechanism for the development and progression of T2DM. However, whether oxidative stress plays a role in mediating the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T2DM is not known. Therefore, this review explores the potential role of oxidative stress leading to increased activation of the afferent arm of the exercise pressor reflex. Several lines of evidence support direct and indirect effects of oxidative stress on the exercise pressor reflex. For example, intramuscular ROS may directly and indirectly (by attenuating contracting muscle blood flow) increase group III and IV afferent activity. Oxidative stress is a primary underlying mechanism for the development of neuropathic pain, which in turn is associated with increased group III and IV afferent activity. These are the same type of afferents that evoke muscle pain and the exercise pressor reflex. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced release of inflammatory mediators may modulate afferent activity. Collectively, these alterations may result in a positive feedback loop that further amplifies the exercise pressor reflex. An exaggerated reflex increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, identifying the contribution of oxidative stress could provide a potential therapeutic target to reduce this risk in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671906>Antioxidant, Xanthine Oxidase, α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities of Bioactive Compounds from  L.

Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility.

This scale showed adequate psychometric properties; higher knowledge scores were reached in women who already heard about the disease and had a formal education. As a result, the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions.The primary objective of this study was to describe the construction of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale (LOKS) and assess its psychometric properties in a representative sample of Lebanese women aged 40 years and above. Secondary objectives were to explore factors associated with this knowledge score.A cross-sectional study carried out between March and June 2018, enrolled 560 women over the age of 40 years living in the community. This proportionate sample was randomly selected from all Lebanese governorates to cover the entire Lebanese area. A survey was developed and adapted to the Lebanese population based on preexisting scales. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data.The items of the LOKS were distributed across seven factors with an Eigenvalue over 1 solution, outlining an overall value of 55.89% of the variance.

ATH generally initiates during the childhood, occurring as a result of a number of changes in the intima tunica and in the media of arteries. A key event occurring during the pathobiology of ATH is the accumulation of lipoproteins in the sub-intimal spaces mediated by extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, especially by the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) -containing proteoglycans (CS/DSPGs). Among them, the proteoglycan biglycan (BGN) is critically involved in the onset and progression of ATH and evidences show that BGN represents the missing link between the pro-atherogenic status induced by both traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the development and progression of vascular damage. In the light of these findings, the role of BGN in dyslipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, , chronic kidney disease and inflammatory status is briefly analyzed and discussed in order to shed new light on the underlying mechanisms governing the association between BGN and ATH.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, 414 Emirati patients with RA were evaluated over a 3-year period from April 2015 to April 2018. All patients fulfilled the 2010 RA ACR/EULAR criteria and were assessed for demographic and clinical characteristics. The estimated RA prevalence rate in our population cohort was 2.72%. Females showed predominance (80%) with a higher body mass index (31.4 ± 6.61,  = 0.0001) compared to males (28.8 ± 6.03,  = 0.0001). The most frequent comorbidity observed was dyslipidemia (43.5%) followed by hypertension (37.9%),  (34.5%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (33.1%). Xerophthalmia was the most frequent extra-articular manifestation. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide were detected in 63.3% and 41.5% patients, respectively, while both were present in 33.3% of patients. Methotrexate, adalimumab, and rituximab were the most frequently prescribed disease modifying agents. In this study, we describe disease features that are unique to United Arab Emirates (UAE) patients and demonstrate that RA has a significant disease burden. Our findings highlight the need for a RA national registry to improve the quality of care of these patients in UAE.Copyright © 2019 Rajaie Namas et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673888>The protective effect of quercetin in the alcohol-induced liver and lymphoid tissue injuries in newborns.</a></h2><p>Recently published experimental and clinical studies indicate that oxidative stress leads to the pathogenesis and progression of alcohol-induced tissue injuries. Quercetin is a type of flavonoid compound that influences antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities have protective and therapeutic effects for treating various diseases including  and neuro-degenerative diseases. In this study, fetal alcohol syndrome was tested in rat models, with the aim of verifying the protective effect of quercetin in preventing alcohol-induced liver and lymphoid tissue (thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes) injuries on the 21st day for the offspring of alcohol treated mother rats. The pregnant rats were randomly assigned into four groups. The control group (C) (n = 3) of pregnant rats received only physiological saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) throughout the pregnancy (1 to 21 days gestation) and during lactation until postnatal day 21. The quercetin positive control group (QT) of pregnant rats (n = 3) received quercetin at 50 mg/kg/days i.p. for the same period. The ethanol treatment group (E) (n = 3) of pregnant rats received 1 ml/day of 40% v/v ethanol (4 g/kg) intragastrically (i.g) for the same period. The model group of pregnant rats (EQ) received ethanol + quercetin (n = 3) with a dose of 1 ml/day of v/v ethanol (4 g/kg i.g.) and quercetin at 50 mg/kg body weight per day i.p. for the same period. Ten offspring were used in each of the C, QT, E and EQ groups. Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PC) and chemiluminescence levels (CL) in liver and lymphoid tissues significantly increased in group E versus the C group (P < 0.05-P < 0.001) whereas glutathione levels (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities significantly decreased in group E compared to the C group (P < 0.05-< 0.001). However, tissue MDA, PC, and CL levels decreased in the EQ group compared to group E. GSH level, GP, GR, SOD, and CAT activity were significantly increased by quercetin (P < 0.05-P < 0.001). The plasma TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and NF-κB activation significantly increased in group E compared to the C and QT groups, but IL-10 significantly decreased in group E compared to the C and QT groups. The TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and NF-κB activation significantly decreased in group EQ compared to group E. In conclusion, quercetin has a protective effect against maternal alcohol-induced oxidative and inflammatory damage in the liver and lymphoid tissues of newborn rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663866>Passive versus Mentally Active Sedentary Behaviors and Depression.</a></h2><p>Detrimental associations of sedentary behaviors with depression have been identified, but findings are inconsistent.

Analysis of hospital malnutrition according to CIPA screening and association with the clinical outcomes of median length of stay, mortality and early readmission. Concordance between both screening methods by Kappa Index (κ), sensitivity (S) and specificity (SP).A total of 226 patients were analysed. The prevalence of malnutrition or risk of malnutrition was identified by CIPA in 35.40% and by SGA in 30.08%. CIPA is capable of detecting patients at a greater risk of mortality during hospitalization (5% vs. 0%, P=.006), unlike the SGA (2.94% vs. 1.27%, P=.385). CIPA also detected patients with higher median length of stay (21 days [IQR 14-34 days] vs. 14.5 days [IQR 9-27 days], P=.002) and rate of early readmissions (25.3% vs. 8.2%, P<.001). S and SP of CIPA vs. SGA was 70.59% and 79.75%, respectively; Kappa index was 0.479 (P<.001).Using CIPA nutritional screening, the prevalence and risk of malnutrition in surgical patients is high, and they present poorer clinical outcomes, making CIPA valid and effective in this type of patients.Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2  and obesity traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

The model was calibrated using a literature review and meta-analyses. The DM-on-TB impact was analyzed using population attributable fraction metrics. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by accommodating less conservative effect sizes for the TB-DM interactions, by factoring the age-dependence of the TB-DM association, and by assuming different TB disease incidence rate trajectories.In 1990, 11.4% (95% uncertainty interval (UI) = 6.3%-14.4%) of new TB disease incident cases were attributed to DM. This proportion increased to 21.9% (95% UI = 12.1%-26.4%) in 2017, and 33.3% (95% UI = 19.0%-44.1%) in 2050. Similarly, in 1990, 14.5% (95% UI = 9.5%-18.2%) of TB-related deaths were attributed to DM. This proportion increased to 28.9% (95% UI = 18.9%-34.1%) in 2017, and 42.8% (95% UI = 28.7%-53.1%) in 2050. The largest impacts originated from the effects of DM on TB disease progression and infectiousness. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the impact could be even greater.The burgeoning DM epidemic is predicted to become a leading driver of TB disease incidence and mortality over the coming decades. By 2050, at least one-third of TB incidence and almost half of TB mortality in India will be attributed to DM. This is likely generalizable to other Asian Pacific countries with similar TB-DM burdens. Targeting the impact of the increasing DM burden on TB control is critical to achieving the goal of TB elimination by 2050.Copyright © 2019 by the Journal of Global Health.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with . The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670165>Effects of walking speeds and durations on plantar skin blood flow responses.</a></h2><p>Various walking speeds and durations in daily life cause different levels of ischemia of plantar tissues. It is unclear what walking speeds and durations significantly affect plantar tissue viability and risks for foot ulcers in non-diabetics and diabetics.The aim of this study was to establish the normal response of plantar skin blood flow to different speeds and durations of walking exercise in non-diabetics that would be needed to quantify impaired responses in diabetics.Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure plantar skin blood flow of the first metatarsal head in 12 non-diabetics. A 3 × 2 factorial design, including 3 speeds (slow at 3 km/h, moderate at 6 km/h, and fast at 9 km/h) and 2 durations (10 and 20 min), was used in this study. Skin blood flow after walking was expressed as a ratio of skin blood flow before walking. The 3 × 2 two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (5.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (2.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between walking speeds and durations (p > 0.05).Our results provide the first evidence that walking speeds affect plantar skin blood flow and a fast walking speed (9 km/h) significantly increases plantar skin blood flow compared to moderate (6 km/h) and slow (3 km/h) walking speeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0.2 [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased lipid availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663469>Effects of pterostilbene on , liver steatosis and serum lipids.</a></h2><p>Pterostilbene, a phenolic compound derived from resveratrol, possesses greater bioavailability than its parent compound due to the presence of two methoxyl groups. In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on , liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 , insulin resistance and type 2  in animal models. Concerning type 1 , the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 , increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662777>GC-MS Analysis and Inhibitory Evaluation of  Leaf Extracts on Major Enzymes Linked to .</a></h2><p> leaves are used in managing both  and its complications in Southwest Nigeria.

The study also identified some bioactive compounds as well as their molecular interaction in the binding pocket of these enzymes. Standard enzyme inhibition and kinetics assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effects of aqueous extract (TCA) and ethanol extract (TCE) of  leaves on -glucosidase and -amylase activities. The phytoconstituents of TCA and TCE were determined using GC-MS. Molecular docking of the phytocompounds was performed using Autodock Vina. TCA and TCE were the most potent inhibitors of -glucosidase (IC = 3.28 ± 0.47 mg/mL) and -amylase (IC = 0.24 ± 0.08 mg/mL), respectively. Both extracts displayed a mixed mode of inhibition on -amylase activity, while mixed and noncompetitive modes of inhibition were demonstrated by TCA and TCE, respectively, on -glucosidase activity. The GC-MS analytic chromatogram revealed the presence of 24 and 22 compounds in TCE and TCA, respectively, which were identified mainly as phenolic compounds, terpenes/terpenoids, fatty acids, and other phytochemicals. The selected compounds exhibited favourable interactions with the enzymes compared with acarbose. Overall, the inhibitory effect of  on -amylase and -glucosidase may be ascribed to the synergistic action of its rich phenolic and terpene composition giving credence to the hypoglycaemic nature of  leaves.Copyright © 2019 Franklyn Nonso Iheagwam et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669187>A Longitudinal Study on the Association Between Diabetic Foot Disease and Health-Related Quality of Life in Adults With Type 2 .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the association between diabetic foot disease and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during a 2-year follow up among people with type 2  in Alberta.A type 2  cohort was established (2011‒2013); those with self-reported diabetic foot disease were identified.

Although whole-body glucose clearance is normal, one-month-old lambs with IUGR at birth have higher rates of hindlimb glucose uptake, which may compensate for myocyte deficiencies in glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in IUGR lambs is due to lower intra-islet insulin availability and not from glucose sensing. We investigated adrenergic receptor (ADR) β2 desensitization by administering oral ADRβ modifiers for the first month after birth to activate ADRβ2 and antagonize ADRβ1/3. In IUGR lambs ADRβ2 activation increased whole-body glucose utilization rates and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on isolated islet or myocyte deficiencies. IUGR establishes risk for developing . In IUGR lambs we identified disparities in key aspects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, providing new insights into potential mechanisms for this risk.Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and disturbances in glucose homeostasis with associated β-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ) desensitization. Our objectives were to measure insulin-sensitive glucose metabolism in neonatal lambs with IUGR and to determine whether daily treatment with ADRβ2 agonist and ADRβ1/β3 antagonists for one month normalizes their glucose metabolism. Growth, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and glucose utilization rates (GUR) were measured in control lambs, IUGR lambs, and IUGR lambs treated with β2-agonist clenbuterol, β1-antagonist atenolol, and β3-antagonist SR59230A (IUGR-AR). In IUGR lambs, islet insulin content and GSIS were less than in controls; however, insulin sensitivity and whole-body GUR were not different from controls. Of importance, ADRβ2 stimulation with β1/β3 inhibition increases both insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose utilization in IUGR lambs. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs, hindlimb GUR were greater but fractional glucose oxidation rates and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation rates were lower than controls. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was lower in IUGR and IUGR-AR skeletal muscle than in controls but GLUT1 was greater in IUGR-AR. ADRβ2, insulin receptor, glycogen content, and citrate synthase activity were similar among groups. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs heart rates were greater, which was independent of cardiac ADRβ1 activation. We conclude that targeted ADRβ2 stimulation improved whole-body insulin sensitivity but minimally affected defects in GSIS and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation. We show that risk factors for developing  are independent of postnatal catch-up growth in IUGR lambs as early as one-month of age and are inherent to the islets and myocytes.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular metabolic phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and ) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

At this study beginning and the end, the receptor expression for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and glyoxalase I (GLO1) enzyme from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and AGEs and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) serum levels were measured by the use of real-time PCR and ELISA methods, respectively.This study results demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation could down-regulate RAGE mRNA [fold change = 0.72 in vitamin D vs. 0.95 in placebo) P = 0.001)]. In addition, no significant changes were observed for GLO1 enzyme expression (P = 0.06). This study results also indicated that vitamin D serum level significantly increased in vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Moreover, AGES and TNF-α serum levels significantly reduced in vitamin D group, but they were remained unchanged in the placebo group.In conclusion, vascular complications are more frequent in diabetic patients, and vitamin D treatment may prevent or delay the complications onset in these patients by AGEs serum level and RAGE gene expression reducing. .

We hypothesize that notable differences exist between claims-based and prospectively collected clinical registries.We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a prospective surgical outcomes database, and PearlDiver (PD), a claims-based private insurance database, for patients undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasties from 2007 to 2016. Comorbidities and 30-day complications were compared. Multiple regression analysis was performed for each cohort to identify notable contributors to 30-day revision surgery.Significant differences were observed in demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative complications for the age-matched groups between PD and NSQIP (P < 0.05 for all). Multiple regression analysis in PD identified morbid obesity and dyspnea to lead to an increased risk for revision surgery (P = 0.001) in the <65 cohort and dyspnea and  to lead to an increased risk for revision surgery in the ≥65 cohort (P = 0.015, P < 0.001). Multiple regression did not reveal any risk factors for revision surgery in the <65 age group for the NSQIP; however, congestive heart failure was found to have an increased risk for revision surgery in the ≥65 cohort (P < 0.001).Notable differences in comorbidities and complications for patients undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty were present between PD and NSQIP.Retrospective cohort study, level III.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662399>Cross-sectional study of the health of southern African truck drivers.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle and working conditions of truck drivers predisposes them to risk-factors associated with communicable and non-communicable diseases, but little is known about the health status of African truck driver. This study aims to assess a cross-section of truckers in South Africa to describe their health information.The study took place across three truck-stop rest areas in the South African provinces of Free State and Gauteng.Eligibility criteria included being males aged 18 years and older, full-time employment as a long-distance truck driver. A total of 614 male truck drivers participated; 384 (63%) were Zimbabwean and 325 (55%) completed high-school.The trucker survey explored demographics; working conditions; sexual, eating and sleeping behaviours; mental health status, medical history and cardiac risk-factors. Medical assessments included physical measurements, glucose and lipid measurements, ECG, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cardiac ultrasound.In the previous month, 554 (91%) participants were sexually active; 522 (86%) had sex with a regular partner; 174 (27%) with a casual partner; 87 (14%) with a sex worker. Average time driving was 10 hours/day, 20 days/month, 302 (50%) never worked night shifts and 74 (12%) worked nights approximately four times per week. 112 (18%) experienced daytime sleepiness and 59 (10%) were ever hospitalised from an accident. Forty-seven (8%, 95% CI 5.3 to 9.5) were HIV-positive, with half taking antiretrovirals. Forty-eight (8%) truckers had some moderate depression, while 21 (4%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Reported tuberculosis, myocardial infarction, and  were <3%. Prominent cardiac risk-factors included smoking (n=63, 11%), consuming alcohol (>15 drinks/week) (n=54, 9%), overweight/obesity (n=417, 69%), and hypertension (n=220, 36%,95% CI 32.1 to 39.7). ECG results showed 23 (4.9%) and 29 (5.3%) drivers had left ventricular hypertrophy using the Cornell criterion and product, respectively. CIMT measurements indicated nine (4.2%) drivers had a carotid atherosclerotic plaque.This first holistic assessment of health among southern African male truck drivers demonstrates substantial addressable cardiovascular risk factors, mental health issues and sexual risk behaviours.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (F) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that F is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: F equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of F are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in F is independent of all environmental confounding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669757>The evolutionary hypothesis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</a></h2><p>Human otoliths, primarily formed from salts of calcium and carbonate, are different from bones of the skeleton, which are composed of calcium phosphate. The echinoderms, which share the earliest common ancestor with us, began to protect the body by making an endoskeleton out of calcium and carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea. In subsequent vertebrates, aerobic respiration supported strong muscle activity, but an occasional shortage of oxygen led to low pH due to the accumulation of lactate produced by anaerobic respiration, increasing the risk of melting bones composed of calcium carbonate. So, all vertebrates used calcium phosphate to increase bone strength, having a stronger ionic bonding than calcium carbonate. But otoliths, which are in the inner ear and thereby not connected to muscles, still use calcium carbonate. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which otoliths detached from the utricle enter the semicircular canals and cause a sense of rotation. Otoliths, the calcium carbonate ear bones retaining a long evolutionary history, can be easily broken at low pH. During sleep, shallow breathing produces mild respiratory acidosis and low pH in the blood. Since otoliths are corroded at low pH during nighttime, BPPV occurs frequently in the morning. In addition,  or gout often decreases pH in the blood and increases the occurrence of BPPV.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical and genetic aspects of HeFH patients with T2DM in the dyslipidemia registry of the Spanish Arteriosclerosis Society.HeFH patients were classified according to the presence or absence of T2DM. The clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of the 2 groups were compared.Of the 2301 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia included in the registry, 1724 with a probable or definite diagnosis according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score were finally included. HeFH patients with T2DM had a higher rate of CVD and a less favorable lipid profile, with higher total cholesterol (366.9±86.7mg/dL vs 342.0±74.7mg/dL; mean difference 24.894; 95%CI, 5.840-43.949) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (316.9±87.8mg/dL vs 286.4±75.4mg/dL; mean difference 30.500; 95%CI, 11.211-49.790) levels. No significant differences were found between the groups concerning the specific type of HeFH-causing mutation (P=.720). After adjustment for major risk factors, logistic regression analysis confirmed a relationship between T2DM and the presence of CVD (OR, 2.01; 95%CI, 1.18-3.43; P=.010).HeFH patients with T2DM have a higher rate of CVD and a less favorable lipid profile, regardless of genetic mutation type. In these patients, T2DM is associated with the presence of CVD.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, through a combination of exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping, we have identified 16 individuals (from seven unrelated families) with ultra-rare homozygous missense variants in NTNG2; these individuals present with shared features of a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of global developmental delay, severe to profound intellectual disability, muscle weakness and abnormal tone, autistic features, behavioral abnormalities, and variable dysmorphisms. The variants disrupt highly conserved residues across the protein. Functional experiments, including in silico analysis of the protein structure, in vitro assessment of cell surface expression, and in vitro knockdown, revealed potential mechanisms of pathogenicity of the variants, including loss of protein function and decreased neurite outgrowth. Our data indicate that appropriate expression of NTNG2 plays an important role in neurotypical development.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Concentrated growth factor (CGF) obtained from the autologous venous blood of patients via fractional centrifugation is employed for producing a CGF gel or membrane that can be applied to expedite self-regeneration of skin wounds. In this case report, we presented the results from 18 patients with chronic skin wounds treated with a CGF gel or membrane produced from autologous venous blood. Noticeable granulation tissue and regenerated epidermal coverage were observed in 16 patients who received CGF treatment over various time courses, thereby demonstrating the significant therapeutic effects of CGF treatment in overall wound healing. The other two patients with stasis ulcers in their calves failed to respond to the treatment because of the comorbidity of iliac vein thrombosis. In addition, by culturing HaCaT keratinocytes using CGF membrane as the foundation, we observed that HaCaT cells attached to the CGF membrane migrated and proliferated to form an epithelium-like structure. Comprehensively, the clinical results infer that CGF gel can expedite the regeneration of the soft tissue at the wound, whereas CGF membrane may facilitate its marginal re-epithelialisation. The combination of the two can promote autologous regeneration of both deep and superficial wounds effectively and safely.© 2019 Medicalhelplines.com Inc and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665233>δ-related Biomarkers Attenuate Multiple AD Conversion Risks and Offer Targets for Intervention.</a></h2><p>We tested certain serum proteins' ability to mediate the effects of demographic variables on prospective 5yr conversion to clinical "Alzheimer's Disease" (AD) from non-demented states [i.e., Normal Control (NC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)]. The proteins were rationally selected from among previously published mediators of those same variables' associations with the latent variable "δ", a novel omnibus dementia severity metric.Each protein's attenuation of its risk factor's independent association with conversion was confirmed by logistic regression, adjusted for education, ethnicity, self-reported  and hypertension, among N = 772 initially non-demented Mexican-American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants in the Texas Alzheimer`s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC).n = 70 non-demented participants at baseline converted to "AD" (9.1%) after a mean follow-up of 5.4 yrs. Age >80yrs (OR = 3.1), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS30) > 10/30 (OR = 2.3), female gender (OR = 2.2) and the presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele (OR = 2.4) were independently associated with prospective conversion. These effects were fully attenuated by five serum proteins: AGE: Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 2 (IGF-BP2), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1 (EGFR); Depression: Resistin; Gender: Thrombopoeitin (THPO); APOE: C-Reactive Protein (CRP).Clinical dementia arises from the sum of independent δ-related processes.

Methods and Results The targeted carotid files from the prospective NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) registry (2011-2013) comprised the derivation population. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of a 30-day adverse event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death), the effect estimates of which were used to build a weighted predictive scale that was validated using the 2014 to 2015 NSQIP registry release. A total of 10 766 and 8002 patients were included in the derivation and the validation populations, in whom 4.0% and 3.7% developed an adverse event, respectively. The NSQIP registry CEA scale included 14 variables; the highest points were allocated for insulin-dependent , high-risk cardiac physiological characteristics, admission source other than home, an emergent operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification IV to V, modified Rankin Scale score ≥2, and presentation with a stroke. NSQIP registry CEA score was predictive of an adverse event (concordance=0.67), stroke or death (concordance=0.69), mortality (concordance=0.76), an extended hospitalization (concordance=0.73), and a nonroutine discharge (concordance=0.83) in the validation population, as well as among symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups (<0.001). In the validation population, patients with an NSQIP registry CEA scale score >8 and 17 had 30-day stroke or death rates >3% and 6%, the recommended thresholds for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusions The NSQIP registry CEA scale predicts adverse outcomes after CEA and can risk stratify patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis using different thresholds for each population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671732>Advances in Research on  by Human Nutriomics.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of  (DM) have increased rapidly worldwide over the last two decades.

Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis, liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662362>Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in rural South India: cohort study.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) accounted for one-third of the deaths in India.

We did baseline (2005-2007) and two follow-up surveys in 2008-2009 and 2013-2015. Risk factors studied were tobacco, alcohol, hypertension, self-reported  and central obesity.Outcome measures were fatal or non-fatal ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular event. We estimated HRs for the risk factors and population attributable fraction (PAF).We followed up 5641 (94.4%) subjects, and follow-up duration was 33 371 person years. The overall incidence of cardiovascular event or death was 4.6 per 1000 person years. Current smoking (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and hypertension (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.4) were the risk factors among men and accounted for 47% of the PAF.

Correlation analysis and 10-fold cross-validation were used to compare the CKD-EPI equation and the new approximating equations to the measured aGFR. Ability to detect hyperfiltration, defined as aGFR > 120 ml/min/1.73m, was compared by analysis of receiver-operating (ROC) curves.aGFR was measured 2798 times in 269 individuals. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), age, and serum creatinine (SCR) were significantly associated with aGFR. The best equations for approximating aGFR used HbA1c and FPG in addition to age and SCR. They approximate aGFR in this cohort of obese people with T2DM more precisely than the CKD-EPI equation. Analysis of ROC curves show that these equations detect hyperfiltration better than does the CKD-EPI equation.HbA FPG, age, and SCR yielded the best equations for estimating aGFR in these subjects. The new equations identify hyperfiltration better than the CKD-EPI equation in this cohort and may inform clinical decisions regarding hyperfiltration in individuals with T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663914>A Novel Machine Learning Model Developed to Assist in Patient Selection for Outpatient Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.</a></h2><p>Patient selection for outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is important to optimizing patient outcomes. This study aims to develop a machine learning tool that may aid in patient selection for outpatient total should arthroplasty based on medical comorbidities and demographic factors.Patients undergoing elective TSA from 2011 to 2016 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were queried. A random forest machine learning model was used to predict which patients had a length of stay of 1 day or less (short stay). A multivariable logistic regression was then used to identify which variables were significantly correlated with a short or long stay.From 2011 to 2016, 4,500 patients were identified as having undergone elective TSA and having the necessary predictive features and outcomes recorded. The machine learning model was able to successfully identify short stay patients, producing an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.77. The multivariate logistic regression identified numerous variables associated with a short stay including age less than 70 years and male sex as well as variables associated with a longer stay including , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than 2.Machine learning may be used to predict which patients are suitable candidates for short stay or outpatient TSA based on their medical comorbidities and demographic profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670029>PAPP-A activity is increased in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and correlates with peripheral nerve impairment.</a></h2><p>Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have neuroprotective effects. IGF activity is partly controlled by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), an enzyme which enhances IGF-action by cleavage of IGF-binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4). To study the role of PAPP-A and the IGF system in diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), we measured immunoreactive (total) concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II, bioactive IGF by cell-based bioassay, PAPP-A, as well as intact and PAPP-A-cleaved IGFBP-4 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with type 2  (T2D) with and without DPN.Twenty-three patients with T2D were included. Based on clinical examination, vibratory perception thresholds and nerve conduction studies, patients were diagnosed with (n = 9) or without (n = 14) DPN.In CSF, PAPP-A activity, as estimated by IGFBP-4 fragment levels, was higher in patients with than without DPN (34.57 vs 13.79 μg/L, p = .003) and concentrations correlated with peripheral nerve impairment measures (r = 0.73, p < .01). Furthermore, serum bioactive IGF was lower in patients with than without DPN (0.8 vs 1.3 μg/L, p = .006) and correlated inversely to the severity of DPN (r = -0.67, p < .01).In both CSF and serum, members of the IGF system correlated with measures of peripheral nerve impairment in patients with T2D. This supports a relationship between the IGF system and the development of DPN. Further studies are needed to clarify if these changes are causally linked to the pathogenesis of DPN.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At optimum N/P ration (15:1), the loading efficiency can reach over 90%. CTH-antagomiR-133a/b showed no cytotoxicity to BMSCs and diminished miR133a and miR133b expression in BMSCs. Furthermore, chitosan-based sustained delivery system can continuous dose CTH-antagomiR-133a/b and calcium deposition and osteogenic specific gene expression were enhanced in vitro. The new bone formation was enhanced after the sustained delivery system containing CTH-antagomiR-133a/b nanoparticles was used in mouse calvarial bone defect model.

Besides, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) can predict the clinical course of patients with type 2  (DM2) during hospital stays. This study aimed to assess the relationship between HbA1c levels and inpatient outcomes. Type 2  patients with age greater than 18 years, hospital length of stay greater than 24 hours, and one HbA1c report during their in-hospital management were included. All the electronic care records of patients admitted at the Clinical Versalles, a high-volume institution, in Manizales-Colombia were revised. The following variables were considered: hospital length of stay, diagnoses at the arrival, complications, capillary glucose levels, and treatment at discharge. Variables were categorized by HbA1c levels: group 1 = ⩽ 7%, group 2 = 7.01% to 8.5%, group 3 = 8.51% to ⩽10% and group 4 = >10%. There were a total of 232 patients. Average age was 69.7 years, mean HbA1c was 7.19 ± 2.03, average body mass index (BMI) was 28.8 ± 5.6. About HbA1c, 146 (62.9%) had ⩽7.5%. The most frequent admission diagnosis was by cardiovascular diseases. Average hospitalization was 7.5 ± 5.7 days. There was no relationship between the levels of HbA1c with hospital stays, inpatient complications, or readmissions. Infections and respiratory diseases were more common conditions related to higher HbA1c levels, especially when these were 8.5%. In diabetic patients with nonsurgical diseases and high HbA1c levels, there was no association with clinical complications, length of stay, readmissions, or in-hospital mortality, but changes in treatment at discharge were observed.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673865>Anti-Neuronal Antibodies Within the IVIg Preparations: Importance in Clinical Practice.</a></h2><p>Our study objective was testing for anti-neuronal autoantibodies within commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations. Sixteen samples from 5 different commercially available IVIg preparations were tested with cell-based assays (CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect and characterize common neuronal autoantibodies, and with immunohistochemistry on teased fibers from mouse sciatic nerve and on mouse brain sections to screen for nodal and not yet identified neuronal antigens. In 15/16 IVIg preparations, anti-GAD antibodies were detected in titers ranging from 40 to 1507 IU/mL, as typically seen in type 1 , but not in the range (> 2000 IU/mL) seen in GAD-positive neurological patients. None of the preparations was however positive with anti-GAD CBA. Antibodies to AQP4 were also detected by ELISA in 15/16 IVIg preparations with titers comparable to those seen in AQP4-seropositive NMO patients; with CBA, however, all IVIg samples were AQP4-negative. IVIg preparations contained IgG-anti-MAG antibodies by ELISA at statistically significant higher titers compared to controls. Two of the 16 IVIg samples were positive for human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies. All IVIg preparations were negative for antibodies to MOG, NMDAR, anti-nodal, and other neuronal-specific proteins. IVIg preparations contain antibodies against GAD and AQP4 in titers comparable to those seen in autoimmune patients when tested by ELISA, but not by CBA or tissue immunohistochemistry, suggesting that the autoantibodies within the IVIg are against linear rather than structural epitopes, as part of the natural antibody immune repertoire. The information is clinically important for diagnosis when testing patients' sera after they have received therapy with IVIg to avoid false interpretation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673130>Building a designer cytokine to treat type 2 .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669626>Changing trends in the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 1  from 1990 to 2018: A retrospective study in a Portuguese population.</a></h2><p>to estimate the prevalence of DR in a Portuguese population with type 1 .Retrospective review of all patients with type 1 DM, whose reference center was Centro Hospitalar de São João, a tertiary center in Portugal, who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2018.

Therefore, a specific diagnostic is recommended. Depressive symptoms should obligatory be screened during the clinical interview or by validated questionnaires. When screened positive, further diagnostic steps are mandatory. The treatment of depressive disorders has three main components: basic psychosomatic care, psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. These interventions are safe and effective for reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing quality of life. However, results regarding the effects on morbidity and mortality of the comorbid somatic disorder are still inconclusive. The greatest effects on depression are obtained by a preference-based, stepped-care approach and an optimal cooperation of all professionals ("collaborative care").An effective treatment of depressive comorbidity is relevant for quality of life and possibly also for the prognosis of a somatic disease.

In the first two analyses, logistic regression models were used with dynapenia (grip strength < 26kg in men and < 16kg in women) as outcome and  [ND, UDD, CD and UCD] as exposure. Next, linear regression was performed with grip strength as outcome and the participants classified based on HbA1c level as exposure. The models were adjusted by sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics.Compared to ND only UCD was associated with dynapenia (men OR=2.37 95% CI 1.36-4.14; women OR=1.67 95% CI 1.01-2.79). This association was less clear, particularly in women, when CD and UCD groups were merged. HbA1c ≥ 6.5% in men and ≥ 8.0% in women were associated with lower NMS.UCD increases the chance of dynapenia in both sexes.

Whereas physiological formation rates confer redox regulation of essential cellular functions and provide the basis for adaptive stress responses, their excessive formation contributes to impaired cellular function or even cell death, organ dysfunction and severe disease phenotypes of the entire organism. Therefore, quantification of RONS formation and knowledge of their tissue/cell/compartment-specific distribution is of great biological and clinical importance.Here, we used a high-performance/pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay to quantify the superoxide-specific oxidation product of the mitochondria-targeted fluorescence dye triphenylphosphonium-linked hydroethidium (mitoSOX) in biochemical systems and three animal models with established oxidative stress. Type 1  (single injection of streptozotocin), hypertension (infusion of angiotensin-II for 7 days) and nitrate tolerance (infusion of nitroglycerin for 4 days) was induced in male Wistar rats.The usefulness of mitoSOX/HPLC for quantification of mitochondrial superoxide was confirmed by xanthine oxidase activity as well as isolated stimulated rat heart mitochondria in the presence or absence of superoxide scavengers.

Targeting an appropriate B cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa 2-18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673293>Painless destructive thyroiditis in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone: a case report.</a></h2><p>Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) usually features a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (SITSH) without suppression of the typical high thyroid hormone levels. However, some patients with RTH show thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression due to thyrotoxicosis. We report a case of painless thyroiditis in a patient with RTH that was misdiagnosed as Graves' disease because of TSH-suppressed thyrotoxicosis.A sixteen-year-old boy consulted a local general physician for fatigue. He had a goiter, and biochemical analysis showed TSH < 0.1 μIU/mL, free triiodothyronine (FT3) of 2.70 pg/mL, and free thyroxine (FT4) of 3.6 ng/dL. He was diagnosed with Graves' disease and was treated with 20 mg thiamazole. One year later, he was referred to the department of endocrinology because of SITSH. He was finally diagnosed with RTH due to the finding of a heterozygous missense mutation (methionine 334 threonine) in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene. Three years after cessation of thiamazole, his hyperthyroxinemia showed marked exacerbation with TSH suppression. We diagnosed him with painless destructive thyroiditis because of low technetium-99 m (Tc-99 m) uptake in the thyroid. Extreme hyperthyroxinemia was ameliorated, with a return to the usual SITSH levels, within 1 month without any treatment.The present case demonstrates that diagnosing RTH is difficult when patients show hyperthyroxinemia with complete suppression of TSH to undetectable levels, and the data lead to misdiagnosis of RTH as Graves' disease. The initial diagnosis is important, and Tc-99 m scintigraphy is useful for the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis accompanying RTH.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665383>Elevated cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity early in pregnancy predicts prediabetes 5 years later.</a></h2><p>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) regulates high density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol levels and interaction between glucose and HDL metabolism is central in the development of .We hypothesized that CETP levels would be regulated in diabetic pregnancies.

Whereas HIV screening is standard of care test in sub Saharan Africa TB programs, the same is not true for  (DM). Sub Saharan Africa, a region with high TB infection rates, is going through an epidemiological transition with rapidly rising prevalence of . We aimed at characterizing TB patients with DM in order to identify factors associated with TB-DM dual disease among patients attending TB clinics in Dar es Salaam.A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2016 and January 2017 among patients attending TB clinics in Dar es Salaam. We collected socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements and screened for  by measuring fasting blood glucose that was followed by a 2 h postprandial glucose for participants with impaired fasting blood glucose. We examined for socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with  using logistic regression analysis.Of the 660 enrolled participants with TB, 25 (3.8%) were on treatment for  while 39 (6.1%) and 147 (23%) of the remaining 635 participants were ultimately diagnosed with DM and impaired fasting blood glucose respectively. The overall prevalence of DM was 9.7% (64/660). Independent risk factors for  included: age > 44 years {OR 4.52, 95% CI: [1.28-15.89]}; family history of  {OR 3.42, 95% [CI 1.88-6.21]}. HIV sero-positive TB patients were less likely to have DM compared to those who were HIV sero-negative {OR 0.35, 95% CI [0.17-0.73]}.Screening for  should be advocated for TB patients aged above 44 years and/or with a family history of . HIV sero-negative TB patients were more likely to have DM compared to those who were HIV sero-positive.

We used data of healthy participants without , aged 40-74 years, in the Kobe Orthopedic and Biomedical Epidemiologic (KOBE) study. The association between being CWI and NAD intake was evaluated by multivariate linear regression analyses after adjusting for age, sex, surveyed months (seasons), alcohol drinking, health-awareness life habits, socioeconomic factors, serum osmolarity, estimated daily salt intake, and reasons for NAD intake. Among 988 (698 women and 290 men) participants eligible for the present analyses, 644 participants (65.2%) were CWI and 344 participants (34.8%) were not CWI (non-CWI). The most popular reason for being CWI was to avoid heat stroke in summer and to prevent ischemic cerebral stroke in winter. The CWI group took more NAD, especially decaffeinated beverages, than the non-CWI group (1846.7 ± 675.1 mL/day vs. 1478.0 ± 636.3 ml/day,  < 0.001). There was a significant association between being CWI and NAD intake in multivariate linear regression analyses ever after adjusting for the relevant variables (β = 318.1,  < 0.001). These findings demonstrated CWI, regardless of the reasons and the seasons, was associated with high NAD intake in Japanese healthy population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665341>Varicella Zoster Virus Infection of Primary Human Spinal Astrocytes Produces Intracellular Amylin, Amyloid-beta, and an Amyloidogenic Extracellular Environment.</a></h2><p>Herpes zoster is linked to amyloid-associated diseases, including dementia, macular degeneration, and , in epidemiological studies. Thus, we examined whether varicella zoster virus (VZV)-infected cells produce amyloid.Production of intracellular amyloidogenic proteins (amylin, amyloid precursor protein [APP], and amyloid-beta [Aβ]) and amyloid, as well as extracellular amylin, Aβ, and amyloid was compared between mock- and VZV-infected quiescent primary human spinal astrocytes (qHA-sps). The ability of supernatant from infected cells to induce amylin or Aβ42 aggregation was quantitated. Finally, the amyloidogenic activity of viral peptides was examined.VZV-infected qHA-sps, but not mock-infected qHA-sps, contained intracellular amylin, APP and/or Aβ, and amyloid. No differences in extracellular amylin, Aβ40, or Aβ42 were detected, yet only supernatant from VZV-infected cells induced amylin aggregation and, to a lesser extent, Aβ42 aggregation into amyloid fibrils. VZV glycoprotein B (gB) peptides assembled into fibrils and catalyzed amylin and Aβ42 aggregation.VZV-infected qHA-sps produced intracellular amyloid and their extracellular environment promoted aggregation of cellular peptides into amyloid fibrils that may be due, in part, to VZV gB peptides. These findings suggest that together with host and other environmental factors, VZV infection may increase the toxic amyloid burden and contribute to amyloid-associated disease progression.© The Author(s) 2019.

Particular examples include stroke, coronary heart disease, dementia and certain cancers. Research linking clinical and lifestyle risk factors to increased risk of noncommunicable disease is now well established with examples of confirmed risk factors, including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and hypertension. However, despite a need to target our resources to achieve risk reduction, relatively little work has examined the overlap between the risk factors for these main noncommunicable diseases. Our high-level review draws together the evidence in this area. Using a systematic overview of reviews, we demonstrate the likely commonality of established risk factors having an impact on multiple noncommunicable disease outcomes. For example, systematic reviews of the evidence on physical inactivity and poor diet found each to be associated with increased risk of cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke,  and dementia. We highlight the potential for targeted risk reduction to simultaneously impact multiple noncommunicable disease areas. These relationships now need to be further quantified to allow the most effective development of public health interventions in this area.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663297>Association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and type 2  (T2DM) susceptibility.</a></h2><p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is essential in mediating folate metabolism, and thus plays an important role in  and diabetic complications. MTHFR C677T (rs1801133 C>T) polymorphism has been proposed to be linked with type 2  (T2DM) susceptibility. However, the conclusions are inconsistent. Therefore, we rechecked their linkage aiming to obtain a more reliable estimation by performing an updated meta-analysis.We searched electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang to obtain studies updated to October 2019.After carefully screening, we finally incorporated 68 studies with 10,812 cases and 8,745 controls. The genotype frequency of C677T polymorphism was analyzed pooled to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled results presented that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM under homozygous (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.39-1.94), heterozygous (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.20-1.59), recessive (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.23-1.61), dominant (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.27-1.70), and allele (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.23-1.52) genetic models. Stratified analysis demonstrated that C677T genotype was associated with T2DM in Asian populations, but not Caucasian and African populations.Our results indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism confers to T2DM, especially in Asian populations.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cancer can increase the risk of . Consequently,  and cancer share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating  and colon and rectal cancer (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on cancer cell aggressiveness in human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both  and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of cancer cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating  and CRC.

The majority of  (DM) patients belong to type 2  (T2DM), which is highly associated with obesity. The general principle of current therapeutic strategies for patients with T2DM mainly focuses on restoring cellular insulin response by potentiating the insulin-induced signaling pathway. In late-stage T2DM, impaired insulin production requires the patients to receive insulin replacement therapy for maintaining their glucose homeostasis. T2DM patients also demonstrate a drop of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in their circulation, which suggests that replenishing BDNF or enhancing its downstream signaling pathway may be beneficial. Because of their protein nature, recombinant insulin or BDNF possess several limitations that hinder their clinical application in T2DM treatment. Thus, developing orally active "insulin pill" or "BDNF pill" is essential to provide a more convenient and effective therapy. This article reviews the current development of non-peptidyl chemicals that mimic insulin or BDNF and their potential as anti-diabetic agents.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671730>Antihypertensive and Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme (ACE)-Inhibitory Peptides from Fish as Potential Cardioprotective Compounds.</a></h2><p>The term metabolic/cardiometabolic/insulin resistance syndrome could generally be defined as the co-occurrence of several risk factors inclusive of systemic arterial hypertension. Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type-2  (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides.

Recently, a new plasma glucagon assay based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was developed. We evaluated the influence of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (anagliptin) on plasma glucagon levels in Japanese patients with type 2  by using this new assay.Twenty-four patients with type 2  were enrolled in a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label study and were randomly allocated to 4 weeks of treatment with metformin (1000 mg/day) or anagliptin (200 mg/day). A liquid test meal labeled with sodium [C] acetate was ingested before and after the treatment period. Samples of blood and expired air were collected over 3 hours. Plasma levels of glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were measured, and gastric emptying was also evaluated.Twenty-two patients completed the study (metformin group: n=10; anagliptin group: n=12). Glycemic control showed similar improvement in both groups. In the anagliptin group, there was a slight decrease of the incremental area under the plasma concentration versus time curve for glucagon after the test meal (P=0.048). In addition, the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP was increased, and plasma C-peptide was also increased versus baseline. Neither anagliptin nor metformin delayed gastric emptying.In patients with type 2  maintained endogenous insulin secretion, anagliptin increased the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP in association with a slight stimulation of insulin secretion and slight inhibition of glucagon secretion, but did not delay gastric emptying.Copyright © 2019.

Yet the extent of this improvement and whether it impacts multiple risk factors together is uncertain. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to investigate the effects of text-messaging interventions for CVD prevention.Electronic databases were searched to identify trials investigating a text-messaging intervention focusing on CVD prevention with the potential to modify at least two CVD risk factors in adults. The main outcome was blood pressure (BP). We conducted standard and IPD meta-analysis on pooled data. We accounted for clustering of patients within studies and the primary analysis used random-effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed.Nine trials were included in the systematic review involving 3779 participants and 5 (n=2612) contributed data to the IPD meta-analysis. Standard meta-analysis showed that the weighted mean differences are as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP), -4.13 mm Hg (95% CI -11.07 to 2.81, p<0.0001); diastolic blood pressure (DBP), -1.11 mm Hg (-1.91 to -0.31, p=0.002); and body mass index (BMI), -0.32 (-0.49 to -0.16, p=0.000). In the IPD meta-analysis, the mean difference are as follows: SBP, -1.3 mm Hg (-5.4 to 2.7, p=0.5236); DBP, -0.8 mm Hg (-2.5 to 1.0, p=0.3912); and BMI, -0.2 (-0.8 to 0.4, p=0.5200) in the random-effects model. The impact on other risk factors is described, but there were insufficient data to conduct meta-analyses.Mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on BP and BMI. Simultaneous but small impacts on multiple risk factors are likely to be clinically relevant and improve outcome, but there are currently insufficient data in pooled analyses to examine the extent to which simultaneous reduction in multiple risk factors occurs.CRD42016033236.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, evidence of an association among obesity, bariatric surgery, and skin cancer, including melanoma, is limited.To investigate the association of bariatric surgery with skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma) and melanoma incidence.This nonrandomized controlled trial, the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, is ongoing at 25 surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in Sweden and was designed to examine outcomes after bariatric surgery. The study included 2007 patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and 2040 contemporaneously matched controls who received conventional obesity treatment. Patients were enrolled between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001. Data analysis was performed from June 29, 2018, to November 22, 2018.Patients in the surgery group underwent gastric bypass (n = 266), banding (n = 376), or vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 1365). The control group (n = 2040) received the customary treatment for obesity at their primary health care centers.The SOS study was cross-linked to the Swedish National Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Registry, and the Registry of the Total Population for data on cancer incidence, death, and emigration.The study included 4047 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.9 [6.1] years; 2867 [70.8%] female). Information on cancer events was available for 4042 patients. The study found that bariatric surgery was associated with a markedly reduced risk of melanoma (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.87; P = .02; median follow-up, 18.1 years) and risk of skin cancer in general (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99; P = .047). The skin cancer risk reduction was not associated with baseline body mass index or weight; insulin, glucose, lipid, and creatinine levels; ; blood pressure; alcohol intake; or smoking.The results of this study suggest that bariatric surgery in individuals with obesity is associated with a reduced risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660896>Correlation between significant asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and severity of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the lower limb: a retrospective study on 200 patients.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between significant asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) and severity of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) in the lower limb, and to investigate the risk factors for significant ACAS in patients with lower limb PAOD.Two hundred patients with lower limb PAOD were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline data, medical history and potential risk factors were collected. Lower limb PAOD was classified as stage IIA, stage IIB, stage III and stage IV. The carotid artery stenosis was classified as significant ACAS and non-significant ACAS.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of one-week treatment with sevelamer on oxidative nucleic acid modifications and inflammation markers.Two double-blinded studies including 30 patients with type 2  (T2D) and 20 healthy individuals were conducted. Participants were randomised to one week of treatment with sevelamer (1600 mg three times daily) or placebo. RNA and DNA oxidation, measured by urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine(8-oxoGuo) and (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-oxodG), and markers of inflammation were determined before and after the intervention.In patients with T2D there was no significant placebo-corrected reduction in 8-oxoGuo or 8-oxodG. However, a reduction in 8-oxoGuo was observed within the group treated with sevelamer (∆8-oxoGuo/creatinine (median[IQR]): -0.04 [-0.24; 0.01] nmol/mmol, p = 0.02).

The target population included individuals with type 2  (T2D) aged 40 years, without retinopathy, followed over a 40-year time horizon. A Markov model was developed with five health states and a 1-year cycle. Model parameters were based on literature and country databases. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model parameters' uncertainty. WHO willingness-to-pay (WHO-WTP) thresholds were used as reference (i.e. one and three times the Brazilian per capita Gross Domestic Product of R$32747 in 2018).Compared to usual practice, the systematic teleophthalmology-based screening was associated with an incremental cost of R$21445/QALY gained ($9792/QALY gained). The systematic ophthalmology referral-based screening was more expensive (incremental costs = R$4) and less effective (incremental QALY = -0.012) compared to the systematic teleophthalmology-based screening. The probability of systematic teleophthalmology-based screening being cost-effective compared to usual practice was 0.46 and 0.67 at the minimum and the maximum WHO-WTP thresholds, respectively.Systematic teleophthalmology-based DR screening for the Brazilian population with T2D would be considered very cost effective compared to the opportunistic ophthalmology referral-based screening according to the WHO-WTP threshold.

Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non-fat yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined. Dietary assessments were also performed. At the end of the intervention, body weight and BMI were reduced in the VY group (86.5 ± 3.1 vs. 87.7 ± 3.0 kg, and 29.2 ± 1.0 vs. 29.6 ± 0.9 kg m-2, respectively, P < 0.05) and dietary intake was lower compared to the CY group (7277.6 ± 332.6 vs. 9918.2 ± 612.1 kJ day-1, P < 0.05). HbA1c was marginally reduced in the VY group (6.2 ± 0.2 vs. 6.4 ± 0.3%, P = 0.08), concentrations of B1, B2 and B6 were increased (63.8 ± 5.6 vs. 52.8 ± 1.7 μg L-1, P = 0.09, 9.2 ± 1.5 vs. 6.9 ± 1.4 μg L-1, P < 0.05 and 23.0 ± 2.8 vs. 14.9 ± 1.2 μg L-1, P < 0.05, respectively) and a trend towards reduced homocysteine concentrations was observed (16.9 ± 1.7 vs. 18.3 ± 2.0 μmol L-1, P = 0.06). IL-6 was decreased in both groups but significantly in the CY group (1.33 ± 0.13 vs. 1.67 ± 0.63 pg mL-1, P < 0.05).

Recent results underscore the utility of coenzyme Q (CoQ) addition to standard medications in order to reduce mortality and to improve quality of life and functional capacity in chronic heart failure (CHF). The rationale for CoQ supplementation in CHF is two-fold. One is the well-known role of CoQ in myocardial bioenergetics, and the second is its antioxidant property. Redox balance is also improved by oral supplementation of CoQ, and this effect contributes to enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Previous reports have shown that CoQ concentration is decreased in myocardial tissue in CHF and by statin therapy, and the greater the CoQ deficiency the more severe is the cardiocirculatory impairment. In patients with CHF and hypercholesterolaemia being treated with statins, the combination of CoQ with a statin may be useful for two reasons: decreasing skeletal muscle injury and improving myocardial function. Ubiquinol, the active reduced form of CoQ, presents higher bioavailability than the oxidised form ubiquinone, and should be the preferred form to be added to a statin. The combination ezetimibe/simvastatin may have advantages over single statins. Since ezetimibe reduces absorption of cholesterol and does not affect CoQ synthesis in the liver, the impact of this combination on CoQ tissue levels will be much less than that of high dose statin monotherapy at any target low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level to be reached. This consideration makes the ezetimibe/statin combination the ideal LDL-lowering agent to be combined with ubiquinol in CHF patients. However, particular caution is advisable with the use of strategies of extreme lowering of cholesterol that may negatively impact on myocardial function. All in all there is a strong case for considering co-administration of ubiquinol with statin therapy in patients with depressed or borderline myocardial function.Copyright © 2019.

However, measurements of total IGF-I concentrations may not reflect the bioactive fraction of IGF-I which reaches the IGF-I receptor at target organs. We examined endogenous IGF-bioactivity using an IGF-I kinase receptor activation (KIRA) assay that measures the ability of IGF-I to activate the IGF-IR in vitro.To compare responses of bioactive IGF and total IGF-I concentrations in short GH treated SGA children in the North European Small for Gestational Age Study (NESGAS).Bioactive IGF increased with age in healthy pre-pubertal children (n=94). SGA children had low-normal bioactive IGF levels at baseline (-0.12 (1.8 SD), increasing significantly after one year of high-dose GH treatment to 1.1 (1.4) SD, p<0.01. Following high-dose GH, 68% (n=65) of SGA children had a total IGF-I concentration >2SD (mean IGF-I 2.8 SDS), whereas only 15% (n=15) had levels of bioactive IGF slightly above normal reference values. At baseline, bioactive IGF (SDS) was significantly correlated to height (SDS) (r=0.29, p=0.005), in contrast to IGF-I (SDS) (r=0.17, p=0.10). IGF-I (SDS) was inversely correlated to delta height (SDS) after one year of high-dose GH treatment (r=-0.22, p=0.02).In contrast to total IGF-I concentrations, bioactive IGF stayed within the normal reference ranges for most SGA children during the first year of GH treatment.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, the incidence of acute kidney injury after platinum-based transarterial chemoembolization or transarterial infusion chemotherapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate association between acute kidney injury after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.We retrospectively analysed 270 sessions in 129 patients who underwent platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the criteria established by the International Club of Ascites. The incidence of acute kidney injury, risk factors for serum creatinine elevation and association between acute kidney injury and prognosis were assessed.Fifteen cases of acute kidney injury (5.6%, 15/270) developed in 14 patients (10.8%, 14/129).

An upskilled GP and endocrinologist developed a management plan which was communicated to the participant's usual GP. Up to two follow-up visits over 6 months were available to ensure that management was acceptable and effective.464 people with type 2  (mean±SD age 59.3±13.7 years, 52.2% males) were enrolled between November 2015 and March 2018. Their mean HbA was 9.3% (78 mmol/mol) and their mean body mass index 33.7 kg/m . There was an increase in use of injectable blood glucose-lowering therapies between the initial and final visit in association with a median HbA reduction of 1.2% (13 mmol/mol) which was sustained to 12 months in assessable participants. There were also reductions in blood pressure, and serum LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Patient satisfaction with current treatment, time for self-management, time spent in -related appointments, and knowledge of  all increased significantly.

However, its ability to reveal individual transmission links within clusters is limited. Here, we used a 2-step approach based on Bayesian transmission reconstruction to (1) identify likely index and missing cases, (2) determine risk factors associated with transmitters, and (3) estimate when transmission happened.We developed our transmission reconstruction method using genomic and epidemiological data from a population-based study from Valencia Region, Spain. Tuberculosis (TB) incidence during the study period was 8.4 cases per 100,000 people. While the study is ongoing, the sampling frame for this work includes notified TB cases between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. We identified a total of 21 transmission clusters that fulfilled the criteria for analysis. These contained a total of 117 individuals diagnosed with active TB (109 with epidemiological data). Demographic characteristics of the study population were as follows: 80/109 (73%) individuals were Spanish-born, 76/109 (70%) individuals were men, and the mean age was 42.51 years (SD 18.46). We found that 66/109 (61%) TB patients were sputum positive at diagnosis, and 10/109 (9%) were HIV positive. We used the data to reveal individual transmission links, and to identify index cases, missing cases, likely transmitters, and associated transmission risk factors. Our Bayesian inference approach suggests that at least 60% of index cases are likely misidentified by local public health. Our data also suggest that factors associated with likely transmitters are different to those of simply being in a transmission cluster, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these 2 phenomena. Our data suggest that type 2  is a risk factor associated with being a transmitter (odds ratio 0.19 [95% CI 0.02-1.10], p < 0.003). Finally, we used the most likely timing for transmission events to study when TB transmission occurred; we identified that 5/14 (35.7%) cases likely transmitted TB well before symptom onset, and these were largely sputum negative at diagnosis. Limited within-cluster diversity does not allow us to extrapolate our findings to the whole TB population in Valencia Region.In this study, we found that index cases are often misidentified, with downstream consequences for epidemiological investigations because likely transmitters can be missed. Our findings regarding inferred transmission timing suggest that TB transmission can occur before patient symptom onset, suggesting also that TB transmits during sub-clinical disease. This result has direct implications for diagnosing TB and reducing transmission. Overall, we show that a transition to individual-based genomic epidemiology will likely close some of the knowledge gaps in TB transmission and may redirect efforts towards cost-effective contact investigations for improved TB control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669079>Vitamin D Supplementation during Pregnancy: An Evidence Analysis Center Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women and possible effects on offspring health, a systematic review on this topic was conducted to help inform future practice guidelines.To evaluate associations between maternal vitamin D supplementation, maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, and health outcomes.A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify studies that examined the health effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes published from 2000 to 2016. Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational , preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5.2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Vascular ATP-sensitive potassium (K) channels most likely participate in the processes of  and hypertension. The aim of this research was to examine whether GDM and PIH cause changes in the expression and function of K channels in vascular smooth muscle of human umbilical vein (HUV). Western blot and immunohistochemistry detected significantly decreased expression of Kir6.1 subunit of K channels in GDM and PIH, while the expression of SUR2B was unchanged. In GDM, a K channel opener, pinacidil caused reduced relaxation of the endothelium-denuded HUVs compared to normal pregnancy. However, its effects in HUVs from PIH subjects were similar to normal pregnancy. In all groups K channel blocker glibenclamide antagonized the relaxation of HUV induced by pinacidil without change in the maximal relaxations indicating additional K channel-independent mechanisms of pinacidil action. Iberiotoxin, a selective antagonist of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, inhibited the relaxant effect of pinacidil in PIH, but not in normal pregnancy and GDM. Experiments performed in K-rich solution confirmed the existence of K-independent effects of pinacidil, which also appear to be impaired in GDM and PIH. Thus, the expression of K channels is decreased in GDM and PIH. In GDM, vasorelaxant response of HUV to pinacidil is reduced, while in PIH it remains unchanged. It is very likely that K channels modulation and more detailed insight in K channel-independent actions of pinacidil may be precious in the therapy of pathological pregnancies.Copyright © 2019.

However, to date, a limited number of scholars have attempted to systematically elucidate the characteristics of KP-PLA. The aim of the present study was to analyze clinical, microbiological, and molecular epidemiological characteristics of KP-PLA patients in Southeastern China.The KP-PLA cases from a tertiary teaching hospital in China from January 2016 to December 2017 were systemically studied and elucidated comprehensively. The virulence factors, resistant spectrum, and clones of  isolates were identified with string test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antimicrobial susceptibility test, and multilocus sequence typing. Moreover, the characteristics in KP-PLA patients with and without other hepatobiliary diseases (OHD) were also been compared.A total of 163 KP-PLA cases were enrolled, in which the majority of those cases were senior males, and often associated with multiple underlying diseases, including  (49.7%). The remaining cases belonged to healthy individuals (50.3%). The clinical symptoms were common but nonspecific, characterized by increased inflammatory parameters and abnormal liver function parameters. The abscess was often right-sided solitary presentation (58.3%). Cephalosporin or carbapenem plus metronidazole combined with percutaneous puncture or catheter drainage were favorable therapeutics. Although low resistance rates of commonly used antimicrobial drugs (< 10%) were observed, twelve strains were identified as multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, and were mainly isolated from the OHD patients. The hypermucoviscosity, as well as K1 and K2 serotypes accounted for 30.7, 40.5, and 19.0%, respectively. Except for  (24.5%) and  (45.4%), the high prevalence of virulence genes (e.g. , , , , , , , , , and ) was identified (68.7-100.0%). Additionally, ST23 was found as a predominant sequence type (ST; 38.7%), and three novel STs (ST3507, ST3508 and ST3509) were noted as well.The present study reported the abundant hvKp strains in KP-PLA, as well as convergence of hypervirulent and MDR  isolates from the KP-PLA patients, particularly those cases with OHD.

Women in the UK usually access EC from a pharmacy but then need a subsequent appointment with a general practitioner or a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service to access regular contraception. Unintended pregnancies can occur during this time.Bridge-It is a pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial designed to determine whether pharmacist provision of a bridging supply of a progestogen-only pill (POP) plus rapid access to a local SRH clinic, results in increased uptake of effective contraception and prevents more unintended pregnancies than provision of EC alone. Bridge-It involves 31 pharmacies in three UK regions (London, Lothian and Tayside) aiming to recruit 626-737 women. Pharmacies will give EC (levonorgestrel) according to normal practice and recruit women to both intervention and the control phases of the study.

In the control phase, pharmacists will advise women to attend a contraceptive provider for contraception (standard care).Women will be asked 4 months later about contraceptive use. Data linkage to abortion registries will provide abortion rates over 12 months. The sample size is calculated on the primary outcome of effective contraception use at 4 months (yes/no) with 90% power and a 5% level of significance. Abortion rates will be an exploratory secondary analysis. Process evaluation includes interviews with pharmacists, SRH clinicians and women. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use a healthcare system perspective and be expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Ethical approval was received from South East Scotland REC June 2017.

The purpose of this study is to report on the types and frequency of readmissions and identify demographic and clinical factors associated with readmission of Medicare beneficiaries that survived their AMI hospitalization. Methods and Results This retrospective study used the Inpatient Standard Analytical File for 2014. There were 143 286 Medicare beneficiaries with AMI who were discharged alive from 3619 hospitals. All readmissions occurring in any hospital within 90 days of the index AMI discharge date were identified. Of 143 286 Medicare beneficiaries discharged alive from their index AMI hospitalization, 28% (40 145) experienced at least 1 readmission within 90 days and 8% (11 477) had >1 readmission. Readmission rates were higher among Medicare beneficiaries who did not undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention in their index AMI admission (34%) compared with those that underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (20.2%). Using all Medicare beneficiary's index AMI, 27 comorbid conditions were significantly associated with the likelihood of a Medicare beneficiary having a readmission during the follow-up period. The strongest clinical characteristics associated with readmissions were dialysis dependence, type 1 , and heart failure. Conclusions This study provides benchmark information on the types of hospital readmissions Medicare beneficiaries experience during a 90-day AMI bundle. This paper also suggests that interventions are needed to alleviate the need for readmissions in high-risk populations, such as, those managed medically and those at risk of heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661547>Effect of Ropivacaine on Peripheral Neuropathy in Streptozocin -induced Rats through TRPV1-CGRP pathway.</a></h2><p>Objective To determine the effect of ropivacaine on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic rats and its possible mechanism.Methods Forty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: nondiabetic control group, nondiabetic group A (0.25% ropivacaine), nondiabetic group B (0.75% ropivacaine), diabetic control group (Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) +artificial cerebrospinal fluid), diabetic group A (DPN+0.25% ropivacaine), and diabetic group B (DPN + 0.75% ropivacaine), with eight rats in each group. Within an hour of the last administration, the sciatic nerve motor conduction velocity (MNCV) of each group was measured, and the morphological changes of rat sciatic nerve were observed by HE, Weil's staining and electron microscopy. The expression of TRPV-1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn of rats was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of CGRP protein in the spinal cord was analyzed by Western blot. Results Compared with the nondiabetic control group, elevated blood glucose, decreased weight and reduced average mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), additionally, the sciatic nerves showed significantly slowed conduction velocity (both p&lt;0.001) and damaged pathological structure, the expression of TRPV1 and CGRP were decreased (both p&lt;0.001) in the diabetic groups. Compared with the diabetic control group, down-regulation of TRPV1 and CGRP in spinal cord was significant for the diabetic group A and B treated with 0.25% and 0.75% ropivacaine, the higher concentration of ropivacaine correlated with a greater change. Conclusion Ropivacaine can significantly block sciatic nerve conduction velocity in DPN rats in a concentration-dependent manner, which may be related to the expression of the TRPV1-CGRP pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to  and cancer. Here, we review a conceptual framework that will provide a basic understanding about the molecular mechanism of action of a therapeutic nanomaterial inside biological milieu. In this review, we highlight how the catalytic nature of a transition metal oxide nanomaterial influences the cellular redox homeostasis, supports the cellular antioxidant defence system and reactivates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated signalling to perform normal cell functions like cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, toxicity, and protein interactions. With numerous examples, we describe the redox modulatory nature of d-block metal oxide nanomaterials and their biomimetic nanozyme activities to protect the mitochondria, the cellular redox mediator which prevents an organism from various diseases. This knowledge will be useful to design new nanomaterials capable of intracellular redox modulation, which in turn can be effective therapeutic agents for treatment of various unmet diseases that are beyond the ability of modern synthetic medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672498>Tanshinone IIA attenuates high glucose induced human VSMC proliferation and migration through miR-21-5p-mediated tropomyosin 1 downregulation.</a></h2><p>The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play important roles in the development and progression of -related vascular complications. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. This study was designed to investigate the influences of tanshinone IIA, an active compound extracted from Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, on the proliferation and migration of human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs). cultured in a high glucose medium and the underlying mechanisms related miRNAs. Using a miRNA microarray method, we profiled the miRNA expression signature in human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs) exposed to normal glucose, high glucose with and without Tanshinone IIA. Cell proliferation was measured with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell migration was evaluated using transwell migration assay and wound scratch assay. Western blot was used to examine the expression of tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and miRNA level was quantified by real-time PCR. The results showed that several miRNAs that were highly expressed in the high glucose group were significantly decreased in the high glucose with Tanshinone IIA group compared with the normal glucose group (P < 0.05). Among these miRNAs, miR-21-5p was significantly upregulated in the high glucose group and downregulated after Tanshinone IIA treatment (P < 0.05). The depletion of miR-21-5p in HASMCs resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration (P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that Tanshinone ⅡA inhibited proliferation and migration partly through miR-21-5p-mediated TPM1 downregulation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Tanshinone IIA is able to protect HASMCs from high glucose-induced proliferation and migration through regulating expression of miRNAs.Copyright © 2019.

These compounds have been widely screened for their pharmacological effects. Polyphenols, such as soy-derived isoflavones, also called phytoestrogens, have been extensively studied due to their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. These compounds are chemically similar to 17β-estradiol, and mimic the binding of estrogens to its receptors, exerting estrogenic effects in target organs. Genistein is an isoflavone derived from soy-rich products and accounts for about 60% of total isoflavones found in soybeans. Genistein has been reported to exhibit several biological effects, such as anti-tumor activity (inhibition of cell proliferation, regulation of the cell cycle, induction of apoptosis), improvement of glucose metabolism, impairment of angiogenesis in both hormone-related and hormone-unrelated cancer cells, reduction of peri-menopausal and postmenopausal hot flashes, and modulation of antioxidant effects. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical studies have reported health benefits of genistein in many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, , and osteoporosis, and aid in the amelioration of typical menopausal symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Although the biological effects are promising, certain limitations, such as low bioavailability, biological estrogenic activity, and effects on target organs, have limited the clinical applications of genistein to some extent. Moreover, studies report that modification of its molecular structure may eliminate the biological estrogenic activity and its effects on target organs. In this review, we summarize the potential benefits of genistein on menopause symptoms and menopause-related diseases like cardiovascular, osteoporosis, obesity, , anxiety, depression, and breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665480>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide is a pancreatic polypeptide secretagogue in humans.</a></h2><p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP) has been suggested to stimulate the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide(PP), an islet hormone thought to regulate gut motility, appetite and glycemia.To determine whether human GIP1-42 (hGIP) stimulates PP secretion.As glycemia modulates the secretion of PP, we measured plasma PP concentrations from two studies in healthy men(n=10) and in patients with type 2  (T2D)(n=12), where hGIP1-42 had been administered intravenously during fasting glycemia,  hyperglycemia(12mmol/L) and insulin-induced hypoglycemia (targets: 2.5mmol/L(healthy)/3.5mmol/L(T2D)). Porcine GIP1-42 (pGIP) was also infused intra-arterially in isolated porcine pancreata(n=4).Mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations were ~5mmol/L(healthy) and ~8mmol/L(T2D).At fasting glycemia, PP concentrations were higher during intravenous hGIP1-42 infusion compared with saline in healthy men (mean(SEM), net iAUCs0;30min 403(116) vs. -6(57) pmol/L×min,p=0.004) and in patients with T2D (905(177) vs. -96(86)pmol/L×min,p=0.009). During hyperglycemic clamping, PP concentrations were significantly higher during hGIP1-42 infusion compared with saline in patients with T2D (771(160) vs. -183(117)pmol/L×min,p=0.001), but not in healthy individuals (-8(86) vs. -57(53)pmol/L×min,p=0.69). When PG levels were declining in response to exogenous insulin, PP concentrations were higher during hGIP1-42 infusion compared with saline in healthy individuals (294(88) vs. -82(53)pmol/L×min,p=0.0025), but not significantly higher in patients with T2D(586(314) vs. -120(53),p=0.070). At target hypoglycemia , PP levels surged in both groups during both hGIP1-42 and saline infusions.In isolated pancreata, pGIP1-42 increased PP output in the pancreatic venous effluent (baseline vs. infusion, 24(5) vs. 79(16)pmol/min x min,p=0.044).GIP1-42 increases plasma PP secretion in healthy individuals, patients with T2D and isolated porcine pancreata. Hyperglycemia blunts the stimulatory effect of hGIP1-42 in healthy individuals, but not in patients with T2D.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Helminth infection has both nutritional and immunological impact on their definitive hosts. Thus, a cross-sectional study was performed to see the effects of OV infection on glucose and lipid profiles. For this purpose, 200 each of OV infected and uninfected residents were recruited and their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) levels and anthropometric measurements, including BMI were examined. Then, as the prospective follow- up study, changes of those metabolic parameters of OV positive subjects (n = 120) before and after Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment were monitored for six months. The results showed that OV infection has a protective effect against hyperglycemia (OR 0.482 and p = .04) and metabolic disease risk group (OR 0.478 and p = .03). OV positive participants had lower HbA1c (5.5% Vs. 6.01%, p = .001) but higher HDL (54.07 Vs. 49.46 mg/dL, p = .001) than OV negative participants that are statistically significant. After PZQ treatment for OV-positive subjects, their serum levels of HbA1c (p < .05) and HDL (p < .05) significantly rose during the follow up. Apparently, OV infection lowers HbA1c but increases HDL in definitive human hosts.Copyright © 2019.

Yet, these relationships are based on studies that relied on estimated GFR (eGFR), estimates of insulin sensitivity, or both. We aimed to verify the relationship between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic function by gold standard methods in adults with T2D.Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value) (glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min) and renal hemodynamic function by urinary inulin (GFR) and para-aminohippuric acid (effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) clearances in participants with T2D without overt kidney disease. Filtration fraction (FF) (GFR/ERPF) was calculated. Relationships between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic parameters were examined by multivariable linear regression. Renal hemodynamic parameters were examined across tertiles of M values.We tested 44 adults with T2D, of whom 77% were male, with mean ± SD age 63 ± 7 years, BMI 31.2 ± 4.0 kg/m, and HbA 7.4 ± 0.6%. Average GFR was 110 ± 26 mL/min, with an FF of 22.1 ± 2.8% and median 24-h urinary albumin excretion of 11.3 mg (interquartile range 5.8-17.0). Average M value was 5.6 ± 2.9 mg/kg ⋅ min. Insulin sensitivity inversely correlated with GFR ( = -0.44,  < 0.01) and FF ( = -0.40,  < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after multivariable adjustments for age, sex, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use, and HbA. In addition, GFR, FF, and urinary albumin excretion were highest in the participants in the lowest M value tertile.For the first time, we demonstrate that impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction by gold standard techniques in adults with T2D treated with metformin monotherapy.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672670>Metabolic Syndrome: A Major Risk Factor for Morbidity & Mortality in Severely Injured Trauma Patients.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases cardiovascular risk and is associated with poor patient outcomes. We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of , hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related metabolism in the central nervous system, especially in type 2  (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

It has been shown that dexamethasone promotes t-tubule development in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and that cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout (GRKO) leads to heart failure. Here, we studied if the t-system is altered in GRKO hearts and if GR signalling is required for t-system preservation in adult cardiomyocytes. Confocal and 3D STED microscopy of myocardium from cardiomyocyte-specific GRKO mice revealed decreased t-system density and increased distances between ryanodine receptors (RyR) and L-type Ca channels (LTCC). Because t-system remodelling and heart failure are intertwined, we investigated the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Ventricular cardiomyocytes from failing human and healthy adult rat hearts cultured in the absence of glucocorticoids (CTRL) showed distinctively lower t-system density than cells treated with dexamethasone (EC 1.1 nM) or corticosterone. The GR antagonist mifepristone abrogated the effect of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone improved RyR-LTCC coupling and synchrony of intracellular Ca release, but did not alter expression levels of t-system-associated proteins junctophilin-2 (JPH2), bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) or caveolin-3 (CAV3). Rather, dexamethasone upregulated LC3B and increased autophagic flux. The broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine prevented dexamethasone-induced upregulation of autophagy and t-system preservation, and autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A and chloroquine accelerated t-system loss. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or amino acid starvation preserved the t-system. These findings suggest that GR signalling and autophagy are critically involved in t-system preservation and remodelling in the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668589>Multifocal (tarsus and knee) activation of neuroarthropathy following rapid glycaemic correction.</a></h2><p>To report a case of neuroarthropathy in the tarsus and knee following rapid glycaemic normalisation in a female patient with type I .A retrospective review of case notes.We describe the case of a female patient with type I  who had developed a multifocal neuroarthropathy in only six months, probably due to a rapid glycaemic normalisation.

Diabetic rats were administered with METS at a dose of (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively orally) and standard drug Metformin (300 mg/kg) was given orally to group serving positive control. Effect of the METS on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, antioxidant status, histopathology of pancreas and also on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, cell cycleof pancreatic islet cells were studied in diabetic rats.The major phytochemicals identified and quantified by HPLC in the extract were berberine, caffeic acid, myricetin and ferulic acid. This result showed that methanol extract exhibited good antioxidant effect. The methanol extract of the plant prevented the diabetogenic effect of STZ and significantly lowered the fasting blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin and increased insulin and C-peptide level in treated rats. METS reduced apoptosis of STZ treated islet cells by significantly decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL6), intracellular ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and sub-G peak area, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.The results revealed that the methanol extract of the stem of the plant possesses protective effects against  and associated complications.Copyright © 2019.

Adjustments were made for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, use of anti-diabetic medication and optimal blood glucose control.Prevalence of type 2  in rural, urban and migrant lean participants were 3.5%, 8.9% and 7.5% respectively, representing 55.4%, 35.6%, 13.2% of all participants with type 2 . Compared with lean rural participants, the odds of type 2  were higher in lean urban participants (adjusted OR = 8.81, 95% CI = 6.56-11.06), followed by migrants (5.27, 95% CI = 3.51-6.91). Irrespective of site, determinants of type 2  in lean participants include; presence of hypertension, physical inactivity, hypercholesterolemia and age (>45 years).Our study shows a high prevalence of type 2  among lean African populations in different geographical settings. Future studies are needed in-order to examine how contextual differences are related to the pathophysiology of type 2  in lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 by the Journal of Global Health.

There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including cancer, , cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their microbiome has not been studied. To determine the role of microbiota on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the microbiota by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut microbiota plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 , insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665268>Combinations of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Predictors for Prognoses in Patients with Acute Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>In contemporary heart failure (HF) practice, prognostic value for combinations of cardiac and non-cardiac predictors remains poorly understood. We analyzed combinatorial predictors of outcomes in acute HF patients.This longitudinal cohort study included consecutive patients admitted for acute decompensated HF between April 2015 and March 2018 in an urban hospital. The main outcomes are HF readmission within 6 months after discharge or all-cause death. A total of 451 patients with 662 admissions were enrolled and the data including frailty and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed by multivariate and matched cohort analyses.The mean age of patients was 76.8 years. We constructed a Multi-frailty Index (MFI) ranging from 0 to 3 points as a composite of non-cardiac comorbidities and biopsychosocial frailty. In matched cohort of patients with EF ≧50% (HFpEF), MFI ≧1, pulmonary hypertension (peak flow velocity of tricuspid regurgitation ≧2.9 m/s by echocardiography), and pancytopenia at discharge were strong predictors of HF readmission (Odds ratios, 4.33, 2.5, and 2.86; p = 0.02, 0.05, and 0.02, respectively), and MFI ≧2 was the only predictor for all-cause death. For EF < 40%, age, BNP ≧800 pg/ml, increase in estimated GFR during hospitalization, and lymphocytopenia plus anemia predicted HF readmission (Odds ratios, 1.77, 2.72, 0.73, and 2.89; p = 0.001, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively). In contrast,  was the only specific predictor found in patients over 80 years old.These data identified multi-frailty and pulmonary hypertension or mild pancytopenia as synergistic predictors of HF readmission in HFpEF patients.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between muscle fatigability and micro and macrovascular complications in patients with T2DM.One-hundred and forty-six patients with T2DM (80 males, 66 females, aged 66.9 ± 7.9 years) were recruited. Maximal voluntary contraction (MCV) and endurance time (ET, 50% of the MVC) were assessed at the knee extensor muscles with an isometric dynamometer. Univariate and multivariate correlations of ET values with diabetic complications, a wide range of surrogate measures of these sequelae, and cardiovascular risk factors were examined.A higher muscle fatigability was detected in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN, ET: -32.4%), cardiovascular disease (CVD, ET: -32.1%), retinopathy (ET: -35.8%), and nephropathy (ET: -30.4%). At univariate analysis, muscle fatigability was associated with age, physical activity level,  duration, HbA , systolic blood pressure, albuminuria, eGFR, and several parameters of nervous and vascular function. Multivariate analysis showed that, after adjusting for covariates, ET was independently associated with sensory nerve conduction velocity, vibration perception threshold at malleolus, and ankle-brachial index. In addition, ET values were independently associated with the presence of DPN, CVD, and retinopathy.In T2DM, muscle fatigability is associated with presence of DPN, CVD, and retinopathy. Such defect appears to be mediated predominantly by sensory nerve and peripheral vascular dysfunction.This article is protected by copyright.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2  (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669136>No evidence of tachyphylaxis for insulinotropic actions of Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) in subjects with type 2 , their first-degree relatives, or in healthy subjects.</a></h2><p>In patients with type 2 , the lost insulinotropic effect of the incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is more apparent after continuous versus bolus administration. To test whether the difference might be explained by rapid tachyphylaxis in response to elevated concentrations of GIP, and whether patients with type 2  and their relatives are more susceptible to tachyphylaxis than healthy subjects.In a two-way crossover design, insulinotropic responses to repeated bolus injection (50 pmol/kg body weight at 30 and 120 min) and continuous infusion of GIP (2 pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min) under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions (8.5 mmol/l) was compared in age- gender- and weight-matched patients with type 2 , first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects.Insulin secretory responses to the first and second GIP bolus were not significantly different in any of the subject groups. Subjects with type 2  had a significant relative impairment versus healthy subjects with continuous (C-peptide, -13.2 %, p < 0.05), but not with repeated bolus administration of GIP (+11.1 %, n.s.). First-degree relatives tended to hyper-secrete insulin with bolus or continuous administrations of GIP.Rapid tachyphylaxis in response to continuous exposure to slightly supraphysiological concentrations of GIP does not explain the reduced insulinotropic response to GIP infusions in patients with type 2  or their first-degree relatives.Copyright © 2019.

The data collected consisted of the total procedures performed, demographic characteristics of the study population, rates of success, aborted procedure, failure, complications, and catheter survival, and costs.the main causes of end stage renal disease (ESRD) were systemic arterial hypertension and , 37.9% each. Patients had a high number of previous arteriovenous fistula (1.72 ± 0.84) and temporary catheter (2.87 ± 1.9) attempts until a definitive vascular access was achieved, while the preferred vascular site was right internal jugular vein (80%). Success, abortion, and failure rates were 93.3%, 2.7% and 4%, respectively, with only 5.36% of complications (minors). Overall LTCVC survival rates over 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 93.38, 71.81, 54.36, and 30.2%, respectively, with a mean of 298 ± 280 days (median 198 days). The procedure cost was around 496 dollars.

Bishkhapra (Trianthema portulacastrum Linn.) is a well-known common weed belonging to the family Aizoaceae. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated from this weed and widely used against several diseases. The present study evaluated the protective and therapeutic efficacies of T. portulacastrum against atherosclerosis in a rat model. The animals were divided into the sham, control (- + atherosclerosis-inducing diet), 100 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, and positive control groups. Blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and other lipid parameters, as well as the expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124), were measured. Glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced to near normal levels. The serum levels of fibrinogen, sVCAM-1, and oxidized low density lipoproteins were substantially increased in control rats. Treatment with the T. portulacastrum extract reversed these levels to near normal levels. The mRNA expression of GPR124 was increased by 150% in the control group. However, treatment with T. portulacastrum extract decreased the mRNA expression up to 40% compared with the control group. Rats treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum extract showed a decrease in GPR124 protein expression by 9.5% and 33.3%, respectively. Taken together, the results suggest that an extract of T. portulacastrum is effective against atherosclerosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671625>Maternal Obesity during Pregnancy Alters Daily Activity and Feeding Cycles, and Hypothalamic Clock Gene Expression in Adult Male Mouse Offspring.</a></h2><p>An obesogenic diet adversely affects the endogenous mammalian circadian clock, altering daily activity and metabolism, and resulting in obesity. We investigated whether an obese pregnancy can alter the molecular clock in the offspring hypothalamus, resulting in changes to their activity and feeding rhythms. Female mice were fed a control (C, 7% kcal fat) or high fat diet (HF, 45% kcal fat) before mating and throughout pregnancy. Male offspring were fed the C or HF diet postweaning, resulting in four offspring groups: C/C, C/HF, HF/C, and HF/HF.

There were 168 females and 154 males with a median age of 71 years (range: 60-89 yrs).PROST (Project in Sado for Total Health), a medical database in Sado island Japan, was analyzed.Data on pure-tone audiometry, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), polymorphism of apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), , hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption were extracted. Hearing impairment was defined as an average frequency between 0.25 and 8 kHz that exceeded 30 dB. Multivariate analysis was used to identify which of the above factors could predict the hearing impairment. Hearing threshold of each Hz was compared between the ApoE4 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) groups.Among various factors, only low MMSE scores (<24) showed significant association with hearing impairment. There were no differences in the hearing threshold of all frequencies between ApoE status groups.Hearing impairment was associated with low MMSE sores, regardless of the ApoE4 status. If ApoE4 status would be a common upstream predictor for both the hearing and cognitive impairment, hearing threshold would be related to ApoE4 status.

Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour.  (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin acetate, confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer. It should be considered in the elderly patients presenting with new-onset central DI with or without anterior pituitary dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664994>Obesity,  and the risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, , family history of colon cancer was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04).

Primary outcome was disease remission after drug withdrawal or surgery. Secondary outcomes were biochemical control and side effects during dopamine agonist treatment and postoperative complications. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled proportions. Robustness of results was assessed by sensitivity analyses.A total of 1469 articles were screened: 55 (10 low risk of bias) on medical treatment (n=3564 patients) and 25 (12 low risk of bias) on transsphenoidal surgery (n=1836 patients). Long-term disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal was 34% (95%CI 26-46%) and 67% (95% CI 60-74%) after surgery. Subgroup analysis of microprolactinomas showed 36% (95% CI 21-52%) disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal and 83% (95% CI 76-90%) after surgery. Biochemical control was achieved in 81% (95% CI 75-87%) of patients during dopamine agonists with side effects in 26% (95%CI 13-41%). Transsphenoidal surgery resulted in 0% mortality, 2% (95% CI 0-5%) permanent , and 3% (95% CI 2-5%) cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Multiple sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.In the majority of prolactinoma patients disease remission can be achieved through surgery, with low risks of long-term surgical complications, and disease remission is less often achieved with dopamine agonists.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672891>Measles virus infection diminishes preexisting antibodies that offer protection from other pathogens.</a></h2><p>Measles virus is directly responsible for more than 100,000 deaths yearly. Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669241>The current and future perspectives of zinc oxide nanoparticles in the treatment of .</a></h2><p> (DM) is a multifaceted and costly disease, which requires serious attention.

Amongst the 1023 adults, mean change in HbA1c was - 0.56% (95% CI - 0.76, - 0.36); for the 447 children and adolescents, mean change in HbA1c was - 0.54% (95% CI - 0.84, - 0.23). Based on regression analysis, the degree of change in HbA1c correlated with the initial HbA1c of the study population. A longitudinal analysis in adult subjects (n = 1276) shows that HbA1c fell within the first 2 months and changes were sustained up to 12 months. No significant differences were detected between T1D and T2D.The meta-analysis reported here confirms that starting the FreeStyle Libre system as part of  care results in a significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c for adults and children with T1D and for adults with T2D.Abbott  Care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662880>A mHealth Support Program for Australian Young Adults with Type 1 : A Mixed Methods Study.</a></h2><p>Young adulthood is a life stage comprised of many turning points. For young adults with type 1  (T1DM),  self-management support is crucial during this period. There is a lack of  education programs and services tailored to this population. This paper presents the findings, according to the STROBE guidelines, on the usability and acceptability of a patient-informed mHealth support program ( YES) that was developed for young adults with T1DM.A total of 34 young adults aged 18-35 years with T1DM participated in the  YES program over 12 weeks. Google analytics was used to tracked website use, while a website usability survey measured ease of use. Facebook analytics was used to measure peer support engagement. Evaluation of the program was completed using Likert scales and open-ended questions.Participants rated the website favourably for its ease of navigation and easy to understand information. Web page visits declined sharply while peer support group engagement through Facebook remained consistent throughout the intervention period. Participants utilised weekly discussion topics to generate conversation within the peer support group. Emotional support from peers was the highest regarded benefit reported by participants. YES is an example of an mHealth support program that was readily accepted by young adults living with T1DM. Feasibility studies are an important formative step in the implementation of mHealth programs within mainstream healthcare. Future work should focus on the adaptability of such programs to fit within larger consumer or healthcare organisations.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672503>Adherence to guideline recommended medical therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence to guideline recommended medical therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CCLI).We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1315 admissions performed in our Department, focusing on diabetic foot patients (842 - 64%) of which 603 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients with CCLI (M/F(%): 73/27; age: 70.3±10.4 yrs;  duration: 17.3±13.7 yrs; BMI: 27.7±5.3 Kg/m; HbA1c 7.8±1.8%) referred to a third-level Center from 2011 to 2015. We focused on medical therapy of , dyslipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and smoke habits.In total, at admission, 66.6% of patients had HbA1c levels higher than recommended; 65.9% of patients were on statins; 81.4 % on anti-hypertensive treatment and 72.4% on antiplatelet drugs. Concerning smoke habits, 27% of patients were no-smokers; 41% former smokers and 32% active smokers. Among all patients, only 24% were prescribed all five guideline recommended therapies while 32% reached four out of five of these. As for patients treated with anti-hypertensive drugs, we observed higher levels of systolic pressure (138.0±29.5 vs 107.7±36.6 p<0.02) while no differences were observed in diastolic pressure levels.In conclusion, when it comes to diabetic patients with a severe limb and life threatening clinical condition, we noticed a lower-than-expected application of international guideline-recommended medical therapies. In fact, only one out of four patients was following all the recommended therapies. Nevertheless, these patients did not reach the standard targets requested to prevent cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019.

Multislice CT (MSCT) is a non-invasive alternative to coronary angiography (CAG) suggested for patients with a low-to-intermediate risk of CAD. No established definition of such patients exists. Our purpose was to develop a simple score to identify as large a group as possible with a suitable pretest risk of CAD.Retrospective study of patients in Denmark undergoing CAG due to newly diagnosed HF from 2010 to 2014. All Danish patients were registered in two databases according to geographical location. We used data from one registry and multiple logistic regression with backwards elimination to find predictors of CAD and used the derived OR to develop a clinical risk score called the CT-HF score, which was subsequently validated in the other database.The main cohort consisted of 2171 patients and the validation cohort consisted of 2795 patients with 24% and 27% of patients having significant CAD, respectively. Among significant predictor, the strongest was extracardiac arteriopathy (OR 2.84). Other significant factors were male sex, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, , angina and age. A proposed cut-off of 9 points identified 61% of patients with a 15% risk of having CAD, resulting in an estimated savings of 15% of the cost and 21% of the radiation.A simple score based on clinical risk factors could identify HF patients with a low risk of CAD; these patients may have benefitted from MSCT as a gatekeeper for CAG.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Enhanced thromboxane (TX)-dependent platelet activation plays a pivotal role in atherothrombosis and characterizes type 2  (DM). Whether this also pertains to IGT is currently unknown. We investigated whether TXA -dependent platelet activation, as reflected by 11-dehydro-TXB (TXM) urinary excretion, is comparably abnormal in IGT as in DM; is persistent over long-term follow-up; changes as a function of metabolic disease progression; is influenced by food intake.We prospectively investigated subjects with IGT (n=48), and two control groups with DM diagnosed either <12 months (n=60) or ≥12 months (n=58).Baseline TXM excretion was comparable between subjects with IGT and DM, with no evidence of a circadian variation.

However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180.5 ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, , and hyperlipidaemia): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes. Reverse remodelling was associated with improved long-term prognosis.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of  and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

We obtained data on person- and health-related characteristics at metformin initiation from these collections and calculated medication possession ratios from pharmacy dispensing data. Regression modelling was used to assess changes in adherence over time.We identified 85,066 people with T2DM who initiated metformin monotherapy. Lower adherence to metformin monotherapy was associated with time since initiating metformin, younger age and being of Māori or Pacific ethnicity. Higher adherence was associated with receiving more non-diabetic medications, a history of CVD and recent cancer registration.Our findings are consistent with international literature and highlight groups of people who experience poor adherence over time. Understanding the drivers of lower adherence in Māori and Pacific peoples is a particular priority given the high prevalence of T2DM in these populations.Copyright © 2019.

The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy weight change on the risk of developing gestational , pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate.Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy weight change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy weight change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis.Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy weight gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational , pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy weight gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m.These findings confirm that interpregnancy weight change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum weight loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy weight before conceiving again.

Polymer-free DES (PF-DES) have offered promising angiographic results, with earlier complete re-endothelization, potentially reducing the thrombotic risk and offering the option of a shorter antiplatelet therapy. However, contrasting prognostic data have been reported so far with PF-DES. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a comprehensive updated meta-analysis of randomized trials (RCT) comparing the impact of PF-DES vs polymer- coated DES (PC-DES) on clinical outcome.Literature and main scientific session abstracts were searched for RCTs comparing PF-DES vs PC-DES for the treatment of CAD. The primary efficacy endpoint was mortality, secondary endpoints were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and stent thrombosis.We included 16 randomized clinical trials, with a total of 15,689 patients, including 50.6% randomized to PF-DES. At a median follow-up of 24 months, PF-DES were associated to a significant reduction in mortality as compared to PC-DES (0.82 [0.68, 0.99], p = .03, I2 = 0%; phet = 0.93). However, no significant benefit was observed in terms of cardiovascular death or major ischemic endpoints (respectively CV death: OR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.71, 1.18] p = .50, I2 = 0.50; phet = 0.84; MI: OR [95% CI] = 1.08 [0.90, 1.29], p = .42; I2 = 0%, phet = 0.98; TLR: OR [95% CI] = 1.02 [0.78, 1.32], p = .91; I2 = 0.63 phet = 0.0003; ST: OR [95% CI] = 0.98 [0.87, 1.10], p = .72; I2 = 0% phet = 0.64). By meta-regression analysis, the mortality benefits of PF-DES were not conditioned by the rate of  or acute coronary syndromes.Based on the current meta-analysis, PF-DES are associated to a significant reduction in mortality as compared to PC-DES, but not in the occurrence of major ischemic events.

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and AKT in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with , atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO metabolism in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The amplified response of TSH to slight changes in thyroid hormone levels provides a large and easily measured signal in the routine care setting. Laboratories provide reference ranges with upper and lower cutoffs for TSH to define normal thyroid function. The upper limit of the range, used to diagnose subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism, is itself a matter for debate, with authoritative guidelines recommending treatment to within the lower half of the range. Concomitant diseases, medications, supplements, age, gender, ethnicity, iodine status, time of day, time of year, autoantibodies, heterophilic antibodies, smoking, and other factors influence the level of TSH, or the performance of current TSH assays. The long-term prognostic implications of small deviations of TSH from the reference range are unclear. Correction of TSH to within the reference range does not always bring thyroid and other biomarkers into range and will not always resolve the patient's symptoms. Overt hypothyroidism requires intervention with levothyroxine. It remains important that physicians managing a patient with symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease consider all of the patient's relevant disease, lifestyle, and other factors before intervening on the basis of a marginally raised TSH level alone. Finally, these limitations of TSH testing mitigate against screening the population for the undoubtedly substantial prevalence of undiagnosed thyroid disease, until appropriately designed randomised trials have quantified the benefits and harms from this approach.Copyright © 2019 Salman Razvi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671197>Protecting Vision in Patients With  With Ultra-Widefield Imaging: A Review of Current Literature.</a></h2><p>Ultra-widefield fundus imaging (UWFI) is a relatively new technology capable of capturing 200° images of the retina. Since vision changes can be irreversible in diabetic retinopathy (DR), recognition of prognostic biomarkers in the peripheral retina may prove invaluable toward optimizing the management and reducing the societal burden of this blinding disease. Following a bibliographic review using Pubmed, OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, the current review systematically examined 13 studies that compared UWFI to conventional screening techniques such as seven standard field (7SF) Early Treatment In Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and non-mydriatic multifield fundus photography (NMFP), as well as their scientific level of evidence. Overall, UWFI had good agreement with 7SF ETDRS and NMFP, and moderate agreement with dilated fundus examination. Seven additional studies were examined that considered the significance of peripheral lesions found on UWFI. These studies demonstrated that UWFI captured additional DR pathology in the peripheral retina that may not be evident if evaluation is limited to the posterior pole and may be relevant to patient outcomes. Future directions include but are not limited to the potential of UWFI to track the progression of DR with treatment.

In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± 2.7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12.5 ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.2% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Unfortunately, current MHCII-αβ chain heterodimerization strategies are typically associated with low production yields and require the use of foreign affinity tags for purification, precluding therapeutic applications in humans. Here, we show that fusion of peptide-tethered or empty MHCII-αβ chains to the IgG1-Fc mutated to form knob-into-hole structures results in the assembly of highly stable pMHCII monomers. This design enables the expression and rapid purification of challenging pMHCII types at high yields without the need for leucine zippers and purification affinity tags. Importantly, this design increases the antigen-receptor signaling potency of multimerized derivatives useful for therapeutic applications and facilitates the detection and amplification of low-avidity T cell specificities in biological samples using flow cytometry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665323>Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening II: effect of treating maternal sub-optimal thyroid function on child behaviour.</a></h2><p>The Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening (CATS) study was the first randomised controlled trial to investigate effects of treating suboptimal-gestational-thyroid-function (SGTF) on child cognition. Since observational studies indicated that SGTF may also increase symptoms of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the CATS cohort was used to investigate whether treatment of mothers affected their children's behavior.Mothers (N=475) completed 3 questionnaires, strengths and difficulties (SDQ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social communication (SCQ, used as a screen for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)), about their children (aged 9.5 years). Group comparisons of total scores, numbers of children above clinical thresholds and association between high maternal FT4 (>97.5th percentile of the UK cohort, 'over-treated') and child neurodevelopment were reported.There were no differences in total scores between normal-GTF (n=246), treated (n=125) and untreated (n=104) SGTF groups. More children of treated mothers scored above clinical thresholds, particularly the over-treated. Scores were above thresholds in SDQ conduct 22% vs 7%, SCQ total scores 7% vs 1%, and ADHD hyperactivity 17% vs 5% when comparing over-treated (n=40) and untreated (N=100) respectively. We identified significantly higher mean scores for SDQ conduct (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.021 to 1.431, P=0.040, effect size 0.018) and ADHD hyperactivity (AMD 1.60, CI 0.361 to 2.633, P=0.003, effect size 0.028) comparing over-treated with normal-GTF children.There was no overall association between SGTF and offspring ADHD, ASD or behavior questionnaire scores. However, children of 'over-treated' mothers displayed significantly more ADHD symptoms and behavioral difficulties than normal-GTF. Thyroxine supplementation during pregnancy requires monitoring to avoid over-treatment.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

Our aim was to
obtain updated information about characteristics of stroke patients and management of stroke across the Ibero-American countries, using a common in-hospital registry (Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–Sociedad Iberoamericana de Enfermedades Cerebrovasculares) as a basis for further quality improvement.Data for this study were entered into the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke registry from September
2009 to December 2013 by 58 centers in 14 countries. Data included demographics, risk factors, onset-to-door time, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, stroke subtype, ischemic stroke etiology, treatments, 3-month mortality, and modified Rankin Scale score. Time to treatment was also recorded for patients treated with thrombolysis.Five thousand four hundred one patients were registered; median age, 65 years; 46% women; 3915 (72.5%)
ischemic strokes; 686 (13.7%) hemorrhagic strokes; 213 (4.3%) subarachnoid hemorrhages; 414 (8.3%) transient ischemic attacks; and 31 (0.6%) cerebral vein thrombosis. The most prevalent risk factors were hypertension (71.3%), dyslipidemia (35.2%), and  (23.6%). Atrial fibrillation was present in 15.1%. Three hundred one ischemic strokes were treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT; 7.7%). Patients undergoing IVT were more severely affected (median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 11 versus 6). The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages after IVT was 5.7%. At 3 months, 60.3% of IVT-treated patients and 59.1% of untreated patients were independent (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2). Mortality was 11.4% in treated and 12.8% in untreated patients.Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–Sociedad Iberoamericana de Enfermedades Cerebrovasculares
is the largest registry of a general stroke population and the first study to evaluate the level of IVT use in Ibero-America.

The Afirma Gene Sequencing Classifier (GSC) was developed to improve the specificity of the Gene Expression Classifier (GEC). Independent studies are needed to assess the performance of GSC.The aim was to compare the performance of GEC and GSC in the assessment of indeterminate nodules.Retrospective analysis of Bethesda III and IV nodules tested with GEC or GSC in an academic center between December 2011 and September 2018. Benign call rates (BCR) and surgical outcomes were compared. Histopathologic data were collected on nodules that were surgically resected to calculate measures of test performance.The BCR was 41% (73/178) for GEC and 67.8% (82/121) for GSC (p<0.001). Among specimens with dominant Hürthle cell cytology, the BCR was 22% (6/27) for GEC and 63.2% (12/19) for GSC (p=0.005). The overall surgery rate decreased from 47.8% in the GEC group to 34.7% in the GSC group (p=0.025). One GEC-benign and three GSC-benign nodules proved to be malignant in surgical excision. GSC had a statistically significant higher specificity (94% vs 60%, p<0.001) and positive predictive value (PPV) (85.3% vs 40%, p<0.001) compared to GEC. While sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) dropped with GSC (97.0% vs 90.6% and 98.6% vs 96.3%, respectively), these differences were not significantly different.GSC reclassified more indeterminate nodules as benign and improved the specificity and PPV of the test. These enhancements appear to be resulting in fewer diagnostic surgeries.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

Currently, there is no descriptive study for the presentation of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SSAH) in our institution. Therefore, our primary aim is to make a retrospective analysis of adult patients with SSAH and assess the need for a DSA after an initially aneurysm-negative CTA in non-aneurysmal SAH, specifically perimesencephalic SAH (PM-SAH).Medical records of 324 adult patients with aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal SAH treated at the Puerto Rico Medical Center from 2015 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographics, past medical history, clinical characteristics and imaging information was extracted.Acute hydrocephalus, mortality at 30 days, prevalence of diffuse SAH pattern, Fisher and WFNS grades >2 on initial exam were higher in the aneurysmal SAH sub-group. Patients with non-aneurysmal SAH had a significantly higher prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease and . 100% of the non-aneurysmal PM SAH with an initial aneurysm-negative CTA were subsequently confirmed by DSA.Patients in the aneurysmal SAH sub-group correlated with an increased disease burden. Furthermore, this study shows that in our population, patients with non-aneurysmal PM-SAH with a low Fisher and WFNS grade and with comorbid  and Chronic Kidney Disease, may not need a DSA after a negative initial CTA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to 1) enhance the existing ACS NSQIP SRC with functionality to predict geriatric-specific outcomes and 2) assess the predictive value of geriatric-specific risk factors by comparing performance in outcome prediction using the traditional ACS NSQIP SRC versus models that also included geriatric risk factors.Data were collected from 21 ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project (GSPP) hospitals between 2014-2017. Hierarchical regression models predicted four postoperative geriatric outcomes (i.e. pressure ulcer, delirium, new mobility aid use, and functional decline) using the traditional 21-variable ACS NSQIP SRC models and 27-variable models that included six geriatric risk factors (i.e. living situation, fall history, mobility aid use, cognitive impairment, surrogate-signed consent, and palliative care on admission).Data from 38,048 patients ages ≥ 65 undergoing 197 unique operations across 10 surgical subspecialties were used. Stable model discrimination and calibration between developmental and validation datasets confirmed predictive validity. Models with and without geriatric risk factors demonstrated excellent performance (c-statistics > 0.8) with inclusion of geriatric risk factors improving performance. Of the 21 ACS NSQIP variables, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), age, functional dependence, sex, disseminated cancer, , and sepsis were the strongest risk predictors, while impaired cognition, fall history, and mobility aid use were the strongest geriatric predictors.The ACS NSQIP SRC can predict four unique outcomes germane to geriatric surgical patients, with improvement of predictive capability after accounting for geriatric risk factors. Augmentation of ACS NSQIP SRC may enhance shared decision-making to improve the quality of surgical care in older adults.Copyright © 2019.

Androgen is suggested not only to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis but also to affect metabolism. In this study, Glp1r mRNA was found widely expressed in normal male mice and its levels were positively correlated with the serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Using mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells, which highly express GLP-1R, we observed GLP-1R was upregulated both at transcriptional and protein levels induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and was downregulated by androgen receptor inhibitor ARN-509 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Glp1r mRNA. In normal C57BL/6 mice and db/db mice, Glp1r mRNA levels in the pancreases increased in the DHT treatment group and decreased in the ARN-509 treatment group. And the increased GLP-1R expression had insulinotropic function both in vitro and in vivo. Further analysis showed that the androgen receptor (Ar) located in the cytosol of MIN6 cells and translocated to the nucleus after DHT treatment. In addition, we found that there was an Ar motif in the promoter region of the Glp1r gene. Further studies revealed that the translocated DHT/Ar complex from the cytosol to the nucleus bound to the Ar motif of the Glp1r gene and upregulated gene transcription. Taken together, the widely expressed GLP-1R was positively regulated by androgen under physiological condition and in diabetic models at the transcriptional level.Copyright © 2019.

To facilitate the early diagnosis of SFN, biomarkers for SFN must be identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of SFN in prediabetic patients and the relationship between pNF-H and SFN.44 IGT patients (inpatients and outpatients) were selected at random. 33 healthy subjects served as controls. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were collected. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), electromyography (EMG), and Sudoscan were performed, and pNF-H was measured by ELISA.24 of the 44 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were diagnosed with SFN according to the modified Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group consensus criteria. The thermal sensory thresholds of the IGT-SFN group were significantly different from those of the CTRL group (p < 0.05), except for the heat pain threshold. The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) of the sural nerve was 12.39 in the IGT-SFN group, which was significantly lower than those in the other groups. No significant difference in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was observed among the three groups. The electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) in the IGT-SFN group was 69.78 ± 14.03uS, which was significantly lower than that in the CTRL group. The pNF-H in the IGT-SFN group was 170.6 (140.0, 223.6) pg/ml, which was significantly higher than those in the CTRL and IGT-non-SFN groups (76.55 and 64.7 pg/ml, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that pNF-H and 2h plasma glucose were independently correlated with SFN; the ORs (95% CI) were 1.429 (1.315, 1.924) and 2.375 (1.157, 4.837), respectively.Serum pNF-H may be associated with SFN in IGT patients, and serum pNF-H could therefore serve as a sensitive biomarker for the detection of SFN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671800>The Usefulness of Anthropometric Indices to Identify the Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Despite several papers having been published on the association between adiposity and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), it is still difficult to determine unambiguously which of the indices of nutritional status is the best to identify MetS. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of six anthropometric indices to identify MetS in the Polish population. The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International  Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = 5.83), WHtR (OR = 5.70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = 5.65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27.2 kg/m. The weakest predictor of the syndrome was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR. The optimal cut-off points for WHtR equaled 0.56 in men and 0.54 in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672448>Effects of newer antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis: think out of the box!</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western societies and a major cause of hepatic disease worldwide. Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2  (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that RCCs are being more commonly diagnosed in children with endocrine-related diseases and most of the RCCs show neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).After approval by the local ethics committee, the medical records and contrast-enhanced pituitary MRI of 833 children (boys/girls, 338/495; mean age±SD, 9.4±3.7 years) were retrospectively reviewed between January 2016 and January 2019. The size, location, signal intensities, and postcontrast enhancement pattern of RCCs were assessed by a pediatric radiologist. Same imaging features were also independently reviewed by another radiologist to determine the interobserver agreement by using the kappa statistics (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).RCC was evident on MRI in 13.5% of the patients (boys/girls, 39/74; mean age±SD, 9.8±3.9 years). The mean size of RCCs was 5.5 mm (range, 3.1-8.5 mm). An RCC frequency higher than expected was found in patients with central precocious puberty, , and hypersecretion of prolactin (P = 0.007). The mean size of RCCs did not show significant differences among the clinical indications for MRI (P ≥ 0.461). All RCCs showed abnormal signal on T2-weighted image and most (89%) showed neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content (i.e., isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging compared with the normal anterior pituitary gland). Eighty-four patients with RCCs (74%) had follow-up MRI and the mean follow-up was 1.5 years. In follow-ups, five RCCs disappeared; the mean size of 10 RCCs increased and that of 6 RCCs decreased. These size changes were not statistically significant (P = 0.376). No signal intensity changes of RCCs were seen during the follow-up, except for 4 RCCs, whose protein content increased over time and T1 signals increased on imaging. Interobserver agreements were almost perfect for the MRI findings of RCCs (κ and ICC range, 0.81-1, P < 0.001).RCCs were not uncommon in patients examined for endocrine-related diseases, and nearly 1 in 10 patients had an RCC. The size and signal intensities of RCCs may change over time and the evolution of RCCs is unpredictable. Most RCCs showed neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content on MRI, and all RCCs had an abnormal signal on T2-weighted imaging, thus eliminating the need to administer a contrast agent at follow-up imaging of the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672299>Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and is frequently encountered in clinical practice.

We describe a mixed methods formative study of health professional's perspectives of antenatal and post-partum  screening and management, including enablers and barriers to care.Health professionals involved in providing  care in pregnancy, from a range of health services across the Northern Territory, completed the survey (n = 82) and/or took part in interviews and/or focus groups (n = 62).Qualitative findings highlighted factors influencing the delivery of care as reported by health professionals, including: whose responsibility it is, access to care, the baby is the focus and pre-conception care. The main challenges were related to: disjointed systems and confusion around whose role it is to provide follow-up care beyond six weeks post-partum. Quantitative findings indicated that the majority of health professionals reported confidence in their own skills to manage women in the antenatal period (62%, 40/79) and slightly lower rates of confidence in the postpartum interval (57%, 33/58).These findings regarding whose role it is to provide postpartum care, along with opportunities to improve communication pathways and follow up care have informed the design of a complex health intervention to improve health systems and the provision of DIP related care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672500>Relationship between glucose variability evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring and clinical factors, including glucagon-stimulated insulin secretion in patients with type 2 .</a></h2><p>To evaluate the clinical factors affecting daily and day-to-day glucose variability by using continuous glucose monitoring.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients with type 2  (T2DM) who underwent a glucagon stimulation test (GST) with 72 h of continuous glucose monitoring. Daily glucose variability was evaluated by mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV), and day-to-day glucose variability (mean of daily differences [MODD]) by using continuous glucose monitoring. Correlations of clinical factors, including insulin secretion ability by the GST with MAGE, %CV, and MODD, were analyzed.In 83 T2DM with insulin therapy, age and hemoglobin A (HbA) correlated with MAGE and %CV, fasting plasma glucose with MAGE and MODD, and increment of C-peptide immunoreactivity (ΔCPR) by GST correlated inversely with MAGE, %CV, and MODD. In 126 T2DM without insulin therapy, age, diastolic blood pressure, and triglycerides correlated with MODD, HbA with MAGE and MODD, and ΔCPR inversely correlated with %CV. Use of α-glucosidase inhibitors inversely correlated with %CV, whereas that of sulfonylurea was associated with MAGE and %CV.These results suggest that ΔCPR correlated with stability of glycemic control, whereas poorly controlled  is associated with increase in glucose variability. α-glucosidase inhibitors may be superior to sulfonylureas in reducing the glucose variability in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

A healthcare payer perspective was adopted, the time horizon was 30 years and the setting was Flanders (Belgium). Sensitivity analyses were performed.'ARS-awareness' was extendedly dominated. Per 10 000 participants, 'ARS-ILS' cost €13 210 256 more and gained 496 QALYs compared with 'doing nothing' (26 632 €/QALY), with a 63% probability of being cost effective, given a cost effectiveness threshold of 35 000 €/QALY. A scenario analysis showed that 'ARS-ILS' for 15 years only offered to women with prediabetes (compared with 'doing nothing') has an 89.5% likelihood of being dominant.'ARS-ILS' may be the preferred intervention. However, the probability of being cost effective was low. Based on further scenario analyses, we recommend healthcare decision makers to consider the application of a more intensive alternative, focused on the highest risk profiles and with a shorter intervention duration.© The Author(s) 2019.

The effect of antioxidant treatment was examined. was induced in adult male Wistar rats with a single dose of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg; i.p.). Diabetic animals were then randomly separated into three groups: No treatment (DM), resveratrol treatment, and taurine treatment, and fed with a high-fat diet. Age-matched non-diabetic animals were used and fed with normal diet (control). Two weeks later, animals were sacrificed and bladders were processed for histological evaluation, and further analysis for oxidative stress markers.The body weight of all diabetic animals was significantly lower compared to the controls. The DM group demonstrated a significantly higher bladder weight to body weight ratio compared to the control. The bladder in the DM group demonstrated abruption of the mucosa from the muscularis and edema in the transitional epithelium. Bladders from the resveratrol-, and taurine-treated groups did not demonstrate these histological alterations. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the bladder was significantly higher in the DM group compared to all other groups. Immunohistochemistry showed that  induced a moderate to strong expression of oxidative stress markers MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal, and DNA oxidative stress marker 8-deoxyguanosine in the DM group compared to the other groups.Prompt diagnosis and treatment of  is crucial in regard to disease progression. Specifically, in the bladder it appears that both mild damage at the structural level, as well as oxidative damage at the molecular level may be prevented by antioxidant treatment.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

We aimed to investigate the relation between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality.The participants were from a community-based health screening program in northern Taiwan during 2005-2008 (n = 118 645) and were followed up until 2014. Incidence of hospitalization for infection and infection-related death was ascertained from the National Health Insurance Database and National Death Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression modelling was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) between FPG and risk of infection.During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, the incidence rate of hospitalization for any infection was 36.33 and 14.26 per 1000 person-years among diabetics and nondiabetics, respectively, in the total study population, but increased to 70.02 and 45.21 per 1000 person-years, respectively, in the elderly. In the Cox regression analysis, the adjusted HR comparing diabetics to nondiabetics was 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-1.67) for any hospitalization for infection and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.36-2.16) for infection-related mortality. The hazard for infection morbidity and mortality was higher at both extremes (<90 and >200 mg/dl) of FPG. The excess risk associated with FPG ≤ 90 mg/dl was attenuated after controlling for multiple comorbidities.Poor glycemic control (FPG > 200 mg/dl) was associated with a higher risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly population where the baseline infection risk was high.© The Author(s) 2019.

We examined sex differences in distinct components of oxygen transport and utilization during exercise using linear and logistic regression models. The data were analyzed from June 2018 to May 2019.Resting and exercise gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.Of 295 participants, 121 (41.0%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years) and 174 (59.0%) were women (mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with men, women with HFpEF in this tertiary referral cohort had fewer comorbidities, including , insulin resistance, and hypertension, and a more favorable adipokine profile. Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak oxygen [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -2.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664390>[Alcohol consumption patterns and associated factors among elderly Brazilians: National Health Survey (2013)].</a></h2><p>The scope of this study was to analyze the pattern of alcohol consumption among elderly Brazilians (60 years and over) and their association with sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits and health conditions. This is a cross-sectional study of 10,537 elderly (90.1%) participants from the National Health Survey of 2013. The consumption of alcoholic beverages was classified as non-use, mild / moderate use and risk use. The multinomial regression model was used to study the associated factors. The prevalence for mild / moderate and risk use was 9.4% (95% CI: 8.4- 10.6%) and 4.6% (95%CI: 4.0-5.3%), respectively. The two consumption patterns were inversely associated with age and more frequent among men, better schooling, smokers and physical activity practitioners. Mild / moderate consumption was less frequent among non-whites and those with a history of stroke and , whereas risk use was less frequent among the elderly diagnosed for heart disease and more frequent among those suffering from depression. This result identifies profiles of greater vulnerability, with small differences between two patterns of consumption.

DR is divided broadly into nonproliferative and proliferative stages, with or without vision-threatening macular edema. Progression to proliferative DR is associated with vision loss that is often irreparable, and a rapid decline in health-related quality of life. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is upregulated in the diabetic eye, and has been identified as a key driver of DR pathogenesis. With this perspective, we review the published phase III clinical trial data of anti-VEGF therapies approved for the treatment of DR in the United States. Using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, in which an improvement of ≥2 steps is considered clinically significant, approximately one-third of patients with DR and macular edema experience this level of improvement after 1 year of treatment with either ranibizumab or aflibercept. The rates of clinically significant DR improvement with ranibizumab could be twice that in the subgroup of patients with moderately severe or severe nonproliferative DR and macular edema. These clinical trial data indicate that intraocular inhibition of VEGF is a rational approach for the management of DR.Copyright © 2019.

However, no proteomic study has been reported to systematically investigate the protein substrates of AGEs.  In this paper, we used an aniline-based probe to capture the glyoxal-imine intermediate which is the transition sate of glyoxal-derived AGEs. Combined with the tandem orthogonal proteolysis activity-based protein profiling strategy, we successfully identified 962 lysines modified by glyoxal.  Enzymes in glycolysis are heavily modified by glyoxal and our biochemical experiments showed that glyoxal can significantly inhibit the activity of GAPDH and glycolysis.

We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians, or when analyzed by Random Forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard.Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for ≥3 years. The urine "steroid fingerprint" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by three blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50-72% of cases, improving to 69-92%, if a pre-operative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than 2 months in 22-39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61 to 97%. The computational classifier detected ACC recurrence with superior accuracy (sensitivity=specificity=81%).Urine steroid metabolomics is a promising tool for post-operative recurrence detection in ACC; availability of a pre-operative urine considerably improves the ability to detect ACC recurrence.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670905>Methylphenidate in children with monogenic obesity due to LEPR or MC4R deficiency improves feeling of satiety and reduces BMI-SDS-A case series.</a></h2><p>The clinical phenotype of patients with monogenic obesity due to mutations in the leptin receptor (LEPR) or melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene is characterized by impaired satiety and hyperphagia, leading to extreme, sometimes life-threatening weight gain.In a case series, we analysed the effect of an off-label methylphenidate (MPH) use for 1 year as an individual treatment approach on eating behaviour (Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire [CEBQ]), appetite (visual analogue scales) and body mass index (BMI) trajectories in five patients with severe obesity due to mutations in the LEPR (n = 3) or MC4R (n = 2) gene.After 1 year use of MPH (20 mg/day divided in two to three doses), BMI (Δ BMI  : -0.7 ± 0.9 kg/m ), BMI standard deviation score (SDS) (Δ BMI-SDS  : -0.32 ± 0.20), and %BMIP95 (Δ %BMIP95  : -6.6 ± 7.8%) decreased. BMI-SDS velocity decreased from +0.17 ± 0.22 to -0.30 ± 0.20. Appetite and CEBQ subscale scores for "food responsiveness" and "enjoyment of food" decreased. We observed adverse effects with increase in self-reported frequency of disordered sleep, nervousness, hyperactivity, and tics.The observed decrease in BMI trajectories with MPH use for one year is clinically meaningful in this group of patients, since the natural course would have been associated with a pronounced increase in BMI, leading to comorbidities and complications over time.© 2019 The Authors.

In the cases of other cutaneous pathologies, such as cancer or cutaneous ulcers due to , optical diffuse reflectance-based tools and methods are widely used for the investigation of those illnesses. These types of tools and methods offer the possibility to develop portable diagnosis and treatment follow-up systems. In this article, we propose the use of a three-layer diffuse reflectance model for the study of the formation of cutaneous ulcers caused by CL. The proposed model together with an inverse-modeling procedure were used in the evaluation of diffuse-reflectance spectral signatures acquired from cutaneous ulcers formed in the dorsal area of 21 golden hamsters inoculated with Leishmanisis braziliensis. As result, the quantification of the model's variables related to the main biological parameters of skin were obtained, such as: diameter and volumetric fraction of keratinocytes, collagen; volumetric fraction of hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation. Those parameters show statistically significant differences among the different stages of the CL ulcer formation. We found that these differences are coherent with histopathological manifestations reported in the literature for the main phases of CL formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670093>CD26/DPP4 levels in peripheral blood and T cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis with normal thyroid function.</a></h2><p>Exploring the CD26 expression in peripheral blood and T cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis with normal thyroid function.

Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between serum CD26 and autoantibodies and CD26 on T cells.Compared with healthy controls, CD26 expression in serum and thyroid tissues were obviously lower in HT patients with normal thyroid function. And serum CD26 level was negatively related with TGAb. While no correlation was seen between membrane-bound CD26 and autoantibodies. There was no relation between serum CD26 and CD26 expression on T cells.Taken together, our results show that the level of serum CD26 was associated with TGAb in HT patients with normal thyroid function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Further, the correlation of plasma microRNAs with sit-to-stand performance was examined. DIANA web server was used to find which Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (P < 0.05) were regulated by miRNAs associated with physical activity and sit-to-stand performance.Plasma levels of hsa-miR-30d-5p were significantly (P = 0.015) lower in participants with higher physical activity, and a borderline trend for hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.06) was noticed. Higher plasma levels of hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.01) and hsa-miR-93-5p (P = 0.04) were observed in the group with reduced sit-to-stand performance.

We first investigated the associations between serum CA19-9 levels and incident DM risk in a prospective cohort study (12,700 individuals). Then, we explored the potential causal relationship between CA19-9 and DM risk in a cross-sectional study (3,349 DM cases and 8,341 controls) using Mendelian randomization analysis. A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated by adding the CA19-9 increasing alleles in five SNPs (rs17271883, rs3760776 and rs3760775 in FUT6, rs11880333 in CA11, rs265548 in B3GNT3, and rs1047781 in FUT2) which were identified in previous genome-wide association study on serum CA19-9 levels.In the prospective study, a total of 1,004 incident DM cases were diagnosed during mean 4.54 years of follow-up period. Elevated serum CA19-9 level was associated with a higher incident  risk after adjustment for confounders, with a HR of 1.20 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.30) per SD (12.17U/ml) CA19-9 increased. Using the genetic score to estimate the unconfounded effect, we did not find causal association of CA19-9 with  risk (OR per weighted CA19-9-increasing allele: 0.99; 95 % CI: 0.94-1.04; P=0.61).The present study does not support a causal association of serum CA19-9 with  risk.

HNA%, defined as HNA / (HNA + HMA) × 100, was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. First, multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate which variables were significant determinants for HNA%. Next, to evaluate the association of HNA% with ADL disability, logistic regression analysis in various models was performed. Then we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the under area the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in each model.In elderly patients with , multiple regression analysis showed that serum bilirubin levels and albumin levels, both of which are major endogenous anti-oxidants, and chronic renal failure (or proliferative nephropathy) were significantly associated with HNA%, suggesting that HNA% may be a good biomarker for oxidative stress in those patients. We then evaluated the association of HNA% with ADL disability in various logistic regression models. Model using only HNA% showed that it was a significant determinant for ADL disability (OR 1.158, 95% CI 1.077-1.244, P < .001).

It includes 3 distinct scales: Perceived Behavior, Perceived Benefit, and Perceived Burden. In contrast with existing measures, the TAPQ was expected to have a clear factor structure; have good discrimination; and assess distinct types of perception, each of which has different patterns of association with interpersonal, personality, motivational, and emotional variables. Foundational work on the TAPQ (with 891 patients) included 5 quantitative scale development studies and 1 qualitative study. The present report focuses on results from a final validation study using 450 patients recruited via market research panels to complete online questionnaires. This study included a general medical sample and a sample of people with either  or hypertension. A confirmatory factor analysis specifying strict measurement invariance across these groups produced a good fit. Analysis with item-response theory suggested that the scales on the TAPQ provide good discrimination across a wide range of experience levels. The 3 scales on the TAPQ each had distinct patterns of association with criterion variables regarding conscientiousness, health behavior, motivation, affect, type of diagnosis, and interpersonal communication with health-care professionals. These effects could not be explained by another existing measure of adherence or by a measure of response bias.

Self-reported alcohol consumption was collected at baseline with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized into: none (0/week), light (>0-≤30 g/week), light-to-moderate (>30-≤70 g/week), moderate (>70-≤140 g/week), and heavy drinkers (>140 g/week). Echocardiography was performed at baseline (N = 778) and after 8 years follow-up (N = 404). Multiple linear regression was used to study the association between alcohol consumption and echocardiographic measures (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume index (LAVI) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI)), adjusted for confounders. Moderate and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with a decreased LVEF of -3.91% (CI: -7.13;-0.69) for moderate and -4.77% (-8.18;-1.36) for heavy drinkers compared to light drinkers. No associations were found between alcohol consumption, LVMI and LAVI. Modified Poisson regression showed a trend that higher alcohol consumption amounts were associated with a higher risk of incident systolic dysfunction (LVEF≤50%) (P-for-trend 0.058).The findings provide longitudinal evidence that moderate and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with decreased LVEF and trend towards a higher risk of incident LV systolic dysfunction, compared to light drinkers.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Gliptins have been proven to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), a serine protease, and are an emerging therapeutic drug target to reduce blood glucose levels, but until now there is no natural cyclic peptide proven to inhibit serine protease DPP4. This study demonstrates the potential mechanism of natural cyclic peptide oxytocin (OXT) as a DPP4 inhibitor. To achieve this, initially, activity atlas and field-based models of DPP4 inhibitors were utilized to predict the possible features of positive and negative electrostatic, hydrophobic, and activity shapes of DPP4 inhibition. Oxytocin binding mode, flexibility, and interacting residues were studied using molecular docking simulations studies. 3D-RISM calculations studies revealed that the stability of water molecules at the binding site are favorable. Finally, an experimental study using fluorescence assay revealed OXT inhibits DPP4 in a concentration-dependent manner in a significant way ( < 0.05) and possess IC of 110.7 nM. These new findings significantly expand the pharmaceutical application of cyclic peptides, and in specific OXT, and implicate further optimization of OXT inhibition capacity to understand the effect of DPP4 inhibition. This work highlights the development of natural cyclic peptides as future therapeutic peptides to reduce glucose levels and treat .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669312>Follow-up of infants born to mothers with autoinmune thyroid disease. What should not be screened?</a></h2><p>Thyroid dysfunction is a common problem in pregnant women. It is usually of an autoimmune origin, with Hashimotós thyroiditis and Graveś disease being the most common conditions. Although hormonal changes and transplacental antibody transfer may occur, specific neonatal screening has not been shown to be useful.A prospective study of newborns of women with autoimmune thyroid disease born at a level III university hospital (November 2013-December 2016). Neonates were selected during their stay at the maternity. Babies with perinatal asphyxia were excluded. Data were collected from the clinical histories of mothers and newborns.A total of 191 neonates were included. Ninety percent of mothers had been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Only 5.8% of newborns had some laboratory disorder, consisting of slightly increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, which returned to normal at the age of one month and did not correlate to thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. Transient hyperthyrotropinemia was diagnosed in one newborn and required thyroxin treatment during the first year of life. Among newborns from mothers with Graveś disease, 36.8% had some abnormal laboratory value during the first 7 days of life, but there were no cases of hyperthyroidism and only one of transient hyperthyrotropinemia.Experience at our hospital in screening of newborns from hypothyroid mothers reveals a high number of laboratory controls with a poor diagnostic yield. No relationship was found between thyroid peroxidase antibody levels and thyroid dysfunction. We support the recommendations to continue testing serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and FT4 levels at 48h of life in newborns of mothers with autoimmune hypothyroidism.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED.

In a blinded manner, the same optometrist who read the original 3-fields images for a patient read the 1- and 2-fields photographs on separate dates later.The sensitivity and specificity of digital retinal photography compared with dilated ophthalmoscopy were, respectively: 88% and 76% for 1-field; 94% and 69% for 2-fields; and 100% and 79% for 3-fields. The proportion of agreement between fundus photography reading and exam DR diagnosis were 58% for 1-field, 58% for 2-fields, and 77% for 3-fields. Kappa and Cramer's V statistics for 1-, 2-, and 3-fields were 0.55 and 0.60, 0.52 and 0.57, and 0.72 and 0.74, respectively. Three-fields measurement of DR was most similar to the dilated ophthalmological exam overall and across all DR severity levels.Compared to 1- and 2-fields fundus photography, 3-fields is superior for detecting vision-threatening DR.

We excluded those women with pre-existing type 2 , those with missing data, and those with unlikely data. GDM was defined as fasting glucose levels >5.55 mmol/L [>100 mg/dL] or >7.77 mmol/L [>140 mg/dL] two hours after glucose load in the oral glucose tolerance test. Potential predictors were selected based on prior research and ease of evaluation.From the original database of 100 758 records, 86 362 women were included in the final cohort. The mean GDM prevalence was 7.6% (95%CI [confidence interval] 7.5%-7.8%), increasing from 4.4% (95% CI 4.0%-4.9%) in 2002 to 13.0% (95% CI 12.0%-13.9%) in 2015. Age, education, marital status, parity, family history of type 2 , personal history of GDM, hypertension and pre-eclampsia, alcohol consumption, smoking, and pre-gestational nutritional status performed well in the prediction of GDM.One out of eight Chilean pregnant women of medium- to low socio-economic status were found to develop GDM. We identified a set of easy-to-capture predictors in the primary health care system that may allow for the early identification of women at high risk for the development of GDM.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668740>Changes in snail and SRF expression in the kidneys of diabetic rats during ageing.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive condition which develops for many years. We analyzed expression of Snail and serum response factor (SRF), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulatory transcription factors with a key role in renal fibrosis, in different renal areas of diabetic rats during ageing.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 55 mg/kg streptozotocin (model of type 1 ; DM group) or citrate buffer (control). DM group received insulin weekly to prevent ketoacidosis. After 2 weeks, 2, 6 and 12 months kidney samples were collected and analysed in different renal areas.Snail expression was located within cortex in proximal convoluted tubules, in control and DM groups, in the cytoplasm. Percentage of Snail-positive cells in control groups was high and decreased with time, whereas in DM groups the highest percentage was after 2 weeks. In all time points, smaller percentage of Snail expression was seen in DM groups compared to controls. SRF expression was mostly located in the proximal convoluted tubules, always in the cytoplasm. In control groups SRF was expressed in all time periods in proximal convoluted tubules, with decrement after 12 months. Percentage of SRF-positive cells was higher in control groups compared to DM in all time points, with the exception of 12 months. To a smaller degree, SRF expression was seen in the glomeruli and distal convoluted tubules, with more SRF positive cells in DM compared to their control groups.While Snail expression remained lower in diabetic tissues, compared to controls, expression of SRF increased in diabetic tissues in the second part of the year. These changes may need long time to develop, and, in line with earlier reports, it is possible that insulin treatment of DM rats once a week reduces possibility of EMT and development of renal fibrosis even in the long term.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

All employees with email and security guards of a tertiary hospital in Singapore were invited to complete a questionnaire that captured sociodemographics and self-reported domain-specific SB. Environmental influences of occupational SB were assessed using an adapted version of the Checklist for Health Promotion Environments at the Worksite (CHEW). Focus group discussion (FGD) addressed perceptions, barriers, and strategies toward reducing workplace SB. Analyses were performed separately and integrated using an inductive comparative approach. The median occupational sitting time ( = 938) was 300 minutes/day, and highest among administrative staff (administrative, 421 minutes/day; allied health, 300 minutes/day; ancillary, 300 minutes/day; nursing, 120 minutes/day; medical/dental/others, 240 minutes/day;  value: <.001). The CHEW assessment identified poor physical and information environment contributing to occupational SB. FGDs confirmed an unsupportive environment and elicited barriers such as low SB awareness, nature of work, and workplace norms. Besides environmental approaches, participants suggested having face-to-face communication and social modelling to promote more breaks from sitting. This mixed-methods study among diverse professional groups of a tertiary hospital indicated a large amount of occupational SB, particularly among administrative staff. Raising awareness of the health risks of SB and building a supportive organizational culture, information, and physical environment emerged as significant factors. To reduce occupational SB, multicomponent interventions addressing these diverse factors are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665258>Differential Epigenetic Factors in the Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetic Patients.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia can strongly alter the epigenetic signatures in many types of human vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions both in micro- and macro domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with obesity and . Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need of combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.© The Author(s) 2019.

Air pollution is a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate materials, that vary depending on their source and physicochemical features. Each material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In particular, there is more and more evidence that PM2.5 exerts adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing substantially -- mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and inflammation -- to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart failure, hypertension,  and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular adverse effects of short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly for the PM2.5 size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than appreciated until now.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673002>Intestinal helminth infection enhances bacteria-induced recruitment of neutrophils to the airspace.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminth infections elicit Th2-type immunity, which influences host immune responses to additional threats, such as allergens, metabolic disease, and other pathogens. Th2 immunity involves a shift of the CD4 T-cell population from type-0 to type-2 (Th2) with increased abundance of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. This study sought to investigate if existing gut-restricted intestinal helminth infections impact bacterial-induced acute airway neutrophil recruitment. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: uninfected; helminth-Heligmosomoides polygyrus infected; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected; and coinfected. Mice infected with H. polygyrus were incubated for 2 weeks, followed by P. aeruginosa intranasal inoculation. Bronchial alveolar lavage, blood, and lung samples were analyzed. Interestingly, infection with gut-restricted helminths resulted in immunological and structural changes in the lung. These changes include increased lung CD4 T cells, increased Th2 cytokine expression, and airway goblet cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, coinfected mice exhibited significantly more airspace neutrophil infiltration at 6 hours following P. aeruginosa infection and exhibited an improved rate of survival compared with bacterial infected alone. These results suggest that chronic helminth infection of the intestines can influence and enhance acute airway neutrophil responses to P. aeruginosa infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665112>Methods for quick, accurate and cost-effective determination of the type 1  genetic risk score (T1D-GRS).</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669066>Validation of a protein biomarker test for predicting renal decline in type 2 : The Fremantle  Study Phase II.</a></h2><p>To validate the prognostic utility of a novel plasma biomarker panel, PromarkerD, for predicting renal decline in an independent cohort of people with type 2 .Models for predicting rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline defined as i) incident diabetic kidney disease (DKD), ii) eGFR decline ≥30% over four years, and iii) annual eGFR decline ≥5 mL/min/1.73 m were applied to 447 participants from the longitudinal observational Fremantle  Study Phase II.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and  is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 .We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 .We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without  at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident  were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2  were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 , with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively.

Participants included: 263 survey respondents with EM, 18 women interviewed, and 11 women and 6 HPs in pilot-testing. Main outcome measures were: survey-perceptions regarding communication with HPs, likeliness to use a QPL and QPL topics; interviews-QPL user-friendliness and acceptability; pilot study-women's QPL use, perceived helpfulness and future use, and HPs' perceived acceptability. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and thematic analysis.Women's perceived communication difficulties most commonly related to sexual function (50.6%), vaginal/urinary symptoms (43%), and psychological effects (41.1%). Most women (67.3%) indicated they were very likely to use an EM QPL. EM symptoms, effects, and management were considered very important/essential QPL topics (>80%). Interviewed women perceived the QPL as comprehensive, user-friendly, informative, and empowering. Most pilot study women asked 1 to 2 questions (73%), perceived the QPL as helpful (100%), and would use it again (81.8%). HPs reported that the QPL helped patients to ask questions and initiate discussion about important and sensitive issues.Women with EM have unmet information and communication needs, and are supportive of a comprehensive EM QPL.

Initially, CP is managed with endoscopic interventions, long-term analgesia for its associated chronic abdominal pain syndrome and pancreatic enzyme replacement for exocrine dysfunction. As the disease advances, pancreatic drainage procedures and partial resections are considered, but they leave diseased tissue behind and usually result in short-term relief only. Total pancreatectomy alone is widely viewed as a last resort treatment option because it causes brittle . However, total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) can prevent the development of  and cure the chronic pain syndrome. One serious, albeit rare, complication of TPIAT is (partial) portal vein thrombosis. Its incidence is probably about 5%. To prevent the occurrence of portal vein thrombosis, we propose herein, and have successfully performed, continuous real-time Doppler ultrasonography during the islet infusion to study portal vein and intrahepatic flow patterns, as well as changes in Doppler signals. Flow and signal changes may allow for timely adjustment of the infusion rate, before a marked increase in portal vein pressure is noted and decrease the risk of portal vein thrombosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 , in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte lipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019.

However, myocardial infarction in SMuRF-less individuals is not uncommon. This study uses 2 sequential large, multicenter registries to examine the proportion and outcomes of SMuRF-less ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Methods and Results We identified 3081 STEMI patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease in the Australian GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and CONCORDANCE (Cooperative National Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome Care) registries, encompassing 42 hospitals, between 1999 and 2017. We examined the proportion that were SMuRF-less as well as outcomes. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or heart failure, during the index admission). Multivariate regression models were used to identify predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events. Of STEMI patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease 19% also had no history of SMuRFs. This proportion increased from 14% to 23% during the study period (=0.0067). SMuRF-less individuals had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than individuals with 1 or more SMuRFs. There were no clinically significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 6 months between the 2 groups. Conclusions A substantial and increasing proportion of STEMI presentations occur independently of SMuRFs. Discovery of new markers and mechanisms of disease beyond standard risk factors may facilitate novel preventative strategies.

The primary end point was set as the change of fatty liver index (FLI) as a surrogate parameter of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660321>The renal resistive index as a new complementary tool to predict microvascular diabetic complications in children and adolescents: a groundbreaking finding.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of type 1  (DM) has made it necessary to have new markers for early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Renal resistive index (RI) by using renal Doppler can be a helpful tool in detecting functional alterations in renal hemodynamics. This study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents with type 1 DM. They were further subdivided into two equal subgroups: group 1 with type 1 DM and normo-albuminuria [urinary albumin excretion (UAE) <30 mg/24 hours], and group 2 with type 1 DM and hyper-albuminuria (increased UAE >30 mg/24 hours). There were 37 males (37%) and 63 females (63%); their mean ages were 13.6±2.53 (range, 10-19) years and mean disease duration was 8.867±2.260 (range, 5-13) years. Progressive increase in RI was significantly associated with increased disease duration more than 10 years, elevated serum HbA1c more than 7.5% and early pubertal stages. While not significantly related to sex, weight, height, blood pressure or serum lipid profile, diabetic micro-vascular complications (nephropathy and sensory neuropathy) were more prevalent among patients with RI more than 0.58. Renal RI could be a useful complementary test for the evaluation of functional alterations in renal hemodynamics in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Currently metformin is increasingly used during pregnancy in women with gestational , even if the long-term effects of metformin on offspring are not exactly known. We have previously shown that high glucose concentration increases hyaluronan (HA) production of cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via stimulating the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (). This offers a potential mechanism whereby hyperglycemia leads to vascular macroangiopathy. In this study, we examined whether gestational metformin use affects HA content in the aortic wall of mouse offspring in vivo. We also examined the effect of metformin on HA synthesis by cultured human VSMCs in vitro. We found that gestational metformin use significantly decreased HA content in the intima-media of mouse offspring aortas. In accordance with this, the synthesis of HA by VSMCs was also significantly decreased in response to treatment with metformin. This decrease in HA synthesis was shown to be due to the reduction of both the expression of  and the amount of HAS substrates, particularly UDP--acetylglucosamine. As shown here, gestational metformin use is capable to program reduced HA content in the vascular wall of the offspring strongly supporting the idea, that metformin possesses long-term vasculoprotective effects.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type 2 . At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664143>Study of Periodontal Health in Almada-Seixal (SoPHiAS): a cross-sectional study in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to describe the prevalence and extent of periodontal diseases among adults in the southern region of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. This population-based cross-sectional study included 1,064 randomized participants (aged 18 to 95 years, 617 females/447 males). Sociodemographic, behaviours and medical information were recorded. Periodontal conditions were assessed with a full-mouth circumferential periodontal examination. It was used the American Association of Periodontology/European Federation of Periodontology 2017 case definitions. A logistic regression analysis was applied to ascertain hypothetical risk factors towards periodontitis. The prevalence of periodontitis was 59.9%, with 24.0% and 22.2% of the participants exhibiting severe and moderate periodontitis, respectively. The risk of periodontitis significantly increased with age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04-1.06), for active and former smokers (OR = 3.76 and OR = 2.11, respectively), with lower education levels (OR = 2.08, OR = 1.86, for middle and elementary education, respectively) and with  (OR = 1.53).

We assessed whether metabolic-syndrome (MetS) severity would remain linked to future CHD and  even when assessed from non-fasting samples.Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were assessed at 4 visits and followed for 20-years of adjudicated CHD outcomes. We used Cox proportional-hazard models (for 20-year CHD outcomes) and logistic regression (for 9-year  outcomes) to compare incident disease risk associated with a race/ethnicity-specific MetS-severity Z-score (MetS-Z) calculated in participants who were fasting (≥8 h) or non-fasting. All analyses were adjusted for sex, race, education, income and smoking. MetS Z-scores were overall similar between participants who were always fasting vs. those non-fasting at Visits 1-3 (all values -0.1 to 0.4), while MetS-Z for participants who were non-fasting at Visit-4 were higher at each visit. Baseline MetS-Z was linked to future CHD when calculated from both fasting and non-fasting measurements, with hazard ratio (HR) for fasting MetS-Z 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42, 1.66) and for non-fasting 1.28 (CI 1.08, 1.51). MetS-Z at Visit-1 also remained linked to future  when measured from non-fasting samples, with odds ratio for fasting MetS-Z 3.10 (CI 2.88, 3.35) and for non-fasting 1.92 (CI 1.05, 3.51).MetS-Z remained linked to future CHD and  when assessed from non-fasting samples.

They underwent three experimental conditions (treadmill walking HIIT session (5 × (3 min at 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR) + 3 min at 30% HRR)); treadmill walking MICT session (30 min at 50% HRR); and a control session of rest (CON)) in random order and in the postprandial state. Measurements of capillary blood glucose (BG) were taken immediately before, during, and until 50 min after the experimental conditions.Both HIIT and MICT treadmill walking sessions reduced BG levels during exercise and laboratory 50 min recovery period compared to CON (time*condition interaction effect;  < 0.001). The effect of HIIT was greater compared with MICT ( = 0.017).Treadmill walking HIIT seems a safe and more effective exercise strategy on immediate acute glycemic control compared with MICT in middle-aged and older patients with T2D under therapy with metformin and/or gliptins.ISRCTN09240628.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663189>Oral Sessions.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669498>Reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia: Risk prediction and lipid management.</a></h2><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a frequent genetic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and early onset of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. FH is caused by mutations in genes that regulate LDL catabolism, mainly the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gain of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the phenotype may be encountered in individuals not carrying the latter monogenic defects, in approximately 20% of these effects of polygenes predominate, and in many individuals no molecular defects are encountered at all. These so-called FH phenocopy individuals have an elevated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in comparison with normolipidemic individuals but this risk is lower than in those with monogenic disease. Individuals with FH are exposed to elevated LDL-C levels since birth and this explains the high cardiovascular, mainly coronary heart disease, burden of these subjects. However, recent studies show that this risk is heterogenous and depends not only on high LDL-C levels but also on presence of previous cardiovascular disease, a monogenic cause, male sex, smoking, hypertension, , low HDL-cholesterol, obesity and elevated lipoprotein(a). This heterogeneity in risk can be captured by risk equations like one from the SAFEHEART cohort and by detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. High dose high potency statins are the main stain for LDL-C lowering in FH, however, in most situations these medications are not powered enough to reduce cholesterol to adequate levels. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors should also be used in order to better treat LDL-C in FH patients.Copyright © 2019.

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity,  status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe obesity, 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe obesity, total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671770>Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Dysregulation of Glucose Metabolism: Beyond Weight Gain.</a></h2><p>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia because of their high clinical efficacy. However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2  and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668590>Sex difference in the association between surrogate markers of insulin resistance and arterial stiffness.</a></h2><p>To investigate the predictive capability of insulin resistance surrogate markers for insulin resistance and arterial stiffness based on sex.We assessed the association of triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP) with homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in both sexes.A total of 1720 men and 1098 women were evaluated.

Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans.

We aimed to evaluate the inter- and intraobserver variation of semiautomated segmentation, to assess whether multiple observers may interchangeably perform this task.Anonymised, unenhanced, single mid-abdominal CT images were acquired from 132 subjects from two previous studies. Semiautomated segmentation was performed using a proprietary software package. Abdominal muscle compartment (AMC), inter- and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were identified according to pre-established attenuation ranges. The segmentation was performed by four observers: an oncology resident with extensive training and three radiographers with a 2-week training programme. To assess interobserver variation, segmentation of each CT image was performed individually by two or more observers. To assess intraobserver variation, three of the observers did repeated segmentations of the images. The distribution of variation between subjects, observers and random noise was estimated by a mixed effects model. Inter- and intraobserver correlation was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).For all four tissue compartments, the observer variations were far lower than random noise by factors ranging from 1.6 to 3.6 and those between subjects by factors ranging from 7.3 to 186.1. All interobserver ICC was ≥ 0.938, and all intraobserver ICC was ≥ 0.996.Body composition segmentation showed a very low level of operator dependability.

DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC).The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between nDPN and DPN.DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher RD.

Complex survey weighted logistic regression models assessed the relationships between ACEs, , and CVD overall and in those with and without depression.Half of participants were female (48.6%) and 82.3% White, non-Hispanic. LCA identified a four-class solution characterized as 'low adversity', 'verbal/physical abuse', 'sexual abuse', and 'high adversity'. The odds ratios for each ACE class and  were similar in those with and without depression. An overall adjusted model showed that 'sexual abuse' versus 'low adversity' was significantly associated with  (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.05-1.61).

Hypopituitarism is the consequence of insults directed at the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, in particular surgery and radiotherapy. The question of whether chemotherapy, in the absence of concomitant radiotherapy, can induce hypopituitarism in susceptible individuals has been raised by a number of studies over the last 30 years. Where described the pituitary hormone deficit in question is almost exclusively growth hormone. Studies have been of variable quality, with endocrine testing that fails to hold up to scrutiny. There is thus no robust data to support this hypothesis, in particular no single agent or class of chemotherapeutic agent has been implicated, and the mechanism of action remains elusive.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

This mixed-methods evaluation advances regulatory science and the assessment of FDA REMS programs when using physician surveys. We: (1) reviewed published physician survey response rates; and (2) assessed response bias in a simulation study of secondary survey data using different accrual cut-off strategies.A systematic literature review was conducted of US physician surveys (2000-2014) on pharmaceutical use ( = 75). Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine the relationships between response rates and survey design characteristics. The simulation was conducted using secondary data from a population-based physician KAB survey on  risk management with antipsychotic use in Missouri Medicaid ( = 973 accrued over 30 weeks). Survey item responses were compared using Pearson's chi-square tests for two faster completion simulations: Fixed Sample ( = 300) and Fixed Time (8 weeks).Survey response rates ranged from 7% to 100% (median = 48%, IQR = 34%-68%). Surveys of targeted populations and surveys using member lists were associated with higher response rates ( = 0.02). In the simulation, 9 of 20 (45%) KAB items, including  screening advocacy, differed significantly using the smaller Fixed Sample strategy (achieved in 12 days) versus full accrual. Fewer response differences were found using the Fixed Time strategy (2 of 20 [10%] items).Published data on physician surveys report low response rates with most associated with the sample source selected.

The goal of this study was to evaluate coronary artery calcifications via the coronary calcification score in primary hyperparathyroidism patients, to compare with control subjects, and to identify risk factors for high to intermediate risk coronary calcification scores (coronary calcification score >100).Cross-sectional study of primary hyperparathyroidism patients without a history of coronary artery disease, , or severe, chronic kidney disease. Coronary calcification scores were compared with a cohort of population-based control subjects.The mean coronary calcification score was 120 ± 344 in 130 primary hyperparathyroidism patients. The coronary calcification score was >100 in 27 patients (21%). When compared with control subjects, the percentage of positive coronary calcification scores was similar in primary hyperparathyroidism patients (53% vs 50%); however, positive coronary calcification scores were at the 67 percentile of the control subjects cohort (P < .001).

However, it is not fully understood how spinal dorsal horn neurons are excited during the voiding reflex. In this study, we developed an in vivo technique allowing recording of superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons concurrent with intravesical pressure (IVP) during the micturition cycle in both normal and diabetic rats.Lumbosacral dorsal horn neuronal activity and IVP were recorded from urethane-anesthetized naive and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Saline was continuously perfused into the urinary bladder through a cannula to induce micturition.We classified SDH neurons into bladder- and urethral-responsive neurons, based on their responsiveness during the voiding reflex. Bladder-responsive SDH neurons responded to the rapid increase in IVP at the start of voiding. In contrast, urethral-responsive SDH neuronal firing increased at the peak IVP and their firing lasted during the voiding phase (the high-frequency oscillations). Urethral-responsive SDH neurons were more sensitive to capsaicin, received C afferent fiber inputs, and were rarely detected in STZ- rats. Administration of a cyclohexenoic long-chain fatty alcohol (TAC-302), which is reported to promote neurite outgrowth of peripheral nerves in STZ-diabetic rats, prevented the functional loss of spinal urethral response.Sensory information from the bladder and urethra is conveyed separately to different groups of SDH neurons. Functional loss of spinal urethral sensory information through unmyelinated C afferent fibers may contribute to diabetic bladder dysfunction.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665262>mCSM-AB2: Guiding Rational Antibody Design Using Graph-Based Signatures.</a></h2><p>A lack of accurate computational tools to guide rational mutagenesis has made affinity maturation a recurrent challenge in antibody development.

However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal colonization are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the microbiota.

Evaluation of this question led two scientific advisory committees to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAC), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations with the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conclude through 2014 that seafood consumed by pregnant women is likely to benefit the neurocognitive development of their children. The evidence they reviewed included between four and ten studies of seafood consumption during pregnancy that reported beneficial associations. In contrast there are now 29 seafood consumption studies available describing over 100,000 mothers-child pairs and 15 studies describing over 25,000 children who ate seafood. A systematic review of these studies using Nutrition Evaluation Systematic Review methodology is warranted to determine whether recent research corroborates, builds on, or significantly alters the previous conclusions. Studies that evaluate the integrated effects of seafood as a complete food more directly and completely evaluate impacts on neurocognition as compared to studies that evaluate individual nutritients or toxicological constituents in isolation. Here we address how the findings could add to our understanding of whether seafood consumed during pregnancy and early childhood affects neurocognition, including whether such effects are clinically meaningful, lasting, related to amounts consumed, and affected by any neurotoxicants that may be present, particularly mercury, which is present at varying levels in essentially all seafood.

There were a lower proportion of participants with hypertension (83.7% vs 85.0%) and  (20.0% vs 23.5%).As a long-term follow-up study, the surviving cohort of SHARP-ER is a selected group of the original study participants, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.The SHARP-ER study will contribute important evidence on the long-term outcomes of cholesterol-lowering therapy in patients with advanced CKD with a total of 10 years of follow-up. Novel analyses of the socioeconomic impact of CKD over time will guide resource allocation.The SHARP trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov  and ISRCTN 54137607.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665316>Letter to the editor « Long-term outcome of primary bilateral macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia after unilateral adrenalectomy ».</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670082>Human epidemiological evidence about the association between air pollution exposure and gestational : Systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that ambient air pollution exposure can increase the risk of type 2  (T2DM) significantly. In consideration of the common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, exposure to air pollution may also increase the risk of gestational  (GDM), but the current evidence was inconsistent and has not well been systematically reviewed. Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between air pollution exposure and GDM.An extensive literature search was conducted in selected electronic databases for related human epidemiological studies published in English language. Summary effect estimates were calculated using random-effect models for a) risk per unit increase in continuous air pollutant concentration and b) risk of high versus low exposure level in individual study if each exposure that had been examined in ≥2 studies. We evaluated the heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and quantified it by I statistic. Publication bias was also evaluated through the funnel plot when sufficient number of studies are available.A total of 11 studies evaluating the association between GDM and exposure to air pollution were identified finally. The summary odds ratio (OR) for incidence of GDM following a 10 μg/m increase in PM exposure during the second trimester was 1.04 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 1.09) and in NO during the first trimester was 1.03 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.07) per 10 ppb increase, while for high versus low SO exposure during the second trimester was 1.25 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.53). High heterogeneity among study-specific results in majority of the analyses were observed, and attributed to different exposure assessment methods, populations, study locations, and covariates adjustment. Publication bias cannot be excluded because of the inclusion of small number of studies.The present study supports the evidence that air pollution exposure increases the risk the GDM, albeit the existence of high heterogeneity. Further studies are necessary to elaborate the suggestive associations. These results are of public health significance since worsening air pollution in developing countries has been expected to increase the risk of GDM development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Under rare circumstances, it can transform into hormonally active disease presenting with severe Cushing syndrome. It might often produce diagnostic dilemma with difficult management issue if not thoroughly investigated and subtyped accordingly following surgery. Here, we present a 21-year-old male who initially underwent pituitary adenomectomy for presumed NFA with compressive symptoms. However, he developed recurrent and invasive macroadenoma with severe clinical as well as biochemical hypercortisolism during post-surgical follow-up. Repeat pituitary surgery was carried out urgently as there was significant optic chiasmal compression. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissue obtained on repeat surgery proved it to be an aggressive corticotroph adenoma. Though not cured, he showed marked clinical and biochemical improvement in the immediate postoperative period. Anticipating recurrence from the residual tumor, we referred him for cyber knife radio surgery.Pituitary NFA commonly present with compressive symptoms such as headache and blurred vision. Post-surgical development of Cushing syndrome in such a case could be either drug induced or endogenous. In the presence of recurrent pituitary tumor, ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome indicates CD. Rarely a SCA presenting initially as NFA can transform into an active corticotroph adenoma. Immunohistochemical marker for ACTH in the resected tumor confirms the diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664021>Hypothalamus-hippocampus circuitry regulates impulsivity via melanin-concentrating hormone.</a></h2><p>Behavioral impulsivity is common in various psychiatric and metabolic disorders. Here we identify a hypothalamus to telencephalon neural pathway for regulating impulsivity involving communication from melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing lateral hypothalamic neurons to the ventral hippocampus subregion (vHP). Results show that both site-specific upregulation (pharmacological or chemogenetic) and chronic downregulation (RNA interference) of MCH communication to the vHP increases impulsive responding in rats, indicating that perturbing this system in either direction elevates impulsivity. Furthermore, these effects are not secondary to either impaired timing accuracy, altered activity, or increased food motivation, consistent with a specific role for vHP MCH signaling in the regulation of impulse control. Results from additional functional connectivity and neural pathway tracing analyses implicate the nucleus accumbens as a putative downstream target of vHP MCH1 receptor-expressing neurons. Collectively, these data reveal a specific neural circuit that regulates impulsivity and provide evidence of a novel function for MCH on behavior.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664579>Performing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in an obese patient with systemic lupus erythematosus undergoing long-term steroid therapy: a case report.</a></h2><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic inflammatory lesions, is often associated with obesity. Obesity aggravates symptoms of SLE; however, these symptoms can be improved by weight loss through diet therapy and bariatric surgery. However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed  (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her obesity and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial weight loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674018>Physiological assessment of high glucose neurotoxicity in mouse and rat retinal explants.</a></h2><p>One of the tissues of the central nervous system most affected by  is the retina. Despite a growing understanding of the biochemical processes involved in glucose toxicity, little is known about the physiological consequences of chronic high glucose on individual neurons and neuronal circuits. Electroretinogram recordings suggest that retinal bipolar cells, which filter and transmit photoreceptor output to the inner retina, are among the first cells affected by diabetic conditions, and may therefore serve as sensitive early biomarkers for incipient neuronal damage caused in . Here, we comparatively assessed retinal integrity, calcium responses and the electrophysiological profiles of specific bipolar cell types of mouse and rat organotypic retinal explants after one to three weeks in tissue culture, under moderate and high glucose conditions. While the retinal layers of both rodent species displayed a progressively reduced thickness in culture, bipolar cells retained their electrophysiological profiles and remained morphologically identifiable for up to two weeks. Responses to glutamate and endogenous inhibitory responses were routinely observed, indicating that the retinal circuitry remained intact during this period. Significant physiological differences between moderate and high glucose conditions were evident in calcium signals and in the time course of responses to glutamate, but the voltage-gated current profiles of bipolar cells displayed only minor variations. Overall, rat retina appeared slightly more sensitive to high glucose levels compared to mouse. In conclusion, electrophysiological analysis of neuronal function in rodent retinal explants is useful for the study of early damage due to high glucose neurotoxicity.

Our objectives were to determine whether immunoassays are affected by the presence of macro-B12 and to validate a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation procedure to detect it. Methods Sixty-two serum samples obtained from healthy volunteers were analyzed to determine recovery and reference intervals (RIs) following PEG precipitation. Thereafter, 50 serum samples with very high levels of B12 (>1476 pmol/L) were randomly selected to search for macro-B12 interferences. Serum samples obtained from healthy volunteers and related PEG aliquots were analyzed on a Cobas® immunoassay. Patients' samples were analyzed on both Cobas® and Architect® immunoassays. Finally, samples suspected to contain macro-B12 were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to confirm the presence of macro-B12. Results Recovery and post-PEG RIs determined on a Cobas 8000® in healthy volunteers ranged from 68.3% to 108.4% and from 122.1 to 514.4 pmol/L, respectively. Fifteen samples (30%) were found to show macro-B12 while using the recovery criteria, and nine samples (18%) while using the post-PEG RI. The other immunoassay ran on the Architect i2000® was also affected by the presence of macro-B12. Size-exclusion chromatography studies confirmed the presence of macro-B12 (immunoglobulin-B12 complexes). Conclusions The prevalence of macro-B12 in elevated B12 samples is high. We suggest to systematically screen for the presence of macro-B12 with PEG precipitation procedure in samples with elevated B12 levels to avoid potential misdiagnosis or harmful clinical consequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663410>Associations of physical activity and sedentary behavior with cardiometabolic biomarkers in prediabetes and type 2 : A compositional data analysis.</a></h2><p>ObjectivesTo investigate the associations between objectively measured sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity physical activity (LIPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cardiometabolic and endocrine biomarkers, and to estimate the associations of reallocating time from one behavior to another with cardiometabolic and endocrine biomarkers.MethodsBaseline data from participants diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 , n=175, 58% men, mean (SD) age=64.4 (7.7), recruited to a physical activity intervention was used. Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and 2.3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health. While LIPA probably requires more time, maintaining or increasing time in MVPA are the most important features of the time use behaviors when promoting a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile in adults with prediabetes and type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669883>Reduction of cardiac and renal dysfunction by new inhibitor of DPP4 in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Increased mortality due to type 2  (T2DM) has been associated with renal and/or cardiovascular dysfunction. Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors (iDPP-4s) may exert cardioprotective effects through their pleiotropic actions via glucagon-like peptide 1-dependent mechanisms. In this study, the pharmacological profile of a new iDPP-4 (LASSBio-2124) was investigated in rats with cardiac and renal dysfunction induced by T2DM.T2DM was induced in rats by 2 weeks of a high-fat diet followed by intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Metabolic disturbance and cardiac, vascular, and renal dysfunction were analyzed in the experimental groups.Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 administration after T2DM induction reduced elevated glucose levels to 319.8 ± 13.2 and 279.7 ± 17.8 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2124 also lowered the cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 76.8 ± 8.0 to 42.7 ± 3.2 mg/dL and from 229.7 ± 25.4 to 100.7 ± 17.1 mg/dL, in diabetic rats. Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 reversed the reduction of the plasma insulin level. LASSBio-2124 recovered the increased urinary flow in diabetic animals and reduced 24-h proteinuria from 23.7 ± 1.5 to 13.3 ± 2.8 mg (p < 0.05). It also reduced systolic and diastolic left-ventricular dysfunction in hearts from diabetic rats.The effects of LASSBio-2124 were superior to those of sitagliptin in the cardiovascular systems of T2DM rats. This new prototype showed promise for the avoidance of comorbidities in a T2DM experimental model, and thus may constitute an innovative therapeutic agent for the treatment of these conditions in the clinical field in future.Copyright © 2019.

It remains unclear how cTnT levels develop over time in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to prospectively study the association between cTnT and GFR over time in older advanced-stage CKD patients not on dialysis. Methods and Results The EQUAL (European Quality Study) study is an observational prospective cohort study in stage 4 to 5 CKD patients aged ≥65 years not on dialysis (incident estimated GFR, <20 mL/min/1.73 m²). The EQUAL cohort used for the purpose of this study includes 171 patients followed in Sweden between April 2012 and December 2018. We used linear mixed models, adjusted for important groups of confounders, to investigate the effect of both measured GFR and estimated GFR on high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) trajectory over 4 years. Almost all patients had at least 1 hs-cTnT measurement elevated above the 99th percentile of the general reference population (≤14 ng/L). On average, hs-cTnT increased by 16%/year (95% CI, 13-19; <0.0001). Each 15 mL/min/1.73 m lower mean estimated GFR was associated with a 23% (95% CI, 14-31; <0.0001) higher baseline hs-cTnT and 9% (95% CI, 5-13%; <0.0001) steeper increase in hs-cTnT. The effect of estimated GFR on hs-cTnT trajectory was somewhat lower than a previous myocardial infarction (15%), but higher than presence of  (4%) and male sex (5%). Conclusions In CKD patients, hs-cTnT increases over time as renal function decreases. Lower CKD stage (each 15 mL/min/1.73 m lower) is independently associated with a steeper hs-cTnT increase over time in the same range as other established cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673398>Pilot randomized controlled trial of a complex intervention for  self-management supported by volunteers, technology, and interprofessional primary health care teams.</a></h2><p>Most health care for people with  occurs in family practice, yet balancing the time and resources to help these patients can be difficult.

Thus, the feasibility and potential for effectiveness of "Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience, Strengthening Quality through Health Connectors for  Management" (Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM) as an approach supporting  self-management was explored to inform development of a future large-scale trial.Four-month pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), sequential explanatory qualitative component. Participants-patients of an interprofessional primary care team-were over age 18 years, diagnosed with  and hypertension, and had Internet access and one of the following: uncontrolled HbA1c, recent  diagnosis, end-stage/secondary organ damage, or provider referral. The Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM intervention focused on patient health goals/needs, integrating community volunteers, eHealth technologies, interprofessional primary care teams, and system navigation. Pilot outcomes included process measures (recruitment, retention, program participation), perceived program feasibility, benefits and areas for improvement, and risks or safety issues. The primary trial outcome was self-efficacy for managing . There were a number of secondary trial outcomes.Of 425 eligible patients invited, 50 signed consent (11.8%) and 35 completed the program (15 intervention, 20 control). Volunteers ( = 20) met 28 clients in 234 client encounters (home visits, phone calls, electronic messages); 27 reports were sent to the interprofessional team. At 4 months, controlling for baseline, most outcomes were better in the intervention compared to control group; physical activity notably better. The most common goal domains set were physical activity, diet/nutrition, and social connection. Clients felt the biggest impact was motivation toward goal achievement. They struggled with some of the technologies. Several participants perceived that the program was not a good fit, mostly those that felt they were already well-managing their .Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM was feasible; a large-scale randomized controlled trial seems possible. However, further attention needs to be paid to improving recruitment and retention. The intervention was well received, though was a better fit for some participants than others.ClinicalTrials.gov, .

We investigated the association between first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016, and the risk of DM in adults.We selected all HIV-infected adults within the Thai National AIDS Program who started a first-line ART regimen consisting the following between October 2006 and September 2013: zidovudine+lamivudine+nevirapine; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)+lamivudine+nevirapine; zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz; TDF+lamivudine/emtricitabine+efavirenz; zidovudine+lamivudine+ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r); or TDF+lamivudine+LPV/r. Diagnosis of DM was defined as having at least 2 of the following characteristics: fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl, 2010 WHO ICD-10 codes E11-E14, or prescription of antidiabetic drugs. To identify ART regimens associated with DM, we used competing risks regression models that considered mortality without DM as a competing event and adjusted for sex, age, pancreas disease, and stratified by groups defined by a score summarizing the propensity to receive a specific first-line ART regimen.Data from 35 710 adults (49.1% male; median age, 35.0 years; median follow-up, 2.0 years) were included. In the multivariable analysis with zidovudine+lamivudine+nevirapine as the reference group, a higher risk of DM was observed with TDF+lamivudine/emtricitabine+efavirenz (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.9), zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz (aSHR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3), and TDF+lamivudine+LPV/r (aSHR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9).Several of the WHO recommended ART regimens, particularly tenofovir + lamivudine +LPV/r and regimens containing efavirenz, may be associated with an increased risk of DM.© The Author(s) 2019.

Aim of this study was to identify perioperative risk factors for anastomotic leak and for 60-day morbidity and mortality after ileocolic anastomoses (stapled vs handsewn).This is a STROBE-compliant study. Demographic and surgical data were gathered from patients with an ileocolic anastomosis performed between November 2010 and September 2016 at a tertiary hospital. Anastomoses were performed using standardised techniques. Independent risk factors for anastomotic leak, complications and mortality were assessed.We included 477 patients: 53.7% of the anastomoses were hand sewn and 46.3% stapled. Laterolateral anastomosis was the most common configuration (93.3%). Anastomotic leak was diagnosed in 8.8% of patients and 36 were classified as major anastomotic leak (7.5%). In the multivariate analysis, male sex ( = 0.014, odds ratio, OR, 2.9), arterial hypertension ( = 0.048, OR 2.29) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 2.4 per litre) were independent risk factors for major anastomotic leak. The overall 60-day complication rate was 27.3%. Male sex (31.3% vs female 22.3%,  = 0.02, OR 1.7),  ( = 0.03 OR 2.0), smoking habit ( = 0.04, OR 1.8) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 3.3 per litre) were independent risk factors for postoperative morbidity.

However, current guidelines do not include routine assessment of myocardial function. We investigated whether echocardiography provides incremental prognostic information in individuals with type 1  without known heart disease.A prospective cohort of individuals with type 1  without known heart disease was recruited from the outpatient clinic. Follow-up was performed through Danish national registers. The association of echocardiography with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the incremental prognostic value when added to the clinical Steno T1D Risk Engine were examined.A total of 1093 individuals were included: median (interquartile range) age 50.2 (39.2-60.3) years and HbA 65 (56-74) mmol/mol; 53% men; and mean (SD) BMI 25.5 (3.9) kg/m and  duration 25.8 (14.6) years. During 7.5 years of follow-up, 145 (13.3%) experienced MACE. Echocardiography significantly and independently predicted MACE: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% (n = 18) vs ≥45% (n = 1075), HR (95% CI) 3.93 (1.91, 8.08), p < 0.001; impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS), 1.65 (1.17, 2.34) (n = 263), p = 0.005; diastolic mitral early velocity (E)/early diastolic tissue Doppler velocity (e') <8 (n = 723) vs E/e' 8-12 (n = 285), 1.59 (1.04, 2.42), p = 0.031; and E/e' <8 vs E/e' ≥12 (n = 85), 2.30 (1.33, 3.97), p = 0.003. In individuals with preserved LVEF (n = 1075), estimates for impaired GLS were 1.49 (1.04, 2.15), p = 0.032; E/e' <8 vs E/e' 8-12, 1.61 (1.04, 2.49), p = 0.033; and E/e' <8 vs E/e' ≥12, 2.49 (1.41, 4.37), p = 0.001.

Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is non-invasive and appears as a promising tool. However, data on breath VOC profiles in pediatric patients are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study and applied quantitative analysis of exhaled VOCs in children suffering from type 1  (T1DM) (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 60). Both groups were matched for sex and age. For breath gas analysis, a very sensitive direct mass spectrometric technique (PTR-TOF) was applied. The duration of disease, the mode of insulin application (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. multiple daily insulin injection) and long-term metabolic control were considered as classifiers in patients. The concentration of exhaled VOCs differed between T1DM patients and healthy children. In particular, T1DM patients exhaled significantly higher amounts of ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylsulfid, isoprene and pentanal compared to healthy controls (171, 1223, 19.6, 112 and 13.5 ppbV vs. 82.4, 784, 11.3, 49.6, and 5.30 ppbV). The most remarkable differences in concentrations were found in patients with poor metabolic control, i.e. those with a mean HbA above 8%. In conclusion, non-invasive breath testing may support the discovery of basic metabolic mechanisms and adaptation early in the progress of T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661466>Uncoupled turnover disrupts mitochondrial quality control in diabetic retinopathy.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) is crucial for regulating central nervous system homeostasis and its disruption has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In healthy tissues, the maintenance of MQC depends upon an exquisite balance between mitophagy (removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy) and biogenesis (de-novo synthesis of mitochondria). Here, we show that mitophagy is disrupted in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and decoupled from mitochondrial biogenesis during the progression of the disease. Diabetic retinas from human post-mortem donors and experimental mice exhibit a net loss of mitochondrial contents during the early stages of the disease process. Using novel diabetic mitophagy-reporter mice (mitoQC-Ins2Akita) alongside pMitoTimer (a molecular clock to address mitochondrial-age dynamics), we demonstrate that mitochondrial loss arose due to an inability of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for -exacerbated mitophagy. However, as  duration increases, Pink1-dependent mitophagy deteriorates, leading to the build-up of mitochondria primed for degradation in DR. Impairment of mitophagy during prolonged  is linked with the development of retinal senescence, a phenotype that blunted hyperglycaemia-induced mitophagy in mitoQC primary Müller cells. Our findings suggest that normalizing mitochondrial turnover may preserve MQC and provide novel therapeutic options for the management of DR-associated complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674043>Risk factors for recurrence in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma after Mohs micrographic surgery: A retrospective review of 237 Asian patients.</a></h2><p>Even after complete removal with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) may recur; however, information about risk factors for recurrence in Asian patients is limited. This retrospective study reviewed cSCC patients treated with MMS at a single tertiary referral center from 2000 to 2017.

As a highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin decreases plasma glucose levels independently of insulin action and enables glycaemic control improvement without increasing the risks associated with intensive insulin therapy. In the phase III DEPICT-1 and -2 trials, dapagliflozin 5 mg/day as an adjunct to insulin improved glycaemic control and reduced total daily insulin dose and bodyweight relative to placebo in adults with inadequately controlled T1D, including in patients with a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m, over 24 weeks of treatment. In extensions of these trials, these improvements were maintained up to 52 weeks. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile and a hypoglycaemia profile generally similar to placebo. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis with dapagliflozin in patients with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m was less than half that of the overall population who received dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved for use in T1D and, while further clinical experience in T1D is required to more definitively establish its efficacy and safety profile, it provides a promising adjunctive treatment option for adults with T1D and a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665370>Changes in Glycemic Load Are Positively Associated with Small Changes in Primary Stress Markers of Allostatic Load in Puerto Rican Women.</a></h2><p>Puerto Ricans experience a high prevalence of type 2 . Dietary glycemic load (GL) and allostatic load (AL) have been linked with . AL, the wear and tear on the body from chronic stress, starts with secretion of primary stress markers from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and immune system. GL can act as a physiological stressor, contributing to the primary AL response.We examined the relation between GL and a composite score of primary stress markers of AL in Puerto Rican adults.Data were from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, a cohort study of Puerto Ricans, aged 45-75 y, including 262 men and 697 women with complete data at baseline and 2-y follow-up. GL was calculated from dietary intake obtained with an FFQ. Sex-specific composite primary AL scores included markers of the HPA axis (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), SNS (epinephrine and norepinephrine), and immune system (C-reactive protein). Linear regression models were stratified by sex and adjusted for covariates.Mean ± SD baseline GL score was 155 ± 28 for men and 135 ± 34 for women. Mean primary stress AL score was 1.25 ± 1.14 for men and 1.25 ± 1.06 for women. GL was not associated with AL score in men. In women, increasing GL from baseline to 2 y was significantly associated with increasing AL, after adjusting for sociodemographics, physical activity, smoking, BMI, menopause, and baseline AL score (β = 0.03; P = 0.049). Results became marginally significant after further adjustment for chronic diseases (P = 0.06) and intake of fats (P values: saturated fats = 0.08; trans fats = 0.06; unsaturated fats = 0.07), but the magnitude of the association remained unchanged.Increasing GL over 2 y was positively associated with increasing composite score of primary markers of AL in Puerto Rican women.

Diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10 Revision codes recorded in the database or, for some entities, on the cut-off points for a particular test result or a specific treatment indicated for that entity. The presence and stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were based on the glomerular filtration rate, the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.A total of 373 185 patients were analysed. 82% of patients exhibited ≥2 comorbidities and 31% exhibited ≥4 comorbidities. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (72%), hyperlipidaemia (60%), obesity (45%), CKD (33%), chronic renal failure (CRF)(28%) and cardiovascular disease (23%). The most frequently coprevalent pairs of chronic conditions were the combination of hypertension with hyperlipidaemia (45%), obesity (35%), CKD (28%), CRF (25%) or cardiovascular disease (19%), as well as the combination of hyperlipidaemia with obesity (28%), CKD (21%), CRF (18%) or cardiovascular disease (15%); other common pairs of comorbidities were obesity/CKD, obesity/CRF, hypertension/retinopathy, hypertension/albuminuria, hypertension/urinary tract infection, CVD/CRF and CVD/CKD, which were each present in more than 10% of patients.Patients with type 2  have a high frequency of coprevalence of metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease and CKD and thus require an integrated management approach.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The TEP included a coordinated transfer process, individual appointments and a group course. At baseline and at 12 months we evaluated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) frequency of severe (SH) hypoglycaemia/patient/year and non severe hypoglycaemia (NSH). The patients were classified into two groups and compared: hypoglycaemia awareness (HA) and HU according to the Clarke Test <3R or>3R respectively.Fifty-six patients (age 18.1±0.3 years, 46% females, HbA 8.0±1.2%) underwent the TEP. In the baseline evaluation 16% presented HU. The number of SH was higher in the HU Group (0.33±0.50 vs. 0.09±0.28 P<.05). The percentage of patients with>2 NSH/week was higher, albeit not significantly, in the HU group (66% vs. 34%, p=0.06). At 12 months 11% of the patients continued to present HU. The number of SH remained higher in the HU group (0.38±1.06 vs. 0.02±0.15 P=.04).The percentage of young people with T1D with HU is quite high at transfer. Although the TEP improves hypoglycaemia awareness it does not solve this important problem. Patients with HU more frequently present SH. It is necessary to identify HU in order to reduce SH which continues to be a problem in people with T1D.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

CRPC is characterized by alterations in the expression levels of steroidgenic enzymes that enable the tumour to derive potent androgens from circulating adrenal androgen precursors. Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis leads to the localized production of both canonical androgens such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as less well characterized 11-oxygenated androgens, which until recently have been overlooked in the context of CRPC. In this review we discuss the contribution of both canonical and 11-oxygenated androgen precursors to the intratumoral androgen pool in CRPC. We present evidence that CRPC remains androgen dependent and discuss the alterations in steroidogenic enzyme expression and how these affect the various pathways to intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. Finally we summarize the current treatment strategies for targeting adrenal derived androgen biosynthesis.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of this biological checkup and to determine the most relevant parameters.We conducted a monocentric retrospective study of all standardized and systematically conducted blood tests (CBC and measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine) over a 15-month period among 726 French Army recruits.The population included mainly young males (85.4%, mean age 21.6 years). More than half (54.1%) of the blood tests had at least one abnormal parameter, most often concerning the CBC. Anemia occurred in 5.3% of the population and was mostly normocytic. Microcytosis was mostly not associated with anemia (72.3% of cases). Lymphopenia occurred in 20.1% of the population and was mostly mild. Eosinophilia was present in 5.1% of the population and was never severe. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 0.7% of the population and was never severe. Serum levels of aminotransferases were elevated in 8.1% of the population. Fasting plasma glucose averaged 84 mg/dL (SD: 0.07) ranging from 64 to 123 mg/dL, was abnormal in 0.4% of the population, and one case of  was diagnosed. Serum creatinine concentration was elevated in 0.7% of the population.CBCs gave useful information but iron deficiency was common and insufficiently detected by this single analysis. Assessing aminotransferase levels without screening for viral hepatitis and systematic measurement of fasting plasma glucose levels did not appear to be efficient. In addition, the only interest in systematic measurement of creatinine serum levels was to obtain a reference level for long-term follow-up. In addition to the urinary dipstick, the systematic biological checkup at recruitment could be limited to a CBC with measurement of plasma ferritin levels and Hepatitis B virus serology, providing that any CBC abnormalities, in particular cytopenia, eosinophilia, and microcytosis, are systematically investigated.

Due to its pathological similarities to type 2  (T2DM), such as β-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, inflammation, disordered glucose metabolism, impaired signaling pathways of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain . Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright © 2019.

The subgingival microbiome, a key player in periodontitis pathogenesis, is not well characterized in T2DM population. To better understand whether the subgingival microbiome is different between T2DM and systemically healthy, nondiabetic (ND) subjects, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the subgingival microbiome in T2DM patients (n = 15) compared with ND subjects (n = 16). Using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we investigated the microbiome in the healthy periodontal state, periodontitis state, and resolved state after treatment. We found that in the periodontitis state, the shift in the subgingival microbiome from the healthy state was less prominent in T2DM compared with ND subjects, yet the clinical signs of disease were similar for both. Furthermore, we revealed highly correlated presence of pathogenic species in relative abundance not only in the periodontitis state, but also in the healthy state in T2DM, suggesting an elevated risk of progression to periodontitis in this cohort. We further investigated the functional potentials of the subgingival microbiome and identified a set of microbial marker genes associated with the clinical states. These genes were significantly enriched in 21 pathways, some of which are associated with periodontitis and some potentially link T2DM and periodontitis. This study identified the longitudinal changes of the subgingival microbiome associated with periodontitis in T2DM and suggests that T2DM patients are more susceptible to shifts in the subgingival microbiome toward dysbiosis, potentially due to impaired host metabolic and immune regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662026>Adapting a Prediction Rule for Metabolic Syndrome Risk Assessment Suitable for Developing Countries.</a></h2><p> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic disturbances that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2  (DM). The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society.

Forty-five adult male Sprague Dawely rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 15); control group, diabetic group, and Br-MSCs treated diabetic group. The homing ability of Br-MSCs in diabetic treated rat testicles was confirmed via semi-quantitative RT- PCR analysis of a human specific Gapdh mRNA expression level. Our result showed that type1 diabetic rats exerted an elevation in blood glucose level and a reduction in body weight, fasting serum insulin, FSH, LH, and total testosterone levels, relative and absolute testicular weights, sperm count, motility, and live ratio. In addition, downregulation in the hypothalamic kisspeptin-GnRH system, HPG axis and testicular steroidogenesis compared to control group was noticed. Moreover, upregulation of testicular proinflammatory and apoptotic markers relative mRNA expression compared to control group was observed. Furthermore, a decrease in testicular tissue antioxidant activity (CAT, SOD, GSH) and an increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA) compared to control group was shown. However, Br-MSCs administration restored or even exceeded the normal physiological tone in most of these parameters to the point where a potential therapeutic role for Br-MSCs in type1diabetic induced infertility can be suggested.Copyright © 2019.

If oral carbohydrate cannot be used, there is a hypothetical risk of severe hypoglycemia. The present article describes the effect on glucose of small doses of subcutaneous glucagon to revert hypoglycemia and prevent severe events in small children with type 1  using a continuous glucose monitoring.We analyzed 4 episodes of impending or mild hypoglycemia in 3 children with type 1  who refused to eat carbohydrates. Using a standard U-100 insulin syringe, children received one "unit" (10 μg) of glucagon subcutaneously for every year of age up to 15 units (150 μg). If the blood glucose did not increase within 30 min, the initial dosage was repeated at that time. Instructions were given by phone from the physician. At the following visit data from continuous glucose monitoring devices, insulin pump and glucometer were downloaded and reviewed retrospectively from the physician.Blood glucose from continuous glucose monitoring after one and 2 h was 127 ± 80 mg/dl and 165 ± 78 mg/dl, respectively. After a glucagon injection, there was a single recurrence of hypoglycemia, requiring another shot. The glucagon was well tolerated, except for nausea, present before the injection.

To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over 2 years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion. The methods used here represent a novel process for identifying combined immune signatures that predict outcomes relevant for complex and heterogeneous diseases like T1D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665588>Vitamin D Supplementation and Prevention of Type 2 .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670807>Is sequential free flap safe in oral cancer reconstruction in the same patient? An outcome and complication analysis.</a></h2><p>Sequential free flap reconstruction in patient with head and neck cancer can provide reliable and effective wound coverage. Only a few studies have reported on the outcome and complications analysis but without consensus on the recipient vessels and flap chosen. Herein, we presented the outcome and analysed the risk factors for complications in sequential free flap reconstruction.Patients who had sequential free tissue transfers due to cancer recurrence, second primary cancer, or secondary correction of the soft tissue contractures and volume deficits were all included. Variables extracted included demographics, comorbidities, free flap characteristics, infection, dehiscence and flap necrosis rates.In total, 40 patients with 92 free flaps were analyzed; 42 initial and 50 sequential free flaps. The most common recipient vessels for sequential flap were contralateral superficial thyroid vessels (68%). The most common flap for both initial and sequential free flap was anterolateral thigh flap (64.3 and 62%). The success rate of sequential free flap was 92.0 compared to 92.9% for initial free flap, which showed no significant difference. Female was independently associated with delayed wound healing with an odds ratio of 90.91 (95% confidence interval 0.001-0.17, P = 0.001), as well as  with an odds ratio of 31.14 (95% confidence interval 2.60-373.19, P = 0.007). Sequential free flap was not a risk factor for any complication.Sequential free flap is a reliable method for head and neck surgery without more complication rate comparing to initial free flap reconstruction. More attentions should be paid on patients with preferential risk for certain complications.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Insulin, which is produced by β-pancreatic cells, is a chief orchestrator of glucose metabolism, regulating its consumption within cells, which leads to energy generation or storage as glycogen. Abnormally lower insulin secretion from β-cells, insulin insensitivity, and insulin tolerance lead to higher plasma glucose levels, resulting in metabolic complications. The last century has witnessed extraordinary efforts by the scientific community to develop anti-diabetic drugs, and these efforts yielded the discovery of exogenous insulin and various classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs.Despite these exhaustive anti-diabetic pharmaceutical and therapeutic efforts, long-term glycemic control, hypoglycemic crisis, safety issues, large-scale economic burden, side effects remain core problems.The last decade has witnessed the development of various new classes of anti-diabetic drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles.

By combining self-monitoring technologies, the acute physiological consequences of behaviors could be shown, prompting greater consideration to physical activity levels today, which impact the risk of developing  years or decades later. However, until recently, commercially available technologies have not been able to show individuals the health benefits of being physically active.The objective of this study was to examine the usage, feasibility, and acceptability of behavioral and physiological self-monitoring technologies in individuals at risk of developing T2D.A total of 45 adults aged ≥40 years and at moderate to high risk of T2D were recruited to take part in a 3-arm feasibility trial. Each participant was provided with a behavioral (Fitbit Charge 2) and physiological (FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitor) monitor for 6 weeks, masked according to group allocation. Participants were allocated to glucose feedback (4 weeks) followed by glucose and physical activity (biobehavioral) feedback (2 weeks; group 1), physical activity feedback (4 weeks) followed by biobehavioral feedback (2 weeks; group 2), or biobehavioral feedback (6 weeks; group 3). Participant usage (including time spent on the apps and number of glucose scans) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the feasibility (including recruitment and number of sensor displacements) and acceptability (including monitor wear time) of the intervention. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted at the 6-week follow-up appointment.For usage, time spent on the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre apps declined over the 6 weeks for all groups. Of the FreeStyle Libre sensor scans conducted by participants, 17% (1798/10,582) recorded rising or falling trends in glucose, and 24% (13/45) of participants changed ≥1 of the physical activity goals. For feasibility, 49% (22/45) of participants completed the study using the minimum number of FreeStyle Libre sensors, and a total of 41 sensors were declared faulty or displaced. For acceptability, participants wore the Fitbit for 40.1 (SD 3.2) days, and 20% (9/45) of participants and 53% (24/45) of participants were prompted by email to charge or sync the Fitbit, respectively. Interviews unearthed participant perceptions on the study design by suggesting refinements to the eligibility criteria and highlighting important issues about the usability, wearability, and features of the technologies.Individuals at risk of developing T2D engaged with wearable digital health technologies providing behavioral and physiological feedback. Modifications are required to both the study and to commercially available technologies to maximize the chances of sustained usage and behavior change.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these surgeries via an ideal risk assessment model, and reduce risks via applying some findings (for instance, perioperative beta-blockers). There are some risk assessment systems, but these have generally not been verified for patients with gynecologic cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of surgery for gynecological oncologic patients and suggest an easy risk assessment model and risk reduction by applying our findings.We retrospectively analyzed 258 gynecologic patients with cancer. Age, diagnosis, staging, performance scale, metoprolol use, heart, renal , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease, , operation type and length, carcinoma antigen 125, ascites, albumin, surgical procedure, hospitalization length, and complications were recorded.Of the 258 patients, 173 patients (67.1%) had no complications, 43 patients (16.7%) had one and 42 patients (16.3%) had two or more complications. The most common complication was the acid-base imbalance (14%), followed by urinary tract infection (9.7%). Parameters associated with complications were performance status, ascites, operating length, metoprolol use, and upper abdominal surgery. In our proposed scoring model with a total score range 0-23, cut-off value points for both the presence and rate of complications was found as >5.In gynecological patients with cancer, the addition of metoprolol use and upper abdominal surgery within preoperative risk assessment evaluation parameters are significantly effective in predicting the rate and severity of complications. Moreover, we have suggested a simple, practical, and convenient scoring model for this evaluation.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661063>The association of smoking with ultrasound-measured kidney dimensions .</a></h2><p>Ultrasound is considered a preferred first-line imaging technique for the assessment of kidney function. The potential relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and ultrasound-measured renal characteristics has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco smoke would be associated with reduced kidney dimensions.This was a cross-sectional study that included all individuals over age 18 at a single site in Mojokerto, Indonesia. A questionnaire was used to assess prior history and environmental exposure, and blinded evaluators performed ultrasound assessments. Six kidney parameters (length, width, and parenchymal thickness of each kidney) were considered as dependent variables, and statistical relationships were assessed using multivariate analysis. Echogenicity was evaluated using a 5-point grading scale described previously.Of the 445 participants assessed, a total of 138 male and 269 female subjects were included in the final analysis. There was a statistically significant association between kidney measures and the following independent variables: pack years smoking (p < 0.001), height (p < 0.001), weight (p < 0.001), and beginning to smoke at the age of 25 or younger (p < 0.001). There was not a statistically significant association between kidney measures and hypertension (p > 0.05) or  (p > 0.05). Echogenicity was similar among all smoking groups.Kidney dimensions were decreased in individuals with increased smoking history. This association is notable, particularly given that statistically significant associations were not observed between renal dimensions and hypertension or . The null findings using echogenicity are consistent with previous studies. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio is related to liver fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present co-twin control study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs was designed to identify nutritional factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Cross-sectional study of 50 MZ twin pairs (age range: 23-36 years), of which ten pairs were discordant for liver fat (liver fat percentage of one twin ≤5% and his/her co-twin >5% and a difference between co-twins of >5%) as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nutrient intake was calculated from 3-day food records.Among the ten liver fat-discordant twin pairs, the n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly higher in the twins with higher liver as compared to their co-twins with lower liver fat (6.6:1 vs. 3.2:1, p-value = 0.005). In multiple regression analysis of within-pair differences including all 50 twin pairs, a higher n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly associated with a higher liver fat percentage within MZ twin pairs after adjustment for body mass index, energy intake and other covariates (standardized beta = 0.43, p-value = 0.001).Our findings suggest that the n-6: n-3 ratio is a promising dietary agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

The mean differences between the measured and estimated REE values were calculated to assess accuracy, and the Bland-Altman method was used to assess the level of agreement.Ten predictive were included. In males, all predictive equations gave significantly different estimates of REE when compared to that measured by IC. On the other hand, in females, the mean difference between the REE value estimated by Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations and that measured using IC was not significant, and agreement was confirmed using Bland-Altman plots.We suggest Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations for accurate REE estimation in females; however, new validated REE estimation equations for males in this population are still needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662018>Long-term training in -related knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practice among  liaison nurses.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664455>The Thyrotropin Reference Range Should Be Changed in Older Patients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670385>Risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To provide a comprehensive update on the most prevalent, significant risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP).Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant publications up to March 2019.

Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective therapeutic strategy for . However, whether the mechanism of action of EA on  is related to altered circRNAs is unclear. The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of EA on circRNA expression in plasma exosomes and the underlying signaling pathway in mice with type 2  (T2DM). In total, 10 mice were randomly categorized into a normal group and 20 mice were used for the T2DM model preparation and randomly divided into the model and model + EA groups. Mice in the model + EA group were administered EA treatment. Changes in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and islet structure were evaluated. Plasma exosomes were subjected to RNA sequencing, and then bioinformatics analysis and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) verification were performed. EA treatment reduced the FBG level, preserved the islet structure, and reduced the islet  cell apoptotic rate in T2DM mice. After EA treatment, 165 differentially expressed circRNAs were found. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that thyroid hormone signaling was actively regulated by EA. circRNA/miRNA interaction analysis revealed mmu-mir-7092-3p to be closely associated with circINPP4B, suggesting that the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway may be affected by EA. qPCR confirmed that 12 circRNAs had significant differences. These findings suggested that EA intervention can significantly protect islet function and improve the FBG level in T2DM, possibly via regulation of thyroid hormone and phosphatidylinositol signaling.Copyright © 2019 Yin Shou et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661471>Relationship Between  and Cirrhosis Risk in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients in Wuhan, China.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The objective of our research was to assess the possible link between  (DM) and liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals with a diagnosis of both liver cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection (n=257), and CHB-only patients (n=514) were matched 1: 2 by age and sex. Demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical characteristics were reviewed. Univariate and the multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate the association between DM and HBV-related liver cirrhosis. RESULTS The prevalence of DM was higher among CHB patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without liver cirrhosis (22.2% vs. 12.8%, P=0.001), yielding an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 2.317 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.528-3.513. Among them, 87.7% of liver cirrhosis patients were diagnosed with DM before liver cirrhosis diagnosis, yielding an AOR (95% CI) of 2.386 (1.533-3.714). In comparison to patients with a DM duration of 2-5 years, the AOR (95% CI) for those with a DM duration >5 years was 2.073 (0.701-6.132).

We know that the size and distribution of the ossified lesions in patients with OPLL are different in each case. However, the characteristics of the patients with radiologically severe cervical OPLL remain unknown.The participants of our study were symptomatic patients with cervical OPLL who were diagnosed by standard radiographs of the cervical spine. Whole-spine CT data and demographic data such as age and sex were obtained from 20 institutions belonging to the Japanese Multicenter Research Organization for Ossification of the Spinal Ligament. According to the number of the levels involved by OPLL, we stratified the patients into two subgroups: severe group (S-group) and non-severe group (NS-group) to delineate the characteristics of radiologically severe patients with cervical OPLL. We also evaluated the most compressed level and the degree of occupying ratio of cervical spinal canal by OPLL at the most compressed level.A total of 234 patients with a mean age of 65 years were recruited. The S-group consisted of 48 patients (21%, 12 females and 36 males) and the NS-group consisted of 92 patients (79%, 22 females and 70 males). The mean age of males in the S-group (68 years old) was significantly higher than that of males in the NS-group (64 years old); however there was no significant difference in the mean age in females between the S-group (69 years old) and the NS-group (66 years old). No significant difference of body mass index, ossification of the nuchal ligament-positivity and presence of  were found between the S- and the NS-group.It is likely that the manner of extension of cervical OPLL is different between male and female patients.Copyright © 2019.

Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals worldwide. The rate of cardiovascular events increases after 65 years in men and after 75 years in women. Myocardial infarction and stroke are the leading disorders caused by atherosclerosis, that lead to death or functional incapacity. Elderly people have a greater risk to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The incidence and prevalence of atherosclerosis increase with age and the number of cardiovascular events is higher in elderly patients. The most efficient treatment against atherosclerosis is the treatment with statins, that has been shown to decrease the risk both of stroke and coronary artery disease in all age groups. The advantages of the treatment become evident after at least one year of treatment. Primary prevention is the most important way of preventing cardiovascular disease in elderly individuals, by promoting a healthy lifestyle and reducing the risk factors. Secondary prevention after a stroke or myocardial infarction includes mandatory a statin, to diminish the risk of a recurrent cardiovascular event. The possible side effects of statin therapy are , myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity. The side effects of the treatment are more likely to occur in elderly patients, due to their multiple associated comorbidities and drugs that may interact with statins. In elderly people, the benefits and disadvantages of the treatment with statins should be put in balance, especially in those receiving high doses of statins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673511>Providing Dignified Palliative Care Services in Liberia.</a></h2><p>Liberia faces a critical shortage of palliative care services, particularly for persons with advanced-stage HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, , and cancers. Access to healthcare services is especially limited in rural areas, along with a lack of supportive social and economic resources. Home of Dignity (HoD) Health Center was established in 2013 in Yarbah's Town to fill a last-option palliative care gap. The mission emphasizes patient wellbeing and worth. HoD integrates health, agriculture, and education on-site for immediate medical needs, broader sustainable development, and reducing disease-associated stigma in local communities.We aimed to describe the Center's integrated approach and conduct a descriptive analysis of the HoD patient population.We reviewed patient characteristics (sex, age distribution, mobility status, and CD4 count on arrival) and outcomes (survival rate and community reintegration) for patients with HIV seeking care at the Center between 2013-2017.Of 182 patients (ages 3 months-50 years), over half arrived to the facility bedridden and over 82% had CD4 counts between <100-350. Of the 182 patients, 66% survived, 27% died, and 7% were lost to follow-up. Of surviving patients, 90% were successfully reintegrated into their communities. The clinic also served over 365 chronically ill patients that had been rejected by other health providers during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak.The Center is providing last-option palliative care services in the country. As a trusted healthcare center, patients also seek care for acute conditions, resulting in unanticipated resource demands. HoD's experience underscores the need for development of training programs for medical professionals, supply chains, community outreach, and resourcing channels to ensure adequate and sustainable service provision for hospice and palliative care services and reduce stigma in the country.

We have measured 25(OH)D concentration, markers of inflammation including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) by using standard methods.We stratified control and T2DM groups by 25(OH)D concentration and it indicates that in severe deficiency and sufficiency category IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL were significantly different while in moderate deficiency category only MDA was significantly different, among control and T2DM groups. In an insufficiency category, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MDA, and Ox-LDL were significantly different among control and T2DM groups. Correlation analysis indicates a negative correlation of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL among total subjects. Further, logistics regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of different categories of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL before and after adjustment to body mass index and waist to hip ratio.This study suggest that vitamin D may have significant implications in the prevention of inflammation and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

Early presentation of this rare condition includes nonspecific symptoms such as swelling, erythema, sensory symptoms, and decreased functionality, making diagnosis challenging.We systematically reviewed 32 case reports published between 1924 and 2016. A total of 59 shoulders from 56 patients are included in this analysis. Variables include patient demographic characteristics, presentation, etiology, diagnostic techniques, treatment, outcome, and follow-up of Charcot shoulder.We compiled a total of 25 right shoulders (42%), 24 left shoulders (41%), and 10 shoulders (17%) with unspecified laterality. The mean patient age (and standard deviation) was 49 ± 11 years, and the median age was 47 years. There was a higher prevalence in men (37 shoulders [63%]) compared with women (22 shoulders [37%]). Presenting symptoms included reduced range of motion (53 shoulders [90%]), paresthesia or hypoesthesia (45 [76%]), swelling (44 [75%]), weakness (40 [68%]), pain (31 [53%]), and reduction in deep tendon reflexes (22 [37%]). Shoulder radiographs were made in all cases. The presence of a syrinx was detected in 45 shoulders (76%) with magnetic resonance imaging, myelography, or clinical diagnosis. Sixteen shoulders (27%) reported exposure to trauma, with a 69% decrease in time from presentation to diagnosis compared with non-traumatic cases. Treatment was categorized as solely nonoperative management (14 [24%]), operative management (13 [22%]), combined therapy (20 [34%]), and no treatment listed (10 [17%]). Two surgical cases (3%) were excluded from our treatment group analysis as they were treated for unrelated or misdiagnosed conditions.Our study increases awareness and understanding of this complex, progressive disease to reduce delay and misdiagnosis and to contribute to the standard-of-care recommendations.Therapeutic Level IV.

In logistic regression models, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the outcomes by an increase of 63 units of neuroticism (equalling the interquartile range). Analyses were adjusted for maternal age, educational level, height, body mass index, year of delivery, smoking during pregnancy, involuntary childlessness, and psychiatric morbidity. Main outcomes were mode of delivery, gestational , gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, induction of delivery, prolonged delivery, severe lacerations, placental retention, postpartum haemorrhage, premature birth, infant born small or large for gestational age, and Apgar score. Neuroticism was not independently associated with adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes besides gestational . For future studies, models examining sub-components of neuroticism or pregnancy-specific anxiety are encouraged.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662353>Continuity of care and delivery of  and hypertensive care among regular users of primary care services in Chile: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Explore factors related to continuity of care and its association with  and hypertensive care, and disease control.Cross-sectional study.Data from the Chilean Health National Survey 2009-2010.Regular users of primary care services aged 15 or older.Proportion of hypertensive and diabetic patients with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and HbA1c<7.0% respectively, self-report of diagnosis, treatment and recent foot and ophthalmological exams. Associations between continuity of care, sociodemographic characteristics, and primary and secondary outcomes were explored using logistic regression.3887 primary care service users were included. 14.7% recognised a usual GP, 82.3% of them knew their name. Continuity of care was positively associated with age >65 years (OR 4.81, 95% CI 3.16 to 7.32), being female (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.05), retired (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.83), obese (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.14), high cardiovascular risk (OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.13 to 4.17) and widowed (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99), and negatively associated with educational level (8-12 vs <8 years OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97), smoking (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82) and physical activity (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95). Continuity of care was associated with diagnosis awareness (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.21 to 6.63), pharmacological treatment (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.63) and a recent foot (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.84 to 5.45) and ophthalmological exam (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.66 to 6.18) in diabetic but not in hypertensive patients.Continuity of care was associated with higher odds of having a recent foot and ophthalmological exam in patients with , but not with better diseases control.

However, whether this association is causal is still unclear. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its metabolic traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International  Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030). The MR-derived estimates for raised fasting plasma glucose was 0.578 (95% CI 0.321, 0.980) per 10 nmol/L GRS determined increase of 25(OH) D levels.We found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25(OH)D conferred an increased risk of MS and its metabolic traits. However, we created our GRS only on the basis of common variants, which represent limited amount of variance in 25(OH)D. MR studies using rare variants, and large-scale well-designed RCTs about the effect of vitamin D supplementation on MS are warranted to further validate the findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664483>Relationship between gut microbiota, probiotics, and type 2 .</a></h2><p>The worldwide prevalence of type 2  (T2DM) is constantly increasing, and it has become a major concern, with several implications for public health, economy, and social well-being. It is well-known that several factors such as lifestyle, increased intake of fat and sugar-rich foods, and host genetics can lead to T2DM. Some recent studies have suggested that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can trigger T2DM. Since then, considerable effort has been made to understand the link between the composition of intestinal microbiota and T2DM, as well as the role of probiotics in modulation of intestinal microbiota.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

We evaluated how the clinical phenotype of patients initiating GLP-1RA changed from 2010 to 2018.This was a retrospective study conducted at six  outpatient clinics in Northeast Italy. We collected data of T2D patients who initiated new GLP-1RA between 2010 and 2018. We recorded baseline characteristics, including demographics, anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, lipid profile, liver enzymes, renal function and concomitant medications. We recorded updated HbA1c and body weight at follow-up.There were 83,116 T2D patients from a general population of ~ 1,380,000 inhabitants. Among 6167 cases of GLP-1RA initiation, 5408 were analyzed after excluding intra-class switchers. Prescription of GLP-1RA increased exponentially, and the change in the type of GLP-1RA reflected waves of their entering the market. From 2010 to 2018, there were significant increases in baseline age,  duration and prevalence of male sex, of cardiovascular disease and of insulin users. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels decreased concomitantly with increasing use of medications for the control of cardiovascular risk. Baseline average HbA1c (8.3% [67 mmol/mol]) and BMI (34 kg/m) and their improvement after GLP-1RA initiation did not change over time.Despite the early positioning of GLP-1RA in T2D treatment algorithms, GLP-1RA have been prescribed in patients with progressively more advanced disease stage and especially in the presence of cardiovascular disease. Optimization of GLP-1RA use in routine clinical practice is still needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664454>High Glucose Provokes Microvesicles Generation from Glomerular Podocytes via NOX4/ROS Pathway.</a></h2><p>Microvesicles (MVs) were involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and . Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC-5) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic acid (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC-5 cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA. High glucose can provoke MVs generation from glomerular podocytes through ROS/NOX4 pathway, not from mitochondrial pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673100>GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has a neuroprotective effect on an aged rat model of Wolfram syndrome.</a></h2><p>Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that is mainly characterized by , optic nerve atrophy, deafness, and progressive brainstem degeneration. Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has shown a promising anti-diabetic effect in WS treatment in both animal models and in human patients. Since previous research has tended to focus on investigation of the WS first symptom, , the aim of the present study was to examine liraglutide effect on WS-associated neurodegeneration. We took 9-month-old Wfs1 knock-out (KO) animals that already had developed glucose intolerance and treated them with liraglutide for 6 months. Our research results indicate that 6-month liraglutide treatment reduced neuroinflammation and ameliorated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the inferior olive of the aged WS rat model. Liraglutide treatment also protected retinal ganglion cells from cell death and optic nerve axons from degeneration. According to this, the results of the present study provide novel insight that GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has a neuroprotective effect in the WS rat model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672578>Amlexanox reversed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through IKKε inhibition of hepatic stellate cell.</a></h2><p>Amlexanox, an inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase epsilon (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), was demonstrated to be effective in  and obesity. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Different epidemiologic studies have shown a significant relationship between lower intake of fibre and metabolic disorders. There are many naturally occurring dietary fibres among which gums are utmost important class e.g. guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, gellan gum, and gum acacia. Gum acacia has been considered as a safe dietary fibre by the United States, Food and Drug Administration and it is used widely as a stabilizer, thickening agent, and emulsifier in the food industry. Though gum acacia feeding has been reported to exert many beneficial effects in both rodents and humans, the underpinning for the different proposed molecular mechanisms are still elusive. So it would be of great relevance to conduct studies to understand the molecular mechanism of action of such fibres in the management of metabolic diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663844>Reduction of Resting Energy Expenditure and Sarcopenic Obesity in Adults with Overweight and Obesity: A Brief Report.</a></h2><p>The last decade has seen the emergence of a new condition, describing the coexistence of obesity and sarcopenia, termed sarcopenic obesity (SO). We aimed to assess the potential association between SO and reduced resting energy expenditure (REE).Body composition and REE were measured using a bioimpedance analyser (Tanita BC-418) and Indirect Calorimeter (Vmax Encore 229) respectively in 89 adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, referred to the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Beirut Arab University (Lebanon). Participants were then categorized as having SO or not.Thirty-nine of the 89 participants met the criteria for SO (43.8%), and these participants displayed a significantly lower REE per unit body weight than those in the group without SO (19.02 ± 2.26 vs 20.87 ± 2.77; p = 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that the presence of SO decreases REE by 1.557 kcal/day for each kg of body weight (β = -1.557; CI = -0.261 ¬- (-0.503); p = 0.004), after adjusting for age and gender.SO appears to be present in a high proportion of treatment-seeking adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, and it seems to be associated with a reduced REE, compared with those without SO.

This study investigates the agreement between self-reported and general practice-recorded data amongst such patients and the impact of participant factors on this agreement.data on health conditions was collected from participants in the Community Ageing Research 75+ (CARE75+) study (n = 964) by self-report during face-to-face assessment and interrogation of the participants' general practice electronic health records. Agreement between self-report and practice records was assessed using Kappa statistics and the effect of participant demographics using logistic regression.agreement ranged from K = 0.25 to 1.00.

Infection of the diabetic foot is a common complication, which may lead to amputation. If infection extends to involve bone, the risk of amputation is increased 4-fold. Presence of osteomyelitis at the histopathologic margin of resection portends a poor prognosis in osteomyelitis outside the setting of the diabetic foot. We aimed to assess the association of a positive histopathologic margin with the outcome of osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot.Medical records were reviewed for all patients who underwent below-ankle amputation for osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot. Patients who had at least 1 year of follow-up, a histopathologic diagnosis of osteomyelitis, and a comment on whether the margin was involved were included.Thirty-nine of 66 (59%) cases had remission of osteomyelitis at 12 months. When comparing cases with remission with those who experienced recurrence in the 12 months of follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences in age, glycosylated hemoglobin, duration of antimicrobial therapy, Infectious Diseases Society of America class, or presence of osteomyelitis at the histopathologic margin. Among cases with a negative histopathologic margin, 29/48 (60.4%) were free of disease at 1 year, compared with 10/18 (55.6%) cases with a positive histopathologic margin ( = .72). Remission was significantly more frequent in cases undergoing amputation at the digit level (66.7%) compared with amputation at the metatarsal level (40.7%) ( = .045).Osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot at the histopathologic margin of resection was not associated with increased risk of treatment failure. Resection at the level of the digit was associated with a lower risk of failure than at the metatarsal level.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665216>Association of Copy Number Variation of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 Region With Cortical and Subcortical Morphology and Cognition.</a></h2><p>Recurrent microdeletions and duplications in the genomic region 15q11.2 between breakpoints 1 (BP1) and 2 (BP2) are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. These structural variants are present in 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664108>GPR40 activation initiates store-operated Ca entry and potentiates insulin secretion via the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway in pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>The long-chain fatty acid receptor GPR40 plays an important role in potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) from pancreatic β-cells. Previous studies demonstrated that GPR40 activation enhances Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors. However, it remains unknown how ER Ca release via the IP3 receptor is linked to GIIS potentiation. Recently, stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 was identified as a key regulator of store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), but little is known about its contribution in GPR40 signaling. We show that GPR40-mediated potentiation of GIIS is abolished by knockdown of IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R1), STIM1 or Ca-channel Orai1 in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown significantly impaired SOCE and the increase of intracellular Ca by the GPR40 agonist, fasiglifam. Furthermore, β-cell-specific STIM1 knockout mice showed impaired fasiglifam-mediated GIIS potentiation not only in isolated islets but also in vivo. These results indicate that the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway plays an important role in GPR40-mediated SOCE initiation and GIIS potentiation in pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673474>The predictive value of weight gain and waist circumference for gestational .</a></h2><p>The first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between gestational  (GDM) and gestational weight gain (WG), waist circumference (WC), prepregnancy, and gestational body mass index (BMI). The second aim of our study was to assess the ability of WG, WC, prepregnancy, and gestational BMI with special reference to their cut-off points on predicting the risk of GDM in pregnant women in Turkey.A total of 261 women who underwent screening for GDM with the 75-g glucose tolerance test (GTT) between 24 and 28 gestational weeks were included. According to the 75-g oral GTT results, women were classified into two groups: the GDM group and non-GDM group. The data collected included age, parity, plasma glucose level for fasting, 1- and 2-h tests, WC, prepregnancy and gestational BMI, prepregnancy weight, WG during pregnancy, gestational age at birth, and birth weight.WC at 20-24 weeks of gestation, prepregnancy BMI, and gestational BMI had a predictive capacity for GDM. According to our results, optimal cut-off points for the best predictive value of GDM were WC of 100 cm with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 70%, prepregnancy BMI of 25 kg/m with a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 76%, and gestational BMI of 28.3 kg/m with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 77.4%.The measurement of prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC may be useful in predicting the risk of GDM. Pregnant women with increased prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC measurements may be susceptible to the development of GDM.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662747>miR-29a Negatively Affects Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion and MIN6 Cell Proliferation via Cdc42/-Catenin Signaling.</a></h2><p> is a progressive metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Functional impairment of islet  cells can occur to varying degrees. This impairment can initially be compensated for by proliferation and metabolic changes of  cells. Cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) and the microRNA (miRNA) miR-29 have important roles in -cell proliferation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which we further explored using the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6.Upregulation and downregulation of miR-29a and Cdc42 were accomplished using transient transfection. miR-29a and Cdc42 expression was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. MIN6 proliferation was detected using a cell counting kit assay. GSIS under high-glucose (20.0 mM) or basal-glucose (5.0 mM) stimulation was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The miR-29a binding site in the Cdc42 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was determined using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays.miR-29a overexpression inhibited proliferation ( < 0.01) and GSIS under high-glucose stimulation ( < 0.01).

In the present work, we established a facile, sensitive and selective fluorescence method based on silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) and MnO2 nanosheets for the determination of α-glucosidase and one of its inhibitors acarbose. The fluorescence of SiQDs was greatly quenched by MnO2 nanosheets due to the inner filter effect. α-Glucosidase could easily catalyze the hydrolysis of l-ascorbic acid-2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl (AAG) to produce ascorbic acid (AA), which could reduce MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+, resulting in dramatic recovery of the fluorescence of SiQDs. The proposed sensing platform could provide a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of SiQDs and the concentration of α-glucosidase in the range of 0.02-2.5 U mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.007 U mL-1. In addition, the sensing platform could be used for α-glucosidase inhibition. Acarbose was one of the most common and typical inhibitors, and this sensing platform can be utilized to detect acarbose in the range of 1-1000 μM. The developed fluorescence method was successfully validated for the determination of α-glucosidase in human serum samples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671667>Methods and Guidelines for Measurement of Glucagon in Plasma.</a></h2><p>Glucagon circulates in concentrations in the low picomolar range, which is demanding regarding the sensitivity of the methods for quantification applied. In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian metabolism, but its precise physiological role in glucose and lipid metabolism and in metabolic disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error. We also reviewed some of the dogmas regarding glucagon secretion in the light of the methodological difficulties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672144> and baseline glucose are associated with inflammation, left ventricular function and short- and long-term outcome in acute coronary syndromes: role of the novel biomarker Cyr 61.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) impacts short term outcomes, but little is known about longer term effects. We therefore designed this study to firstly determine the association between hyperglycemia and short term and longer term outcomes in patients presenting with ACS and secondly evaluate the prognostic role of , body mass index (BMI) and the novel biomarker Cyr61 on outcomes.The prospective Special Program University Medicine-Acute Coronary Syndrome (SPUM-ACS) cohort enrolled 2168 patients with ACS between December 2009 and October 2012, of which 2034 underwent PCI (93.8%). Patients were followed up for 12 months. Events were independently adjudicated by three experienced cardiologists. Participants were recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Switzerland: Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and Bern. Participants presenting with acute coronary syndromes and who underwent coronary angiography were included in the analysis. Patients were grouped according to history of  (or HbA1c greater than 6%), baseline blood sugar level (BSL; < 6, 6-11.1 and > 11.1 mmol/L) and body mass index (BMI). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary endpoint, revascularisations, bleeding events (BARC classification) and cerebrovascular events (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or TIA).Patients with hyperglycemia, i.e. BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine kinase (CK), higher heart rates and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. At 30 days and 12 months, those with BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L had more MACE and death compared to those with BSL < 6.0 mmol/L or 6.0-11.1 mmol/L (HR-ratio 4.78 and 6.6; p < 0.001). The novel biomarker Cyr61 strongly associated with high BSL and STEMI and was independently associated with 1 year outcomes (HR 2.22; 95% CI 1.33-3.72; Tertile 3 vs. Tertile 1).In this large, prospective, independently adjudicated cohort of in all comers ACS patients undergoing PCI, both a history of  and elevated entry glucose was associated with inflammation and increased risk of MACE both at short and long-term.

Here we report on the phases of developing and validating the self-report Type 1  and Life (T1DAL) measures for children (age 8-11) and adolescents (age 12-17).Measure development included qualitative interviews with youth and parents (n = 16 dyads) followed by piloting draft measures and conducting cognitive debriefing with youth (n = 9) to refine the measures. To evaluate the psychometric properties, children (n = 194) and adolescents (n = 257) at three T1D Exchange Clinic Network sites completed the age-appropriate T1DAL measure and previously validated questionnaires measuring related constructs. Using psychometric data, the investigators reduced the length of each T1DAL measure to 21 and 23 items, respectively, and conducted a final round of cognitive debriefing with six children and adolescents.The T1DAL measures for children and adolescents demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.84 and 0.89, respectively) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.78 and 0.80, respectively). Significant correlations between the T1DAL scores and measures of general quality of life, generic and -specific HRQOL,  burden, and  strengths demonstrated construct validity. Correlations with measures of self-management (child and adolescent) and glycemic control (adolescent only) demonstrated criterion validity.

The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D.

Herein we synthesized benzoboroxole-containing multi-armed poly(ethylene glycol) amphiphilic dendrimers sensitive to both pH and glucose. The multi-branched structure of dendrimer facilitated its self-assembly into micelles in aqueous solution and exhibited good encapsulation of insulin just by simply mixing with insulin solution. The insulin loaded micelles were stable under strong acidic condition and showed glucose-responsive insulin release at physiological pH. The reversible binding between benzoboroxole and glucose can effectively regulate the disassembly of micelles and insulin release rate, which in turn stabilizes blood sugar fluctuations. Utilizing a mouse model of type 1 , it was demonstrated that these insulin loaded micelles could successfully control the blood glucose levels under a normoglycemic state and avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, this smart delivery system shows great potential to significantly improve the effect of oral protein therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is well known to induce hypertrophy of visceral fat and to trigger inflammation substantially.

In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity effects of pyrogallol-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PPB)-a single compound from the ethanoic extract of -mediated by a reduction in the inflammation caused by RAGE and RAGE ligands. In visceral fat, PPB (i) significantly inhibited RAGE ligands, (ii) reduced the expression of RAGE, and (iii) reduced the binding ratio between RAGE and RAGE ligands. Under lower expression of RAGE, RAGE ligands and their cognate binding, the differentiation of macrophages found in visceral fat into M1-type-the pro-inflammatory form of this immune cell-was reduced. As the M1-type macrophage decreased, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause obesity, decreased in visceral fat. The results of this study highlight the anti-obesity effects of PPB, with the effects mediated by reductions in RAGE, RAGE ligands, and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660541>Xeno-Transplantation of macro-encapsulated islets and Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Pancreatic Progenitors without Immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>Islet transplantation effectively treats  but relies on immune suppression and is practically limited by the number of cadaveric islets available.

The first cohort received macro-encapsulated undifferentiated hESCs, a second cohort received hESCs differentiated to a pancreatic progenitor state with limited endocrine differentiation. A reference cohort received human islets. Macro-encapsulation devices were implanted subcutaneously and monitored for up to 4 months. Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells did not form teratoma but underwent cell death following implantation. Human C-peptide (hC- peptide) was detectable in host serum one week after implantation for both other cohorts. hC-peptide levels decreasing over time but remained detectable up to the end of the study. Key factors associated with mature endocrine cells were observed in grafts recovered from cohorts containing islets and hESC-derivatives including C-peptide, insulin, glucagon and urocortin 3.

It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation.  (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between  and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of  along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal inflammation can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels.

We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Plasma VitD levels were measured in the first (T1) and/or second trimester (T2). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for evaluating the association of VitD with GDM.Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with all three time-point glucose of OGTT. 25(OH)D level in T1 (β = -0.003) and T2 (β = -0.004), and its change from T1 to T2 (β = -0.004) were significantly and inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) of OGTT, but not 1-h and 2-h postload blood glucose of OGTT, respectively. The negative associations of VitD and FBG were stronger among overweight/obese women. VitD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) in T2 was associated with an increased risk of GDM with increased FBG, GDM subtype 1 (OR: 2.10) and subtype 3 (OR: 2.19). Moreover, prepregnancy BMI modified this effect on GDM subtype 1 (BMI < 24: OR = 1.42; BMI ≥ 24: OR = 9.61, P for interaction = 0.002). Lower VitD increment from T1 to T2 was associated with a higher risk for GDM among overweight/obese women. Additionally, GDM prevalence fluctuated with the season, i.e. lower in summer/fall and higher in winter/spring.Maternal VitD deficiency was associated with a higher risk of GDM subtype with increased FBG, and the risk is much greater among overweight/obesity women. The lower the VitD increment during pregnancy, the greater the risk of GDM, especially in overweight/obesity women. Furthermore, seasonal variation of GDM may be exhibited as a critical confounder in the association of VitD and GDM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for treatment of type 2 DM. Inhibition of SGLT-2 co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type 2  now suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes the existing data from studies evaluating the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BP, and its potential value for cardio and nephroprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665767>Student-led foot-care sessions for patients with .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663302>Newer therapeutic approaches towards the management of : an update.</a></h2><p> is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by an elevation of blood glucose levels, resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 , cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity. In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672964>Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Pu-erh tea displays cholesterol-lowering properties, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669388>Pharmacological potential of novel agonists for FFAR4 on islet and enteroendocrine cell function and glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the metabolic effects of FFAR4-selective agonists on islet and enteroendocrine cell hormone release and the combined therapeutic effectiveness with DPP-IV inhibitors.Insulinotropic activity and specificity of FFAR4 agonists were determined in clonal pancreatic BRIN-BD11 cells. Expression of FFAR4 was assessed by qPCR and western blotting following agonist treatment in BRIN-BD11 cells and by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets. Acute in-vivo effects of agonists was investigated after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral administration in lean and HFF-obese diabetic mice.GSK137647 (10-10 M) and Compound-A (10-10 M) stimulated insulin secretion at 5.6mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) and 16.7mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) glucose in BRIN-BD11 cells, with no cytotoxicity effects as assessed by MTT. FFAR4 antagonist (AH-7614) abolished the insulintropic effect of GSK137647 (p<0.05-p<0.001), whilst FFAR1 antagonist (GW1100) had no effect. Incubation of BRIN-BD11 cells with GSK137647 and Compound-A increased FFAR4 (p<0.01) gene expression at 16.7 mM glucose, with a corresponding increase in FFAR4 (p<0.01) protein concentrations. FFAR4 upregulation was attenuated under normoglycaemic conditions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated co-localisation of FFAR4 and insulin in mouse islets. Orally administered GSK137647 or Compound-A (0.1µmol/kgBW) improved glucose tolerance (p<0.001), increased plasma insulin (p<0.001), GLP-1 (p<0.05), GIP (p<0.05) and induced satiety (p<0.001) in HFF mice, with glucose-lowering effects enhanced in combination with DPP-IV inhibitor (Sitagliptin) (p<0.05).Specific FFAR4 agonism improves glucose tolerance through insulin and incretin secretion, with enhanced DPP-IV inhibition in combination with Sitagliptin.These findings have for the first time demonstrated that selective FFAR4 activation regulates both islet and enteroendocrine hormone function with agonist combinational therapy, presenting a promising strategy for the treatment of type-2-.Copyright © 2019.

Effectiveness analyses of current regimens used 3598 person-visit-pairs (745 men) on cART in 2014-2017. Inverse-probability-of-treatment-and-censoring weighted Poisson regression with robust variances was used to evaluate the association between regimens and switching, adherence and HIV RNA <20 copies/mL.Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen usage has increased since 2008. Almost 90% of cART initiators started with INSTI-cART in 2016-2017; cART adherence was stable around 90% and 83%-85% suppressed virus (<20 cp/mL). Commonly used regimens in 2014-2017 contained disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) backbone with efavirenz (EFV, n = 1161 person-visits), elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c, n = 551), rilpivirine (RPV, n = 492), darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r, n = 351), or atazanavir (ATV)/r (n = 333). Others were dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC, n = 401) and EVG/c/tenofovir alafenamide/FTC (EVG/c/TAF/FTC, n = 309). Compared to EFV/TDF/FTC users, ATV/r+TDF/FTC users switched more (rate ratio [RR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.76), while those on DTG/ABC/3TC (RR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.08-0.31]) or EVG/c/TAF/FTC (RR [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.06-0.27]) switched less. The rate of suppressed HIV RNA was 15% (95% CI, 2%-26%) lower among younger EVG/c/TDF/FTC users and 18% (95% CI, 3%-34%) higher in older DRV/r+TDF/FTC users; adherence did not differ by regimen.Consistent with guidelines, recent cART initiators started with INSTI-cART, which was associated with less switching early after initiation. Factors beyond those studied here, such as need for salvage therapy, unique personal characteristics, drug interactions, and cost may influence treatment decisions.© The Author(s) 2019.

OGTT was performed at the 3rd trimester. Women were categorized as non-smokers (A), as those who ceased smoking at pregnancy (B), and as smokers (C).5,434 (73.1%) women were group A, 1,191 (16%) group B and 812 (10.9%) group C. The rates of GDM among the groups were: A 33.7%, B 34.2%, C 34.2% (ns). However, the number of individuals requiring insulin treatment was significantly different: A 39.2%, B 47.5%, C 50.6% (p<0.001). Regarding OGTT, fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in group C (89+13 vs 86+12mg/dl) compared to A, whereas 3-h glucose values were significantly lower (104+33 vs 112+32mg/dl) (p<0.001). Group B demonstrated intermediate glucose concentrations. Similar findings were observed in women without GDM. In women with GDM, higher 1-h glucose levels were measured in group C (210+31 vs 205+28mg/dl) compared with A (p=0.024). Further, group C sub-analysis found that those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes showed significantly lower 3-h glucose levels (111+31 vs 128+40mg/dl) compared to those who smoked less than 10 (p=0.006).

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of this reform experienced by patients with type 2 . The objective was also to explore if socio-economic status affects this experience.The data were collected by conducting a survey among Finnish adults with type 2  (n = 603). The baseline survey was conducted in November-December 2016. A second follow-up survey was conducted at the end of 2017 where the participants' experience of the reimbursement reform was surveyed with an open-ended question. Free-form inductive content analysis was used to categorize the answers. The association between the participants' characteristics and reporting an effect caused by the reimbursement reform was studied with binomial logistic regression.285 (47.3%) participants reported an effect of some kind caused by the reimbursement reform. The most common reported effects were economic effects (32.7%) and annoyance (12.4%). Having financial difficulties in purchasing antidiabetic medicines (odds ratio (OR) 5.20, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 2.99-9.06) or not having annual deductible exceeded (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.19-3.95), and use of certain antidiabetic medication groups at baseline were associated with reporting an effect. Socio-economic status was not associated with the likelihood of reporting an effect.Almost half of the participants with type 2  reported an effect, most commonly economic effects, such as increased expenditure or difficulty in purchasing medicines, after the reimbursement reform. It is important to study the effects of reimbursement reforms also from the patients' perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661517>'Fat's chances': Loci for phenotypic dispersion in plasma leptin in mouse models of .</a></h2><p>Leptin, a critical mediator of feeding, metabolism and , is expressed on an incidental basis according to satiety.

Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to  and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669188>The Avoiding  After Pregnancy Trial in Moms Program: Feasibility of a  Prevention Program for Women With Recent Gestational .</a></h2><p>Our aim in this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based  prevention program, delivered by interdisciplinary certified  educators (CDEs), and customized for postpartum women with recent gestational  (GDM).This pilot randomized trial recruited women with GDM from 24 to 40 weeks gestation from 4 centres, and trained 10 CDEs in behaviour coaching, physical activity (PA) and low glycemic index education.

These characteristics mean that initiating treatment and obtaining a virological cure (Sustained Viral response, SVR) on completion of treatment, in non-specialist environments should be feasible. We investigated the English-language literature evaluating community and primary care-based pathways using DAAs to treat HCV infection.Databases (Cinahl; Embase; Medline; PsycINFO; PubMed) were searched for studies of treatment with DAAs in non-specialist settings to achieve SVR. Relevant studies were identified including those containing a comparison between a community and specialist services where available. A narrative synthesis and linked meta-analysis were performed on suitable studies with a strength of evidence assessment (GRADE).Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: five from Australia; two from Canada; two from UK and eight from USA. Seven studies demonstrated use of DAAs in primary care environments; four studies evaluated integrated systems linking specialists with primary care providers; three studies evaluated services in locations providing care to people who inject drugs; two studies evaluated delivery in pharmacies; and one evaluated delivery through telemedicine. Sixteen studies recorded treatment uptake. Patient numbers varied from around 60 participants with pathway studies to several thousand in two large database studies. Most studies recruited less than 500 patients. Five studies reported reduced SVR rates from an intention-to-treat analysis perspective because of loss to follow-up before the final confirmatory SVR test. GRADE assessments were made for uptake of HCV treatment (medium); completion of HCV treatment (low) and achievement of SVR at 12 weeks (medium).Services sited in community settings are feasible and can deliver increased uptake of treatment. Such clinics are able to demonstrate similar SVR rates to published studies and real-world clinics in secondary care. Stronger study designs are needed to confirm the precision of effect size seen in current studies.

To test whether similar phenomena occur in humans, we compared beta-cell function in adult subjects previously exposed to glucocorticoids during first part of fetal life to non-exposed subjects.The study was conducted in 16 adult participants exposed to glucocorticoids during the first part of fetal life and in 16 non-exposed healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance matched for age, sex, and BMI. Exposed subjects were descendants from mother at risk of having a child with 21-hydroxylase deficiency that were consequently treated by dexamethasone (1 to 1.5mg/day from the 6th gestational week (GW) to prevent genital virilization. We selected descendant of mother who stopped dexamethasone before the 18th GW following negative genotyping of the fetus. Insulin and glucagon secretion were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), graded intravenous (IV) glucose and arginine test. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic-clamp.Age, BMI and anthropometric characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Insulinogenic index during OGTT and insulin-sensitivity during the clamp were similar in the 2 groups. In exposed subjects, insulin secretion during graded IV-glucose infusion and after arginine administration decreased by 17% (p=0.02) and 22% (p=0.002) respectively while Glucagon secretion after arginine increased.Over exposure to glucocorticoids during first part of fetal life is associated with lower insulin secretion at adult age, which may lead to abnormal glucose tolerance later in life.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669201>Neuroprotective effect of PPAR alpha and gamma agonists in a mouse model of amyloidogenesis through modulation of the Wnt/beta catenin pathway via targeting alpha- and beta-secretases.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of fenofibrate and pioglitazone in a mouse model of amyloidogenesis induced by amyloidβ (βA) peptide. Mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with βA1-40 (400 pmol/mouse) once, followed by treatment with fenofibrate (300 mg/kg), pioglitazone (30 mg/kg),or both. After 21 days of daily treatment, memory impairment and cognitive function were evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM), Y-maze and object recognition tests. On the 22nd day, mice were sacrificed, and their hippocampi were dissected to determine the levels of α- and β-secretase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα and β), Wnt and β-catenin. Significant memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction were observed in the mouse model group. This finding was associated with a significant increase in α- and β-secretase levels and a significant decrease in Wnt, β-catenin, and PPARα and β levels. Neuronal damage was also evident after histopathological examination. Treatment with fenofibrate, pioglitazone and their combination resulted in a significant improvement in the behavioural and neurochemical changes induced by βA injection. The present findings indicate that the combined administration of fenofibrate and pioglitazone was more effective than monotherapy in ameliorating the behavioural, neurochemical and histopathological changes in amyloidogenesis model mice and provide a promising therapeutic approach in the management of Alzheimer's disease complicated by  and hypercholesterolemia.Copyright © 2018.

However, flap venous congestion remains a tough nut to crack. We hypothesize that raising an adipofascial flap with turnover mode of transposition can improve venous drainage and enhance flap safety.Based on the 2 rows of septocutaneous perforators in the posterior distal third of the lower leg, distally based adipofascial flap was raised from medial sural region nourished by 1 perforator bundle from the posterior tibial artery or from the lateral sural region from the peroneal artery. The superficial dissection was performed in subdermal plane and deep in to the subfascial space. The flap was nourished by perforator-plus-adipofascial pedicle and turned over 180 degrees upside down to reach the distal wounds. One week later, a split-skin graft was used to cover the exposed fascial flap. Postoperatively, flap survival, complications, and patient functional recovery were evaluated.Distally based sural turnover adipofascial flaps were used in 12 cases with complicated wounds of the distal third lower leg, foot, and ankle region. All wounds were caused by trauma and experienced fracture implants fixation and 5 with osteomyelitis. The comorbidities include  in 9 cases and smoking in 7. There were 8 medial ural flaps and 4 lateral sural flaps. The adipofiscial flaps measured from 6.0 cm × 5.0 cm to 17.0 cm × 6.0 cm (mean, 61.3 cm). Postoperatively, all flaps survived uneventfully without any complication such as flap ischemia and/or necrosis. Two minor donor site complications were encountered, one was postoperative hematoma, and another was hyperproliferative scar. After a mean of 14.6 months of follow-up, the adipofascial flap plus skin graft showed a durable esthetic coverage, with normal shoe wearing and walking.Distally based sural adipofascial turnover flap is a simple and reliable wound coverage technique. It avoids venous congestion as usually seen in distally based fasciocutaneous flaps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664080>dendPoint: a web resource for dendrimer pharmacokinetics investigation and prediction.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine development currently suffers from a lack of efficient tools to predict pharmacokinetic behavior without relying upon testing in large numbers of animals, impacting success rates and development costs. This work presents dendPoint, the first in silico model to predict the intravenous pharmacokinetics of dendrimers, a commonly explored drug vector, based on physicochemical properties. We have manually curated the largest relational database of dendrimer pharmacokinetic parameters and their structural/physicochemical properties. This was used to develop a machine learning-based model capable of accurately predicting pharmacokinetic parameters, including half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and dose recovered in the liver and urine. dendPoint successfully predicts dendrimer pharmacokinetic properties, achieving correlations of up to r = 0.83 and Q up to 0.68. dendPoint is freely available as a user-friendly web-service and database at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dendpoint . This platform is ultimately expected to be used to guide dendrimer construct design and refinement prior to embarking on more time consuming and expensive in vivo testing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670977>ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), a novel myokine, regulates glucose metabolism by AMPK and Akt dual pathways.</a></h2><p>ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is an ATP synthase-interacting protein that suppresses the hydrolysis activity of ATP synthase. In this study, we observed that the expression of IF1 was up-regulated in response to electrical pulse stimulation of skeletal muscle cells and in exercized mice and healthy men. IF1 stimulates glucose uptake  AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and primary cultured myoblasts. Reactive oxygen species and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) function in the upstream and downstream of AMPK, respectively, in IF1-mediated glucose uptake. In diabetic animal models, the administration of recombinant IF1 improved glucose tolerance and down-regulated blood glucose level. In addition, IF1 inhibits ATP hydrolysis by β-F1-ATPase in plasma membrane, thereby increasing extracellular ATP and activating the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, ultimately leading to glucose uptake. Thus, we suggest that IF1 is a novel myokine and propose a mechanism by which AMPK and Akt contribute independently to IF1-mediated improvement of glucose tolerance impairment. These results demonstrate the importance of IF1 as a potential antidiabetic agent.-Lee, H. J., Moon, J., Chung, I., Chung, J. H., Park, C., Lee, J. O., Han, J. A., Kang, M. J., Yoo, E.

The confirmation of a likely episode of cyst infection by isolating the pathogenic microorganism in a clinical scenario is possible only in the minority of cases. The available antimicrobial treatment guidelines, therefore, might not be appropriate to some patients.We describe two unique cases of kidney cyst infection by Candida albicans, a condition that has not been previously described in literature. Both cases presented clear risk factors for Candida spp. infection. However, since there was no initial indication of cyst aspiration and culture, antifungal therapy was not immediately started and empirical treatment was initiated as recommended by the current guidelines. Antifungal treatment was instituted in both cases along the clinical course, according to their specificities.Our report highlights the possibility of Candida spp. cyst infection. Failure of clinical improvement with antibiotics should raise the suspicion of a fungal infection. Identification of infected cysts should be pursued in such cases, particularly with PET-CT, and when technically possible followed by cyst aspiration and culture to guide treatment. Risk factors for this condition, such as Candida spp. colonization, previous antimicrobial therapy, hemodialysis, necrotizing pancreatitis, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary surgical procedure, central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition,  and immunodeficiency (neutropenia < 500 neutrophils/mL, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant drugs), should be also considered accepted criteria for empirical antifungal therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663063>Atypical Tibial Fracture in a 63-Year-Old Woman With Intermittent Use of Bisphosphonate Unmasking Hypophosphatasia.</a></h2><p>We report an unusual case of atypical proximal tibial stress fracture (APTF) associated with intermittent use of bisphosphonates (BPs) and persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. We describe the case of a 63-year-old white woman who had experienced an APTF after 4 years of intermittent exposure to alendronate given for recurrent metatarsal stress fractures. BP administration was stopped after the diagnosis of the APTF. A review of her previous serum ALP levels revealed they had been consistently low. Adult hypophosphatasia (HPP) was diagnosed by the low serum ALP activity and elevated urine phosphoethanolamine levels. She was treated conservatively with analgesics. Adult HPP is an underrecognized condition associated with atypical insufficiency fractures, and BP use compounds this risk. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of intermittent BP exposure preceding an APTF in an adult patient with HPP, highlighting the uncommon site of the proximal tibia for BP-associated atypical insufficiency fractures, the need to screen for HPP in those with persistently low ALP levels before they begin BP therapy, and the importance of avoiding BP use in those with HPP.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 : a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2  at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without . Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2  affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2  with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Moreover, dicarbonyls especially methylglyoxal (MG) and glyoxal, accelerate AGEs formation and hence have potential roles in the pathogenesis of . They can also induce oxidative stress and concomitantly decrease the efficiency of antioxidant enzymes. Increased proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) are secreted by monocytes due to the dicarbonyl-modified proteins. High levels of blood dicarbonyls have been identified in  and its associated complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). This review aims to provide a better understanding by including in-depth information of past and current knowledge about the formation of MG and glyoxal through multiple pathways with a focus on their biological functions and detoxifications. The potential role of these dicarbonyls in diabetic secondary complications is also discussed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674127>Lower limb muscle mass is associated with insulin resistance more than lower limb muscle strength in non-diabetic older adults.</a></h2><p>We examined the association of muscle mass and muscle strength with insulin resistance, focusing on lower limb muscles.This was a cross-sectional study, and participants were registered in 2017 from the Tanno-Sobetsu Study, a population-based cohort study. After excluding individuals aged <64 years or with a history of , 272 non-diabetic older adults (116 men, 156 women) met the inclusion criteria. According to the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, the participants were divided into two groups; that is, the insulin resistance group (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ≥1.73) and non-insulin resistance group (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance <1.73). Muscle mass (lower limb, upper limb, appendicular and trunk) and muscle strength (grip strength and knee extension torque) were measured and divided by the weight, and then multiplied by 100 to calculate the weight ratio (%). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of each muscle index for risk of insulin resistance was calculated separately for both men and women.Lower limb muscle mass (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.92 in men; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.96 in women, respectively) and appendicular muscle mass (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.94 in men; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.95 in women, respectively), but not other muscle indexes, were associated with risk of insulin resistance, after adjusting for age, body mass index, highly sensitive C-reacting protein and smoking habits.Lower limb muscle mass of non-diabetic older adults is independently related to insulin resistance.

At the time, psychosocial  research in Europe was steadily growing, but not well recognized. By establishing an official European Association for the Study of  study group, PSAD, for which purpose some hurdles had to be overcome,  psychology became more visible and accessible to the scientific  community. Over the years the PSAD study group has been successful in promoting the quality of research in the field through scientific meetings, mentoring, postgraduate education and publications. Looking back we can conclude that starting the PSAD study group signified an important moment in time, where researchers were joining forces to further the quality of the science, raise awareness of the importance of psychosocial aspects and promote the dissemination of psychological interventions in  care.© 2019  UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672783>Ergothioneine is associated with reduced mortality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>We recently identified a health conscious food pattern (HCFP) associated with reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease. However, the molecular events linking the healthy food pattern to reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease are unknown. Our aim was to identify plasma metabolites associated with the HCFP and test if such metabolites predict cardiometabolic disease and mortality.Using liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry, 112 plasma metabolites were measured in 3236 participants without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and  from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer study. Metabolites associated with the HCFP were identified using multivariable adjusted linear regressions followed by Bonferroni correction. The healthy dietary biomarkers were subsequently related to risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality during long-term follow-up with multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.During a median follow-up time of 21.4 years, 603 participants developed CVD, 362 developed  and 843 participants died. Five healthy dietary biomarkers were associated with the HCFP at baseline (p<0.0004) and four predicted at least one of the studied end points (p<0.05). Ergothioneine was the metabolite most strongly connected to the HCFP and was associated with a lower risk of coronary disease (HR per 1 SD increment of ergothioneine, HR=0.85, p=0.01), cardiovascular mortality (HR=0.79, p=0.002) and overall mortality (HR=0.86, p=4e-5).We identified that higher ergothioneine was an independent marker of lower risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality, which potentially can be induced by a specific healthy dietary intake.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Prevention and control of NCDs and their risk factors require interventions that are therapeutically cost-effective, affordable by the patient and/or health systems and feasible, based upon local resources. This commentary paper sets a basis of global evidence to advocate, nationally and internationally, for an expanded role for pharmacists in NCD management by compiling best practices and examples. It encourages pharmacists around the world to act upon NCDs, from prevention and screening activities, to patient referral when appropriate, and to pharmacist-led, patient-centred NCD management to improve outcomes and quality of life. Priority NCDs fall into four areas: cardiovascular diseases, , asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer. Building on the key roles they already play as primary healthcare professionals in the community, pharmacists can provide focused interventions, specialised counselling and care coordination, improving patient engagement to achieve better outcomes in the global fight against NCDs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To test the diagnostic performance of antibodies against non-complexed and complexed forms of transglutaminases, to correlate their activities to the intestinal damage and to explore their age groups dependency, in celiac disease (CD). 296 children with untreated CD and 215 non-celiac disease controls were checked by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays detecting IgA, IgG, or combined detection of IgA and IgG (check) against tTG, AESKULISA tTG New Generation (tTG-neo) and mTG-neo (RUO), IgA and IgG antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) and human IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) using AESKUSLIDES EMA. Intestinal pathology was graded according the revised Marsh criteria, and age dependencies of the antibodies' activities were analysed. Using cut-offs estimated from Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, the highest area under curve (AUC) of the TG assays was 0.963 for tTG-neo Check, followed by tTG Check, (0.962) when the diagnosis was based on enteric mucosal histology. tTG-neo Check was the best to reflect the intestinal abnormalities in CD (r=0.795, p<0.0001). High levels of anti-mTG-neo IgG and anti-tTG-neo IgG appeared in the earlier age groups followed by the latter anti-tTG IgG surge along the advanced ages, (p<0.001). Considering antibodies' diagnostic performances based on AUC, enteric damage reflection and predictability at an early age, the anti-neo tTG check was the best diagnostic biomarker for pediatric CD. The mTG neo Check might represent a new marker for CD screening, diagnosis and predictability.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p></html>
