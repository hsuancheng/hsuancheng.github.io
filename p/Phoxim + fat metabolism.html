<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239122>Exposure to herbicides reduces larval sensitivity to insecticides in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).</a></h2><p>Herbicides and insecticides are widely used in modern agriculture. It has been reported in various studies that application of insecticides can increase tolerance of herbivorous insects to insecticides. However, limited information exists on susceptibility to insecticides when insects are exposed to herbicides. This study was conducted to investigate the potential impact of the herbicides trifluralin and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid sodium salt (MCPA-Na) on the susceptibility of the nocturnal moth Spodoptera litura to the insecticides λ-cyhalothrin,  and bifenthrin. We found that larvae exposed to trifluralin or MCPA-Na became significantly less susceptible to both insecticides than non-exposed control larvae. Herbicide-treated larvae did not show altered growth under the used test conditions. However, heads of herbicide-treated larvae showed increased expression of the acetylcholinesterase genes SlAce1 and SlAce2. Moreover, the fat body and midgut of herbicide-treated larvae displayed elevated expression of detoxification genes (the carboxylesterase gene SlCarE; the glutathione S-transferase genes SlGSTe2 and SlGSTe3; the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes CYP6B48, CYP9A40 and CYP321B1). The CYP6B48 gene exhibited highest inducibility. In conclusion, the data of this study suggest that exposure of S. litura larvae to herbicides may stimulate detoxification mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of insecticides.© 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660516>Molecular cloning and characterization of C tetrahydrofolate (C-THF) synthase in Bombyx mori, silkworm.</a></h2><p>Folate metabolism pathway is mainly associated with syntheses of nucleic acids and proteins as well as DNA methylation and repair. Cytoplasmic C tetrahydrofolate (C-THF) synthase is a central enzyme in folate metabolism and plays an important role in C-THF conversion. The full-length sequence of silkworm (Bombyx mori) cytoplasmic C-THF synthase (BmC-THF synthase) gene including an open reading frame (ORF) of 932 amino acid residues was cloned. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BmC-THF synthase shares 84% and 81% identity with C-THF synthase of Papilio Xuthus and Danaus plexippus, respectively. Conserved sequence analysis showed that the 330 to 710 amino acid residues of BmC-THF synthase were highly conserved among various organisms. Recombinant BmC-THF synthase protein with a molecular weight of about 105.5 kDa was expressed in E. coli cells and identified using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. The expression of BmC-THF synthase gene in eight silkworm tissues revealed that BmC-THF synthase gene is widely expressed in various tissues of silkworm and highly expressed in the fat body. The expression characteristics of BmC-THF synthase gene in response to oxidative stress were conducted under  and high temperature (30 °C) exposure. The results showed that the transcriptional level of BmC-THF synthase gene was upregulated by 3.435-fold and 6.845-fold after  and high temperature (30 °C) exposure, respectively, indicating that BmC-THF synthase gene may play a significant role in response of silkworm to oxidative stresses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abuse of organophosphorus pesticides in recent years often leads to poisoning of silkworms, which significantly affects sericulture development by reducing silk production. Previous studies have shown that TiO2 NPs can effectively mitigate the damages caused by organophosphorus pesticides in silk glands and nerve tissues. The fat body is an important  detoxification organ of silkworms, but it is unknown whether TiO2 NPs affect pesticide  in fat body. In this study, we characterized the transcription of antioxidant genes and enzyme activity in fat body after TiO2 NPs and  treatments using transcriptome sequencing, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity assay. Transcriptome sequencing detected 10 720, 10 641, 10 403, and 10 489 genes for control group, TiO2 NPs group,  group, and TiO2 NPs+ group, respectively. The TiO2 NPs+ group had 705 genes with significantly differential expression (FDR<0.001), among which the antioxidant genes thioredoxin reductase 1 and glutathione S-transferase omega 3 were significantly upregulated. In  group, the expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase delta (GSTd), and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) were increased by 1.365 -fold, 1.335 -fold, 1.642 -fold, and 1.765 -fold, respectively. The level changes of SOD, CAT, GSTd, and TPx were validated by real time PCR. The contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were increased by 1.598 -fold, 1.946 -fold, and 1.506 -fold, respectively, indicating that TiO2 NPs treatment can relieve -induced oxidative stress. To clarify the mechanism of TiO2 NPs's effect, the transcription levels of P450 gene family were measured for the TiO2 NPs+ group; the expression levels of CYP4M5, CYP6AB4, CYP6A8, and CYP9G3 were elevated by 2.784 -fold, 3.047 -fold, 2.254 -fold, and 4.253 -fold, respectively, suggesting that high expression of P450 family genes can enhance the  of  in the fat body. The results of this study indicated that TiO2 NPs treatment promoted the transcriptional expression of the P450 family genes to improve the fat body's ability to metabolize  and reduce -induced oxidative stress. This may be the main mechanism of TiO2 NPs' mitigation of -induced damages in the fat body.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Each year, O,O-diethyl O-(alpha-cyanobenzylideneamino) phosphorothioate () pesticide poisoning in China results in huge economic losses in sericulture. Silkworm fat body is the main organ for nutrient storage,  supply, intermediary metabolism, and detoxification. Microarray analysis of silkworm Cytochrome P450 detoxification enzyme genes revealed that all tested P450 4 (CYP4) family genes are expressed in the fat body. Quantitative Real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of CYP4 family genes in silkworm fat body 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after  exposure. The expression levels of silkworm molting hormone synthesis-related genes started to change 24 h after  exposure, with those of CYP302A1, CYP306A1, and CYP314A1 being elevated by 1.38-, 1.33-, and 2.10-fold, respectively. The CYP18A1 gene that participates in steroid hormone inactivation and the CYP15C1 gene that participates in the epoxidation during the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH) from methyl farnesoate (MF) were increased by 3.85- and 7.82-fold, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these endogenous hormone metabolism-related genes belong to CYP mito clan and clan 2, and that  exposure may affect silkworm development and metamorphosis. The CYP4, CYP6, and CYP9 families all showed some degrees of increases in gene expression; among them, CYP49A1, CYP4L6, CYP6AB4, CYP9G3, CYP9A19, and CYP9A22's transcription levels were significantly upregulated to 12.77-, 2.64-, 2.42-, 4.06-, 3.32-, and 2.98-fold, respectively, of the control levels. In the fat body, CYP49A1, CYP6AB4, CYP9A19, and CYP9A22 were constantly expressed at high levels after 24, 48, and 72 h of  treatments; according to phylogenetic analysis, these genes belong to detoxification-related clan 3 and clan 4 CYP families. These genes may participate in the metabolism of  in silkworm fat body. The results obtained in this study provide a basis for future in-depth investigations of insect P450 family genes in metabolic detoxification.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, poisoning of silkworms by organophosphate pesticides causes tremendous loss to the sericulture. The fat body is the major tissue involved in detoxification and produces antimicrobial peptides and regulates hormones. In this study, a microarray system comprising 22,987 oligonucluotide 70-mer probes was employed to examine differentially expressed genes in the fat body of B. mori exposed to  insecticide. The results showed that a total of 774 genes were differentially expressed upon  exposure, including 500 up-regulated genes and 274 down-regulated genes. The expression levels of eight detoxification-related genes were up-regulated upon  exposure, including six cytochrome P450s and two glutathione-S-transferases. It was firstly found that eight antimicrobial peptide genes were down-regulated, which might provide important references for studying the larvae of B. mori become more susceptible to microbial infections after  treatment. In addition, we firstly detected the expression level of metamorphosis-related genes after  exposure, which may lead to impacted reproduction. Our results may facilitate the overall understanding of the molecular mechanism of multiple  following exposure to  insecticide in the fat body of B. mori.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In order to study the effects of TiO NPs and  on fat body protein synthesis through MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling  in silkworms, we determined the effects of TiO NPs and , alone and in combination, on fat body protein content of silkworms, analyzed the gene expression profile of the fat body, and verified the expression of characteristic genes. We found that TiO NPs and  alone increased the total protein content of the fat body, and up-regulated MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway genes. TiO NPs up-regulated the expression of two growth and development-related genes-insulin-like peptide and neuropeptide receptor B-by 5.17 and 3.89-fold, respectively.  up-regulated the expression of detoxification genes-P450, GST, and CarE2. Pretreatment with TiO NPs could reduce -increased total protein content and up-regulated MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway genes and detoxification genes; the activities of detoxification enzymes were consistent with the gene expression pattern. Our results showed that MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling  both regulate fat body protein synthesis in silkworms, but the target proteins induced to express were different under different inducing factors. Our finding may provide a reference for investigating the mechanism of protein synthesis regulation through MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is possible that during the  , there is generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and  may produce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in an intoxicated silkworm. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) pretreatment has been demonstrated to increase antioxidant capacity and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in organisms. This study was, therefore, undertaken to determine -induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity to determine whether  intoxication alters the antioxidant system and AChE activity in the B. mori larval midgut, and to determine whether TiO2 NPs pretreatment attenuates -induced toxicity. The findings suggested that  exposure decreased survival of B. mori larvae, increased malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl and 8-OHdG levels, and ROS accumulation in the midgut. Furthermore,  significantly decreased the activities of AChE, superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and levels of ascorbic acid (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and thiol in the midgut. TiO2 pretreatment, however, could increase AChE activity, and remove ROS via activating SOD, CAT, APX, GR, and GST, and accelerating AsA-GSH cycle, thus attenuated lipid, protein, and DNA peroxidation and improve B. mori larval survival under -induced toxicity. Moreover, this experimental system would help nanomaterials to be applied in the sericulture.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482325>Cloning and Functional Analysis of CncC and Keap1 Genes in Silkworm.</a></h2><p>CncC/keap1-ARE is an important signaling pathway for detoxification and antioxidation in Diptera and Coleoptera insects. However, such a signaling pathway has not been studied in Bombyx mori. In this study, BmCncC and Bmkeap1 genes were cloned, their amino acid sequences were analyzed, and each functional domain was mapped. Through phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison among multiple species, we found that the Neh1 motif of CncC was highly conserved and the DLG motif was replaced by the DMG motif in Neh2. Conformational analysis showed that Neh1 of BmCncC forms a hairpin structure to bind DNA. The DGR region of Bmkeap1 contained abundant β sheets, which was involved in the recognition of Neh2. The transcription and expression analyses showed that both BmCncC and Bmkeap1 were highly expressed in the first instar larvae, and these two genes were expressed at a high level in the reproductive gland, fat body, and head. The transcriptional and expression levels of Akt and BmCncC in the fat body were significantly upregulated, and the expression of Bmkeap1 was downregulated after the  treatment in silkworm. The transcriptional levels of CncC-regulated detoxification enzymes GST, cyp4M5, cyp6AE2, and cyp9G3 were increased by 4.026-, 5.246-, 3.821-, and 9.787-fold, respectively, while the activities of GST and CYP450 were increased by 1.521- and 1.231-fold, respectively, after  treatment. These results indicated that the BmCncC/Bmkeap1 signaling pathway was activated by , leading to the expression of downstream detoxifying enzymes and detoxification of  in silkworm.</p></html>
