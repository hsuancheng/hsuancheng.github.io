Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk . Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids, Lys and Thr decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of Phe+, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, , Val, Lys and Thr, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8601843>Amino acid pair interchanges at spatially conserved locations.</a></h2><p>Here we study the pattern of amino acid interchanges at spatially, locally conserved regions in globally dissimilar and unrelated proteins. By using a method which completely separates the amino acid sequence from its respective structure, this work addresses the question of which properties of the amino acids are the most crucial for the stability of conserved structural motifs. The proteins are taken from a structurally non-redundant dataset. The spatially conserved substructural motifs are defined as consisting of a "large enough" number of Calpha atoms found to provide a geometric match between two proteins, regardless of the order of the Calpha atoms in the sequence, or of the sequence composition of the substructures. This approach can apply to proteins with little or no sequence similarity but with sufficient structural similarity, and is unique in its ability to handle local, non-topological matches between pairs of dissimilar proteins. The method uses a computer-version based algorithm, the Geometric Hashing. Since the Geometric Hashing ignores sequence information it lends itself to answer the question posed above. The interchanges at geometrically similar positions that have been obtained with our method demonstrate the expected behaviour. Yet, a closer inspection reveals some distant characteristics, as compared with interchanges based upon sequence-order based techniques, or from -contact-based considerations. First, a pronounced division of the amino acids into two classes is displayed: Lys, Glu, Arg, Gln, Asp, Asn, Pro, Gly, Thr, Ser and His on the one hand, and , Val, Leu, Phe, Met, , Trp, Cys and Ala on the other. These groups further cluster into subgroups: Lys, Glu, Arg, Gln; Asp Asn; Pro, Gly; , Val, Leu, Phe. The other amino acids stand alone. Analysis of the conservation among amino acids indicates proline to be consistently, by far, the most conserved. Next are Asp, Glu, Lys and Gly. Cys is also highly conserved. Interestingly, oppositely charged amino acids are interchanged roughly as frequently as those of the same charge. These observations can be explained in terms of the three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Most of all, there is a clear distinction between residues which prefer to be on the protein surfaces, compared to those frequently buried in the interiors. Analysis of the interchanges indicates their low information content. This, together with the separation into two groups, suggest that the predictive value of the spatial positions of the Calpha+ atoms is not much greater than the sequence alone, aside from their hydrophobicity/hydrophillicity classification.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27695803>Digestibility of energy, amino acids, and phosphorus in a novel source of soy protein concentrate and in soybean meal fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Three experiments were conducted to determine standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA, DE and ME, and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of P in a new source of soy protein concentrate (SPC) and in soybean meal (SBM). In Exp. 1, 9 barrows (initial BW: 13.08 ± 1.98 kg) were prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a triplicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 3 diets and 3 periods. A nitrogen-free diet and 2 diets that contained corn starch and SPC or SBM as the sole source of CP and AA were formulated. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. The SID for , Leu, Phe, Pro, and  was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC than in SBM, but for CP and all other AA, no difference between SPC and SBM was observed. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (initial BW: 13.94 ± 1.34 kg) were housed individually in  crates and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. A corn-based diet (96.9% corn) and 2 diets that contained corn and SPC or corn and SBM were formulated. Each diet was fed to 8 pigs. Feces and urine samples were collected using the marker to marker method with 5-d adaptation and 5-d collection periods. The DE and ME in SPC and SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results indicated that the ATTD of GE was lower ( < 0.05) in SBM than in corn and the DE and ME in SPC were greater ( < 0.01) than in corn and SBM. In Exp. 3, 40 barrows (initial BW: 14.12 ± 2.08 kg) were placed in  crates and allotted to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design with 10 pigs per diet. Two diets were based on SPC or SBM as the sole source of P. Two additional diets were formulated by adding microbial phytase to diets that were otherwise similar to the 2 initial diets. Feces were collected for 5 d after a 5-d adaptation period and values for ATTD and STTD of P were calculated. No differences were observed in ATTD and STTD of P between SPC and SBM, but the ATTD and STTD of P of both SPC and SBM were greater ( < 0.01) if microbial phytase was added to the diets. In conclusion, the concentrations of DE and ME are greater in SPC than in SBM, but the SID of most AA and the STTD of P are not different between SPC and SBM.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7410430>Allophycocyanin from Nostoc sp. phycobilisomes.

Allophycocyanins I and B had red-shifted fluorescence emission maxima, and on this basis, may function in transfer of excitation  from phycobilisomes to chlorophyll a. Allophycyanins II and III, which together comprise 70% of the total allophycocyanin, have absorption maxima at 648 nm and 650 nm, respectively, and probably transfer excitation  from phycocyanin to allophycocyanins I and B, in addition to serving a structural function. Allophycocyanin I was resolved into alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000, 17,000, and 35,000, respectively, whereas allophycocyanin B was resolved into two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 16,100 and 15,300, using a modified Weber and Osborn gel electrophoresis system (Brown, A. S., and Troxler, R. F. (1977) Biochem. J. 163, 571-581). In the same gel system, allophycocyanins II and III were each resolved into alpha and beta subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 17,000, respectively. The subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and the amino acid compositions determined. Automated sequence analysis demonstrated that the first 30 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of alpha subunits, and the beta subunits, of allophycocyanins I to III were identical. alpha Subunits: Ser--Val-Thr-Lys-Ser--Val-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg--Leu-Ser-Pro-Gly -Glu-Leu-Asp-Arg--Lys-Ser-Phe-Val-Thr- beta Subunits: Ala-Gln-Asp-Ala--Thr-Ala-Val--Asn-Ala-Ala-Asp-Val-Gln-Gly-Lys--Leu-Asp-Ala-Thr-Ala-Leu-Ser-Lys-Leu-Lys-Ala-- The gamma subunit of allophycocyanin I and both subunits of allophycocyanin B appeared to be blocked at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that the allophycocyanin B subunits may be different gene products than those of allophycocyanins I to III, or if the same, the subunits of allophycocyanin B undergo proteolytic modification after initial synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2678101>A 13-amino acid peptide in three yeast glycosyltransferases may be involved in dolichol recognition.</a></h2><p>A 13-amino acid peptide was identified in three glycosyltransferases of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. These enzymes, the products of the ALG1, ALG7, and DPM1 genes, catalyze the transfer of sugars from nucleotide sugars to dolichol phosphate derivatives. The consensus sequence for the conserved peptide was Leu-Phe-Val-Xaa-Phe-Xaa-Xaa--Pro-Phe-Xaa-Phe-. A sequence resembling the conserved peptide was also found in the predicted SEC59 protein, which is suspected to participate in assembly of the -linked precursor oligosaccharide, although its specific function is unknown. All of the identified sequences contain an isoleucine at position 8 and phenylalanine or tyrosine at positions 2, 5, and 12. We believe this peptide may be involved in dolichol recognition for the following reasons. (i) The conserved sequence occurs in potential membrane-spanning regions. (ii) The ALG7 and DPM1 proteins are known to recognize the isoprenoid region of dolichol phosphate specifically; this recognition presumably occurs in the membrane since dolichol is very hydrophobic. (iii) The consensus sequence is similar to a region of two halobacterial proteins implicated in binding of the isoprenoid region of retinal. (iv) If the consensus sequence is represented as an alpha-helix, the conserved residues lie on one face of the helix. An alpha-helical structure is likely since the conserved regions are in potential membrane-spanning domains.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887533>Creation and Initial Characterization of Isogenic Helicobacter pylori CagA EPIYA Variants Reveals Differential Activation of Host Cell Signaling .</a></h2><p>The polymorphic CagA toxin is associated with Helicobacter pylori-induced disease. Previous data generated using non-isogenic strains and transfection models suggest that variation surrounding the C-terminal Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motifs as well as the number of EPIYA motifs influence disease outcome. To investigate potential CagA-mediated effects on host cell signaling, we constructed and characterized a large panel of isogenic H. pylori strains that differ primarily in the CagA EPIYA region. The number of EPIYA-C motifs or the presence of an EPIYA-D motif impacted early changes in host cell elongation; however, the degree of elongation was comparable across all strains at later time points. In contrast, the strain carrying the EPIYA-D motif induced more IL-8 secretion than any other EPIYA type, and a single EPIYA-C motif induced comparable IL-8 secretion as isolates carrying multiple EPIYA-C alleles. Similar levels of ERK1/2 activation were induced by all strains carrying a functional CagA allele. Together, our data suggest that polymorphism in the CagA C-terminus is responsible for differential alterations in some, but not all, host cell signaling . Notably, our results differ from non-isogenic strain studies, thus highlighting the importance of using isogenic strains to study the role of CagA toxin polymorphism in gastric cancer development.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460665>Metabolizable  and standardized ileal digestible amino acid contents of expeller-extracted canola meal fed to broiler chicks.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestible amino acid (AA) and AMEn contents of expeller-extracted canola meal (EECM) fed to broiler chicks. One hundred forty-four broiler chicks were divided into 24 groups of 6 birds balanced for BW and fed 4 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups per diet) from d 14 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal-based basal diet formulated to meet NRC nutrient requirements, the basal diet with - and AA-yielding ingredients replaced by 30% of either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM, and a low-protein casein-cornstarch-based diet. The SECM, which is commonly used in formulating poultry diets, was fed for comparison with EECM, whereas the casein-cornstarch-based diet was fed to estimate basal endogenous AA losses for determining standardized ileal digestibility of AA. All 4 diets contained titanium oxide (0.3%) as an indigestible marker, and nutrient digestibility and retention were determined by the substitution method. From d 19 to 21, excreta samples were collected for AMEn determination. On d 21, the birds were killed by cervical dislocation, and contents of the whole ileum were obtained for determination of AA digestibility. Expeller-extracted canola meal had greater (P<0.05) standardized ileal digestible contents of Gly, Leu, Ser, Thr, Asp, and Glu and tended to have greater (P<0.10) standardized ileal digestible contents of , Lys, Phe, Ala, and  than SECM. Compared with SECM, EECM had greater (P<0.001) AMEn (2,694 vs. 1,801 kcal/kg). The results show that the EECM evaluated in the current study had greater standardized ileal digestible AA and AMEn contents than SECM, and hence, it may be a better source of protein and  for broiler chicks than SECM. The standardized ileal digestible AA and AMEn values of EECM used in the current study could be used when formulating broiler chicken diets using the same to minimize the N excretion and feeding cost.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271345>Specific affinity-labeling of the nociceptin ORL1 receptor using a thiol-activated Cys(Npys)-containing peptide ligand.</a></h2><p>We previously showed that an antagonist-based peptide ligand, H-Cys(Npys)-Arg---Arg- -Lys-NH2 , captures the free thiol groups in the ligand-binding site of the nociceptin receptor ORL1. However, the exact receptor sites of this thiol-disulfide exchange reaction have not been uncovered, although such identification would help to clarify the ligand recognition site.

Seven different mutant receptors were soundly expressed in the COS-7 cells and examined for their specific affinity labeling by a competitive binding assay using nociceptin and [(3) H]nociceptin. The results of in vitro Ala scanning analyses revealed that the labeled residues were Cys59 in TM1, Cys215 and Cys231 in TM5, and Cys310 in TM7.

Despite the importance of GPCRs in human physiology and pharmacotherapy, little is known about the molecular details of the TIP39-PTH interaction. To address this, we utilised the different pharmacological profiles of TIP39 and PTH(1-34) at PTH and its related receptor PTH: TIP39 being an agonist at the former but an antagonist at the latter, while PTH(1-34) activates both. A total of 23 site-directed mutations of PTH, in which residues were substituted to the equivalent in PTH were made and pharmacologically screened for agonist activity. Follow-up mutations were analysed by radioligand binding and cAMP assays. A model of the TIP39-PTH complex was built and analysed using molecular dynamics. Only Tyr318- displayed reduced TIP39 potency, despite having increased PTH(1-34) potency, and further mutagenesis and analysis at this site demonstrated that this was due to reduced TIP39 affinity at Tyr318- (pIC=6.01±0.03) compared with wild type (pIC=7.81±0.03). The hydroxyl group of the -318's side chain was shown to be important for TIP39 binding, with the Tyr318-Phe mutant displaying 13-fold lower affinity and 35-fold lower potency compared with wild type. TIP39 truncated by up to 5 residues at the N-terminus was still sensitive to the mutations at -318, suggesting that it interacts with a region within TIP39(6-39). Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the selectivity is based on an interaction between the -318 hydroxyl group with the carboxylate side chain of Asp-7 of the peptide.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

Crude protein (CP), crude , amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight,  percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM).

Data shows that both opioid system function enhancement and opiate administration can result in autistic-like symptoms. Cow milk opioid peptides, including β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7, -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-), affect the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and are subjected to degradation resulting from the proline dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) enzyme activity. The presence of MOR and DPPIV activity are crucial factors determining biological activity of BCM7 in the human body. Our study examined the effect of β-casomorphin-7 on the MOR and DPPIV genes expression according to specific point mutations in these genes. In addition, we investigated frequency of A118G SNP in the MOR gene and rs7608798 of the DPPIV (A/G) gene in healthy and autistic children. Our research indicated correlation in DPPIV gene expression under the influence of BCM7 and hydrolyzed milk between healthy and ASD-affected children with genotype GG (P<0.0001). We also observed increased MOR gene expression in healthy children with genotype AG at polymorphic site A118G under influence of BCM7 and hydrolyzed milk. The G allele frequency was 0.09 in MOR gene and 0.68 in the DPPIV gene.

This channel is regulated by a number of accessory proteins including fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14), a member of the intracellular FGF family. In addition to forming homodimers, FGF14 binds directly to the Nav1.6 channel C-tail, regulating channel gating and expression, properties that are required for intrinsic excitability in neurons. Seeking amino acid residues with unique roles at the protein-protein interaction interface (PPI) of FGF14·Nav1.6, we engineered model-guided mutations of FGF14 and validated their impact on the FGF14·Nav1.6 complex and the FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation using a luciferase assay. Divergence was found in the β-9 sheet of FGF14 where an alanine (Ala) mutation of Val-160 impaired binding to Nav1.6 but had no effect on FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation. Additional analysis revealed also a key role of residues Lys-74/-76 at the N-terminal of FGF14 in the FGF14·Nav1.6 complex and FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrated that either the FGF14(V160A) or the FGF14(K74A/I76A) mutation was sufficient to abolish the FGF14-dependent regulation of peak transient Na(+) currents and the voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation of Nav1.6; but only V160A with a concomitant alanine mutation at -158 could impede FGF14-dependent modulation of the channel fast inactivation. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy of purified proteins confirmed a stronger binding reduction of FGF14(V160A) to the Nav1.6 C-tail compared with FGF14(K74A/I76A) Altogether these studies indicate that the β-9 sheet and the N terminus of FGF14 are well positioned targets for drug development of PPI-based allosteric modulators of Nav channels.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25425280>CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 binds to an intrahelical site distinct from that of the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779.</a></h2><p>The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is implicated in a variety of clinically important diseases, notably rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific low MW CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which blocks CXCR3 along with CCR2 and CCR5.Molecular modelling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand docking, highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ), which was postulated to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modelling was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation.Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and -271(6.51) within CXCR3 severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects on TAK-779 activity, but clearly decreased the antagonist potency of VUF 10085. Likewise, mutations of Phe-131(3.32) , -279(6.59) and -308(7.43) were well tolerated and were critical for the antagonist activity of VUF 10085 but not for that of TAK-779.This more detailed definition of a binding pocket within CXCR3 for low MW antagonists should facilitate the rational design of newer CXCR3 antagonists, with obvious clinical potential.© 2014 The Authors.

Recent studies have disclosed that the conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of eukaryotic ribosomal P stalk proteins is involved in the process that RIPs target ribosome. However, the details of the molecular interaction between ricin and P stalk proteins remain unknown. Here, we report the structure of ricin-A chain (RTA) in a complex with the CTD of the human ribosomal protein P2. The structure shows that the Phe, Leu and Phe residues of P2 insert into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the , Arg, Phe and  residues of RTA, while Asp of P2 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg of RTA. The key residues in RTA and P2 for complex formation were mutated, and their importance was determined by pull-down assays. The results from cell-free translation assays further confirmed that the interaction with P stalk proteins is essential for the inhibition of protein synthesis by RTA. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis that will improve our understanding of the process by which ricin targets the ribosome, which will benefit the development of effective small-molecule inhibitors for use as therapeutic agents.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10222199>Crystal structure of Trematomus newnesi haemoglobin re-opens the root effect question.</a></h2><p>As new structural data have become available, somewhat contrasting explanations of the Root effect in fish haemoglobins (Hb) have been provided.

Zn(2+) binding to OT is known to increase the affinity of OT for its receptor [Pearlmutter, A. F., Soloff, M. S.: Characterization of the metal ion requirement for oxytocin-receptor interaction in rat mammary gland membranes. J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3899-3906 (1979)]. In the absence of Zn(2+), we find evidence for two primary OT conformations, which arise because the Cys(6)-Pro(7) peptide bond exists in both the trans- and cis-configurations. Upon addition of Zn(2+), we determine binding constants in water of KA = 1.43 ± 0.24 and 0.42 ± 0.12 μM(-1), for the trans- and cis-configured populations, respectively. The Zn(2+) bound form of OT, having a cross section of Ω = 235 Å(2), has Pro(7) in the trans-configuration, which agrees with a prior report [Wyttenbach, T., Liu, D., Bowers, M. T.: Interactions of the hormone oxytocin with divalent metal ions. J. Am. Chem.

The present work shows that the cis-configuration of OT isomerizes to the trans-configuration upon binding Zn(2+). In this way, the proline residue regulates Zn(2+) binding to OT and, hence, is important in receptor binding.

The substitution F25A severely impaired the functional properties of the enzyme. Strains expressing all other mutations can grow on methionine sulfoxide with growth efficiencies of 45-60% that of the wild type at 37 degrees, and essentially identical at 42 degrees. At both temperatures, however, strains harboring the substitutions F25V and F25Y had lower growth rates and formed smaller colonies. In another in vivo assay, only the wild type and the F25I substitution allowed growth of phage T3/7 at 37 degrees, demonstrating that subtle modifications of the protein interior at position 25 /Leu or Phe/) can produce significant biological effects. All F25 mutants were good substrates for E. coli thioredoxin reductase. Although turnover rates and apparent Km values were significantly lower for all mutants compared to the wild type, catalytic efficiency of thioredoxin reductase was similar for all substrates. Determination of the free  of unfolding showed that the aliphatic substitutions (Val, Leu, ) significantly destabilized the protein, whereas the F25Y substitution did not affect protein stability.

Circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and this feature correlates with increased risk of developing several metabolic, immunological and neoplastic diseases. Thus, pharmacological replacement of adiponectin might prove clinically beneficial, especially for the obese patient population. At present, adiponectin-based therapeutics are not available, partly due to yet unclear structure/function relationships of the cytokine and difficulties in converting the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug.We aimed to generate adiponectin-based short peptide that can mimic adiponectin action and be suitable for preclinical and clinical development as a cancer therapeutic. Using a panel of 66 overlapping 10 amino acid-long peptides covering the entire adiponectin globular domain (residues 105-254), we identified the 149-166 region as the adiponectin active site. Three-dimensional modeling of the active site and functional screening of additional 330 peptide analogs covering this region resulted in the development of a lead peptidomimetic, ADP 355 (H-DAsn--Pro-Nva-Leu--DSer-Phe-Ala-DSer-NH2). In several adiponectin receptor-positive cancer cell lines, ADP 355 restricted proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at 100 nM-10 μM concentrations (exceeding the effects of 50 ng/mL globular adiponectin). Furthermore, ADP 355 modulated several key signaling pathways (AMPK, Akt, STAT3, ERK1/2) in an adiponectin-like manner. siRNA knockdown experiments suggested that ADP 355 effects can be transmitted through both adiponectin receptors, with a greater contribution of AdipoR1. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of 1 mg/kg/day ADP 355 for 28 days suppressed the growth of orthotopic human breast cancer xenografts by ~31%. The peptide displayed excellent stability (at least 30 min) in mouse blood or serum and did not induce gross toxic effects at 5-50 mg/kg bolus doses in normal CBA/J mice.ADP 355 is a first-in-class adiponectin receptor agonist. Its biological activity, superior stability in biological fluids as well as acceptable toxicity profile indicate that the peptidomimetic represents a true lead compound for pharmaceutical development to replace low adiponectin levels in cancer and other malignancies.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176710>Organic Solvent-Tolerant Esterase from  Based on Amino Acid CompositionAnalysis: Cloning and Characterization of EstSP2.</a></h2><p>Organic solvent-tolerant (OST) enzymes are widely applied in various industries due to their activity and stability in organic solvents, higher substrate solubility, and increased stereo-selectivity.

A conformational analysis of the unhydrated state was carried out using the buildup procedure. The free  calculation using the hydration shell model was also carried out to obtain the stable conformation of the hydrated state. The calculated stable conformations of AII in both states have a partially right-handed alpha-helical structure stabilized by short- and medium-range interactions. The similarity between the lowest free  conformations of the unhydrated and hydrated states suggests that the hydration might not be important to stabilize the overall conformation of AII in a free state. The absence of any intramolecular interaction of the  side chain suggests the possible interaction of this residue with the receptor.

This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-Thr, Asn, Gln, Lys, Glu, Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-, Leu, Met, Phe, , Trp, and His. The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573843>Triennial Lactation Symposium: Mammary metabolism of amino acids in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met, Phe (+), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, , Leu, Lys, Thr, and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of Phe+ uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling Phe supply did not result in mammary oxidation of Phe+ and either limited or no contribution of peptides to Phe and  mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (, Leu, Val, and Lys) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing Lys supply decreased Lys U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and Thr, does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the Thr U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than  supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for  provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and  supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15723532>Role of hydrogen bond networks and dynamics in positive and negative cooperative stabilization of a protein.</a></h2><p>Cooperativity mediated through hydrogen bond networks in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c was studied using a thermodynamic triple mutant cycle. Three known stabilizing mutations, Asn 26 to His, Asn 52 to , and  67 to Phe, were used to construct the triple mutant cycle. The side chain of His 26, a wild-type residue, forms two hydrogen bonds that bridge two substructures of the wild-type protein, and  67 and Asn 52 are part of an extensive buried hydrogen bond network. The stabilities of all variants in the triple mutant cycle were determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation methods and used to determine the pairwise, Delta(2)G(int), and triple interaction energies. His 26 and  52 interact cooperatively (Delta(2)G(int) is 1-2 kcal/mol), whereas the two other pairs of mutations interact anticooperatively (Delta(2)G(int) is -0.5 to -1.5 kcal/mol). Previously reported structural data for iso-1-cytochrome c variants containing these mutations show that changes in the strength of the His 26 to Glu 44 hydrogen bond, apparently caused by changes in main chain dynamics, provide a mechanism for the long distance (His 26 to Phe 67 and His 26 to  52) propagation of pairwise interaction energies. Opposing changes in the strength of the His 26 to Glu 44 hydrogen bond caused by the N52I and Y67F mutations generate a negative triple interaction  (-0.9 +/-0.7 kcal/mol) that combined with cancellation of cooperative and anticooperative pairwise interactions produce apparent additivity for the stabilizing effects of the single mutations in the triple mutant variant.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27035422>Bifunctional Peptide-Based Opioid Agonist-Nociceptin Antagonist Ligands for Dual Treatment of Acute and Neuropathic Pain.</a></h2><p>Herein, the opioid pharmacophore H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-NH2 (7) was linked to peptide ligands for the nociceptin receptor. Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg---Arg--Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg---Arg--Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine.

Additionally, alterations in the plasma level of glycogenic amino acids and glucose (as the factors influencing leptin secretion) and the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 17beta-oestradiol (E-2) (as the hormones regulated by leptin and engaged in recruitment, selection and development of ovulatory follicles) were analysed. Ninety-six female Polish Lowland Sheep were used. All ewes were cyclic and synchronized with PGF2alpha. The ewes were divided into two groups: control (n = 48), fed only with hay, and experimental (n = 48), received additionally lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) grain as a high-protein and a high- supplement. They were given lupin from the second to 13th day of the oestrous cycle at increasing doses (150-750 g/day per ewe). On the 11th day of cycle blood samples for analysis of hormones, amino acids and total glucose concentration, were collected from the jugular vein. OR was determined by laparoscopy of ovaries on the sixth day of the following oestrous cycle. Mean OR of ewes supplemented with lupin grain (1.687 +/- 0.463) was 30.67% higher than that of control (1.291 +/- 0.454). In spite of the unchanged body mass, a significant increase (P < or = 0.05) in mean concentration of plasma leptin in the experimental ewes [2.17 +/- 0.15 ng/ml human equivalent (HE)] was found in comparison with control (1.42 +/- 0.12 ng/ml HE). A significantly (P < or = 0.05) higher plasma FSH level in the ewes fed lupin (105.21 +/- 5.87 ng/ml) compared with those fed hay (67.88 +/- 6.03 ng/ml) was also found. However, plasma level of E-2 decreased after lupin feeding. Moreover, in the ewes fed lupin the plasma concentrations of glucose and nine glycogenic amino acids (Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, , , Phe and Arg) were increased. It can be concluded that lupin feeding exerts the stimulatory effect on the OR in Polish Lowland Sheep. The increase in OR is connected with significantly higher plasma leptin level and coincident with rise in FSH, glycogenic amino acids and glucose concentration. In contrast, the level of plasma E-2 was significantly decreased in lupin-fed ewes.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061520>Understanding the adhesion mechanism of a mucin binding domain from Lactobacillus fermentum and its role in enteropathogen exclusion.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus species possesses surface exposed Mucin Binding Protein (MucBP) which plays a role in adhesion to gastrointestinal mucin. MucBP contains one or more mucin binding domain (MBD), the functionality of which has yet not been characterized thoroughly. Here, we have characterized a 93-amino acid MBD (MBD) of MucBP (LAF_0673) from Lactobacillus fermentum. Multiple sequence alignment of L. fermentum MBD exhibited ∼60% sequence homology with MBDs from other Lactobacillus species. Further, we cloned, expressed and purified MBD from Escherichia coli as N-terminal histidine-tagged protein (6X His-MBD). The purified MBD was able to bind to mucin and showed strong affinity towards the terminally expressed mucin glycans viz. N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), Galactose (Gal), and Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac). In silico experiments further confirmed the interaction between homology modeled MBD to mucin glycans through hydrogen-bonding with its surface amino acid residues Ser, Pro, ,  and Ala. We also have demonstrated that MBD was able to inhibit the adhesion of enteric pathogens, including E. coli, Salmonella Paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei and Proteus vulgaris to mucin. Our results suggested that L. fermentum MBD is a functionally sufficient unit to act as an adhesin and to protect from invading enteric pathogens.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The gene encoding the FGLa/AST polypeptide precursor was first isolated from cockroaches and since then could be identified in many insects and crustaceans. With its strictly conserved regions in combination with variable regions the gene seems to be a good candidate for phylogenetic analyses between closely and distantly related species. Here, the structure of the FGLa/AST gene of the most primitive termite, the giant northern termite Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt, was identified. The FGLa/AST gene of the woodroach Cryptocercus darwini was also determined. Precursor sequences of both species possess the general organization of dictyopteran FGLa/AST precursors containing 14 putative FGLa/AST peptides. In M. darwiniensis, only 11 out of the 14 FGLa/AST-like peptides possess the C-terminal conserved region Y/FXFGL/I/V/M and four of the putative peptide structures are not followed by a Gly residue that would lead to nonamidated peptides.

We developed a method to determine deoccluded bound Ca(2+) by taking advantage of its rapid occlusion upon formation of E1PCa2 and of stabilization afforded by a high concentration of Ca(2+). The assay is applicable to minute amounts of Ca(2+)-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cells. It was validated by measuring the Ca(2+) binding properties of unphosphorylated Ca(2+)-ATPase. The method was then applied to the isomerization of the phosphorylated intermediate associated with the Ca(2+) release process E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca(2+). In the wild type, Ca(2+) release occurs concomitantly with EP isomerization fitting with rate-limiting isomerization (E1PCa2 → E2PCa2) followed by very rapid Ca(2+) release. In contrast, with alanine mutants of Leu(119) and (122) on the cytoplasmic part of the second transmembrane helix (M2) and (179) on the A domain, Ca(2+) release in 10 μm Ca(2+) lags EP isomerization, indicating the presence of a transient E2P state with bound Ca(2+).

Protein phosphatases are divided into two major groups: tyrosine () phosphatases and serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphatases. Substrate trapping mutants are frequently used to characterize  phosphatases and identify their substrates; however, a rapid and simple method to identify substrates for Ser/Thr phosphatases has yet to be developed. Recently it has reported that AlF4 -/AlF3 and BeF3 - form a complex with Mg2+ in the catalytic center of FCP/SCP phosphatases, and that the Mg2+-AlF4 -/AlF3 complex mimics the transition state of the hydrolysis step, while the Mg2+-BeF3 - complex mimics the aspartylphosphate intermediate.The main objective of this study was to develop a novel methodology, termed Phosphorylation Mimic Phage Display (PMPD), to identify substrates for Ser/Thr phosphatase Scp1 using peptide phage display libraries with Mg2+ and AlF4 -.Recombinant protein of human full-length Scp1 (rScp1) expressed in E. coli system was purified by Co2+ chelated affinity column, and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The Ph.D.-C7C or M12 Phage Display Libraries (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were screened using purified rScp1 immobilized on ELISA plate. Then, the plate was blocked with 0.5% (w/v) BSA in maleate buffer at 4°C for 3 h, before adding approximately 1×1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the phages in maleate blocking AlF4 - buffer to each well. After incubating, the wells were washed with maleate AlF4 - buffer to remove unbound phages. Then, phages were eluted with Mg2+ and AlF4 - free maleate buffer or with excess rScp1. After the third round of screening, the isolated phages were sequenced and subjected to binding analyses.After panning by PMPD method, 46 and 60 clones were isolated from the Ph.D. C7C and Ph.D. 12 phage libraries, respectively, as Mg2+ or/and AlF4 - -dependent binding clones. The binding analyses showed that M12-1 and Dep-3 specifically bind to Scp1 in an AlF4 --dependent manner. Notably, the Dep-3 peptide contained a Thr-Pro-Met-Ser sequence, which is similar to the Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5 (Ser/Thr-Pro-partially hydrophobic residue-Ser) sequence found in CTD, which is an endogenous substrate for Scp1. Binding analyses also showed that both BP-14 and M12-6a bound to Scp1 in a Mg2+-dependent manner. BP-14 peptide contained Ser- Thr- and Pro-Phe-Glu sequences, which are similar to the Ser-Thr-Trp and -Phe-Glu sequences found in M12-6a, suggesting that one or both of these tripeptides may be the binding motif(s) recognized by Scp1.We developed a substrate identification method for the Ser/Thr phosphatase Scp1 using a novel phage display method with AlF4 -. Dep-3 showed a core sequence similar to that of the CTD of RNA polymerase II, an endogenous Scp1 substrate, suggesting that this method is applicable for identifying novel Scp1 substrate candidates. This method will also be applicable for other FCP/SCP-type phosphatases, allowing us to better understand the substrate recognition mechanisms of Ser/Thr phosphatases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586060>Designer Self-Assemble Peptides Maximize the Therapeutic Benefits of Neural Stem Cell Transplantation for Alzheimer's Disease via Enhancing Neuron Differentiation and Paracrine Action.</a></h2><p>The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the presence of extracellular amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the form of amyloid plaques and neuronal loss. Neural stem cell (NSC) is being scrutinized as a promising cell replacement therapy for various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the unfavorable niche at the site of degenerative disease is hostile to the survival and differentiation of transplanted cells. Here, we undertook in vitro and in vivo works to examine whether a designer self-assemble peptide (DSP), which contains one functional domain --Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) derived from laminin, promotes the survival and neuronal differentiation of NSC and behavioral improvement. We found that DSP could undergo spontaneous assembly into well-ordered nanofibers, and it not only facilitated the cell viability in normal culture condition, but also decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by Aβ in vitro. NSC seeded in DSP showed much more neuronal differentiation than that seeded in self-assemble peptide (SP) or alone. In the AD model, NSC transplantation in DSP-treated AD rats demonstrated much more obvious cognitive rescue with restoration of learning/memory function compared with NSC transplantation in SP, NSC alone, or DSP alone treated ones. Interestingly, DSP enhanced the survival and neuronal differentiation of transplanted NSC. Apoptosis levels in the CA1 region and Aβ level in the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the group of NSC transplantation in DSP. Moreover, synaptic function, indicated by the expression of pre-synaptic protein synapsin-1, was restored and the secretion of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors were increased, such as IL-10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), while the expression of pro-inflammatory factors were decreased, such as TNF-α and IL-1β. These data firstly unveiled that the biomaterial DSP can maximize the therapeutic benefits of NSC transplantation for AD through improving the survival and differentiation of transplanted stem cells and promoting the effects of neuroprotection, anti-neuroinflammatory and paracrine action.

It is remarkable that the peptide spanning the scissile bond binds to but bypasses cleavage by the enzyme and inhibits the catalysis fairly with K(i) approximately 69 microm.

Yet, little is known about which specific amino acids in the hydrophobic surface of colipase influence adsorption. In this study, we systematically substituted alanine or tryptophan at residues implicated in adsorption of colipase to an interface. We expressed, purified recombinant colipase mutants and characterized the ability of each alanine mutant to restore activity to lipase in the presence of bile salts. The functions of L16A, Y55A, I79A and F84A colipase were most impaired with activities ranging from 20 to 60% of wild-type colipase. We next characterized the fluorescence properties of the tryptophan mutants in the absence and presence of bile-salt-oleic acid mixed micelles. We performed steady-state emission spectra to determine peak shift and I330/I350 ratio and acrylamide quenching curves to characterize the environment of the residues. The analysis supports a model of adsorption that includes residues Leu 34 and Leu 36 on the 2nd loop,  55 and  59 on the 3rd loop and  75 and  79 on the 4th loop. The analysis confirms that Phe 84 is not part of the adsorption surface and likely stabilizes the conformation of colipase. Contrary to the predictions of computer modeling, the results provide strong support for an essential role of  55 in colipase adsorption to mixed micelles. The results indicate that the adsorption of colipase to mixed micelles is mediated by specific residues residing in a defined surface of colipase.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While cholesterol-sensing motifs in transmembrane proteins have been identified, little is known about cholesterol recognition by soluble proteins. We reviewed the structural characteristics of binding sites for cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate from crystallographic structures available in the Protein Data Bank. This analysis unveiled key features of cholesterol-binding sites that are present in either all or the majority of sites: ) the cholesterol molecule is generally positioned between protein domains that have an organized secondary structure; ) the cholesterol hydroxyl/sulfo group is often partnered by Asn, Gln, and/or , while the hydrophobic part of cholesterol interacts with Leu, , Val, and/or Phe; ) cholesterol hydrogen-bonding partners are often found on α-helices, while amino acids that interact with cholesterol's hydrophobic core have a slight preference for β-strands and secondary structure-lacking protein areas; ) the steroid's C21 and C26 constitute the "hot spots" most often seen for steroid-protein hydrophobic interactions; ) common "cold spots" are C8-C10, C13, and C17, at which contacts with the proteins were not detected.

Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale.

Reactions to food may play a significant role especially in young children. Milk proteins are particularly strong allergens and are additional source of bioactive peptides including β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7, -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-). BCM7 exerts its influence on nervous, digestive, and immune functions via the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). Proline dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV; EC 3.4.14.5) appears to be the primary degrading enzyme of BCM7. Moreover, DPPIV is known to restrict activity of proinflammatory peptides. BCM7 is considered to modulate an immune response by affecting MOR and DPPIV genes expression. In this study, we determined the MOR and DPPIV genes expression in children diagnosed with a severe form of AD. 40 healthy children and 62 children diagnosed with severe AD (AD score ≥60) were included in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the studied subjects were incubated with the peptide extracts of raw and hydrolysed cow milk with defined β-casein genotypes (A1A1, A2A2 and A1A2) and MOR and DPPIV genes expression was determined with real-time PCR. Incubation PBMCs with peptide extracts from cow milk caused an increase of the MOR gene expression (p<0.05; p<0.001) in AD children with a simultaneous decrease in the DPPIV gene expression (p<0.001).

Following natural infection, 10-70% of the infected stallions can become persistently infected and continue to shed EAV in their semen for periods ranging from several months to life. Recently, we reported that some stallions possess a subpopulation(s) of CD3+ T lymphocytes that are susceptible to in vitro EAV infection and that this phenotypic trait is associated with long-term carrier status following exposure to the virus. In contrast, stallions not possessing the CD3+ T lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at less risk of becoming long-term virus carriers. A genome wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina Equine SNP50 chip revealed that the ability of EAV to infect CD3+ T lymphocytes and establish long-term carrier status in stallions correlated with a region within equine chromosome 11. Here we identified the gene and mutations responsible for these phenotypes. Specifically, the work implicated three allelic variants of the equine orthologue of CXCL16 (EqCXCL16) that differ by four non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions (XM_00154756; c.715 A → T, c.801 G → C, c.804 T → A/G, c.810 G → A) within exon 1. This resulted in four amino acid changes with EqCXCL16S (XP_001504806.1) having Phe, His,  and Lys as compared to EqCXL16R having , Asp, Phe, and Glu at 40, 49, 50, and 52, respectively. Two alleles (EqCXCL16Sa, EqCXCL16Sb) encoded identical protein products that correlated strongly with long-term EAV persistence in stallions (P<0.000001) and are required for in vitro CD3+ T lymphocyte susceptibility to EAV infection. The third (EqCXCL16R) was associated with in vitro CD3+ T lymphocyte resistance to EAV infection and a significantly lower probability for establishment of the long-term carrier state (viral persistence) in the male reproductive tract. EqCXCL16Sa and EqCXCL16Sb exert a dominant mode of inheritance. Most importantly, the protein isoform EqCXCL16S but not EqCXCL16R can function as an EAV cellular receptor. Although both molecules have equal chemoattractant potential, EqCXCL16S has significantly higher scavenger receptor and adhesion properties compared to EqCXCL16R.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604877>Water scorpions (Heteroptera, Nepidae) and giant water bugs (Heteroptera, Belostomatidae): sources of new members of the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone family.</a></h2><p>Two novel octapeptide members of the AKH/RPCH family have been identified from the corpora cardiaca (CC) of two species of water bugs. The giant water bug Lethocerus indicus (family: Belostomatidae) contains a peptide code-named Letin-AKH with the sequence pGlu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro--Trp amide, and the water scorpion Nepa cinerea (family: Nepidae) has the peptide code-named Nepci-AKH with the sequence pGlu-Leu/-Asn-Phe-Ser-Ser-Gly-Trp amide. The sequences were deduced from the multiple MS(N) electrospray mass data from crude CC extracts. Synthetic peptides were made and co-elution on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with the natural peptide from crude gland extract confirmed the accuracy of the deduced sequence for Letin-AKH and demonstrated that Nepci-AKH contains a Leu residue at position 2 and not an  residue. A previously characterized member of the AKH/RPCH family was identified in the stick water scorpion Ranatra linearis by mass spectrometry: Grybi-AKH (pGlu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Thr-Gly-Trp amide) has the same mass (919 Da) as Nepci-AKH and differs in two positions from Nepci-AKH (residues 2 and 6). The apparent function of the peptides is to achieve  mobilization in the species under investigation; indications for this came from conspecific bioassays using the appropriate synthetic peptides for injecting into the insects.

We hypothesize that a wholly different mechanism of deamidation might occur in the presence of aerobic nitric oxide (NO). Accordingly, we examined the deamidating ability of aerobic NO toward three model peptides, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-Pro-Gln-Gly, Lys-Trp-Asp-Asn-Gln, and Ser-Glu-Asn--Pro--Val, incubating them with the NO-generating compound, Et(2)N[N(O)NO]Na (DEA/NO, 30-48 mM), in aerobic, pH 7.4, buffer at 37 degrees C. DNP-Pro-Glu-Gly was detected after 2 h, while Lys-Trp-Asp-Asp-Gln, Lys-Trp-Asp-Asn-Glu, and Ser-Glu-Asp--Pro--Val were detected within 10 min, accumulating in apparent yields of up to approximately 10%. In the latter case, tyrosine nitration was also observed, producing the expected nitrotyrosine residue. DEA/NO solutions preincubated to exhaust the NO before the peptides were added did not induce detectable deamidation. The data demonstrate that aerobic NO exposures can lead to nitrosative deamidation of peptides, a pathway that differs from the established hydrolytic deamidation mechanism in several key respects: the by-products of the former are molecular nitrogen and an acid (HONO) while that of the latter is a base (NH(3)); the nitrosative path can in principle proceed in the absence of water molecules; Asn is much more easily deamidated than Gln in the hydrolytic pathway, while the two amino acid residues were deamidated to a similar extent by exposure to NO in the presence of .</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375824>Conformations of a model cyclic hexapeptide, CYIQNC: (1)H-NMR and molecular dynamics studies.</a></h2><p>Solution conformation of the cyclic hexapeptide sequence, [cyclo-S-Cys---Gln-Asn-Cys-S] (CYIQNC) - a disulfide-linked fragment of a neurohypophyseal peptide hormone oxytocin (OT) - has been investigated by high-field one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopic methods and compared with the results obtained from computer simulation studies. (1)H-NMR results based on temperature dependence of amide proton chemical shifts and nuclear Overhauser effect indicate that peptide in solution populates different conformations, characterized by two fused β-turns. The segment (3)-Gln(4)-Asn(5)-Cys(6) yields a preferred type-III β-turn at residues 4, 5 (HB, 3HN → 6CO), while the segment Cys(6), Cys(1)-(2)-(3) exhibits inherently weaker, flexible β-turn either of type I/II'/III/half-turn at residues 1, 2 (HB, 6HN → 3CO). The computer simulation studies using a mixed protocol of distance geometry-simulated annealing followed by constrained minimization, restrained molecular dynamics, and  minimization showed the possibility of existence of additional conformations with the hydrogen bonds, (a) 5HN → 3CO and (b) 2HN → 6CO. These results, therefore, indicate that the additional conformations obtained from both NMR and simulation studies can also be possible to the peptide.

Therefore, classical resonance assignment approaches often fail. The large size of phospholipid nanodiscs, a detergent-free phospholipid bilayer mimetic, prevented their use in high-resolution solution-state NMR spectroscopy so far. We recently introduced smaller nanodiscs that are suitable for NMR structure determination. However, side-chain assignments of a membrane protein in nanodiscs still remain elusive. Here, we utilized a NOE-based approach to assign (stereo-) specifically labeled , Leu, Val and Ala methyl labeled and uniformly (15)N-Phe and (15)N- labeled OmpX and calculated a refined high-resolution structure. In addition, we were able to obtain residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of OmpX in nanodiscs using Pf1 phage medium for the induction of weak alignment. Back-calculated NOESY spectra of the obtained NMR structures were compared to experimental NOESYs in order to validate the quality of these structures. We further used NOE information between protonated lipid head groups and side-chain methyls to determine the position of OmpX in the phospholipid bilayer. These data were verified by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments obtained with Gd(3+)-modified lipids. Taken together, this study emphasizes the need for the (stereo-) specific labeling of membrane proteins in a highly deuterated background for high-resolution structure determination, particularly in large membrane mimicking systems like phospholipid nanodiscs. Structure validation by NOESY back-calculation will be helpful for the structure determination and validation of membrane proteins where NOE assignment is often difficult. The use of protein to lipid NOEs will be beneficial for the positioning of a membrane protein in the lipid bilayer without the need for preparing multiple protein samples.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7795524>Conformationally constrained analogs of protein kinase inhibitor (6-22)amide: effect of turn structures in the center of the peptide on inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.</a></h2><p>The high-affinity interaction between protein kinase inhibitor (PKI)(6-22)amide(Thr6--Ala-Asp-Phe--Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly- Arg-Arg-Asn- Ala-Ile22-NH2) and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase requires both the N-terminal Thr6 to Ile11 sequence of the inhibitor peptide and its C-terminal pseudosubstrate site comprised of Arg15 to Ile22. Small angle X-ray scattering data indicate that PKI(6-22)amide has a compact, rather than extended, structure in solution (Reed J et al., 1989, Biochem J 264:371-380). CD spectroscopic analysis of the PKI peptide led to the suggestion that a beta-turn structure might be located in the -Ala12-Ser-Gly-Arg15-connecting sequence in the middle of the molecule (Reed J, Kinzel V, Cheng HC, Walsh DA, 1987, Biochemistry 26:7641-7647). To investigate this possibility further, conformationally constrained and flexible analogs of PKI(6-22)amide were synthesized and used to study the structure-function relationships of this central portion of the inhibitor. (Des12-14)PKI(6-22) amide exhibited over a 200-fold loss in inhibitory activity. Replacement of the omitted -Ala12-Ser-Gly14-sequence with aminocaprylic acid yielded an analog that regained more than 90% of the lost binding . The D-alanine14 PKI analog was as potent as the parent peptide, whereas the beta-alanine14 and the sarcosine14 analogs were only 10-fold less active. Several peptides that promoted a beta-turn structure at residues 12-15 showed about 200-fold decreases in inhibitory activity. Two constrained analogs that could not assume a beta-turn conformation were only 30-fold less potent than PKI(6-22)amide. Thus, the structure of the central connecting portion of the PKI peptide, encompassing residues 12-15, greatly influences its ability to effectively bind to and inhibit the catalytic subunit. We conclude, however, that a formal beta-turn at this position is not required and is actually detrimental for a high-affinity interaction of PKI(6-22)amide with the enzyme. These results are interpreted in light of the Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the peptide analogs and the crystal structure of the peptide bound at the active site of the protein kinase (Knighton DR et al., 1991b, Science 253:414-420).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453000>Identification of εPKC targets during cardiac ischemic injury.</a></h2><p>Epsilon-protein kinase C (εPKC) protects the heart from ischemic injury.

Previous studies, using εPKC transgenic mice and difference in gel electrophoresis, identified proteins involved in glucose , the expression of which was modified by εPKC. Those studies were accompanied by metabolomic analysis, suggesting that increased glucose oxidation may be responsible for the cardioprotective effect of εPKC.

This and other Osh proteins are essential for intracellular transport of sterols and ultimately cell life. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the binding of cholesterol to Osh4 at the atomic level. The structure of the protein is stable during the course of all MD simulations and has little deviation from the experimental crystal structure. The conformational stability of cholesterol within the binding tunnel is aided in part by direct or water-mediated interactions between the 3-hydroxyl (3-OH) group of cholesterol and Trp(46), Gln(96), (97), Asn(165), and/or Gln(181) as well as dispersive interactions with Phe(42), Leu(24), Leu(39), (167), and (203). These residues along with other nonpolar residues in the binding tunnel and lid contribute nearly 75% to the total binding . The strongest and most populated interaction is between Gln(96) and 3-OH with a cholesterol/Gln(96) interaction  of -4.5 +/- 1.0 kcal/mol.

Affinity purification of tagged UL51 in HSV-1-infected Vero cells was coupled with immunoblotting of the purified UL51 complexes with various antibodies to HSV-1 virion proteins. Subsequent analyses revealed that UL51 interacted with another tegument protein, UL14, in infected cells. Mutational analyses of UL51 showed that UL51 amino acid residues Leu-111, -119, and -123 were required for interaction with UL14 in HSV-1-infected cells. Alanine substitutions of these UL51 amino acid residues reduced viral replication and produced an accumulation of unenveloped and partially enveloped nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm at levels comparable to those of UL51-null, UL14-null, and UL51/UL14 double-null mutations. In addition, although UL51 and UL14 colocalized at juxtanuclear domains in HSV-1-infected cells, the amino acid substitutions in UL51 produced aberrant localization of UL51 and UL14. The effects of these substitutions on localization of UL51 and UL14 were similar to those of the UL51-null and UL14-null mutations on localization of UL14 and UL51, respectively. These results suggested that the interaction between UL51 and UL14 was required for proper localization of these viral proteins in infected cells and that the UL51-UL14 complex regulated final viral envelopment for efficient viral replication.Herpesviruses contain a unique virion structure designated the tegument, which is a protein layer between the nucleocapsid and the envelope. HSV-1 has dozens of viral proteins in the tegument, which are thought to facilitate viral envelopment by interacting with other virion components. However, although numerous interactions among virion proteins have been reported, data on how these interactions facilitate viral envelopment is limited. In this study, we have presented data showing that the interaction of HSV-1 tegument proteins UL51 and UL14 promoted viral final envelopment for efficient viral replication. In particular, prevention of this interaction induced aberrant accumulation of partially enveloped capsids in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the UL51-UL14 complex acted in the envelopment process but not in an upstream event, such as transport of capsids to the site for envelopment. This is the first report showing that an interaction between HSV-1 tegument proteins directly regulated final virion envelopment.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The inhibitors assume a compact, very well defined conformation, embedded into the substrate binding site not in the same way as a substrate, blocking thus the catalysis.

TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the -binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific  headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues -2456 to Trp-2470 of the -binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, -2463, and Phe-2469) and aliphatic residues (-2456, Leu-2459, -2464, and Pro-2468) in the -binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964984>Purification and identification of antioxidant peptides from egg white protein hydrolysate.</a></h2><p>Egg white proteins were hydrolysed separately using five different proteases to obtain antioxidant peptides. The antioxidant activity of egg white protein hydrolysates was influenced by the time of hydrolysis and the type of enzyme. Of the various hydrolysates produced, papain hydrolysate obtained by 3-h hydrolysis (PEWPH) displayed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity. PEWPH could also quench the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, effectively inhibit  peroxidation and exhibit reducing power. Then, PEWPH was purified sequentially by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, RP-HPLC and two fractions with relatively strong antioxidant activity were subsequently subjected to LC-MS/MS for peptide sequence identification. The sequences of the two antioxidant peptides were identified to be -Leu-Gly-Ala-Lys (551.54 Da) and Gly-Gly-Leu-Glu-Pro--Asn-Phe-Gln (974.55 Da), and they were identified for the first time from food-derived protein hydrolysates. Last, the two purified peptides were synthesized and they showed 7.48- and 6.02-fold higher DPPH radical scavenging activity compared with the crude PEWPH, respectively. These results indicate that PEWPH and/or its isolated peptides may be useful ingredients in food and nutraceutical applications.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035301>The role of substrate strain in the mechanism of the carbon-carbon lyases.</a></h2><p>The carbon-carbon lyases, tryptophan indole lyase (TIL) and tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) are bacterial enzymes which catalyze the reversible elimination of indole and phenol from l-tryptophan and l-tyrosine, respectively. These PLP-dependent enzymes show high sequence homology (∼40% identity) and both form homotetrameric structures. Steady state kinetic studies with both enzymes show that an active site base is essential for activity, and α-deuterated substrates exhibit modest primary isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km, suggesting that substrate deprotonation is partially rate-limiting. Pre-steady state kinetics with TPL and TIL show rapid formation of external aldimine intermediates, followed by deprotonation to give quinonoid intermediates absorbing at about 500nm. In the presence of phenol and indole analogues, 4-hydroxypyridine and benzimidazole, the quinonoid intermediates of TPL and TIL decay to aminoacrylate intermediates, with λmax at about 340nm. Surprisingly, there are significant kinetic isotope effects on both formation and subsequent decay of the quinonoid intermediates when α-deuterated substrates are used. The crystal structure of TPL with a bound competitive inhibitor, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate, identified several essential catalytic residues: -71, Thr-124, Arg-381, and Phe-448. The active sites of TIL and TPL are highly conserved with the exceptions of these residues: Arg-381(TPL)/-396 (TIL); Thr-124 (TPL)/Asp-137 (TIL), and Phe-448 (TPL)/His-463 (TIL). Mutagenesis of these residues results in dramatic decreases in catalytic activity without changing substrate specificity. The conserved tyrosine, -71 (TPL)/-74 (TIL) is essential for elimination activity with both enzymes, and likely plays a role as a proton donor to the leaving group. Mutation of Arg-381 and Thr-124 of TPL to alanine results in very low but measurable catalytic activity. Crystallography of Y71F and F448H TPL with 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine bound demonstrated that there are two quinonoid structures, relaxed and tense. In the relaxed structure, the substrate aromatic ring is in plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond, but in the tense structure, the substrate aromatic ring is about 20° out of plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond. In the tense structure, hydrogen bonds are formed between the substrate OH and the guanidinium of Arg-381 and the OH of Thr-124, and the phenyl rings of Phe-448 and 449 provide steric strain. Based on the effects of mutagenesis, the substrate strain is estimated to contribute about 10(8) to TPL catalysis. Thus, the mechanisms of TPL and TIL require both substrate strain and acid/base catalysis, and substrate strain is probably responsible for the very high substrate specificity of TPL and TIL.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The only one amino acid residue that is significantly overrepresented around ethanol molecules is . There are usually two or more  residues in the same ethanol binding site, while residues of Thr, Asp and Gln are underrepresented around them. Residues of Ala and Pro are significantly underrepresented in ethanol binding surfaces. Several residues (Phe, Val, Pro, Ala, Arg, His, Ser, Asp) bind ethanol significantly more frequent if they are not included in beta strands. Residues of Ala,  and Arg preferably bind ethanol when they are included in an alpha helix. Ethanol molecules often make hydrogen bonds with oxygen and nitrogen atoms from the main chain of a protein. Because of this reason, the binding of ethanol may be associated with the decrease of the length of alpha helices and the disappearance of 3/10 helices. Obtained data should be useful for studies on new targets of the direct action of ethanol on enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The inhibitory activity was stable over a wide range of pH and was fully retained after 30 min at 80°C, after which it decreased gradually at higher temperatures. The activity was sensitive to the proteolytic action of α-chymotrypsin, proteinase-K, and trypsin, indicating its proteinaceous nature. This bacteriocin was active against a broad spectrum of bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans.

The  landscape analysis of a hot spot at the intermolecular interface using alanine scanning and equilibrium-simulated tempering dynamics with the simplified, knowledge-based  function has enabled the role of the protein hot spot residues in providing the thermodynamic stability of the native structure to be determined. We have found that hydrophobic interactions between the peptide and the Met-252, -253, His-433, and His-435 protein residues are critical to guarantee the thermodynamic stability of the crystallographic binding mode of the complex. Binding free  calculations, using a molecular mechanics force field and a solvation  model, combined with alanine scanning have been conducted to determine the energetic contribution of the protein hot spot residues in binding affinity. The conserved Asn-434, Ser-254, and -436 protein residues contribute significantly to the binding affinity of the peptide-protein complex, serving as an energetic hot spot at the intermolecular interface.

The refined preferred conformation of the Phe dipeptide (aspartame) with side chain chi 1/2 conformation g- is g-Fg- in the hydrated state, which is consistent with the structure deduced from 1H-nmr experiments. Irrespective of the Xaa and taste, all the dipeptides have the same conformation for the Asp residue, which is attributable to the hydrogen bond between protonated amino hydrogen and carboxylate  and the favored hydration of the carboxylate group. This implies that the L-aspartyl residue is a necessary factor for the dipeptides to be sweet not a sufficient factor. The computed conformational preferences for sweet, bitter, and tasteless dipeptides in the hydrated state indicate to us that the conformation about the N--C alpha bond of the Xaa residue, i.e., the orientation of the hydrophobic moiety with respect to the AH/B functionalities in the aspartyl moiety, seems to be crucial to elicit the tastes. In addition, the hydrophobicity and the size of the Xaa residue are found to play a major role in determining the tastes.

The tyrosyl radical is buried in the protein matrix close to a dinuclear iron center and a cluster of three hydrophobic residues (Phe-208, Phe-212, and -234) conserved throughout the R2 family. A key step in the generation of the tyrosyl radical is the activation of molecular  at the iron center. It has been suggested that the hydrophobic cluster provides an inert binding pocket for molecular  bound to the iron center and that it may play a role in directing the oxidative power of a highly reactive intermediate toward tyrosine 122. We have tested these hypotheses by constructing the following mutant R2 proteins:F208Y, F212Y, F212W, and I234N. The resulting mutant proteins all have the ability to form a tyrosine radical, which indicates that binding of molecular  can occur. In the case of F208Y, the yield of tyrosyl radical is substantially lower than in the wild-type case. A competing reaction resulting in hydroxylation of -208 implies that the phenylalanine at position 208 may influence the choice of target for electron abstraction. The most prominent result is that all mutant proteins show impaired radical half-life; in three of the four mutants, the half-lives are several orders of magnitude shorter than that of the wild-type radical. This suggests that the major role of the hydrophobic pocket is to stabilize the tyrosyl radical. This hypothesis is corroborated by comparative studies of the environment of other naturally occurring tyrosyl radicals.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143767>Influence of dietary amino acid reductions and Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein diets.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance, plasma carotenoids, and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein (LCP) diets with reduced concentrations of selected amino acids (AA).

Following delivery into gastric epithelial cells by type IV secretion and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA motifs, CagA serves as an oncogenic scaffold/adaptor that promiscuously interacts with SH2 domain-containing mammalian proteins such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) and the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a negative regulator of Src family kinases. Like CagA, Pragmin also forms a physical complex with Csk. In the present study, we found that Pragmin directly binds to Csk by the tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA motif. The complex formation potentiates kinase activity of Csk, which in turn phosphorylates Pragmin on tyrosine-238 (Y238), Y343, and Y391. As Y391 of Pragmin comprises the EPIYA motif, Pragmin-Csk interaction creates a feed-forward regulatory loop of Csk activation. Together with the finding that Pragmin and Csk are colocalized to focal adhesions, these observations indicate that the Pragmin-Csk interaction, triggered by Pragmin EPIYA phosphorylation, robustly stimulates the kinase activity of Csk at focal adhesions, which direct cell-matrix adhesion that regulates cell morphology and cell motility. As a consequence, expression of Pragmin and/or Csk in epithelial cells induces an elongated cell shape with elevated cell scattering in a manner that is mutually dependent on Pragmin and Csk. Deregulation of the Pragmin-Csk axis may therefore induce aberrant cell migration that contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis.© 2016 The Authors.

The weight of abdominal and brown adipose tissues, on the contrary, increased.

The additional pyridine ring of ZnTerp binds deeply in the major binding pocket and, in contrast to ZnBip, interacts directly with the Trp-248 microswitch, contributing to its 8-fold higher potency. The impact of Trp-248 was further confirmed by ZnClTerp, a chloro-substituted version of ZnTerp that showed no inherent agonism but maintained positive allosteric modulation of CCL3 binding. Despite a similar overall binding mode of all three metal ion chelator complexes, the pyridine ring of ZnClTerp blocks the conformational switch of Trp-248 required for receptor activation, thereby explaining its lack of activity. Importantly, ZnClTerp becomes agonist to the same extent as ZnTerp upon Ala mutation of -116, a residue that constrains the Trp-248 microswitch in its inactive conformation.

The Frq1 main chain is similar to that in free Frq1 and related proteins in the same branch of the calmodulin superfamily. The myristoyl group and first eight residues of Frq1 are solvent-exposed, and Ca2+ binds the second, third, and fourth EF-hands, which associate to create a groove with two pockets. The Pik1 peptide forms two helices (125-135 and 156-169) connected by a 20-residue loop. Side chains in the Pik1 N-terminal helix (Val-127, Ala-128, Val-131, Leu-132, and Leu-135) interact with solvent-exposed residues in the Frq1 C-terminal pocket (Leu-101, Trp-103, Val-125, Leu-138, -152, and Leu-155); side chains in the Pik1 C-terminal helix (Ala-157, Ala-159, Leu-160, Val-161, Met-165, and Met-167) contact solvent-exposed residues in the Frq1 N-terminal pocket (Trp-30, Phe-34, Phe-48, -51, -52, Phe-55, Phe-85, and Leu-89). This defined complex confirms that residues in Pik1 pinpointed as necessary for Frq1 binding by site-directed mutagenesis are indeed sufficient for binding. Removal of the Pik1 N-terminal region (residues 8-760) from its catalytic domain (residues 792-1066) abolishes  kinase activity, inconsistent with Frq1 binding simply relieving an autoinhibitory constraint. Deletion of the  kinase unique motif (residues 35-110) also eliminates Pik1 activity. In the complex, binding of Ca2+-bound Frq1 forces the Pik1 chain into a U-turn. Frq1 may activate Pik1 by facilitating membrane targeting via the exposed N-myristoyl group and by imposing a structural transition that promotes association of the  kinase unique motif with the kinase domain.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2183216>Understanding structural relationships in proteins of unsolved three-dimensional structure.</a></h2><p>The locations of functionally important sequences and general structural motifs have been assigned to -tRNA synthetase. However, a function has not been established for some segments of the protein (e.g., CP1). The method of structural modeling described here cannot establish the details of a 3 A crystal structure, and, in contrast to a crystal structure, the precision of the model varies according to the extent of a sequence similarity or the functional importance of a region. In -tRNA synthetase, the signature sequence and the flanking regions are likely to be similar in structure to the proteins on which the model is based. For other regions, it may be possible to build a three-dimensional model by connecting well defined regions and refining the positions of the connecting elements by  minimization. Structural modelling of this kind must be done cautiously, because the order and orientation of the elements of a structural motif can change in subtle ways. In the case of -tRNA synthetase, the beta-strand nearest the N-terminus is the outermost strand of the nucleotide binding fold; in Met-tRNA synthetase, the same strand is innermost. Furthermore, the orientation of this strand may be antiparallel (-tRNA synthetase) or parallel (Met-tRNA synthetase). Because multiple structures that differ in their orientations of structural elements are possible, the structural analogies between proteins should not be naively extrapolated without independent experimental support. As described above, some regions of proteins tolerate internal deletions and insertions. This provides further experimental support for the practice of allowing for gaps in computer-generated sequence alignments. Nevertheless, because some regions are more tolerant of insertions and deletions than others, the structural and functional significance of a region of broken alignment must be assessed carefully. All gaps in sequence alignments cannot be treated equally, and each must be evaluated within its own context. In the synthetases of known structure, structural analogy can be used to identify important functional elements. For example, the amino acid binding site of Met-tRNA synthetase might be formed, at least in part, by a peptide that encompasses Ala50; this amino acid aligns with Gly94 of the -tRNA synthetase. This is an example in which results on a protein of unknown structure (-tRNA synthetases) can lead to identification of a potential substrate binding site in a protein of known structure (Met-tRNA synthetase).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803828>PTK2B/Pyk2 overexpression improves a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Pyk2 is a Ca-activated non-receptor tyrosine kinase enriched in forebrain neurons and involved in synaptic regulation. Human genetic studies associated PTK2B, the gene coding Pyk2, with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that Pyk2 is important for hippocampal function, plasticity, and spine structure. However, its potential role in AD is unknown. To address this question we used human brain samples and 5XFAD mice, an amyloid mouse model of AD expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin1. In the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice and in human AD patients' cortex and hippocampus, Pyk2 total levels were normal. However, Pyk2 -402 phosphorylation levels, reflecting its autophosphorylation-dependent activity, were reduced in 5XFAD mice at 8 months of age but not 3 months. We crossed these mice with Pyk2 mice to generate 5XFAD animals devoid of Pyk2. At 8 months the phenotype of 5XFAD x Pyk2 double mutant mice was not different from that of 5XFAD. In contrast, overexpression of Pyk2 in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, using adeno-associated virus, rescued autophosphorylated Pyk2 levels and improved synaptic markers and performance in several behavioral tasks. Both Pyk2 and 5XFAD mice showed an increase of potentially neurotoxic Src cleavage product, which was rescued by Pyk2 overexpression. Manipulating Pyk2 levels had only minor effects on Aβ plaques, which were slightly decreased in hippocampus CA3 region of double mutant mice and increased following overexpression. Our results show that Pyk2 is not essential for the pathogenic effects of human amyloidogenic mutations in the 5XFAD mouse model. However, the slight decrease in plaque number observed in these mice in the absence of Pyk2 and their increase following Pyk2 overexpression suggest a contribution of this kinase in plaque formation. Importantly, a decreased function of Pyk2 was observed in 5XFAD mice, indicated by its decreased autophosphorylation and associated Src alterations. Overcoming this deficit by Pyk2 overexpression improved the behavioral and molecular phenotype of 5XFAD mice. Thus, our results in a mouse model of AD suggest that Pyk2 impairment may play a role in the symptoms of the disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence accumulates that H. pylori cagA-positive strains play a crucial role in the neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells. The cagA-encoded CagA protein is delivered into the host cells via bacterial type IV secretion, where it interacts with and thereby aberrantly activates pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2. The CagA-SHP2 interaction requires tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA at the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motif. The incidences of gastric cancer in East Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Korea are among the highest worldwide. A vast majority of H. pylori circulating in East Asia produce a CagA variant termed East Asian CagA, which possesses the SHP2-binding EPIYA motif (EPIYA-D) that is substantially diverged in sequence from the SHP2-binding EPIYA motif (EPIYA-C) of CagA isolated in the rest of the world (Western CagA). Tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-D interacts with SHP2 approximately two orders of magnitude stronger than tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-C does. The strong SHP2 binding of East Asian CagA is achieved by a cryptic interaction between the phenylalanine residue located at the +5 position from the phospho-tyrosine in EPIYA-D and a small hollow on the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding floor, the latter of which cannot be created by the corresponding aspartic acid in EPIYA-C. Thus, a variation in a single amino-acid residue determines the magnitude for the pathogenic/oncogenic action of CagA, which may influence the worldwide landscape in the incidence of H. pylori-associated malignancies, especially gastric cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879834>Effect of keratinase on ileal amino acid digestibility in five feedstuffs fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of keratinase (KE) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in rice bran, cottonseed meal (CSM), rapeseed meal (RSM), corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and peanut meal (PNM).Twelve crossbred barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire, 50.5±1.4 kg body weight [BW]) fitted with T-cannulas at the terminal ileum were allotted to a 12×6 Youden Square design with 12 diets and 6 periods.

The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil.

In Exp. 1, a total of 6 ileally cannulated barrows (average initial BW = 26.8 kg) were fed 3 diets in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design to determine the apparent and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) values of N and AA and the SID AA contents of EECM. The 3 diets were a cornstarch-based diet with either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM as the sole source of protein, and a low-casein cornstarch-based diet, which was used to estimate basal endogenous N and AA losses to determine the SID of N and AA. All 3 diets contained chromic oxide as an indigestible marker for determining nutrient digestibility by the indicator method. In Exp. 2, a total of 18 intact barrows (average initial BW = 25.9 kg) were fed 3 diets in a completely randomized design (6 pigs per diet) to determine apparent total tract digestibility and retention of nutrients and the DE and ME contents of EECM. The diets were a basal corn-based diet or the basal diet with corn replaced by 35% SECM or EECM. The basal diet was used for determining the total tract digestible nutrient content by the difference method. Solvent-extracted canola meal, which is commonly used in the formulation of swine diets, was fed in both experiments for comparison with EECM. The SECM and EECM were similar in CP content (41.8 vs. 41.4%). Expeller-extracted canola meal was, however, greater in ether extract content (12.03 vs. 5.54%) and decreased in NDF content (23.8 vs. 29.9%) compared with SECM. The EECM also had a greater content of all the AA except Met, Cys, and Ser, by approximately 6.6%; Cys was greater in SECM, whereas Met and Ser were similar between the 2 meals. The EECM had greater (P < 0.05) SID of N, Arg, , Leu, Phe, Glu, and Pro. The SID contents of Arg, His, , Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Pro, and  were also greater (P < 0.05) for EECM than for SECM by an average of 15%. The EECM had greater (P < 0.01) DE (4,107 vs. 3,790 kcal/kg) and ME (3,978 vs. 3,564 kcal/kg) values compared with SECM.

The cagA gene-encoded CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via bacterial type IV secretion, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motifs. Delivered CagA then acts as a non-physiological scaffold/hub protein by interacting with multiple host signaling molecules, most notably the pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2 and the polarity-regulating kinase PAR1/MARK, in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. CagA-mediated manipulation of intracellular signaling promotes neoplastic transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Transgenic expression of CagA in experimental animals has confirmed the oncogenic potential of the bacterial protein. Structural polymorphism of CagA influences its scaffold function, which may underlie the geographic difference in the incidence of gastric cancer. Since CagA is no longer required for the maintenance of established gastric cancer cells, studying the role of CagA during neoplastic transformation will provide an excellent opportunity to understand molecular processes underlying "Hit-and-Run" carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537897>Anticancer Activity of a Hexapeptide from Skate (Raja porosa) Cartilage Protein Hydrolysate in HeLa Cells.</a></h2><p>In this study, the hexapeptide Phe--Met-Gly-Pro- (FIMGPY), which has a molecular weight of 726.9 Da, was separated from skate (Raja porosa) cartilage protein hydrolysate using ultrafiltration and chromatographic methods, and its anticancer activity was evaluated in HeLa cells. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that FIMGPY exhibited high, dose-dependent anti-proliferation activities in HeLa cells with an IC50 of 4.81 mg/mL. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) fluorescence staining and flow cytometry methods confirmed that FIMGPY could inhibit HeLa cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis.

Thus, FIMGPY could induce apoptosis by upregulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activation.

We have investigated the role of proteases in HT22 cell oxidative glutamate toxicity. L-glutamate-induced toxicity was characterized by cell and nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation, yet occurred in the absence of either DNA fragmentation or mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Pretreatment with the selective caspase inhibitors either benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (pan-caspase), N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-aldehyde (caspase 9) or N-acetyl--Glu-Thr-Asp-aldehyde (caspase 8), significantly increased L-glutamate-induced cell death with a corresponding increase in observed nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation. This enhancement of glutamate toxicity correlated with an increase in L-glutamate-dependent production of reactive  species (ROS) as a result of caspase inhibition. Pretreating the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine prevented ROS production, cell shrinkage and cell death from L-glutamate as well as that associated with the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor. In contrast, the caspase-3/-7 inhibitor N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde was without significant effect. However, pretreating the cells with the calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO, but not the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074, prevented cell death. The cytotoxic role of calpains was confirmed further by: 1) cytotoxic dependency on intracellular Ca(2+) increase, 2) increased cleavage of the calpain substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val--AMC and 3) immunoblot detection of the calpain-selective 145 kDa alpha-fodrin cleavage fragment. We conclude that oxidative L-glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells is mediated via calpain activation, whereas inhibition of caspases-8 and -9 may exacerbate L-glutamate-induced oxidative neuronal damage through increased oxidative stress.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697521>Activation of arginine vasopressin receptor 1a facilitates the induction of long-term potentiation in the accessory olfactory bulb of male mice.</a></h2><p>Olfaction plays an important role in social recognition in most mammals. Central arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a role in this olfaction-based recognition. The high level of expression of AVP receptors in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) at the first relay of the vomeronasal system highlights the importance of AVP signaling at this stage. We therefore analyzed the effects of AVP on the synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic transmission from mitral cells to granule cells in AOB slices from male mice. To monitor the strength of the glutamatergic transmission, we measured the maximal initial slope of the lateral olfactory tract-evoked field potential, which represents the granule cell response to mitral cell activation. AVP paired with 100-Hz stimulation that only produced short-term potentiation enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in a dose-dependent manner. AVP-paired LTP was blocked by the selective AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1a) antagonist, d(CH)[(Me)]AVP (Manning compound), but not by the AVPR1b antagonist SSR149415, and it was mimicked by the selective AVPR1a agonist [Phe, , Orn]-vasopressin. We further examined the effect of AVP on the reciprocal transmission between mitral and granule cells by stimulating a mitral cell and recording the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from the same cell using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. AVP reduced the reciprocal IPSCs triggered by endogenous glutamate release from the excited mitral cell. These results suggest that AVP promotes the induction of LTP at the mitral-to-granule cell synapse via the activation of AVPR1a through an as-yet-to-be-determined mechanism in the AOB of male mice.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the molecular details of ligand uptake and targeted release by CRBP1 remain unclear. Here we report the first structure of CRBP1 in a ligand-free form as well as ultra-high resolution structures of this protein bound to either all-trans-retinol or retinylamine, the latter a therapeutic retinoid that prevents light-induced retinal degeneration. Superpositioning of human apo- and holo-CRBP1 revealed major differences within segments surrounding the entrance to the retinoid-binding site. These included α-helix II and hairpin turns between β-strands βC-βD and βE-βF as well as several side chains, such as Phe-57, -60, and -77, that change their orientations to accommodate the ligand. Additionally, we mapped hydrogen bond  inside the retinoid-binding cavity and demonstrated their significance for the ligand affinity. Analyses of the crystallographic B-factors indicated several regions with higher backbone mobility in the apoprotein that became more rigid upon retinoid binding. This conformational flexibility of human apo-CRBP1 facilitates interaction with the ligands, whereas the more rigid holoprotein structure protects the labile retinoid moiety during vitamin A transport.

Neurotensin, PD149163, and JMV-431 all significantly reduced the number 22-kHz calls. No changes in call duration were found, suggesting that non-specific drug effects do not account for the reductions in 22-kHz calls.

The cDNA sequence of HdCAV1 is 826 bp long and encodes a 127-amino acid polypeptide. Characteristic caveolin superfamily domain (Glu - Lys) and two possible transmembrane domains (Cys -  and  - Phe) were identified in the HdCAV1 protein. Homology analysis revealed that HdCAV1 shared higher identity (>47%) with molluscans, but lower identity with other species. Phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method revealed a distinct evolutionary pathway for molluscans. Transcriptional analysis by SYBR Green qPCR showed the highest expression of HdCAV1 mRNA in late veliger stage, as compared to that in other embryonic developmental stages of disk abalone. In adult animals, gill tissue showed highest HdCAV1 transcript levels under normal physiological condition. Stimulations with two bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS and poly I:C) significantly modulated the expression of HdCAV1 transcripts. Collectively, these data suggest that CAV1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and host immune defense in disk abalone.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the first PfSPZ Vaccine trial ever in a malaria-endemic population, Vδ2 γδ T cells were significantly elevated and Vγ9/Vδ2 transcripts ranked as the most upregulated in vaccinees who were protected from  infection. In a mouse model, absence of γδ T cells during vaccination impaired protective CD8 T cell responses and ablated sterile protection. γδ T cells were not required for circumsporozoite protein-specific Ab responses, and γδ T cell depletion before infectious challenge did not ablate protection. γδ T cells alone were insufficient to induce protection and required the presence of CD8α dendritic cells. In the absence of γδ T cells, CD8α dendritic cells did not accumulate in the livers of vaccinated mice. Altogether, our results show that γδ T cells were essential for the induction of sterile immunity during whole-organism vaccination.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706971>Dietary electrolyte balance influences ileal endogenous amino acid losses in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of nitrogen-free diets formulated with 2 ratios of corn starch and dextrose and 2 levels of dietary electrolyte balance (DEB; calculated as Na + K - Cl(-), in mEq/kg of diet) on ileal endogenous amino acid (EAA) losses in 48-d-old broiler chickens. On d 43, 240 broiler chickens were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicate cages per diet in a completely randomized design. Each experimental diet was fed for 5 d (d 43-48). All diets were free of nitrogen with 2 ratios of corn starch-to-dextrose (0.31 and 1.04) and 2 levels of DEB (108 and 219 mEq/kg of diet). Final BW and BW loss between birds fed the 2 corn starch-to-dextrose ratios and between birds fed 2 levels of DEB were not different (P > 0.05). Birds fed the diet containing a high level of DEB consumed less (P < 0.05) feed than birds on the low-DEB diet. Birds on the high-corn starch-to-dextrose (1.04) diet showed a tendency for higher (P = 0.08) feed intake. High dietary dextrose level (corn starch-to-dextrose ratio of 0.31) resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal DM and  digestibility. A high level of DEB resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal endogenous nitrogen loss. Arginine, , Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, Glu, Gly, Pro, and  secretion into the gut increased (P ≤ 0.05) with an increasing level of DEB. Endogenous His, Lys, Thr, Asp, Cys, and Ser showed a tendency for increased (P ≤ 0.1) losses with a high level of DEB. Mean ileal EAA losses for the indispensable and dispensable amino acids for the low-DEB diet were 81 and 82%, respectively, that of the birds fed the high-DEB diet. The 4 amino acids with the lowest endogenous flow were Met, His, , and Cys, whereas the highest endogenous flow was found in Glu, Asp, Val, and Leu. Data from the current study showed that EAA losses in the ileum of broiler chickens are significantly affected by DEB, but not by the ratio of corn starch to dextrose.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309861>Protective effects of diketopiperazines from Moslae Herba against influenza A virus-induced pulmonary  via inhibition of viral replication and platelets aggregation.</a></h2><p>Moslae Herba (MH) is broadly used as an antiviral, antipyretic and anticoagulant drug which effectively treats respiratory diseases including cough, asthma, throat, cold and flu.The excessive  of the lungs is the hallmark of severe influenza A virus (IAV) infection, while platelet aggregation and its subsequent microvascular thrombosis can exacerbate IAV-induced lung injury. Thus, inhibition of platelet aggregation can be a potential target for IAV treatment. Previous studies focus on the flavonoids from MH and their anti-inflammatory activities, but the anticoagulant compounds and potential molecular mechanism of MH remains unclear. This study was to isolate and characterize diketopiperazines (DKPs) from MH and to explore the underlying anticoagulant mechanism on IAV infection models.EtOAc sub-extract separated from MH ethanolic extract was subjected to fractionation through column chromatography. The chemical structures of pure compounds were characterized by the spectral analysis. Antiviral activities of DKPs were assayed in IAV-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and mice. Anticoagulant effects of DKPs were investigated on adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-induced acute pulmonary embolism and IAV-induced lung injury in vivo, as well as the inhibition on platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid (AA) and ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. The serum levels of thromboxane B (TXB) and 6-keto-PGF were detected by ELISA. The expressions of key proteins in CD41-mediated PI3K/AKT pathways were determined by western blotting analysis.Six DKPs were, for the first time, isolated from MH and identified as cyclo(-Leu) (1), cyclo(Phe-Phe) (2), cyclo(Phe-) (3), cyclo(Ala-) (4), cyclo(Ala-Leu) (5) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe (6). Among these DKPs, cyclo(Ala-) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe possessed low cytotoxicities and significant inhibition against cytopathic effects induced by IAV (H1N1 and H3N2) replication in MDCK cells. Furthermore, cyclo(Ala-) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe significantly alleviated IAV-induced platelet activation and lung  in mice. They could reduce the expression of CD41 and the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in PLTs of IAV-infected mice.These results suggested that cyclo(Ala-) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe isolated from MH have antiviral and anticoagulant effects against IAV-induced PLT aggregation and lung  via regulating CD41/PI3K/AKT pathway, and could be used as the potential agents for IAV treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the aim of this study was to apply the deletion method to derive the IAAR for broiler breeder hens. The nitrogen balance trials were performed from 31 to 35 weeks and from 46 to 50 weeks. Twelve treatments with eight replicates and one hen per cage were used. A balanced diet (BD) was formulated to meet the requirement of all nutrients. The other diets were formulated diluting 55% of BD with corn starch and refilled with amino acids (AAs) and other ingredients, except the AA tested. Each trial lasted 25 days. Feather losses, egg production and egg weight were recorded daily, and the samples were stored to further determine NEM and nitrogen in feather losses (ND ). At the start and the end of each period, a group of birds were slaughtered to further determine ND and ND . The NR was calculated as the sum of ND , ND , ND , NEM and the nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR). The deletion of valine greatly depressed the NR in peak production (31 to 35 weeks) while the deletion of the isoleucine greatly depressed the NR of the hens from 46 to 50 weeks of age. The percentual reduction in NR and the per cent of the AA to delete from the BD were used to calculate the AA requirement. The average IAAR was Lys 100, Met+Cys 86, Trp 23, Thr 80, Arg 113, Val 90,  91, Leu 133, Phe+ 108, Gly+Ser 94 and His 35. The IAAR was in line with the recommendation from the literature, validating deletion method with the advantages from a rapid and low-cost procedure.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17620608>Potent cross-reactive neutralization of SARS coronavirus isolates by human monoclonal antibodies.</a></h2><p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a worldwide epidemic in late 2002/early 2003 and a second outbreak in the winter of 2003/2004 by an independent animal-to-human transmission. The GD03 strain, which was isolated from an index patient of the second outbreak, was reported to resist neutralization by the human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) 80R and S3.1, which can potently neutralize isolates from the first outbreak. Here we report that two hmAbs, m396 and S230.15, potently neutralized GD03 and representative isolates from the first SARS outbreak (Urbani, Tor2) and from palm civets (SZ3, SZ16). These antibodies also protected mice challenged with the Urbani or recombinant viruses bearing the GD03 and SZ16 spike (S) glycoproteins. Both antibodies competed with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, for binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD), suggesting a mechanism of neutralization that involves interference with the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interaction. Two putative hot-spot residues in the RBD (-489 and -491) were identified within the SARS-CoV spike that likely contribute to most of the m396-binding . Residues -489 and -491 are highly conserved within the SARS-CoV spike, indicating a possible mechanism of the m396 cross-reactivity. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis data show that m396 might neutralize all zoonotic and epidemic SARS-CoV isolates with known sequences, except strains derived from bats. These antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity against isolates from the two SARS outbreaks and palm civets and could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV infections.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11720974>Influence of a  interface on protein dynamics in a fungal lipase.</a></h2><p>Lipases catalyze lipolytic reactions and for optimal activity they require a  interface. To study the effect of a  aggregate on the behavior of the enzyme at the interfacial plane and how the aggregate influences an attached substrate or product molecule in time and space, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations were performed over 1 to 2 ns using explicit SPC water. The interaction energies between protein and  are mainly due to van der Waals contributions reflecting the hydrophobic nature of the  molecules. Estimations of the protonation state of titratable residues indicated that the negative charge on the fatty acid is stabilized by interactions with the titratable residues -28, His-143, and His-257. In the presence of a  patch, the active site lid opens wider than observed in the corresponding simulations in an aqueous environment. In that lid conformation, the hydrophobic residues -85, -89, and Leu-92 are embedded in the  patch. The behavior of the substrate or product molecule is sensitive to the environment.

In Exp. 1, 42 barrows (63.8 ± 2.1 kg BW) were allotted to seven diets in a completely randomized design with six replicates per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and six additional diets containing 4.85%, 9.70%, 19.40%, 29.10%, 38.80%, or 48.50% CGM. Pigs were fed twice daily, at 0730 and 1630 hours, at a level of 4% of BW, and feces and urine were collected for 5 d. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, CP, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract, and the DE and ME in diets linearly decreased (P < 0.01) as dietary CGM increased. Inclusion level of CGM had no effect on the DE and ME values of CGM. On a DM basis, the concentration of DE and ME varied from 3,396 to 3,747 kcal/kg and 3,107 to 3,502 kcal/kg, respectively.

It consists of an active site inhibitor segment, hirudin1-48, a fibrinogen-recognition exosite inhibitor segment, hirudin55-65, and a linker, hirudin49-54, connecting these inhibitor segments. The role of the side chain of the hirudin 59th residue, , is studied by using a series of synthetic bivalent thrombin inhibitors, which mimic the binding mode of hirudin. The synthetic inhibitors based on the hirudin sequence have a general sequence of Ac-(D-Phe)-Pro-Arg-Pro-(4-aminobutyric acid)-(7-amino-heptanoic acid)-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Xaa-Pro-Glu-Glu--Leu-Gln-OH, in which the 59th residue, Xaa, is substituted by various natural and unnatural L-amino acids. For example, substitution of IleH59 by Val, which is equivalent to removing the delta-methyl group of IleH59, reduces the affinity of the inhibitor 5.7-fold (delta delta G0 = 1.0 kcal/mol) to a Ki value of 4.7 nM compared to that (Ki = 0.82 nM) of the corresponding inhibitor with IleH59. Removal of the entire side chain of IleH59, i.e., a substitution of IleH59 by Gly, reduces the affinity of the inhibitor 6300-fold, revealing the critical role of the IleH59 side chain in the inhibitor binding. Theoretical free  calculation successfully reproduces the binding free  of most of the analogs. It suggests that intra- and intermolecular van der Waals interactions of delta-CH3, gamma-CH3, and gamma-CH2 of IleH59 play the major role in the binding affinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12068020>The thrombin epitope recognizing thrombomodulin is a highly cooperative hot spot in exosite I.</a></h2><p>The functional epitope of thrombin recognizing thrombomodulin was mapped using Ala-scanning mutagenesis of 54 residues located around the active site, the Na(+) binding loop, the 186-loop, the autolysis loop, exosite I, and exosite II.

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular  (MW) ≤ 3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, -Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg--Leu (VRYL), -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro--Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

Previously, we have shown unintended incorporation of tyrosine () and leucine/isoleucine (Leu/) at phenylalanine (Phe) positions in a recombinant produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) using an orthogonal MASCOT/SIEVE based approach for mass spectrometry data analysis. The misincorporation could be avoided by sufficient supply of phenylalanine throughout the process. Several non-annotated signals in the primarily chromatographic peptide separation step for apparently single Phe→ sequence variants (SVs) suggest a role for isobar tyrosine isoforms. Meta- and ortho- are spontaneously generated during aerobic fed-batch production processes using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Process induced meta- and ortho- but not proteinogenic para- are incorporated at Phe locations in Phe-starved CHO cultures expressing a recombinant mAb.

Structure and specificity of the interaction between the FHA2 domain of Rad53 and phosphotyrosyl peptides.</a></h2><p>The forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is a protein module found in many proteins involved in cell signaling in response to DNA damage. It has been suggested to bind to pThr sites of its target protein. Recently we have determined the first structure of an FHA domain, FHA2 from the yeast protein Rad53, and demonstrated that FHA2 binds to a pTyr-containing peptide (826)EDI(pY)YLD(832) from Rad9, with a moderate affinity (K(d) ca. 100 microM). We now report the solution structure of the complex of FHA2 bound with this pTyr peptide. The structure shows that the phosphate group of pTyr interacts directly with three arginine residues (605, 617, and 620), and that the leucine residue at the +2 position from the pTyr interacts with a hydrophobic surface on FHA2. The sequence specificity of FHA2 was determined by screening a combinatorial pTyr library. The results clearly show that FHA2 recognizes specific sequences C-terminal to pTyr with the following consensus: XX(pY)N(1)N(2)N(3), where N(1)=Leu, Met, Phe, or , N(2)=, Phe, Leu, or Met, and N(3)=Phe, Leu, or Met. Two of the selected peptides, GF(pY)LYFIR and DV(pY)FYMIR, bind FHA2 with K(d) values of 1.1 and 5.0 microM, respectively. The results, along with other recent reports, demonstrate that the FHA domain is a new class of phosphoprotein-binding domain, capable of binding both pTyr and pThr sequences.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12082163>Thermodynamic characterization of variants of mesophilic cytochrome c and its thermophilic counterpart.</a></h2><p>Thermal stability was measured for variants of cytochrome c-551 (PA c-551) from a mesophile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a thermophilic counterpart, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c-552 (HT c-552), by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at pH 3.6.

The thermodynamic parameters determined indicated that the mutations in regions I and III caused enhanced stability through not only enthalpic but also entropic contributions, which reflected improved packing of the side chains. Meanwhile, the mutated region II made enthalpic contributions to the stability through electrostatic interactions.

HT c-552 had the smallest heat capacity change (DeltaC(P)), resulting in higher DeltaG values over a wide temperature range (0-100 degrees C), compared to the PA c-551 variants; this contributed to the highest stability of HT c-552.

Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Thr than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of  in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of Lys than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of , Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, and  than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID Thr and SID  than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States. These observations indicate that the protein value is not different among SBM produced in the United States regardless of the location of the crushing plants.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10193575>Hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells requires caspase-3 activation.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis has been associated with oxidative stress in biological systems. Caspases have been considered to play a pivotal role in the execution phase of apoptosis. However, which caspases function as executioners in reactive  species (ROS)-induced apoptosis is not known. The present study was performed to identify the major caspases acting in ROS-induced apoptosis. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 50 microM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 4 h induced the morphological changes such as condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, increase in caspase-3 subfamily protease activities, reduction of the procaspase-3 and a DNA fragmentation. To determine the role of caspases in H2O2-induced apoptosis, caspase inhibitors, acetyl--Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone (Ac-YVAD-cmk), acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and acetyl-Val-Glu--Asp-aldehyde (Ac-VEID-CHO), selective for caspase-1 subfamily, caspase-3 subfamily and caspase-6, respectively, were loaded into the cells using an osmotic lysis of pinosomes method. Of these caspase inhibitors, only Ac-DEVD-CHO completely blocked morphological changes, caspase-3 subfamily protease activation and DNA ladder formation in H2O2-treated HL-60 cells. This inhibitory effect was dose-dependent. These results suggest that caspase-3, but not caspase-1 is required for commitment to ROS-triggered apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8899531>Response of cows fed a low crude protein diet to ruminally protected methionine and lysine.</a></h2><p>Ten cows (mean = 128 DIM) were utilized in a replicated 5 x 5 Latin square design and fed diets formulated to supply adequate (18% CP) or inadequate (14% CP) Met and Lys.

The DMI; yields of milk, 3.5% FCM, total N, protein N, and whey N; plasma concentrations of Arg, Cit, His, , Leu, Orn, Phe, Pro, , Val, and urea N were greater for cows fed the 18% CP diet.

Without prior isolation, the structural determination is achieved on the basis of mass fragmentation pattern and comparison with the previously established data. The ESI-MS of the fraction in the positive ion mode gave clusters of singly and doubly charged molecular ion peaks. The ESI-MS spectrum showed peaks for the presence of the peptides kahalalides F, G, R and S reported earlier.

The MS/MS at m/z 779.4 [M+2H] at collision  40 V obtained series of b and y fragment ions. The MS/MS spectrum showed identical fragment ion y at m/z 643 which revealed that cyclic part is identical with kahalalide F, R and S. Careful examination of the fragment ions b to b with their corresponding y fragment ions y to y, respectively and by comparison of MS/MS pattern of kahalalide S, established that proline can be replaced by tyrosine amino acid residue. The mass difference between b ( m/z 511) and b ( m/z 674) is equal to 163 which is equivalent to mass residue of tyrosine. Their y fragment ions also quickly helped in fixing the puzzle.

The modeling studies have revealed the two possible mode of RCy-Cytc(4) complexation involving nearly the same stabilization energy approximately -15 x 10(3) kJ/mol, one through N-terminal Asp 15 and another -C terminal Glu 121 of Cytc(4) with the Cu-bonded His 143 of RCy. The Asp 15:His 143 associated complex (DH) of Cytc(4)-RCy was stabilized by the intermolecular H-bonds of the carboxyl  atoms O(delta1) and O(delta2) of Asp 15 with the Nepsilon-atom of His 143 and O(b) atoms of Ala 8 and Asp 5 (of Cytc(4)) with the Thr 146 and Phe 51 (of RCy).

The six water molecules were present in the binding region of the two proteins in the energy minimized autosolvated DH and EH-complexes.

Isoxicam is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 whereas meloxicam displays some selectivity for COX-2. Here we report crystal complexes of COX-2 with isoxicam and meloxicam at 2.0 and 2.45 angstroms, respectively, and a crystal complex of COX-1 with meloxicam at 2.4 angstroms. These structures reveal that the oxicams bind to the active site of COX-2 using a binding pose not seen with other NSAIDs through two highly coordinated water molecules. The 4-hydroxyl group on the thiazine ring partners with Ser-530 via hydrogen bonding, and the heteroatom of the carboxamide ring of the oxicam scaffold interacts with -385 and Ser-530 through a highly coordinated water molecule. The nitrogen atom of the thiazine and the oxygen atom of the carboxamide bind to Arg-120 and -355 via another highly ordered water molecule. The rotation of Leu-531 in the structure opens a novel binding pocket, which is not utilized for the binding of other NSAIDs. In addition, a detailed study of meloxicam·COX-2 interactions revealed that mutation of Val-434 to  significantly reduces inhibition by meloxicam due to subtle changes around Phe-518, giving rise to the preferential inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257055>Deletion of arginine from an abomasal infusion of amino acids does not decrease milk protein yield in Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>This study was undertaken to determine if a limited supply of Arg would alter milk and milk protein yields, as well as mammary uptake of AA and energetic substrates. Six lactating Holstein cows (199 ± 5 d in milk) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square balanced for residual effects with 14-d periods. The diet was formulated to supply 100% of the National Research Council net  requirement and 72% of the metabolizable protein requirement. The treatments were randomly distributed as abomasal infusions of (1) water (CTL), (2) a mixture of essential AA (EAA) excluding Arg (ARG-), or (3) a mixture of EAA including Arg (ARG+). The profile of EAA in the infusates was the same as that found in casein with the exception that methionine was increased to maintain a 3:1 ratio of digestible lysine:methionine (total dietary+infusion). Milk protein yield was increased by the ARG+ compared with the CTL treatment and deletion of Arg in the infusate (ARG-) did not impair this response. Deletion of Arg from the EAA mixture decreased the mammary uptake of Arg relative to that of the CTL treatment, and although the uptake:output ratio decreased from 2.52 (ARG+) to 2.12 (ARG-), it was still largely in excess of Arg secretion in milk protein. Otherwise, Arg deletion did not affect any of the measured parameters (no significant difference between ARG- and ARG+) except Arg and urea arterial concentrations. In support of the increased yields of milk protein and lactose, mammary uptake of the group 2 AA (, Leu, Lys, and Val) increased and the uptake:output ratio tended to increase from 1.04 to 1.23. The mammary uptake:milk protein output ratio was not different from 1 and not different among treatments for the group 1 AA (His, Met, Phe+, Trp). Mammary uptake of energetic substrates did not vary across treatments, although milk lactose yield increased with the ARG+ treatment relative to CTL. These results indicate that deletion of Arg has minimal effects on milk and milk component yields when the remaining EAA are supplied in sufficient amounts despite decreased mammary Arg uptake and that group 2 AA seem to be involved in the mammary gland to support the lactose yield response to EAA infusion.Copyright Â© 2011 American Dairy Science Association.

Knowledge-based potential functions are one type of the energy functions which can be obtained from known protein structures. The pairwise potential between atom types is approximated using Boltzmann's law which relates the frequency of atom types to its potential. The total energy is approximated as a summation of pairwise potential between the atomic pairs. In the present study, the performance of knowledge-based potential function was assessed based on the strength of interaction between groups of amino acids. The dominant energies involved in the pairwise potentials were revealed by eigenvalue analysis of the matrix, the elements of which represent the energy between amino acids. For this purpose, the matrix including the mean of the energies of residue-residue interaction types was constructed using 500 native protein structures. The matrix has a dominant eigenvalue and amino acids, with LEU, VAL, , PHE, , ALA and TRP having high values along the dominant eigenvector. The results show that the ranking of amino acids is consistent with the power of amino acids in discriminating native structures using K-alphabet reduced model. In the reduced interactions, only amino acids from a subset of all 20 amino acids, along with their interactions are considered to assess the energy. In the K-alphabet reduced model, the reduced structures are constructed based on only the K-amino acid types. The dominant K-alphabet reduced model derived for the k-first amino acids in the list [LEU, VAL, PHE, , , ALA, TRP] of amino acids has the best discrimination of native structure among all possible K-alphabet reduced models.

VacA exhibits pleiotropic actions in gastroduodenal disorders via its specific receptors. Recently, we found that VacA induced the phosphorylation of cellular Src kinase (Src) at Tyr418 in AZ-521 cells. Silencing of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP)α, a VacA receptor, reduced VacA-induced Src phosphorylation. Src is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA at its Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) variant C (EPIYA-C) motif in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, resulting in binding of CagA to SHP-2 phosphatase. Challenging AZ-521 cells with wild-type H. pylori induced phosphorylation of CagA, but this did not occur when challenged with a vacA gene-disrupted mutant strain. CagA phosphorylation was observed in cells infected with a vacA gene-disrupted mutant strain after addition of purified VacA, suggesting that VacA is required for H. pylori-induced CagA phosphorylation. Following siRNA-mediated RPTPα knockdown in AZ-521 cells, infection with wild-type H. pylori and treatment with VacA did not induce CagA phosphorylation. Taken together, these results support our conclusion that VacA mediates CagA phosphorylation through RPTPα in AZ-521 cells. These data indicate the possibility that Src phosphorylation induced by VacA is mediated through RPTPα, resulting in activation of Src, leading to CagA phosphorylation at Tyr972 in AZ-521 cells.© 2016.

The functions of protein-RNA complexes are dictated by their interactions, binding, stability, and affinity. In this work, we have identified the key residues (KRs), which are involved in both stability and binding. We found that 42 percent of considered proteins share common binding and stabilizing residues, whereas these residues are distinct in 58 percent of the proteins. Overall, 5 percent of stabilizing and 3 percent of binding residues serve as key residues. These residues are enriched with the combination of polar, charged, aliphatic, and aromatic residues. Analysis on subclasses of protein-RNA complexes based on protein structural class, function and RNA type showed that regulatory proteins, and complexes with single stranded RNA and rRNA have appreciable number of key residues. Specifically, Arg, , and Thr are preferred in most of the subclasses of protein-RNA complexes. In addition, residues with similar chemical behavior have different preferences to be KRs, such that Arg, , Val, and Thr are preferred over Lys, Trp, , and Ser, respectively. Atomic level contacts revealed that charged and polar-nonpolar contacts are dominant in enzymes, polar in structural, and nonpolar in regulatory proteins. On the other hand, polar-nonpolar contacts are enriched in all these classes of protein-RNA complexes. Further, the influence of sequence and structural features such as conservation score, surrounding hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and long-range order in key residues are also discussed.

The experiments of single β-amino acid incorporation into a peptide revealed that 13 β-amino acids are compatible with ribosomal translation. Six of the tested β-amino acids (βhGly, l-βhAla, l-βhGln, l-βhPhg, l-βhMet, and d-βhPhg) showed high incorporation efficiencies, and seven (l-βhLeu, l-βhIle, l-βhAsn, l-βhPhe, l-βhLys, d-βhAla, and d-βhLeu) showed moderate incorporation efficiencies; whereas no full-length peptide was produced using other β-amino acids (l-βhPro, l-βhTrp, and l-βhGlu).

Seven residues, located on one face of a model alpha-helix spanning residues 59-75, are fully conserved in apoCII from ten different animal species. We have mutated these residues one by one. Substitution of Ala(59) by glycine, or Thr(62) and Gly(65) by alanine did not change the activation, indicating that these residues are outside the LPL-binding site. Replacement of (63), (66), Asp(69), or Gln(70) by alanine lowered the affinity for LPL and the catalytic activity of the LPL-apoCII complex. For each residue several additional replacements were made. Most mutants retained some activating ability, but replacement of (63) by phenylalanine or tryptophan and Gln(70) by glutamate caused almost complete loss of activity. All mutants bound to liposomes with similar affinity as wild-type apoCII, and they also bound with similar affinity to LPL in the absence of hydrolyzable lipids. However, the inactive mutants did not compete with wild-type apoCII in the activation assay. Therefore, we conclude that the productive apoCII-LPL interaction may be dependent on substrate molecules. In summary, our data demonstrate that residues 63, 66, 69, and 70 are of special importance for the function of apoCII, but no single amino acid residue is absolutely crucial.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h2><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys--Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala--226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala--226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, Lys-Arg-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser-Met-Thr-Asp-Phe--His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and Lys-Thr-Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser-Phe-Phe-Thr-Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively.

We investigated the role of (B26), a conserved aromatic residue at this interface. To probe the evolutionary basis for such conservation, we constructed 18 variants at B26. Surprisingly, non-aromatic polar or charged side chains (such as Glu, Ser, or ornithine (Orn)) conferred high activity, whereas the weakest-binding analogs contained Val, , and Leu substitutions. Modeling of variant complexes suggested that the B26 side chains pack within a shallow depression at the solvent-exposed periphery of the interface. This interface would disfavor large aliphatic side chains. The analogs with highest activity exhibited reduced thermodynamic stability and heightened susceptibility to fibrillation. Perturbed self-assembly was also demonstrated in studies of the charged variants (Orn and Glu); indeed, the Glu(B26) analog exhibited aberrant aggregation in either the presence or absence of zinc ions. Thus, although (B26) is part of insulin's receptor-binding surface, our results suggest that its conservation has been enjoined by the aromatic ring's contributions to native stability and self-assembly. We envisage that such classical structural relationships reflect the implicit threat of toxic misfolding (rather than hormonal function at the receptor level) as a general evolutionary determinant of extant protein sequences.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21866908>Volumetric characterization of interactions of glycine betaine with protein groups.</a></h2><p>We report the partial molar volumes and adiabatic compressibilities of N-acetyl amino acid amides and oligoglycines at glycine betaine (GB) concentrations ranging from 0 to 4 M. We use these results to evaluate the volumetric contributions of amino acid side chains and the glycyl unit (-CH(2)CONH-) as a function of GB concentration. We analyze the resulting GB dependences within the framework of a statistical thermodynamic model and evaluate the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which a GB molecule binds each of the functionalities under study replacing four water molecules. We calculate the free  of the transfer of functional groups from water to concentrated GB solutions, ΔG(tr), as the sum of a change in the free  of cavity formation, ΔΔG(C), and the differential free  of solute-solvent interactions, ΔΔG(I), in a concentrated GB solution and water. Our results suggest that the transfer free , ΔG(tr), results from a fine balance between the large ΔΔG(C) and ΔΔG(I) contributions. The range of the magnitudes and the shape of the GB dependence of ΔG(tr) depend on the identity of a specific solute group. The interplay between ΔΔG(C) and ΔΔG(I) results in pronounced maxima in the GB dependences of ΔG(tr) for the Val, Leu, , Trp, , and Gln side chains as well as the glycyl unit.

The producer strain, designated OSY-I1, was determined to be Brevibacillus laterosporusvia morphological, biochemical, and genetic analyses. The antimicrobial agent was extracted from cells of OSY-I1 with isopropanol, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and structurally analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The MS and NMR results, taken together, uncovered a linear lipopeptide consisting of 13 amino acids and an N-terminal C6 fatty acid (FA) chain, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid. The lipopeptide (FA-Dhb-Leu-Orn---Val-Lys-Val-Val-Lys--Leu-valinol, where Dhb is α,β-didehydrobutyric acid and valinol is 2-amino-3-methyl-1-butanol) has a molecular mass of 1,583.0794 Da and contains three modified amino acid residues: α,β-didehydrobutyric acid, ornithine, and valinol. The compound, designated brevibacillin, was determined to be a member of a cationic lipopeptide antibiotic family. In addition to its potency against drug-resistant bacteria, brevibacillin also exhibited low MICs (1 to 8 μg/ml) against selected foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes,Bacillus cereus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Purified brevibacillin showed no sign of degradation when it was held at 80 °C for 60 min, and it retained at least 50% of its antimicrobial activity when it was held for 22 h under acidic or alkaline conditions. On the basis of these findings, brevibacillin is a potent antimicrobial lipopeptide which is potentially useful to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less Lys and Thr than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free Lys-Thr-Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, , Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, Lys, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for  serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum , Leu, Thr, and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of , Leu, Met, Thr, and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and  were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as  and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Plants and/or fungi can catabolize JA into the bioactive jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-) that in turn activates the JA--pathway in planta. To extend our knowledge on JA-derivates related to natural occurring JA conjugates, N-[(-)-jasmonyl]-S-tyrosin (JA-) and the ester JA-Sei between JA and seiridin, a fungal disubstituted furanone, were synthesized. The classical procedures for ester synthesis were applied for compound JA-Sei, while N-[(-)-jasmonyl]-S-tyrosin was synthesized with an optimized procedure. JA- and JA-Sei were characterized by spectroscopic method (essentially 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS) and their stereochemical composition was determined by means of HPLC and circular dichroism analysis. Finally, the activity of these JA-derivates was analyzed in planta. JA- and JA-Sei trigger JA-regulated plant responses, such as protein degradation and growth inhibition. These effects require the conversion of JA into JA- and its recognition by the plant JA- perception complex COI1-JAZ. Overall, these data suggest a mode-of-action of JA- and JA-Sei as inactive pool of JA that can be transformed into the bioactive JA- to induce the canonical JA--pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and  show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and  to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, Asn, Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and Lys the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, , Trp and Phe prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free  values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662934>Identification of lipopeptide isoforms by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS based on the simultaneous purification of iturin, fengycin, and surfactin by RP-HPLC.</a></h2><p>A three-stage linear gradient strategy using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was optimized for rapid, high-quality, and simultaneous purification of the lipopeptide isoforms of iturin, fengycin, and surfactin, which may differ in composition by only a single amino acid and/or the fatty acid residue.

Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, , and Phe, and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, Val, , Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and gluconeogenesis with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively).

Because monophyly of the family Xenosauridae (Shinisaurus and Xenosaurus) is statistically rejected, we recommend placing Shinisaurus in a separate family, the Shinisauridae. The family Anniellidae and the anguid subfamilies Gerrhonotinae and Anguinae each form monophyletic groups receiving statistical support. The Diploglossinae*, which appears monophyletic, is retained as a metataxon (denoted with an asterisk) because its monophyly is statistically neither supported nor rejected. The family Anguidae appears monophyletic in analyses of the DNA sequence data, and statistical support for its monophyly is provided by reanalysis of previously published allozymic data. Anguid lizards appear to have had a northern origin in Laurasia. Taxa currently located on Gondwanan plates arrived there by dispersal from the north in two separate events, one from the West Indies to South America and another from a Laurasian plate to Morocco. Because basal anguine lineages are located in western Eurasia and Morocco, formation of the Atlantic Ocean (late Eocene) is implicated in the separation of the Anguinae from its North American sister taxon, the Gerrhonotinae. Subsequent dispersal of anguine lizards to East Asia and North America appears to have followed the Oligocene drying of the Turgai Sea. The alternative hypothesis, that anguine lizards originated in North America and dispersed to Asia via the Bering land bridge with subsequent  of Europe and Morocco, requires a phylogenetic tree seven steps longer than the most parsimonious hypothesis. North African, European, and West Asian anguines were isolated from others by the rapid uplift of Tibet in the late Oligocene to Miocene. Phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary changes in the gene encoding tRNA(Cys) suggests gradual reduction of dihydrouridine (D) stems by successive deletion of bases in some lineages. This evolutionary pattern contrasts with the one observed for parallel elimination of the D-stem in mitochondrial tRNAs of eight other reptile groups, in which replication slippage produces direct repeats. An unusual, enlarged TpsiC (T) stem is inferred for tRNA(Cys) in most species.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11790849>Solution structure of a K(+)-channel blocker from the scorpion Tityus cambridgei.</a></h2><p>A new K(+)-channel blocking peptide identified from the scorpion venom of Tityus cambridgei (Tc1) is composed of 23 amino acid residues linked with three disulfide bridges. Tc1 is the shortest known toxin from scorpion venom that recognizes the Shaker B K(+) channels and the voltage-dependent K(+) channels in the brain. Synthetic Tc1 was produced using solid-phase synthesis, and its activity was found to be the same as that of native Tc1. The pairings of three disulfide bridges in the synthetic Tc1 were identified by NMR experiments. The NMR solution structures of Tc1 were determined by simulated annealing and -minimization calculations using the X-PLOR program. The results showed that Tc1 contains an alpha-helix and a 3(10)-helix at N-terminal Gly(4)-Lys(10) and a double-stranded beta-sheet at Gly(13)-(16) and Arg(19)-(23), with a type I' beta-turn at Asn(17)-Gly(18). Superposition of each structure with the best structure yielded an average root mean square deviation of 0.26 +/- 0.05 A for the backbone atoms and of 1.40 +/- 0.23 A for heavy atoms in residues 2 to 23. The three-dimensional structure of Tc1 was compared with two structurally and functionally related scorpion toxins, charybdotoxin (ChTx) and noxiustoxin (NTx). We concluded that the C-terminal structure is the most important region for the blocking activity of voltage-gated (Kv-type) channels for scorpion K(+)-channel blockers. We also found that some of the residues in the larger scorpion K(+)-channel blockers (31 to 40 amino acids) are not involved in K(+)-channel blocking activity.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504604>Nutrient digestibility of soybean products in grower-finisher pigs.</a></h2><p>Solvent extraction of soybean creates soybean meal (SBM), but an array of other soybean products can be created using further processing of SBM or soybean. For accurate inclusion of these products in pig feed, characterization of digestible AA profile and  value is required. Soybean products from processes such as extrusion (EX) of soybean and thermo-mechanical (TM) treatment, bioconversion using fermentation or enzymes (BC), and ethanol-water extraction (EW) of soybean meal were collected together with SBM. These 9 soybean products were tested in cornstarch-based diets together with an N-free diet for a total of 10 diets. Ten ileal-cannulated barrows (30.4 ± 0.7 kg initial BW) were fed 10 diets at 2.8 times maintenance DE for six 9-day periods with a 6 (periods) × 10 (pigs) Youden square. The control SBM contained 47.0% CP, 1.4% ether extract, and ADF 6.0%. The 9 soybean products contained 35.6 to 66.4% CP, 0.9 to 21.6% ether extract, and 4.4 to 8.0% ADF. The EW soybean products were high in CP (> 61%), whereas the 2 EX soybean products were low in CP (< 36%) but high in ether extract (≥ 19%). Chemically-available Lys ranged from 92.6 to 100% of total Lys, indicating that minor Lys damage occurred during processing. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of  was lower (P < 0.05) for soybean products with greater ether extract and ADF content than SBM, and varied among soybean products. The standardized ileal digestibility (SID) did not differ (P > 0.05) among soybean products for most AA, except for lower SID of Arg, , Leu, Lys, Phe, and  (P < 0.05) for EX2 and BC1 than other soybean products. The DE and predicted NE value did not differ (P > 0.05) among soybean products. The greater SID AA content (P < 0.05) in EW, BC, and TM1 soybean products than SBM was mainly a result of greater total AA content due to removal of other macronutrients. In conclusion, extrusion of soybean creates soybean products with a greater  value but lower ATTD of  and lower SID AA content than SBM. Further processing of SBM creates soybean products with greater CP and SID AA content but similar SID of AA than SBM. Thus, new technologies to process SBM or soybean create high value ingredients to be included in pig diets, especially for young pigs with high nutritional requirements.© The Author(s) 2019.

III. The denaturational thermodynamics of the holoenzyme with single-site mutations in the catalytic chain.</a></h2><p>Aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2) from E. coli is a multimeric enzyme consisting of two catalytic subunits and three regulatory subunits whose activity is regulated by subunit interactions. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) scans of the wild-type enzyme consist of two peaks, each comprised of at least two components, corresponding to denaturation of the catalytic and regulatory subunits within the intact holoenzyme (Vickers et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253 (1978) 8493; Edge et al., Biochemistry 27 (1988) 8081). We have examined the effects of nine single-site mutations in the catalytic chains. Three of the mutations (Asp-100-Gly, Glu-86-Gln, and Arg-269-Gly) are at sites at the C1: C2 interface between c chains within the catalytic subunit. These mutations disrupt salt linkages present in both the T and R states of the molecule (Honzatko et al., J. Mol. Biol. 160 (1982) 219; Krause et al., J. Mol. Biol. 193 (1987) 527). The remainder (Lys-164-, -165-Phe, Glu-239-Gln, Glu-239-Ala, -240-Phe and Asp-271-Ser) are at the C1: C4 interface between catalytic subunits and are involved in interactions which stabilize either the T or R state. DSC scans of all of the mutants except Asp-100-Gly and Arg-269-Gly consisted of two peaks. At intermediate concentrations, Asp-100-Gly and Arg-269-Gly had only a single peak near the Tm of the regulatory subunit transition in the holoenzyme, although their denaturational profiles were more complex at high and low protein concentrations. The catalytic subunits of Glu-86-Gln, Lys-164- and Asp-271-Ser appear to be significantly destabilized relative to wild-type protein while -165-Phe and -240-Phe appear to be stabilized. Values of delta delta G degree cr, the difference between the subunit interaction  of wild-type and mutant proteins, evaluated as suggested by Brandts et al. (Biochemistry 28 (1989) 8588) range from -3.7 kcal mol-1 for Glu-86-Gln to 2.4 kcal mol-1 for -165-Phe.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963389>Identification of a novel amino acid racemase from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3 induced by D-amino acids.</a></h2><p>To date, there have been few reports analyzing the amino acid requirement for growth of hyperthermophilic archaea. We here found that the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3 requires Thr, Leu, Val, Phe, , Trp, His and Arg in the medium for growth, and shows slow growth in medium lacking Met or . This largely corresponds to the presence, or absence, of genes related to amino acid biosynthesis in its genome, though there are exceptions. The amino acid requirements were dramatically lost by addition of D-isomers of Met, Leu, Val, allo-, Phe, , Trp and Arg. Tracer analysis using (14)C-labeled D-Trp showed that D-Trp in the medium was used as a protein component in the cells, suggesting the presence of D-amino acid  enzymes. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent racemase activity toward Met, Leu and Phe was detected in crude extract of P. horikoshii and was enhanced in cells grown in the medium supplemented with D-amino acids, especially D-allo-. The gene encoding the racemase was narrowed down to one open reading frame on the basis of enzyme purification from P. horikoshii cells, and the recombinant enzyme exhibited PLP-dependent racemase activity toward several amino acids, including Met, Leu and Phe, but not Pro, Asp or Glu. This is the first report showing the presence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon of a PLP-dependent amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity that is likely responsible for utilization of D-amino acids for growth.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380619>Effects of ileal digesta collection time on standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and distiller's dried grains with solubles fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the minimum collection time needed to obtain representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets. Eight barrows with an initial BW of 34.6 kg (SD 2.1) were individually fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 diets and 4 periods per square. Three diets contained corn, soybean meal (SBM), or distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) as the sole source of CP. An N-free diet was also prepared. All diets contained 0.5% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Equal meals were provided at 0800 and 2000 h. Ileal digesta samples were collected in 2-h intervals from 0800 to 2000 h during the last 3 d of each 7-d period. When pigs were fed the corn diet, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of most indispensable AA and dispensable AA increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during each of the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal digesta samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h or from 1600 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the SBM diet, the SID of , Leu, Thr, Trp, Val, Ala, and Cys increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) but the SID of all other AA linearly decreased ( < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of almost all AA were greater ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 0800 to 1000 h, from 0800 to 1200 h, from 1000 to 1400 h, or from 0800 to 1400 h but less ( < 0.05) if collected from 1600 to 1800 h, from 1800 to 2000 h, from 1600 to 2000 h, or from 1400 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the DDGS-based diet, the SID of , Leu, Lys, Phe, Trp, Val, and  increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. In conclusion, diurnal variations in SID of AA in pigs indicate that 6 h of ileal sample collection starting 4 or 6 h after feeding may provide representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26981137>The Dipeptides - and Ser- Exert Distinct Effects on Catecholamine  in the Mouse Brainstem.</a></h2><p>Catecholamine synthesis and transmission in the brain are influenced by the availability of  in the body.

The occurrence of Phe-Leu-Gly motif characteristic for the amino acid sequence of the primate immuno-deficiency viruses fusion peptides is analysed in various proteins, as well as tripeptide fragments of general formula Xaa-Xah-Gly (Xaa-Phe, ; Xab-hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu, ) homologous to the above motif and retro-sequences Gly-Xab-Xaa. These tripeptide repeats are characteristic for the amino acid sequences of complex membrane proteins, viral envelope proteins, proteinases and proteins connected with  transfer or interacting with lipids. These repeats are frequently met in conservative regions of amino acid sequences, in sites readily accessible for other molecules at the boundary of or between structured fragments, this being due to the backbone semi-coiled form's preference in the given amino acid fragment.

Herein, the generation of well-defined scaffolds of Gly---Gly-Ser-Arg (GYIGSR) peptide-functionalized poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) aligned nanofibers are used to accelerate the neural lineage commitment and differentiation of D3 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Gene expression trends and immunocytochemistry analysis were similar to laminin-coated glass, and indicated an earlier differentiation progression than D3 mESCs on laminin. Further, GYIGSR-functionalized nanofiber substrates yielded an increased gene expression of Sox1, a neural progenitor cell marker, and Tubb3, Cdh2, Syp, neuronal cell markers, at early time points. In addition, guidance of neurites was found to parallel the fiber direction. We demonstrate the fabrication of a well-defined, xeno-free functional nanofiber scaffold and demonstrates its use as a surrogate for xenogenic and complex matrixes currently used for the neural differentiation of stem cells ex vivo.In this paper, we report the use of GYIGSR-functionalized poly(ε-caprolactone) aligned nanofibers as a tool to accelerate the neural lineage commitment and differentiation of D3 mouse embryonic stem cells. The results indicate that functional nanofiber substrates promote faster differentiation than laminin coated substrates. The data suggest that aligned nanofibers and post-electrospinning surface modification with bioactive species can be combined to produce translationally relevant xeno-free substrates for stem cell therapy. Future development efforts are focused on additional bioactive species that are able to function as surrogates for other xenogenic factors found in differentiation media.Copyright © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

Resistance to these classes of antimicrobials has increased significantly in the recent years. However, little is known on the genetic basis of resistance to these drugs in  isolates from Ethiopia. isolates with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams ( = 43) were tested for genes encoding for beta-lactamase enzymes, and those resistant to quinolones ( = 29) for mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) as well as plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes using PCR and sequencing.Beta-lactamase genes () were detected in 34 (79.1%) of the isolates. The dominant  gene was TEM, recovered from 33 (76.7%) of the isolates, majority being TEM-1 (24, 72.7%) followed by TEM-57, (10, 30.3%). The OXA-10 and CTX-M-15 were detected only in a single  Concord human isolate. Double substitutions in A (Ser83-Phe + Asp87-Gly) as well as C (Thr57-Ser + Ser80-) subunits of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) were detected in all  Kentucky isolates with high level resistance to both nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Single amino acid substitutions, Ser83-Phe ( = 4) and Ser83- ( = 1) were also detected in the A gene. An isolate of . Miami susceptible to nalidixic acid but intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin had Thr57-Ser and an additional novel mutation (Tyr83-Phe) in the C gene. Plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes investigated were not detected in any of the isolates. In some isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid, no mutations in QRDR or PMQR genes were detected. Over half of the quinolone resistant isolates in the current study 17 (58.6%) were also resistant to at least one of the beta-lactam antimicrobials.Acquisition of TEM was the principal beta-lactamase resistance mechanism and mutations within QRDR of A and C were the primary mechanism for resistance to quinolones.

While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity.Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, , Leu, Val, Trp, , Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased.These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity.

CDI(+) bacteria deliver the toxic C-terminal region of contact-dependent inhibition A proteins (CdiA-CT) into neighboring target bacteria and produce CDI immunity proteins (CdiI) to protect against self-inhibition. The CdiA-CT(EC536) deployed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli 536 (EC536) is a bacterial toxin 28 (Ntox28) domain that only exhibits ribonuclease activity when bound to the cysteine biosynthetic enzyme O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (CysK). Here, we present crystal structures of the CysK/CdiA-CT(EC536) binary complex and the neutralized ternary complex of CysK/CdiA-CT/CdiI(EC536) CdiA-CT(EC536) inserts its C-terminal Gly--Gly- peptide tail into the active-site cleft of CysK to anchor the interaction. Remarkably, E. coli serine O-acetyltransferase uses a similar Gly-Asp-Gly- motif to form the "cysteine synthase" complex with CysK. The cysteine synthase complex is found throughout bacteria, protozoa, and plants, indicating that CdiA-CT(EC536) exploits a highly conserved protein-protein interaction to promote its toxicity. CysK significantly increases CdiA-CT(EC536) thermostability and is required for toxin interaction with tRNA substrates. These observations suggest that CysK stabilizes the toxin fold, thereby organizing the nuclease active site for substrate recognition and catalysis. By contrast, Ntox28 domains from Gram-positive bacteria lack C-terminal Gly--Gly- motifs, suggesting that they do not interact with CysK. We show that the Ntox28 domain from Ruminococcus lactaris is significantly more thermostable than CdiA-CT(EC536), and its intrinsic tRNA-binding properties support CysK-independent nuclease activity. The striking differences between related Ntox28 domains suggest that CDI toxins may be under evolutionary pressure to maintain low global stability.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1518799>NMR docking of a substrate into the X-ray structure of staphylococcal nuclease.</a></h2><p>The conformation of the staphylococcal nuclease-bound metal-dTdA complex, previously determined by NMR methods [Weber, D.J., Mullen, G.P., Mildvan, A.S.

The molecular docking study was carried out using Vina docking protocol. Finally, the receptor-ligand interaction analysis was carried out using the Discovery Studio Client package. Quercetin and diosgenin of onion showed favorable binding with NRP-1 with low binding energy of -7.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in comparison with the control inhibitor (-6.1 kcal/mol). The study suggests that ligand interaction with the residues Asp 48, Thr 44, Thr 77,  81, Trp29,  143 of NRP-1 and Lys 653, Phe 765, Ser 763, Thr 699,  683 of Eph might be critical for the inhibitory activity of these receptors. The study provides evidence for consideration of quercetin and diosgenin of onion as valuable small ligand molecules for targeting NRP-1 receptor in treatment and prevention of neurological disorders as well as cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173542>Interaction between dietary bioactive peptides of short length and bile salts in submicellar or micellar state.</a></h2><p>Bile salts act as steroidal detergents in the gut, and could also interact with peptides and improve their bioavailability, although the mechanism is unclear. The occurrence of direct interaction between milk bioactive peptides, -Asn--Trp, Leu-Asp-Gln-Trp, and Leu-Gln-Lys-Trp, and different bile salts in the submicellar or micellar state was investigated by intrinsic fluorescence measurement and dynamic light scattering, above the critical micellar concentration, the latter being determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The peptides form aggregates, spontaneously. In the presence of bile salts, some released peptide monomers were bound to the micellar surface. The lack of hydrogen bonding involving the C12OH group of the steroid skeleton, and the acidic function of some bile salts, might promote the interaction with the peptides, as could the lack of the C12OH group, rather than that of the C7OH group. At submicellar concentrations, sodium taurochenodeoxycholate and taurodeoxycholate readily interacted with the most hydrophobic peptide -Asn--Trp.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Supplementation of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) has been suggested as an alternative dietary treatment strategy to optimize neurocognitive outcome in phenylketonuria and has been shown to influence 3 brain pathobiochemical mechanisms in phenylketonuria, but its optimal composition has not been established.In order to provide additional pathobiochemical insight and develop optimal LNAA treatment, several targeted LNAA supplements were investigated with respect to all 3 biochemical disturbances underlying brain dysfunction in phenylketonuria.Pah-enu2 (PKU) mice received 1 of 5 different LNAA-supplemented diets beginning at postnatal day 45. Control groups included phenylketonuria mice receiving an isonitrogenic and isocaloric high-protein diet or the AIN-93M diet, and wild-type mice receiving the AIN-93M diet. After 6 wk, brain and plasma amino acid profiles and brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations were measured.Brain Phe concentrations were most effectively reduced by supplementation of LNAAs, such as Leu and , with a strong affinity for the LNAA transporter type 1. Brain non-Phe LNAAs could be restored on supplementation, but unbalanced LNAA supplementation further reduced brain concentrations of those LNAAs that were not (sufficiently) included in the LNAA supplement. To optimally ameliorate brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations, LNAA supplementation should include  and Trp together with LNAAs that effectively reduce brain Phe concentrations. The requirement for  supplementation is higher than it is for Trp, and the relative effect of brain Phe reduction is higher for serotonin than it is for dopamine and norepinephrine.The study shows that all 3 biochemical disturbances underlying brain dysfunction in phenylketonuria can be targeted by specific LNAA supplements. The study thus provides essential information for the development of optimal LNAA supplementation as an alternative dietary treatment strategy to optimize neurocognitive outcome in patients with phenylketonuria.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20630242>Changes in production and mammary metabolism of dairy cows in response to essential and nonessential amino acid infusions.</a></h2><p>This study was undertaken to increase our understanding of the need of the mammary gland for the different types of AA and how the mammary gland alters its metabolism in response to a variable AA supply. Eight lactating Holstein cows (61+/-4 DIM) were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square balanced for residual effects with 14-d periods. The diet was formulated to supply 100% of the net  requirement and 72% of the metabolizable protein requirement. The 4 treatments were 1) abomasal infusions of water, 2) essential AA at 359 g/d, 3) nonessential AA at 356 g/d, and 4) essential AA at 359 g/d+nonessential AA at 356 g/d (total of 715 g/d). The infusates had the same AA profile as casein with the exception that Met was increased to maintain a 3:1 ratio of digestible Lys to Met and because of solubility limitations all the  was replaced by Phe and part of the Glu was replaced by Gln. Milk yield and milk protein yield were increased by the essential AA treatments compared with the other treatments. Mammary uptake of beta-hydroxybutyrate plus lactate tended to increase with the essential AA treatments, whereas glucose mammary uptake tended to be higher with the nonessential AA treatments. With the essential AA treatments, the mammary uptake:milk protein output ratio for the group 1 AA (His, Met, Phe, Trp, and ) did not differ from 1 but tended to increase; the ratio for the group 2 AA (, Leu, Lys, and Val) did increase, significantly exceeding unity when essential AA were infused. These results indicate that the mammary gland alters differently its uptake of both AA and -yielding nutrients in response to the amount and profile of AA presented to it and that even under situations of protein deficiency nonessential AA supplementation does not enhance milk and milk protein synthesis.Copyright  (c) 2010 American Dairy Science Association.

Accurate prediction of functional PTS1 sequences and their relative strength by computational methods is essential for determination of peroxisomal proteomes in silico but has proved challenging due to high levels of sequence variability of non-canonical targeting signals, particularly in higher plants, and low levels of availability of experimentally validated non-canonical examples. In this study, in silico predictions were compared with in vivo targeting analyses and in vitro thermodynamic binding of mutated variants within the context of one model targeting sequence. There was broad agreement between the methods for entire PTS1 domains and position-specific single amino acid residues, including residues upstream of the PTS1 tripeptide. The hierarchy Leu>Met>>Val at the C-terminal position was determined for all methods but both experimental approaches suggest that  is underweighted in the prediction algorithm due to the absence of this residue in the positive training dataset. A combination of methods better defines the score range that discriminates a functional PTS1. In vitro binding to the PEX5 receptor could discriminate among strong targeting signals while in vivo targeting assays were more sensitive, allowing detection of weak functional import signals that were below the limit of detection in the binding assay. Together, the data provide a comprehensive assessment of the factors driving PTS1 efficacy and provide a framework for the more quantitative assessment of the protein import pathway in higher plants.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Binding of pVHL to HIF-1alpha is dependent on hydroxylation of specific proline residues by O(2)-dependent prolyl 4-hydroxylases. Upon exposure to hypoxia the hydroxylase activity is inhibited, resulting in stabilization of HIF-1alpha protein levels and activation of transcription of target genes. One of the two critical proline residues, Pro(563) in mouse HIF-1alpha, is located within a bifunctional domain, the N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD), which mediates both pVHL-dependent degradation at normoxia and transcriptional activation at hypoxia. Here we have identified two N-TAD residues, (564) and (565), which, in addition to Pro(563), were critical for pVHL-mediated degradation at normoxia. We have also identified D568A/D569A/D570A, F571A, and L573A as mutations of the N-TAD that abrogated binding to pVHL both in vitro and in vivo, and constitutively stabilized N-TAD against degradation. Moreover, the mutations Y564G, L556A/L558A, and F571A/L573A drastically reduced the transactivation function of either the isolated N-TAD or full-length HIF-1alpha in hypoxic cells. Interestingly, the P563A mutant exhibited a constitutively active and potent transactivation function that was enhanced by functional interaction with the transcriptional coactivator protein CREB-binding protein.

Our objectives were to compare the effect of supplying an "ideal" EAA profile (EAA+) with an imbalanced AA profile (control) at 2 levels of PDIE/NE(L) (net energy for lactation) supplies to study the interaction between PDIE and AA profiles, and to compare this ideal profile with a simple mixture of the 4 most deficient EAA (4 EAA) in the diets of dairy cows. Six lactating multiparous Holstein cows received 6 treatments with 2 different levels of PDIE supplied by diets and AA infusions in the duodenum according to a changeover design with 3-wk periods. Within each PDIE supply level, the cows received 3 different AA infusions in the duodenum according to a 3×3 Latin square design with 1-wk subperiods, which corresponded to the following treatment groups: control (Glu), 4EAA (Lys, Met, His, Leu), and EAA+ (4 EAA plus , Val, Phe, Trp, and ). In the low and high PDIE treatments, diets and infusions provided 54.7 and 64.0 g/Mcal of PDIE/NE(L), respectively, which corresponded to crude protein levels of 13.6 and 15.2%, respectively. High-PDIE supplies increased the milk protein yield by 163 g/d, the milk protein content by 1.4 g/kg, the milk yield by 4.1 kg/d, and the lactose yield by 178 g/d and decreased the PDIE efficiency of utilization by 12.4%, whereas the N efficiency of utilization remained unaffected. Supplying the 2 EAA profiles (4EAA and EAA+) increased the milk protein yield by 67 g/d, the milk protein content by 1.3g/kg, and the milk yield by 0.9 kg/d, whereas the milk fat and milk lactose contents were decreased by 2.4 and 1.6g/kg, respectively. The responses regarding milk yield and its composition were similar whether the cows received the 4 EAA or the EAA+ treatment. The responses were similar for the milk yield and composition whether the EAA were supplied by low- or high-PDIE supplies. In conclusion, the efficiency of PDIE utilization was improved by 6.6% and the N efficiency was improved by 7.0% by correcting the EAA profiles, independent of the level of PDIE supplied. In addition, the increased efficiency observed, associated with provision of the 4 EAA, was similar to the provision of all EAA (EAA+) in this experiment.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

The major fragmentation reaction involves cleavage of the second amide bond (counting from the N-terminus) except for Xaa = Ser and Thr where elimination of H(2)O from the [M + 2H](+2) ion forms the base peak. In general, the extent of cleavage of the second amide bond shows little dependence on the identity of Xaa and little dependence on whether the bond cleavage involves symmetrical bond cleavage to form a y(5)/b(2) ion pair or asymmetrically to form y (5) (+2) and a neutral b(2) species. Notable exceptions to this generalization occur for Xaa equal to Pro or Sar. For Xaa = Pro only cleavage of the second amide bond is observed, consistent with a pronounced proline effect, i.e., cleavage N-terminal to Pro. When Xaa = Sar considerably enhanced cleavage of the second amide bond also is observed, suggesting that at least part of the proline effect relates to the tertiary nature of the amide nitrogen. In the competition between symmetric and asymmetric bond cleavage an attempt to establish a linear free  correlation in relating ln(y(5)(+2)/y(5)) to PA(H-Xaa-OH) did not lead to a reasonable correlation although the trend of increasing y(5)(+2)/y(5) ratio with increasing proton affinity of H-Xaa-OH was clear.

We previously demonstrated a pair of mutations that are required to enable the prosthetic heme group to bind O2 reversibly: (i) -142-->His, which is axially coordinated to the central Fe2+ ion of the heme, and (ii) -161-->Phe or Leu, which makes the sixth coordinate position available for ligand interactions [I142H/Y161F (HF) or I142H/Y161L (HL)]. Here we describe additional new mutations designed to manipulate the architecture of the heme pocket in rHSA-heme complexes by specifically altering distal amino acids. We show that introduction of a third mutation on the distal side of the heme (at position Leu-185, Leu-182, or Arg-186) can modulate the O2 binding equilibrium. The coordination structures and ligand (O2 and CO) binding properties of nine rHSA(triple mutant)-heme complexes have been physicochemically and kinetically characterized. Several substitutions were severely detrimental to O2 binding: for example, Gln-185, His-185, and His-182 all generated a weak six-coordinate heme, while the rHSA(HF/R186H)-heme complex possessed a typical bis-histidyl hemochrome that was immediately autoxidized by O2. In marked contrast, HSA(HL/L185N)-heme showed very high O2 binding affinity (P1/2O2 1 Torr, 22 degrees C), which is 18-fold greater than that of the original double mutant rHSA(HL)-heme and very close to the affinities exhibited by myoglobin and the high-affinity form of Hb. Introduction of Asn at position 185 enhances O2 binding primarily by reducing the O2 dissociation rate constant. Replacement of polar Arg-186 with Leu or Phe increased the hydrophobicity of the distal environment, yielded a complex with reduced O2 binding affinity (P1/2O2 9-10 Torr, 22 degrees C), which nevertheless is almost the same as that of human red blood cells and therefore better tuned to a role in O2 transport.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049310>Structural dynamics of ligand diffusion in the protein matrix: A study on a new myoglobin mutant Y(B10) Q(E7) R(E10).</a></h2><p>A triple mutant of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) [Leu(B10) --> , His(E7) --> Gln, and Thr(E10) --> Arg, called Mb-YQR], investigated by stopped-flow, laser photolysis, crystallography, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, proved to be quite unusual. Rebinding of photodissociated NO, O2, and CO from within the protein (in a "geminate" mode) allows us to reach general conclusions about dynamics and cavities in proteins. The 3D structure of oxy Mb-YQR shows that bound O2 makes two H-bonds with (B10)29 and Gln(E7)64; on deoxygenation, these two residues move toward the space occupied by O2. The bimolecular rate constant for NO binding is the same as for wild-type, but those for CO and O2 binding are reduced 10-fold. While there is no geminate recombination with O2 and CO, geminate rebinding of NO displays an unusually large and very slow component, which is pretty much abolished in the presence of xenon. These results and MD simulations suggest that the ligand migrates in the protein matrix to a major "secondary site," located beneath (B10)29 and accessible via the motion of (G8)107; this site is different from the "primary site" identified by others who investigated the photolyzed state of wild-type Mb by crystallography. Our hypothesis may rationalize the O2 binding properties of Mb-YQR, and more generally to propose a mechanism of control of ligand binding and dissociation in hemeproteins based on the dynamics of side chains that may (or may not) allow access to and direct temporary sequestration of the dissociated ligand in a docking site within the protein. This interpretation suggests that very fast (picosecond) fluctuations of amino acid side chains may play a crucial role in controlling O2 delivery to tissue at a rate compatible with physiology.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26933234>Effects of Eimeria acervulina infection severity on growth performance, apparent ileal amino acid digestibility, and plasma concentrations of amino acids, carotenoids, and α1-acid glycoprotein in broilers.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to evaluate growth performance, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of amino acids, and plasma concentrations of amino acids, carotenoids, and α1-acid glycoprotein, an acute-phase protein, in broilers inoculated with graded doses of E. acervulina oocysts.

Thus, these results indicated that alterations in amino acid metabolism caused by E. acervulina infection extended beyond reduced amino acid digestibility.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471545>High-protein distillers dried grains with solubles produced using a novel front-end-back-end fractionation technology has greater nutritional value than conventional distillers dried grains with solubles when fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE, and DE and ME in conventional distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-CV) and in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-HP) produced by Lincolnway Energy (Nevada, IA).

To facilitate the identification of novel inhibitors of HIV-1 PR, as well as to permit detailed studies on the enzymology and inhibition of this enzyme, a continuous assay for its activity was developed that was based on intramolecular fluorescence resonance  transfer (RET). The assay used the quenched fluorogenic substrate 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL)--Ser Gln Asn  Pro  Val Gln--5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1 sulfonic acid (EDANS), whose peptide sequence is derived from a natural processing site for HIV-1 PR. Incubation of recombinant HIV-1 PR with the fluorogenic substrate resulted in specific cleavage at the -Pro bond and a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity that was linearly related to the extent of substrate hydrolysis. An internally quenched fluorogenic substrate was also designed that was selectively cleaved by the related PR from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). The fluorescence quantum yields of the HIV-1 PR and AMV PR substrates in the RET assay increased by 40.0- and 34.4-fold, respectively, per mole of substrate cleaved. Because of its simplicity, rapidity, and precision in the determination of reaction rates required for kinetic analysis, this method offers many advantages over the commonly used high-performance liquid chromatography- or electrophoresis-based assays for peptide substrate hydrolysis by retroviral PRs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186568>β-Pro7Ang III is a novel highly selective angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) agonist, which acts as a vasodepressor agent via the AT2R in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that individual β-amino acid substitution in angiotensin (Ang) II reduced Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) but not Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R)-binding and that the heptapeptide Ang III exhibited greater AT2R:AT1R selectivity than Ang II. Therefore, we hypothesized that β-amino-acid-substituted Ang III peptide analogues would yield highly selective AT2R ligands, which we have tested in binding and functional vascular assays. In competition binding experiments using either AT1R- or AT2R-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, novel β-substituted Ang III analogues lacked appreciable AT1R affinity, whereas most compounds could fully displace (125)I-Sar(1)(8) Ang II from AT2R. The rank order of affinity at AT2R was CGP42112 > Ang III > β-Pro(7) Ang III=Ang II > β-(4) Ang III ≥ PD123319 >> β-Phe(8) Ang III >> β Arg(2) Ang III=β-Val(3) Ang III >> β-(5) Ang III. The novel analogue β-Pro(7) Ang III was the most selective AT2R ligand tested, which was >20,000-fold more selective for AT2R than AT1R. IC50 values at AT2R from binding studies correlated with maximum vasorelaxation in mouse aortic rings. Given that β-Pro(7) Ang III was an AT2R agonist, we compared β-Pro(7) Ang III and native Ang III for their ability to reduce blood pressure in separate groups of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Whereas Ang III alone increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), β-Pro(7) Ang III had no effect. During low-level AT1R blockade, both Ang III and β-Pro(7) Ang III, but not Ang II, lowered MAP (by ∼30 mmHg) at equimolar infusions (150 pmol/kg/min for 4 h) and these depressor effects were abolished by the co-administration of the AT2R antagonist PD123319. Thus, β-Pro(7) Ang III has remarkable AT2R selectivity determined in binding and functional studies and will be a valuable research tool for insight into AT2R function and for future drug development.© 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h2><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs. Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average  (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, :Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, :Leu, Val:Leu, :Val, (+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, :Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, :Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, :His, Val:His, BCAA:His, Thr:Lys, Leu:Thr, :Thr, Val:Thr, BCAA:Thr, (Phe+):Lys, Leu:(Phe+), :(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, :LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the  statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × :Lys) - (0.1479 × :Lys × :Lys) + (9.2243 × (+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (+Val):Leu × (+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × :Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × :Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, , and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Both the peptide and most lipids are chiral, so there is a possibility that interactions between peptide and  could require chiral recognition. On the other hand, in our models with small peptides, the extent of folding of the peptide to form a specific binding pocket is limited. We have determined that replacing cholesterol with its enantiomer, ent-cholesterol, alters the modulation of  organization by peptides. The phase-transition properties of SOPC (1-stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine):cholesterol [in a 6:4 ratio with 0.2 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P2] are not significantly altered when ent-cholesterol replaces cholesterol. However, in the presence of 10 mol% of a 19-amino-acid, N-terminally myristoylated fragment (myristoyl-GGKLSKKKKGYNVNDEKAK-amide) of the protein NAP-22 (neuronal axonal membrane protein), the  mixture containing cholesterol undergoes separation into cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-depleted domains. This does not occur when ent-cholesterol replaces cholesterol. In another example, when N-acetyl-Leu-Trp---Lys-amide (N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide) is added to SOPC:cholesterol (7:3 ratio), there is a marked increase in the transition enthalpy of the phospholipid, indicating separation of a cholesterol-depleted domain of SOPC. This phenomenon completely disappears when ent-cholesterol replaces cholesterol. The all-D-isomer of N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide also induces the formation of cholesterol-rich domains with natural cholesterol, but does so to a lesser extent with ent-cholesterol. Thus specific peptide chirality is not required for interaction with cholesterol-containing membranes. However, a specific chirality of membrane lipids is required for peptide-induced formation of cholesterol-rich domains.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29808621>Target site mutations and cytochrome P450s confer resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl in Alopecurus aequalis.</a></h2><p>Shortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis Sobol.) is a competitive grass weed infesting winter wheat- and canola-growing fields in China. In May 2016, a suspected A. aequalis resistant population AHTC-06 that survived fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl applied at their field-recommended rates was collected from a wheat field in Jinji County, Anhui Province, China. This study aimed to determine the resistance profile of this AHTC-06 population to ACCase- and ALS-inhibitors, and to investigate its mechanisms of resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl.Two mutations, a common -2041-Asn (ACCase gene) and a very rare Pro-197- (ALS1 gene), were both identified in resistant individual plants. The homozygous subpopulation AHTC-06F1 for the two mutations was generated, and it showed broad-spectrum resistance to APPs, DENs, and ALS-inhibiting herbicides of all five chemical families tested, with resistance index (RI) values that ranged from 2.2 to 36.5. In vitro ALS activity assays showed the ALS from the resistant population was insensitive to all the tested ALS inhibitors, with RI values ranging from 3.10 to 22.51. Pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and malathion significantly (P < 0.05) reversed the weed's resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl, respectively.

Iron(III) protoporphyrin IX (hemin) is bound in subdomain IB of wild-type rHSA [rHSA(wt)] with weak axial coordination by -161. The reduced ferrous rHSA(wt)-heme under an Ar atmosphere exists in an unusual mixture of four- and five-coordinate complexes and is immediately autoxidized by O2. To confer O2 binding capability on this naturally occurring hemoprotein, a proximal histidine was introduced into position -142 or Leu-185 by site-directed mutagenesis. A single mutant (I142H) and three double mutants (I142H/Y161L, I142H/Y161F, and Y161L/L185H) were prepared. Both rHSA(I142H/Y161L)-heme and rHSA(I142H/Y161F)-heme formed ferrous five-N-coordinate high-spin complexes with axial ligation of His-142 under an Ar atmosphere. These artificial hemoproteins bind O2 at room temperature. Mutation at the other side of the porphyrin, Y161L/L185H, also allowed O2 binding to the heme. In contrast, the single mutant rHSA(I142H)-heme could not bind O2, suggesting that removal of Y161 is necessary to confer reversible O2 binding. Laser flash photolysis experiments showed that the kinetics of CO recombination with the rHSA(mutant)-heme were biphasic, whereas O2 rebinding exhibited monophasic kinetics. This could be due to the two different geometries of the axial imidazole coordination arising from the two orientations of the porphyrin plane in the heme pocket. The O2 binding affinities of the rHSA(mutant)-heme were significantly lower than those of hemoglobin and myoglobin, principally due to the high O2 dissociation rates. Changing Leu-161 to Phe-161 at the distal side increased the association rates of both O2 and CO, which resulted in enhanced binding affinity.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500966>Statistical analysis of atomic contacts at RNA-protein interfaces.</a></h2><p>Forty-five crystals of complexes between proteins and RNA molecules from the Protein Data Bank have been statistically surveyed for the number of contacts between RNA components (phosphate, ribose and the four bases) and amino acid side chains. Three groups of complexes were defined: the tRNA synthetases; the ribosomal complexes; and a third group containing a variety of complexes. The types of atomic contacts were a priori classified into ionic, neutral H-bond, C-H...O H-bond, or van der Waals interaction. All the contacts were organized into a relational database which allows for statistical analysis. The main conclusions are the following: (i) in all three groups of complexes, the most preferred amino acids (Arg, Asn, Ser, Lys) and the less preferred ones (Ala, , Leu, Val) are the same; Trp and Cys are rarely observed (respectively 15 and 5 amino acids in the ensemble of interfaces); (ii) of the total number of amino acids located at the interfaces 22% are hydrophobic, 40% charged (positive 32%, negative 8%), 30% polar and 8% are Gly; (iii) in ribosomal complexes, phosphate is preferred over ribose, which is preferred over the bases, but there is no significant preference in the other two groups; (iv) there is no significant prevalence of a base type at protein-RNA interfaces, but specifically Arg and Lys display a preference for phosphate over ribose and bases; Pro and Asn prefer bases over ribose and phosphate; Met, Phe and  prefer ribose over phosphate and bases. Further, , Pro, Ser prefer A over the others; Leu prefers C; Asp and Gly prefer G; and Asn prefers U. Considering the contact types, the following conclusions could be drawn: (i) 23% of the contacts are via potential H-bonds (including CH...O H-bonds and ionic interactions), 72% belong to van der Waals interactions and 5% are considered as short contacts; (ii) of all potential H-bonds, 54% are standard, 33% are of the C-H...O type and 13% are ionic; (iii) the Watson-Crick sites of G, O6(G) and principally N2(G) and the hydroxyl group O2' is more often involved in H-bonds than expected; the protein main chain is involved in 32% and the side chains in 68% of the H-bonds; considering the neutral and ionic H-bonds, the following couples are more frequent than expected-base A-Ser, base G-Asp/Glu, base U-Asn. The RNA CH groups interact preferentially with  atoms (62% on the main chain and 19% on the side chains); (iv) the bases are involved in 38% of all H-bonds and more than 26% of the H-bonds have the H donor group on the RNA; (v) the atom O2' is involved in 21% of all H-bonds, a number greater than expected; (vi) amino acids less frequently in direct contact with RNA components interact frequently via their main chain atoms through water molecules with RNA atoms; in contrast, those frequently observed in direct contact, except Ser, use instead their side chain atoms for water bridging interactions.Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545920>Expansion of Noncanonical V-Arm-Containing tRNAs in Eukaryotes.</a></h2><p>Transfer RNA (tRNA) is essential for the translation of genetic information into proteins, and understanding its molecular evolution is important if we are to understand the genetic code. In general, long variable-arm (V-arm) structures form in tRNA(Leu), tRNA(Ser), and bacterial and organellar tRNA(). However, as we have previously reported, noncanonical V-arms occur in nematode tRNA(Gly) and tRNA(), and potentially affect translational fidelity. Here, we comprehensively analyzed 69 eukaryotic genome sequences and examined the evolutionary divergence of the V-arm-containing tRNAs. In total, 253 V-arm-containing tRNAs, with neither leucine nor serine anticodons, were identified in organisms ranging from nematodes to fungi, plants, and vertebrates. We defined them as "noncanonical V-arm-containing tRNAs" (nov-tRNAs). Moreover, 2,415 nov-tRNA-like sequences lacking some of the conserved features of tRNAs were also identified, largely in vertebrate genomes. These nov-tRNA/nov-tRNA-like sequences can be categorized into three types, based on differences in their possible evolutionary origins. The type A nov-tRNAs in nematodes probably evolved not only from tRNA(Leu) but also from tRNA(Ser) and other isotypes on several independent occasions. The type B nov-tRNAs are dispersed abundantly throughout vertebrate genomes, and seem to have originated from retrotransposable elements. The type C nov-tRNAs may have been acquired from plant chloroplasts or from bacteria through horizontal transfer. Our findings provide unexpected insight into the evolution of the tRNA molecule, which was diverse and occurred independently in nematodes, vertebrates, and plants.© The Author 2015.

Here we report that the stress response also involves processing of pre-tRNA 3' termini. By a combination of Northern analyses and RNA sequencing, we show that upon shift to elevated temperatures and/or to glycerol-containing medium, aberrant pre-tRNAs accumulate in yeast cells. For pre-tRNAUAU() and pre-tRNAUUU Lys) these aberrant forms are unprocessed at the 5' ends, but they possess extended 3' termini. Sequencing analyses showed that partial 3' processing precedes 5' processing for pre-tRNAUAU(). An aberrant pre-tRNA() that accumulates also possesses extended 3' termini, but it is processed at the 5' terminus. Similar forms of these aberrant pre-tRNAs are detected in the rex1Δ strain that is defective in 3' exonucleolytic trimming of pre-tRNAs but are absent in the lhp1Δ mutant lacking 3' end protection. We further show direct correlation between the inhibition of 3' end processing rate and the stringency of growth conditions. Moreover, under stress conditions Rex1 nuclease seems to be limiting for 3' end processing, by decreased availability linked to increased protection by Lhp1. Thus, our data document complex 3' processing that is inhibited by stress in a tRNA-type and condition-specific manner. This stress-responsive tRNA 3' end maturation process presumably contributes to fine-tune the levels of functional tRNA in budding yeast in response to environmental conditions.© 2016 Foretek et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25354707>Permethrin and its metabolites affect Cu/Zn superoxide conformation: fluorescence and in silico evidences.</a></h2><p>The proclivity of permethrin and its metabolites to affect the structure and activity of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been investigated by using intrinsic fluorescence and 8-ANS fluorescence techniques. In silico molecular docking investigations were carried out in order to assess the means of interaction at a molecular level between SOD and the considered ligands. Results show that both, permethrin and its metabolites are able to induce conformational variation on SOD. Permethrin and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol metabolite induce a blue shift toward the hydrophobic amino acids Leu-101, -102, Leu-104, -110 and -111, with a significant peak increase. An opposite effect was shown by 3-phenoxy benzaldehyde and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid with a progressive reduction of tyrosine fluorescence emission, without any shift. Computational findings confirm that all the molecules considered have more than one allosteric binding site but none of them interact with SOD at its catalytic Cu/Zn cleft. Moreover, all the binding poses found are very close in binding energy thus demonstrating that there is not only a preferred interaction site but most of them are important due to their relative energy in equilibrium with a population strictly connected to the ligand concentration. In the obtained complexes, all the ligands are involved in many hydrogen bonds through their polar oxygen moieties but due to the presence of a common aromatic hydrophobic core, many hydrophobic interactions are due to the SOD nature rich in apolar amino acids.

The complex was present mostly as a dimer as determined by T2 relaxation measurements. The TRNOE crosspeaks in the ternary complex were assigned to the specific  protons in the CCR5 peptide and to methyl protons, predominantly of isoleucine residues, and also of leucine and/or valine residues of gp120. The TRNOE/asymmetric deuteration method benefits from the sensitivity of the homonuclear NOESY experiment and does not suffer the sensitivity losses associated with isotope-edited/isotope-filtered approaches that rely on magnetization transfer between protons and heteronuclei that are bonded to them. The technique can be widely applied for studying large protein complexes that exhibit fast off-rates.© 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28155663>SCMBYK: prediction and characterization of bacterial tyrosine-kinases based on propensity scores of dipeptides.</a></h2><p>Bacterial tyrosine-kinases (BY-kinases), which play an important role in numerous cellular processes, are characterized as a separate class of enzymes and share no structural similarity with their eukaryotic counterparts. However, in silico methods for predicting BY-kinases have not been developed yet. Since these enzymes are involved in key regulatory processes, and are promising targets for anti-bacterial drug design, it is desirable to develop a simple and easily interpretable predictor to gain new insights into bacterial tyrosine phosphorylation. This study proposes a novel SCMBYK method for predicting and characterizing BY-kinases.A dataset consisting of 797 BY-kinases and 783 non-BY-kinases was established to design the SCMBYK predictor, which achieved training and test accuracies of 97.55 and 96.73%, respectively. Furthermore, the leave-one-phylum-out method was used to predict specific bacterial phyla hosts of target sequences, gaining 97.39% average test accuracy. After analyzing SCMBYK-derived propensity scores, four characteristics of BY-kinases were determined: 1) BY-kinases tend to be composed of α-helices; 2) the amino-acid content of extracellular regions of BY-kinases is expected to be dominated by residues such as Val, , Phe and ; 3) BY-kinases structurally resemble nuclear proteins; 4) different domains play different roles in triggering BY-kinase activity.The SCMBYK predictor is an effective method for identification of possible BY-kinases. Furthermore, it can be used as a part of a novel drug repurposing method, which recognizes putative BY-kinases and matches them to approved drugs. Among other results, our analysis revealed that azathioprine could suppress the virulence of M. tuberculosis, and thus be considered as a potential antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504948>Targeted disruption of TORC1 retards young squab growth by inhibiting the synthesis of crop milk protein in breeding pigeon (Columba livia).</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore the regulatory role of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons (Columba livia). Three groups of breeding pigeons in the lactation period (n = 30 pairs/group) were respectively injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex) at doses of 0 (vehicle, control), 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg  (BW)/day via the wing vein for 7 days. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and BW of the breeding pigeons and the BW of young squabs were respectively recorded throughout the experimental period. The breeding pigeons were sacrificed to collect their crop tissues, crop milk, and serum on the eighth day of the experiment. The results showed that neither 0.6 nor 1.2 mg/kg BW RAPA injection affected BW loss or ADFI in breeding pigeons (P > 0.05), while crop thickness and crop relative  were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the 1.2 mg/kg BW rapamycin-injected group. Simultaneously, RAPA (especially at 1.2 mg/kg BW) decreased the crude protein, αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein, and amino acid contents (Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Val, Met, , Leu, , Lys, His, Arg, and Pro) of crop milk (P < 0.05) and the concentrations of albumin, total protein, and uric acid in the serum of breeding pigeons (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of TORC1 pathway-related proteins (TORC1, S6K1, S6, 4EBP1, and eIF4E) was downregulated in the crop tissues of breeding pigeons by 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg BW/day RAPA injection (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the average daily gain (ADG) of young squabs declined, and the mortality rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). Together, the results showed that RAPA reduced protein and amino acid levels in the crop milk of breeding pigeons and retarded young squab growth, suggesting a crucial role of TORC1 in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25477187>Utilisation of the isobole methodology to study dietary peptide-drug and peptide-peptide interactive effects on dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibition.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is used as a means to regulate post-prandial serum glucose in type 2 diabetics.

Five peptides (-Pro--Gln-, Trp-Lys, Trp-Pro, Trp-Arg and Trp-Leu), having DPP-IV half maximum inhibitory concentration values (IC₅₀)<60 μM and reported to act through different inhibition mechanisms, were investigated.

The isolates grew at 60 to 97 degrees C, with the optimum temperatures at 85 to 90 degrees C. Sensitivity to rifampin and the existence of ether lipids indicated that the isolates are hyperthermophilic archaea. Partial sequencing of the genes coding for 16S rRNA showed that the three isolates are closely related to the genus Thermococcus.

The resulting RNA encodes four covalently linked subunit domains ([4]RBK1). Injection of this RNA into Xenopus oocytes resulted in the expression of voltage-dependent potassium currents. A single amino acid substitution, -->Val, located within the outer mouth of the pore, introduced into the equivalent position of any of the four domains, reduced affinity for external tetraethylammonium by approximately the same amount. In constructs containing 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4  residues the free  of binding tetraethylammonium was linearly related to the number of  residues. A different amino acid substitution, Leu-->, located in the S4 region, was made in the equivalent position of one, two, three, or four domains. The depolarization required for channel activation increased approximately linearly with the number of  residues, whereas models of independent gating of each domain predict marked nonlinearity.

The structure of the NpTrpDH monomer, which exhibited high similarity to that of l-Glu/l-Leu/l-Phe dehydrogenases, consisted of a substrate-binding domain (domain I, residues 3 to 133 and 328 to 343) and an NAD/NADH-binding domain (domain II, residues 142 to 327) separated by a deep cleft. The apo-NpTrpDH existed in an open conformation, where domains I and II were apart from each other. The subunits dimerized themselves mainly through interactions between amino acid residues around the β-1 strand of each subunit, as was observed in the case of l-Phe dehydrogenase. The binding site for the substrate l-Trp was predicted by a molecular docking simulation and validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Several hydrophobic residues, which were located in the active site of NpTrpDH and possibly interacted with the side chain of the substrate l-Trp, were arranged similarly to that found in l-Leu/l-Phe dehydrogenases but fairly different from that of an l-Glu dehydrogenase. Our crystal structure revealed that Met-40, Ala-69, -74, -110, Leu-288, -289, and -292 formed a hydrophobic cluster around the active site. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that the hydrophobic cluster plays critical roles in protein folding, l-Trp recognition, and catalysis. Our results provide critical information for further characterization and engineering of this enzyme.In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of l-Trp dehydrogenase, analyzed its various site-directed substitution mutants at residues located in the active site, and obtained the following informative results. Several residues in the active site form a hydrophobic cluster, which may be a part of the hydrophobic core essential for protein folding. To our knowledge, there is no previous report demonstrating that a hydrophobic cluster in the active site of any l-amino acid dehydrogenase may have a critical impact on protein folding. Furthermore, our results suggest that this hydrophobic cluster could strictly accommodate l-Trp. These studies show the structural characteristics of l-Trp dehydrogenase and hence would facilitate novel applications of l-Trp dehydrogenase.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595103>Computational identification and binding analysis of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 enzyme with substrates.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are important heme-containing proteins, well known for their monooxygenase reaction. The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and energy stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes. Docking of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 with arachidonic acid revealed that  112, ALA 126,  222,  223, THR 312, LEU 315, ALA 316, ASP 319, THR 320, PHE 491 and  492 residues were actively participating in the interaction, while docking of CYP4X1 with anandamide showed that  112, GLN 114, PRO 118, ALA 126,  222,  223, SER 251, LEU 315, ALA 316 and PHE 491 key residues were involved in strong interaction.From this study, several key residues were identified to be responsible for the binding of arachidonic acid and anandamide with orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1. Both substrates obeyed Lipinski rule of five in drug-likeness test and biological spectrum prediction showed anticarcinogenic activity. Compared to anandamide, arachidonic acid showed strong interaction with cytochrome P450 4X1 and also less health effect in certain human system in ADME-Tox prediction.

Ala-based tetra- and pentapeptides were designed, and the N- or C-terminal amino acid residues were replaced by different amino acids. The results showed that the oligopeptides had a wide range of transport permeability across the Caco-2 cell monolayer and could be divided into four categories: non-/poor permeability, low permeability, intermediate permeability, and good permeability. Tetrapeptides with N-terminal Leu, Pro, , Cys, Met, and Val or C-terminal Val showed the highest permeability, with apparent permeability coefficient (P) values over 10 × 10 cm/s (p < 0.05), suggesting that nonpolar hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids or polar sulfur-containing amino acids were the best for the transport of tetrapeptides. Pentapeptides with N- or C-terminal  also showed high permeability levels, with P values of about 10 × 10 cm/s. The amino acids Glu, Asn, and Thr at the N terminus or Lys, Asp, and Arg at the C terminus were also beneficial for the transport of tetra- and pentapeptides, with P values ranging from 1 × 10 to 10 × 10 cm/s.

A key step in the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs is the association of the receptor with beta-arrestins. In the present study, these receptors were analyzed with respect to their ability to interact with GFP2-tagged beta-arrestin 2 using the new bioluminescence resonance  transfer 2 method. Agonists induced a concentration-dependent association of beta-arrestin 2 with all four receptors. Whereas the Y1 receptor exhibited the highest maximum response and rapid association (t(1/2) = 3.4 min), the maximal signals for the association of Y2 and Y4 receptors were less than half of that of Y1, and the association rates were much slower. Interestingly, when evaluated at the Y4 receptor, the Y4 agonist 1229U91 [(,Glu,Pro,Dpr,,Arg, Leu,Arg,Try-NH2)-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] was unable to provoke the same maximal response as human PP, suggesting that 1229U91 is a partial agonist. When stimulated by PYY, the Y5 receptor responded with a t(1/2) of 4.6 min and a maximal response approximately 60% of what was observed with Y1. Because beta-arrestins are key components in GPCR internalization, it is interesting to note that the receptor that is known to internalize rapidly (Y1) exhibits the most rapid association with beta-arrestin 2, whereas the receptor that is known to internalize slowly, or not at all (Y2) associates slowly with beta-arrestin 2.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342601>Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry MS-based untargeted milk metabolomics in dairy cows with subclinical or clinical mastitis.</a></h2><p>In this study, a novel metabolomics technique based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry in the MS mode was used to investigate the milk metabolomics of healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitis cows, which were classified based on somatic cell count and presentation of clinical symptoms.

On the other hand, neither growth rate nor efficiency increased when any one of these amino acids was added singly, except for Glu and Gln, each of which produced significant but small improvements. The stimulatory effect of the combined amino acids on bacterial growth declined when each of Leu, Trp, , Glu, Met, Phe, and Val was removed from the original group of 20. When a mixture of only these seven amino acids was used as a supplement, their stimulatory effects on growth rate and efficiency were only 21 and 25%, respectively, of the effects that the mixture of 20 amino acids showed.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in metabolic flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in diabetes; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of metabolic pathways in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes. The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate metabolic dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and  changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism leading to energy generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of tyrosine (), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of diabetes. Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting metabolic substrate to compensatory pathways, which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12071346>Lysozyme modification by the fenton reaction and gamma radiation.</a></h2><p>A comparative study was performed on lysozyme modification after exposure to Fenton reagent (Fe(II)/H2 O2) or hydroxyl radicals produced by y radiation.

Laminin is one of the major non-collagenous glycoproteins. The pentapeptide YIGSR (--Gly-Ser-Arg) is a functional motif of laminin that binds to the laminin receptor. In the present study, we examined whether YIGSR could improve the reconstruction of SEs. YIGSR has no effects on monolayer cell proliferation of CCD25-Sk fibroblasts or HaCaT keratinocytes. Interestingly, YIGSR decreased TGF-β1 levels, although it promoted type Ι collagen synthesis in CCD25-Sk cells. In HaCaT cells, YIGSR decreased the expression of involucrin and loricrin, which are differentiation markers. Furthermore, YIGSR increased levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p63, and integrin α6, and decreased involucrin in SE models. In addition, two models containing YIGSR (mixed with dermal equivalents or added into media) did not show any differences in expression levels of PCNA, p63, integrin α6, and involucrin. Therefore, YIGSR is a useful agent for reconstruction of SEs, independent of its method of application. These results indicate that YIGSR stimulates epidermal proliferation and basement membrane formation while inhibiting keratinocyte differentiation of SEs. Taken together, these results indicate that YIGSR promotes the reconstruction of SEs, potentially via decreased TGF-β1 levels and consequent inhibition of epidermal differentiation.Copyright © 2018 Tissue Viability Society.

It is possible that genetic factors could account for the bulk of the variance observed, and hence play a major role in the development of impaired insulin sensitivity, ie insulin resistance. From the genetic point of view, insulin resistance is thought to be due to the inheritance of a number of mutations in a variety of genes. Three complementary approaches have been applied in the search for mutations: mutational analysis of candidate genes; linkage analysis of candidate genes or chromosomal regions for insulin resistance in familial type 2 diabetes; and random genome mapping with quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Mutational analysis of the insulin signalling cascade has identified a glycine-arginine (Gly-Arg) substitution at codon 972 of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene with a carrier prevalence of 9% among Caucasians. Expression of this variant in 32-D cells is associated with a significant (20-30%) impairment of insulin-stimulated PI3-kinase activity, as well as reduced binding of IRS-1 to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. Genotype/phenotype studies stratified according to body mass index (BMI) indicate that obese subjects who are heterozygous for the mutant allele have a 50% decrease in insulin sensitivity, compared with wild-type obese subjects. This suggests that there may be an interaction between the mutant allele and obesity, such that, in the presence of obesity, the mutant variant may aggravate the obesity-associated insulin resistance. Mutational analysis has also shown that homozygous carriers of a codon Met 326  mutation in the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3)-kinase (about 2% of the Caucasian population) have lower glucose tolerance, glucose effectiveness. A further Asp to  polymorphism has been identified at codon 905 of the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of glycogen-associated protein phosphatase-1 (PP1G). Individuals who are heterozygous for this polymorphism constitute 18% of the Caucasian population and appear to exhibit both tissue-specific and pathway-specific insulin resistance. It is likely that inherited insulin resistance will eventually prove to be related to subtle mutations in many such genes of the insulin signalling network and the numerous genetic components controlling  metabolism.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16733618>Gas chromatographic determination and mechanism of formation of D-amino acids occurring in fermented and roasted cocoa beans, cocoa powder, chocolate and cocoa shell.</a></h2><p>Fermented cocoa beans of various countries of origin (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Sulawesi), cocoa beans roasted under defined conditions (100-150 degrees C; 30-120 min), low and high  cocoa powder, various brands of chocolate, and cocoa shells were analyzed for their contents of free L-and D-amino acids. Amino acids were isolated from defatted products using a cation exchanger and converted into volatile N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters which were analyzed by enantioselective gas chromatography mass spectrometry on a Chirasil-L-Val capillary column. Besides common protein L-amino acids low amounts of D-amino acids were detected in fermented cocoa beans. Quantities of D-amino acids increased on heating. On roasting cocoa beans of the Forastero type from the Ivory Coast at 150 degrees C for 2 h, relative quantities of D-amino acids approached 17.0% D-Ala, 11.7% D-, 11.1% D-Asx (Asp + Asn), 7.9% D-, 5.8% D-Ser, 4.8% D-Leu, 4.3% D-Phe, 37.0% D-Pro, and 1.2% D-Val. In cocoa powder and chocolate relative quantities amounted to 14.5% D-Ala, 10.6% D-, 9.8% D-Phe, 8.1% L-Asx, and 7.2% D-. Lower quantities of other D-amino acids were also detected. In order to corroborate our hypothesis that D-amino acids are generated from Amadori compounds (fructose amino acids) formed in the course of the Maillard reaction, fructose-L-phenylalanine and fructose-D-phenylalanine were synthesized and heated at 200 degrees C for 5-60 min. Already after 5 min release of 11.7% D-Phe and 11.8% L-Phe in the free form could be analyzed. Based on the data a racemization mechanism is presented founded on the intermediate and reversible formation of an amino acid carbanion in the Amadori compounds.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29519417>Regulation of macrophage polarization and promotion of endothelialization by NO generating and PEG-YIGSR modified vascular graft.</a></h2><p>As an effective clinic treatment for cardiovascular disease, vascular transplantation gains much acceptance recently. However, due to the acute thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia, long-term failure of synthetic grafts after implanted in small diameter blood vessel decelerates its commercial use. The continued acute inflammation and delayed endothelialization have been considered as fundamental reasons. To enhance the adhesion and organization of endothelial cells (ECs) and improve the vascular remodeling process, we have constructed a vascular graft based on electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix, on which organoselenium-immobilized polyethyleneimine (SePEI) for in situ nitric oxide (NO) generation and hyaluronic acid (HA) grafted with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) modified --Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) for antifouling and EC adhesion were deposited through electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. The in vitro results showed that SePEI deposited on the grafts could catalyze stable generation of NO. After in situ implantation in rats for 4 and 8weeks, the graft promoted the transformation of macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2), which helped endothelium remodeling. YIGSR on the outmost layer facilitated more rapid and organized EC adhesion compared to PCL and non-modified grafts. PEG polymer chain on the outmost layer mitigated nonspecific adsorption of undesirable blood components. In our study, we first demonstrated the regulation of macrophage polarization by an NO-generating vascular graft. The results indicated that the approach of anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and enhanced endothelialization through NO generation and PEG-modified YIGSR in our study may provide a new perspective for the clinic application of cell-free small-diameter vascular grafts.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 720 d-old male broiler chicks were randomly allocated to 8 treatments, with 6 replicates per treatment and 15 birds per replicate. Birds were reared in floor pens from 0 to 35 d. The study used a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with 2 grains (sorghum or wheat) and 4 diets: positive control (no enzyme and ME, digestible Lys, Ca, and P sufficient, negative control (NC; no enzyme and reduced ME [-100 kcal/kg], digestible AA [-2%], Ca [-0.12 percentage points], and available P [-0.18 percentage points in the starter phase and -0.22 percentage points in the grower phase]), NC + nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes + phytase (500 phytase units [FTU]; NCCP), and NC + phytase (1,000 FTU; NCP). From 0 to 35 d, birds fed wheat-based diets had greater G:F (4.5%), BW gain (9.2%), breast meat yield (6.8%), and tibia ash (2.0%) compared with birds fed sorghum-based diets. Across grain types, the NCCP treatment improved BW gain ( < 0.001), feed intake ( < 0.001), G:F ( < 0.05), and livability ( < 0.001) compared with the NC treatment. Birds fed NCP had greater BW gain ( < 0.001), feed intake ( < 0.001), G:F ( < 0.001), and livability ( < 0.001) compared with birds fed NC. Birds fed the NCP diet had greater BW gain ( < 0.001), toe ash ( < 0.01), and tibia ash ( < 0.001) compared with birds fed the NCCP diet. There was a grain × diet interaction for feed intake ( < 0.01), BW gain ( < 0.001), tibia ash ( < 0.01), and tibia breaking strength ( < 0.05). The influence of enzymes was more pronounced in sorghum-based diets than in wheat-based diets. Birds fed wheat-based diets had greater ileal digestibility of His, Met, Val, Phe, , Leu, Trp, Glu, Pro, Ala, , and Cys compared with those fed sorghum-based diets ( < 0.05). Across grain types, NCP had greater apparent ileal digestibility of Met, Lys, Ser, Pro, Gly, and Cys than NC ( < 0.05). The results suggest that wheat is superior to sorghum for broilers, as expected, but that enzyme supplementation has the capability to restore the compromised bird performance due to feeding sorghum. In addition, compared with nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and phytase (500 FTU/kg feed) added in concert, phytase supplemented at 1,000 FTU/kg resulted in a further improvement of some of the performance and bone mineralization parameters in male broilers fed sorghum-based diets.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26920059>Chameleon sequences in neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h2><p>Chameleon sequences can adopt either alpha helix sheet or a coil conformation. Defining chameleon sequences in PDB (Protein Data Bank) may yield to an insight on defining peptides and proteins responsible in neurodegeneration. In this research, we benefitted from the large PDB and performed a sequence analysis on Chameleons, where we developed an algorithm to extract peptide segments with identical sequences, but different structures. In order to find new chameleon sequences, we extracted a set of 8315 non-redundant protein sequences from the PDB with an identity less than 25%. Our data was classified to "helix to strand (HE)", "helix to coil (HC)" and "strand to coil (CE)" alterations. We also analyzed the occurrence of singlet and doublet amino acids and the solvent accessibility in the chameleon sequences; we then sorted out the proteins with the most number of chameleon sequences and named them Chameleon Flexible Proteins (CFPs) in our dataset. Our data revealed that Gly, Val, ,  and Phe, are the major amino acids in Chameleons. We also found that there are proteins such as Insulin Degrading Enzyme IDE and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN) with the most number of chameleons (640 and 405 respectively). These proteins have known roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore it can be inferred that other CFP's can serve as key proteins in neurodegeneration, and a study on them can shed light on curing and preventing neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is also up-regulated in cancer cells, as part of a tumor's increased  demands. Previously, amino acid prodrugs have been shown to be transported by LAT1. Carboxylic acid bioisosteres may afford prodrugs with an altered physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profile than those derived from natural amino acids, allowing for higher brain or tumor levels of drug and/or lower toxicity. The effect of replacing phenylalanine's carboxylic acid with a tetrazole, acylsulfonamide and hydroxamic acid (HA) bioisostere was examined. Compounds were tested for their ability to be LAT1 substrates using both cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation cell assays. As HA-Phe demonstrated weak substrate activity, its structure-activity relationship (SAR) was further explored by synthesis and testing of HA derivatives of other LAT1 amino acid substrates (i.e., , Leu, , and Met). The potential for a false positive in the trans-stimulation assay caused by parent amino acid was evaluated by conducting compound stability experiments for both HA-Leu and the corresponding methyl ester derivative. We concluded that HA's are transported by LAT1. In addition, our results lend support to a recent account that amino acid esters are LAT1 substrates, and that hydrogen bonding may be as important as charge for interaction with the transporter binding site.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During growth, this retention changes in an absolute way and also between nutrients and energy, resulting in changing nutrient requirements. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in chemical composition in male growing turkeys. The serial slaughter technique was used to determine the composition of amino acids, , ash, and water in feather-free body (FFB) and feathers in male turkeys offered feed ad libitum from 1 to 15 wk of age. Allometric relations were used to describe changes in body composition. The feather content in the body decreased from 6% at 1 wk of age to less than 3% at 15 wk of age. The water and protein content in FFB decreased with increasing FFB mass, with allometric scalars (b) of, respectively, 0.967 and 0.970, whereas the  content increased with increasing FFB mass (b = 1.388). The water, protein, and ash content in -free FFB was constant and represented, respectively, 71.6, 24.2, and 4.2% of the -free FFB mass. The amino acid content of FFB protein was relatively constant and only the Cys content decreased between 1 and 15 wk of age, whereas the  content increased. Feathers were mostly composed of protein, and the protein content did not change during growth. During growth, the Lys, Met, Trp, His, , Asp, and Glu contents in feather protein decreased, whereas the Cys, Val, and Ser contents increased. The contribution of feathers to whole-body amino acid retention ranged from 5% for His to 33% for Cys. On average, the weight gain of FFB contained 21.3% protein and 12.7% , corresponding to an energy content of 10.1 kJ/g. The weight gain of feathers contained 87.4% protein, corresponding to an energy content of 20.4 kJ/g.

This dual function of NT establishes a connection between brain and peripheral tissues that renders this peptide a central player in  homeostasis. Many biological actions of NT are mediated through its interaction with three types of NT receptors (NTS receptors). Despite its role in  homeostasis, NT has a short half-life that hampers further determination of the biological actions of this peptide and its receptors in brain and periphery. The short half-life of NT is due to the proteolytic degradation of its C-terminal side by several endopeptidases. Therefore, it is important to synthesize NT analogues with resistant bonds against metabolic deactivation. Based on these findings, we herein report the synthesis of ten linear, two cyclic and two dimeric analogues of NT with modifications in its structure that improve their metabolic stability, while retaining the ability to bind to NTS receptors. Modifications at position 11 (introduction of D-Tyrosine (OEthyl) [D-(Et)] or D-1-naphtylalanine [D-1-Nal] were combined with introduction of a L-Lysine or a D-Arginine at positions 8 or 9, and 1-[2-(aminophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (AOPC) at positions 7 or 8, resulting in compounds NT4-NT21. AOPC is an unnatural amino acid with promise in applications as a building block for the synthesis of peptidomimetic compounds. To biologically evaluate these analogues, we determined their plasma stability and their binding affinities to type 1 NT receptor (NTS1), endogenously expressed in HT-29 cells, Among the fourteen NT analogues, compounds, NT5, NT6, and NT8, which have D-(Et) at position 11, bound to NTS1 in a dose-response manner and with relatively high affinity but still lower than that of the natural peptide. Despite their lower binding affinities compared to NT, the NT5, NT6, and NT8 exhibited a remarkably higher stability, as a result of their chemistry, which provides protection from enzymatic activity. These results will set the basis for the rational design of novel NT molecules with improved pharmacological properties and enhanced enzymatic stability.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25938568>Genetic diversity in oxytocin ligands and receptors in New World monkeys.</a></h2><p>Oxytocin (OXT) is an important neurohypophyseal hormone that influences wide spectrum of reproductive and social processes.

A structure-activity relationship study using these three assay systems revealed several requirements of their structure for the strong inhibition of HDAC not only in the cell-free situation, but also in cells. When the structures of CHAP derivatives are represented as cyclo(-Asu(NHOH)-AA(2)-AA(3)-Pro or Pip-)(n), where Asu(NHOH) and Pip are zeta-hydroxamide-alpha-aminosuberic acid and pipecolic acid, respectively, (a) the tetrapeptide structure (n = 1) was better than the octapeptide one (n = 2); (b) AA(2) and AA(3) should be hydrophobic; and (c) the combination of amino acid chirality should be LDLD for the strongest inhibition of HDAC in cells (LDLD > LLLD, LDLL > LLDL). cyclo(-L-Asu(NHOH)-D-(Me)-L--D-Pro-) or CHAP31 was selected as one of the strongest CHAPs, and its biological activity was characterized further.

Eight ileal-cannulated pigs (initial BW = 79.7 ± 3.97 kg) were fed 4 diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design to give 8 replicates per diet. Diets included a cornstarch-based diet with CP-SBC, extruded CP-SBC, and SBC plus multi-enzyme (1,200 U of xylanase, 150 U of glucanase, 500 U of cellulase, 60 U of mannanase, 700 U of invertase, 5,000 U of protease, and 12,000 U of amylase/kilogram of diet; Superzyme-CS, 0.5 g/kg); and a N-free diet. The CP-SBC was the sole source of protein in the CP-SBC-containing diets. The ratio of cornstarch to sugar and soybean oil in CP-SBC-containing diets was identical to the N-free diet to allow calculation of energy digestibility of CP-SBC by the difference method. The evaluated CP-SBC had been produced by heating the soybean seed at 105°C for 60 min followed by pressing of the heated soybean seeds at less than 42°C (barrel temperature). On a DM basis, CP-SBC and extruded CP-SBC contained 47.8 and 47.1% CP, 15.6 and 10.5% ADF, 7.23 and 8.85% ether extract, 3.11 and 3.08% Lys, and 2.25 and 3.70 trypsin inhibitor units per mg, respectively. Extrusion increased ( < 0.001) the SID of AA for the CP-SBC by an average of 12%. Also, extrusion increased ( < 0.001) the NE value of the CP-SBC from 2,743 to 2,853 kcal/kg of DM. Supplementation of CP-SBC diet with the multi-enzyme increased ( < 0.05) the SID of Arg and Pro, and tended to increase ( < 0.1) the SID of  and . However, the multi-enzyme supplementation did not affect the NE value of CP-SBC. In conclusion, the CP-SBC evaluated in the present study could be an alternative source of AA and energy in swine diets, and its nutritive value can be increased by extrusion following cold-pressing.

In this study, the effect of replacing IleH59 with ten other non-polar amino acids was examined. Three preferred interaction sites for methyl/methylene groups for the various XaaH59 side-chains in the complex were identified from conformational search calculations. The corresponding thermodynamic changes were determined using a combination of systematic search and  minimization in a manner that locates the local minima in the system and in the process simultaneously builds up the partition function. The free , internal  and entropic contributions are readily calculated from the partition function. Very good agreement in the resulting relative binding free energies was obtained between theory and experiment. The calculations allowed us to dissect out the enthalpic, entropic and solvation contributions to delta delta G. The contribution from desolvation was found to be relatively weak. The binding of these non-polar side-chains to thrombin is found to be driven mainly by favorable protein-ligand interactions rather than by the desire for non-polar groups to be desolvated.

Approximately 10% of gastric cancers also harbour Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the cancer cells(5,6). Following delivery into gastric epithelial cells via type IV secretion(7,8), the cagA-encoded CagA protein undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation on the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motifs initially by Src family kinases (SFKs) and then by c-Abl(9,10). Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA binds to the pro-oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and thereby deregulates the phosphatase activity(11,12), which has been considered to play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis(13). Here we show that the SHP2 homologue SHP1 interacts with CagA independently of the EPIYA motif. The interaction potentiates the phosphatase activity of SHP1 that dampens the oncogenic action of CagA by dephosphorylating the CagA EPIYA motifs. In vitro infection of gastric epithelial cells with EBV induces SHP1 promoter hypermethylation, which strengthens phosphorylation-dependent CagA action via epigenetic downregulation of SHP1 expression. Clinical specimens of EBV-positive gastric cancers also exhibit SHP1 hypermethylation with reduced SHP1 expression. The results reveal that SHP1 is the long-sought phosphatase that can antagonize CagA. Augmented H. pylori CagA activity, via SHP1 inhibition, might also contribute to the development of EBV-positive gastric cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989088>Identification of Inhibitors of MMPS Enzymes via a Novel Computational Approach.</a></h2><p>Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteinases that play complex and diverse roles in , which are vital for physiological development.

However, the structure of Lyve-1 and the nature of its interaction with ligand are obscure. Here we present new evidence that Lyve-1 is functionally distinct from CD44. Using truncation mutagenesis we confirm that Lyve-1 in common with CD44 contains an extended HA-binding unit, comprising elements flanking the N and C termini of the consensus lectin-like Link module, bridged by a third conserved disulfide linkage that is critical for HA binding. In addition, we identify six essential residues -87, -97, Arg-99, Asn-103, Lys-105, and Lys-108 that define a compact HA-binding surface on Lyve-1, encompassing the epitope for an adhesion-blocking monoclonal antibody 3A, in an analogous position to the HA-binding surface in CD44. The overtly electrostatic character of HA binding in Lyve-1 and its sensitivity to ionic strength (IC(50) of 150 mm NaCl) contrast markedly with CD44 (IC(50) > 2 m NaCl) in which HA binding is mediated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In addition, unlike the extended Link module in CD44, which binds HA efficiently when expressed as a soluble monomer (K(d) = 65.7 mum), that of Lyve-1 requires artificial dimerization, although the full ectodomain is active as a monomer (K(d) = 35.6 mum). Finally, full-length Lyve-1 did not form stable dimers in binding-competent 293T transfectants when assessed using bioluminescent resonance  transfer.

Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups according to the diet provided during pregnancy: control (C; 20% casein); V+I [5% casein + 2% L-valine (Val) + 2% L-isoleucine ()]; KYT [5% casein + 1.8% L-lysine (Lys) + 1.2% L-tyrosine () + 1% L-threonine (Thr)]; and BCAA (5% casein + 1.8% L-Leu + 1.2% L-Val + 1% L-). Maternal protein restriction reduced the growth and organ weight of the offspring of dams receiving the V+I and KYT diets compared with the C group. Supplementation with BCAA reversed this growth deficit, minimizing the difference or restoring the mass of organs and carcass , the liver and muscle protein, and the RNA concentrations compared with newborns in the C group (P < 0.05). These effects could be explained by the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, because phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of offspring of the BCAA group was greater than that in the C, V+I, and KYT groups. The present results identify a critical role for Leu in association with other BCAA in the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway for the control of altered intrauterine growth induced by a maternal low-protein diet.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25844930>Synthesis and pharmacology of halogenated δ-opioid-selective [d-Ala(2)]deltorphin II peptide analogues.</a></h2><p>Deltorphins are naturally occurring peptides produced by the skin of the giant monkey frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor). They are δ-opioid receptor-selective agonists. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a peptide, -d-Ala-(pI)Phe-Glu---Gly-NH2 3 (GATE3-8), based on the [d-Ala(2)]deltorphin II template, which is δ-selective in in vitro radioligand binding assays over the μ- and κ-opioid receptors. It is a full agonist in [(35)S]GTPγS functional assays and analgesic when administered supraspinally to mice. Analgesia of 3 (GATE3-8) is blocked by the selective δ receptor antagonist naltrindole, indicating that the analgesic action of 3 is mediated by the δ-opioid receptor. We have established a radioligand in which (125)I is incorporated into 3 (GATE3-8). The radioligand has a KD of 0.1 nM in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the δ receptor. Additionally, a series of peptides based on 3 (GATE3-8) was synthesized by incorporating various halogens in the para position on the aromatic ring of Phe(3). The peptides were characterized for binding affinity at the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, which showed a linear correlation between binding affinity and the size of the halogen substituent.

The residue chosen for mutation is one that was reported previously to accept fecosterol and yield a set 24-ethyl (idene) sterol products typical of plants, showing the amino acid residue is located close to the transient C25 carbocation intermediate in the active site. One group of mutants (aromatic) tested with the natural substrate zymosterol accelerated the C-methylation reaction (k(cat)/K(m)) whereas the other group of mutants (aliphatics) decreased catalytic competence as the amino acid side chain was downsized. Mutating to aromatic and assaying with the substrate analog designed as a suicide substrate 26,27-dehydrozymosterol favored C26-monol formation, whereas mutating to the aliphatic of smaller size favored C26-diol formation (a measure of enzyme alkylation). In no case was zymosterol converted to an intermediate that formed a C25-diol. Thermodynamic analysis (determination of E(a), DeltaG(double dagger), DeltaH(double dagger) and TDeltaS(double dagger)) for the C-methylation reaction performed by these enzymes assayed with the substrate and its analog or zymosterol paired with the "charged' high  intermediate (HEI) analogs 24(R,S)25,epiminolanosterol and 25-azalanosterol or "neutral" membrane insert ergosterol showed that mutation to aromatics can reduce inhibitor potency (measured as K(m)/K(i)), yet catalysis can improve in Trp81 by the introduction of a gain in free  associated with stabilization of the transition state of a rate-controlling step directed toward turnover. Alternatively, mutation to the smaller aliphatic amino acid side chains led to a destabilization in the active site structure which was accompanied by increases in the partition ratios associated with abortive complex formation. The results are explained by consideration of the functional differences attributed to Tyr81 substitution to aromatics and aliphatics of different size involved with cation-pi or hydrogen bonding interactions and in the activation barriers required of differing side chain conformations to orient the reactants in the direction of turnover versus enzyme inactivation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569279>Effects of graded levels of duodenal infusions of leucine on mammary uptake and output in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Four multiparous Holstein cows, each equipped with a duodenal cannula and an ultrasonic mammary blood flow probe, were assigned to a 4x4 Latin square to measure the effects of duodenal infusions of Leu (0, 40, 80 and 120 g/d) on lactational responses and mammary  of nutrients.

Premature termination on sense codons, for example, results in truncated proteins, whose accumulation could be detrimental to the cell. Nevertheless, some sense codons are prone to triggering premature termination, but the structural basis for this is unclear. To investigate premature termination, we determined a cryo-EM structure of the  70S ribosome bound with RF1 in response to a UAU () sense codon. The structure reveals that RF1 recognizes a UAU codon similarly to a UAG stop codon, suggesting that sense codons induce premature termination because they structurally mimic a stop codon. Hydrophobic interaction between the nucleobase of U3 (the third position of the UAU codon) and conserved -196 in RF1 is important for misreading the UAU codon. Analyses of RNA binding in ribonucleoprotein complexes or by amino acids reveal that -U packing is a frequent protein-RNA-binding motif with key functional implications.

We previously altered the enantioselectivity of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) by inserting the editing domain from phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (FRSed) between Gly 161 and  162 in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (the editing domain hydrolyzes l--tRNA but not d--tRNA). In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the enantioselectivity of this TyrRS-FRSed chimera can be shifted further toward the formation of d--tRNA by introducing activating mutations into the editing site. Yokoyama and colleagues previously identified six alanine substitutions in phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase that increase its editing activity.1 We have introduced these alanine substitutions into TyrRS-FRSed in various combinations, generating 14 different variants. To analyze their editing activity, we developed a continuous, spectrophotometric, steady-state post-transfer editing assay in which l--tRNA is generated in situ, resulting in the release of one molecule of AMP during each editing cycle. Post-transfer editing is monitored by coupling the release of AMP to the reduction of NAD(+) (via the actions of AMP deaminase and IMP dehydrogenase), resulting in an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. In general, TyrRS-FRSed variants containing two activating mutations are the most active, with additional alanine substitutions decreasing the activity of the editing domain. Linear free energy relationships indicate that high kcat values are correlated with high binding affinities for l--tRNA. Lastly, competition assays indicate that at least one TyrRS-FRSed variant (F145A/S211A) preferentially aminoacylates tRNA with d-tyrosine, demonstrating that the enantioselectivity of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase can be inverted using hyperactive editing domains.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7758002>The laminin alpha 1 chain -Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV)-containing peptide promotes liver  by human colon cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Laminin, a major basement membrane-specific glycoprotein, promotes the attachment, migration, and invasion of a variety of tumor cells.

This highly conserved amino acid almost makes direct contact with the distal histidine and has been postulated to affect ligand binding. The overall association rate constants for CO, O2, and NO binding were little affected by decreasing the size of residue 46 step-wise from Phe to Leu to Val to Ala. In contrast, the rates of CO, O2, and NO dissociation increased 4-, 10-, and 25-fold, respectively, for the same series of mutants, causing large decreases in the affinity of myoglobin for all three diatomic gases. The rates of autooxidation at 37 degrees C, pH 7.0 increased dramatically from approximately 0.1-0.3 h-1 for wild-type, -46, and Trp-46 myoglobins to 1.5, 5.2, 4.9, and 5.0 h-1 for the Leu-46, -46, Val-46 and Ala-46 mutants, respectively. Rates of NO and O2 geminate recombination were measured using 35 ps and 9 ns laser excitation pulses. Decreasing the size of residue 46 causes significant decreases in the extent of both picosecond and nanosecond rebinding processes. High resolution structures of Leu-46 and Val-46 metmyoglobins, Val-46 CO-myoglobin, and Val-46 deoxymyoglobin were determined by X-ray crystallography. When Phe-46 is replaced by Val, the loss of internal packing volume is compensated by (1) contraction of the CD corner toward the core of the protein, (2) movement of the E-helix toward the mutation site, (3) greater exposure of the distal pocket to intruding solvent molecules, and (4) large disorder in the position of the side chain of the distal histidine (His-64). In wild-type myoglobin, the van der Waals contact between C zeta of Phe-46 and C beta of His-64 appears to restrict rotation of the imidazole side chain. Insertion of Val at position 46 relieves this steric restriction, allowing the imidazole side chain to rotate about the C alpha - C beta bond toward the surface of the globin and about the C beta - C gamma bond toward the space previously occupied by the native Phe-46 side chain. This movement disrupts hydrogen bonding with bound ligands, causing significant decreases in affinity, and opens the distal pocket to solvent water molecules, causing marked increases in the rate of autooxidation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606463>Know your fish: A novel compound-specific isotope approach for tracing wild and farmed salmon.</a></h2><p>The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry with carnivorous fish such as salmon has been accompanied by an equally rapid development in alternative feed ingredients.

It acts as an immunoregulatory protein as well as a phenylpyruvate tautomerase. To understand better the relationship between these two activities and to elucidate the structural basis for the enzymatic activity, a crystal structure of a complex between murine MIF and (E)-2-fluoro-p-hydroxycinnamate, a competitive inhibitor of the tautomerase activity, has been determined to 1.8 A resolution. The structure is nearly superimposable on that of the free protein indicating that the presence of the inhibitor does not result in any major structural changes. The inhibitor also confirms the location of the active site in a hydrophobic cavity containing the amino-terminal proline. Within this cavity, the inhibitor interacts with residues from adjacent subunits. At the back of the cavity, the side-chain carbonyl  of Asn-97' interacts with the phenolic hydroxyl group of the inhibitor while at the mouth of the cavity the ammonium group of Lys-32 interacts with a carboxylate . The other carboxylate  of the inhibitor interacts with Pro-1. The hydroxyl group of -95' interacts weakly with the fluoro group on the inhibitor.

The optimum dietary Leu resulted in increased urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and choline and relatively decreased excretion of 2-aminoadipic acid, acetyl-dl-valine, , 2-methylbutyrylglycine, and . In conclusion, plasma glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid were discriminating metabolites to the optimum dietary . The optimum dietary Leu was associated with reduced plasma creatine and urinary 2-aminoadipic acid and elevated urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and choline. The optimum dietary Val had a less pronounced  response reflected in plasma or urine than other BCAA.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25649658>The Brain Hepatocyte Growth Factor/c-Met Receptor System: A New Target for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease increasing in frequency as life expectancy of the world's population increases. There are an estimated 5 million diagnosed AD patients in the U.S. and 16 million worldwide with no adequate treatment presently available. New therapeutic approaches are needed to slow, and hopefully reverse, disease progression. This review summarizes available information regarding an overlooked therapeutic target that may offer a treatment to slow and hopefully halt AD, namely the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met receptor system. Activation of the c-Met receptor stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, morphogenesis, the ability to mediate stem cell differentiation and neurogenesis, and protects against tissue insults in a wide range of cells including neurons. This growth factor system has recently been shown to induce dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis when stimulated by a newly developed angiotensin-based analogue, N-hexanoic---(6) amino hexanoic amide (Dihexa). This small molecule was derived from the pre-prototype molecule Nle1-angiotensin IV and has shown promise in facilitating the formation of new functional synaptic connections and augmenting memory consolidation in animal models of AD. Dihexa is a first-in-class compound that is orally active, penetrates the blood-brain barrier, and facilitates memory consolidation and retrieval. This angiotensin-based small molecule may be efficacious as a treatment for AD.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265780>[Analysis of amino acid composition of skim milk and buttermilk for the production of dairy drink when introducing whey protein hydrolysate].</a></h2><p>The imbalance of macronutrient composition of people's diets determines the relevance of the functional foods development - sources of protein and essential amino acids.  of the work was to analyze the amino acid composition and determine the functional significance of the product based on skim milk and buttermilk byadding whey protein hydrolysate. . The control options were samples of skimmed milk, buttermilk and their mixtures in a 1:1 ratio. From 1 to 3% of the whey protein hydrolysate with a degree of hydrolysis of about 60% of peptide bonds were added to the same milk base samplesin the experimental options. The amino acid composition was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using a cation exchange analyzer and subsequent post-column derivatization with ninhydrin. . The content of essential amino acids per 100 g of whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) is 50.6-168.0% from the adequate level of their daily intake, while there are only 3.0-22.3 and 2.6-19.9% in skimmed milk and buttermilk, respectively. Despite the practically equal protein content in skimmed milk and buttermilk 3.36±0.02 and 3.09±0.01%, respectively, the absolute content of all essential amino acids in buttermilk is lower than in skimmed milk. This can be explained by differences in the qualitative composition of proteins in these types of dairy raw materials. . The amino acid composition of the milk base, consisting of buttermilk and skimmed milk mixture in a 1:1 ratio, can be presented as «functional» product in relation to Val, , Leu, Lis, Trp and , due to the addition of 3% WPH, because the product portion of 200 g provides 15% of adequate daily intake of these essential amino acids.

Several active sites on laminin-1 have been identified previously. We modified these biologically active peptides to enhance their activities. The multimeric YIGSR (--Gly-Ser-Arg) peptides assembled on a branched lysine core were found to strongly enhance the activity of YIGSR in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. We also found the all-D-configuration peptide segment containing the IKVAV (-Lys-Val-Ala-Val) sequence had similar biological activities to the native all-L-peptide in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that these modified compounds are potentially useful for clinical applications. We have identified new active sequences from the laminin alpha 1 chain carboxyl-terminal globular domain (G domain). Using a systematic screening for cell binding sites with 113 overlapping synthetic peptides, we found five peptides (AG-10, AG-22, AG-32, AG-56, and AG-73) showed cell attachment activities with cell-type specificities. AG-10 and AG-32 were found to interact with integrins. AG-73 caused metastases of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells to the liver  in mice. Additionally AG-73 was found to promote neurite outgrowth. Moreover, this peptide inhibited laminin mediated acinar-like development of a human submandibular gland cell line. The AG-73 domain on laminin-1 could be one of the most important biologically active sites.

Leaf portions of the seed-derived plants were placed on an MS-medium fortified with different PGRs. Under 16hD/8hL, thidiazuron (TDZ; 4.0 mg L⁻¹) and BA (1.5 mg L⁻¹) was found to be the most effective (<90%) in callus induction. Two concentrations (1.5, 2.0 mg L⁻¹) of the IBA produced>80% shoots from callus cultures. Healthy shoots were transferred to rooting medium and higher percentage of rooting (<90%) was observed on IBA (1.5 mg L⁻¹). These in vitro tissues were subjected to amino acid analysis, spectrophotometry, and HPLC. ARG, SER, THR, and  were the most abundant components out of 17 amino acids. Higher amino acid production was observed under normal photoperiod (16hL/8hD) than under reverse photoperiod (16hD/8hL). The highest total phenolic content (TPC; 9.91 mg/g-DW) and flavonoid content (7.38 mg/g-DW) were observed in callus cultures incubated under 16hL/8hD than other tissues incubated under 16hD/8hL photoperiod. Higher DPPH and PoMo activities were observed in tissues incubated under 16hL/8hD photoperiod, while ABTS and Fe²⁺ chelating activities were found higher in tissues incubated under reverse photoperiod. Significant quantities of piperine content were observed in all tissues except callus cultures. These results suggest that reverse photoperiod is a promising approach for callus induction, phytochemicals and piperine production for commercial applications.Copyright © 2013 Académie des sciences.

A recent study of six different modeling software packages showed that they are more successful at predicting side chain conformations of core compared to surface residues. All the modeling software tested have multicomponent  functions, typically including contributions from solvation, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding and Lennard-Jones interactions in addition to statistical terms based on observed protein structures. We investigated to what extent a simplified  function that includes only stereochemical constraints and repulsive hard-sphere interactions can correctly repack protein cores. For single residue and collective repacking, the hard-sphere model accurately recapitulates the observed side chain conformations for , Leu, Phe, Thr, Trp,  and Val. This result shows that there are no alternative, sterically allowed side chain conformations of core residues. Analysis of the same set of protein cores using the Rosetta software suite revealed that the hard-sphere model and Rosetta perform equally well on , Leu, Phe, Thr and Val; the hard-sphere model performs better on Trp and  and Rosetta performs better on Ser. We conclude that the high prediction accuracy in protein cores obtained by protein modeling software and our simplified hard-sphere approach reflects the high density of protein cores and dominance of steric repulsion.© The Author 2017.

This study mainly focused on the large insoluble aggregates formed during proteolysis, and the influence of heating was further explored for a better understanding of the mechanism involved. The results from SDS-PAGE and amino acid analysis clearly showed that the insoluble aggregates formed upon hydrolysis were aggregated peptides, mainly attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between peptides with hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Ala, Leu, , , Phe, and Pro) and sulfur-containing (Met and Cys) residues. Heating of the hydrolysates further enhanced the peptide-protein interactions through hydrophobic forces and disulfide bonds, accelerating the aggregation, where fractions from the basic subunits of glycinin were particularly involved. Furthermore, taking into consideration the fact that aggregates had a high proportion of essential amino acids, the in vitro digestion properties of the aggregates were also investigated. Interestingly, the relatively pepsin-resistant aggregates showed a high degradability toward pancreatin, releasing low molecular weight peptides possessing a higher proportion of antioxidative amino acids, which therefore had a better antioxidant activity. These results indicated a potential use of the insoluble peptide aggregates as protein supplements or active delivery systems for human consumption.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19745556>Structural and mutagenic approach to create human serum albumin-based  carrier and photosensitizer.</a></h2><p>Human serum albumin (HSA) is a versatile protein found at high concentration in blood plasma and binds a range of insoluble endogenous and exogenous compounds. We have shown that complexation of functional molecules into HSA creates unique proteins never seen in nature. Complexing an iron-protoporphyrin IX into a genetically engineered heme pocket of recombinant HSA (rHSA) generates an artificial hemoprotein, which binds O(2) reversibly in much the same way as hemoglobin. A pair of site-specific mutations, (i) introduction of a proximal histidine at the -142 position and (ii) substitution of -161 with Phe or Leu, allows the heme to bind O(2). Additional modification on the distal side of the heme pocket provides rHSA(triple mutant)-heme complexes with a variety of O(2) binding affinity.

A bimane probe was covalently attached to a cysteine residue in a series of single-cysteine mutant proteins to scan each helix in a residue-by-residue fashion. A variety of fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore were measured for both the soluble and membrane-bound states of the channel peptide, including the fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence anisotropy, and membrane bilayer penetration depth. The fluorescence properties were collated for construction of a membrane-bound topology model of helices 4 and 5 of the channel domain. Finally, the data reveal that both helices 4 and 5 are two separate amphipathic alpha-helices that are situated parallel to the membrane surface. Dual fluorescence quencher analysis shows that helix 4 adopts a tilted topology in which its C-terminus is more buried than its N-terminus within the bilayer. In contrast, helix 5 is relatively solvent-exposed and located parallel to the interfacial region of the membrane surface. However, the loop region of both helices 4 and 5 was shown to be relatively buried within the bilayer. In addition, a least-squares fit of the data to a harmonic wave function indicated that both periodicity and frequency are typical for an amphipathic alpha-helix (3.75 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 4 and 3.70 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 5). Squared residual plots of the harmonic wave function also reveal that the N-terminus of helix 4 is elongated by two residues from Lys-406 to Phe-404, while the C-terminus of helix 5 is elongated by three residues from -434 to -437 upon membrane association.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8316244>[Superspiralized alpha-spiral. 2.

Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method).

Average ileal digestibilities of His, Thr, Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, , Leu, Met, Phe,  and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids.

In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, , Lys, Phe, Ser, Tau, Thr and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and ) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied.

More than 20 variants of these compounds were detected and characterized in detail. Mass spectrometric sequence analysis was performed by MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF fragment analysis. The obtained product ion spectra show a specific processing in the fatty acid part. GHPD is cleaved between the α- and ß-position yielding two fragments a and b, one bearing the end-standing guanidine group and another one comprising the residual two C-atoms of GHPD with the attached peptide moiety.

A collection of novel fusaricidins was detected differing from those of families 1-3 by an additional residue of 71 Da (family 4).

In parallel studies, the Co(phen)3(3+) oxidation kinetics of , Leu, , Ala, Ser, and Gly variants of the phylogenetically conserved residue Phe82 have been studied and correlated with previous electrochemical and kinetic results. To assist mechanistic interpretation of these results, the three-dimensional structures of the Asn52Ala and Ile75Met ferrocytochrome c variants have been determined. The reduction potentials of the variants modified in the region of Wat166 were at least 33 mV (pH 6, 25 degrees C, and mu = 0.1 M) lower than that of the wild-type protein. Electron transfer reactivity of this family of variants in both the oxidation and reduction reactions was increased as much as 10-fold over that of the wild-type cytochrome. On the other hand, the reactivity of the position-82 variants in both oxidation and reduction depended on the structural characteristics of the oxidation-reduction reagent with which they reacted, and this reactivity was related to the nature of the residue at this position. These findings have been interpreted as demonstrating that the principal influence of modification at position-82 arises from changes in the nature of reactant-protein interaction at the surface of the protein and in maintaining the high reduction potential of the cytochrome while the principal influence of internal modifications near Wat166 results from alteration of the reorganization  for the oxidation state-linked conformational change defined by crystallographic analysis of the wild-type protein.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755932>Relationships between postruminal casein infusion and milk production, and concentrations of plasma amino acids and blood urea in dairy cows: A multilevel mixed-effects meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The relationships between postruminal casein infusion and production variables and concentrations of plasma AA and blood urea were evaluated using multilevel mixed-effects models derived from literature data collected in dairy cows. The data set contained 147 treatment means [i.e., 66 controls (CTL) and 81 casein-infused (CAS) means]. Each CAS mean was paired with its corresponding CTL mean to create 81 mean differences (CAS minus CTL), which were analyzed as absolute and percentage-based units (i.e., percentage increase or decrease in CAS relative to CTL). The primary variable of interest was the difference in estimated metabolizable protein (MP) supply (ΔMP) between CAS and CTL. The other explanatory variables were based on levels in CTL: MP supply, MP balance, the ratio of duodenal microbial protein (MCP) to MP supply (MCPMP), the stage of lactation (early or mid/late) and the type of forage (grass/legume- or corn silage-based). The MP supply and MP balance influenced negatively the relationship between ΔMP and the response of true protein yield. Responses of milk urea, blood urea, and plasma urea cycle AA concentrations were associated positively with ΔMP, indicating that a large amount of infused AA was catabolized to urea. Responses of plasma essential AA concentrations were related positively to ΔMP. The relative effect of ΔMP was highest for responses of plasma His concentration in cows fed grass/legume-based diets and at high MCPMP ratios. This relationship suggests that positive responses of plasma His concentrations are associated with diets relying heavily on microbial protein synthesis (high MCP), low in crude protein (low estimated MP supply), or both. The relationship between ΔMP and responses of plasma group 2 AA (, Leu, Lys, and Val) concentrations was approximately 2 times greater than that for group 1 AA (His, Met, and Phe+) at mean MCPMP and MP supply. This could reflect the low hepatic removal group 2 AA compared with group 1 AA in dairy cows. Collectively, these results provide novel information on how dietary and cow conditions may alter responses to protein supplementation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

The results indicate that the binding of the peptide substrate or peptide inhibitor is entropically driven; i.e., it is characterized by an unfavorable enthalpy and a favorable entropy change, in agreement with a structure-based thermodynamic analysis based upon an empirical parameterization of the energetics. Dissection of the binding enthalpy indicates that the intrinsic interactions are favorable and that the unfavorable enthalpy originates from the  cost of rearranging the flap region in the protease molecule. In addition, the binding is coupled to a negative heat capacity change. The dominant binding force is the increase in solvent entropy that accompanies the burial of a significant hydrophobic surface. Comparison of the binding energetics obtained for the substrate with that obtained for synthetic nonpeptide inhibitors indicates that the major difference is in the magnitude of the conformational entropy change. In solution, the peptide substrate has a higher flexibility than the synthetic inhibitors and therefore suffers a higher conformational entropy loss upon binding. This higher entropy loss accounts for the lower binding affinity of the substrate. On the other hand, due to its higher flexibility, the peptide substrate is more amenable to adapt to backbone rearrangements or subtle conformational changes induced by mutations in the protease. The synthetic inhibitors are less flexible, and their capacity to adapt is more restricted. The expected result is a more pronounced effect of mutations on the binding affinity of the synthetic inhibitors. On the basis of the thermodynamic differences in the mode of binding of substrate and synthetic inhibitors, it appears that a key factor to understanding resistance is given by the relative balance of the different forces that contribute to the binding free  and, in particular, the balance between conformational and solvation entropy.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233758>L. donovani XPRT: Molecular characterization and evaluation of inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Among all PRT enzymes of purine salvage pathway in Leishmania, XPRT (Xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase) is unique in its substrate specificity and their non-existence in human. It is an interesting protein not only for drug designing but also to understand the molecular determinants of its substrate specificity. Analysis of the 3D model of L. donovani XPRT (Ld-XPRT) revealed that  209, Glu 215 and  208 may be responsible for the altered substrate specificity of Ld-XPRT. Comparisons with it's nearest homologue in humans, revealed significant differences between the two. A 28 residue long unique motif was identified in Ld-XPRT, which showed highest fluctuation upon substrate binding during MD simulations. In kinetic analysis, Ld-XPRT could phosphoribosylate xanthine, hypoxanthine and guanine with K values of 7.27, 8.13, 8.48μM and k values of 2.24, 1.82, 1.19min respectively. Out of 159 compounds from docking studies, six compounds were characterized further by fluorescence spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy and enzyme inhibition studies. Fluorescence quenching experiment was performed to study the binding of inhibitors with Ld-XPRT and dissociation constants were calculated. Four compounds are bi-substrate analogues and show competitive inhibition with both the substrates (Xanthine and PRPP) of Ld-XPRT. The CD spectral analysis revealed that the binding of inhibitors to Ld-XPRT induce change in its tertiary structure, where as its secondary structure pattern remains unchanged. Two Ld-XPRT inhibitors (dGDP and cGMP), which also have ability to inhibit Leishmanial HGPRT, are predicted as potential drug candidates as it can inhibit both the important enzymes of the purine salvage pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Gly and Ala variants with a smaller bulk size at position 483 predominantly afforded monocyclic camelliol C, which suggested that the orientation of the (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene substrate was not appropriately arranged in the reaction cavity as a result of the decreased bulk size, leading to failure of its normal folding into the chair-chair-chair-boat-boat conformation. The  variant, with a somewhat larger bulk, afforded β-amyrin as the dominant product. Intriguingly, various variants of Trp534 exhibited significantly decreased enzymatic activities and provided no aberrantly cyclized products, although the aromatic Phe and  residues were incorporated and the steric sizes of the aliphatic residues were altered. Therefore, the Trp534 residue does not stabilize the transient cation through a cation-π interaction. Furthermore, the Trp residue, with the largest steric bulk among all natural amino acids, is essential for high enzymatic activity. Robust CH-π complexation between the Val483 and Trp534 residues is proposed herein. Altering the steric bulk at the Met729 position afforded the pentacyclic skeletons. Thus, Met729 is positioned at the E-ring formation site.

However, the PFAA profiles within non-obese, but more insulin-resistant Asians are not well researched. Compared with Caucasians, Asian populations have more central adiposity, which is generally regarded as metabolically more adverse, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined whether PFAA profiling was at least one important factor mediating central adiposity and insulin resistance, and aid in cardiovascular risk assessment in healthy Asians with normal body weight.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 190 healthy men (n=87 with a mean±s.d. body mass index (BMI) of 23.5±3.5 kg/m) and women (n=103 with a mean±s.d. BMI of 21.4±3.7 kg/m) residing in Singapore took part in this study. PFAA levels were measured by using an amino acid analyzer. Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.Seven out of 18 amino acids were significantly correlated with measures of obesity (for example, waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio and BMI) in current participants. Among them, the plasma concentrations of five amino acids, including Phe, , Met, Ala and His were positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio. With the exception of His, which had no association with insulin resistance, Phe, , Met and Ala were significantly associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P<0.05). In contrast, no associations were observed between circulating BCAAs (that is, Val, Leu, ), measures of obesity and insulin resistance. However, significant inverse associations were observed between BCAAs and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein.We found that central adiposity was associated with alterations of specific amino acids. As a result, PFAAs may serve as metabolite predictors of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in healthy participants.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24226385>Interaction of angiotensin peptides and zinc metal ions probed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry experiments were used to provide evidence regarding the sites of interactions between zinc metal ions and angiotensin peptides.

Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles.

In the present study, an ortholog of goose-type lysozyme (ShLysG) from the big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) was identified and characterized structurally and functionally. The full-length cDNA sequence (1213 bp) of ShLysG is comprised of an open reading frame made up of 552 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 184 amino acid (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 20 kDa. In silico analysis of ShLysG revealed the absence of signal peptide and the presence of a characteristic bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) domain bearing three catalytic residues (Glu, Asp, and Asp) and seven N-acetyl-d-glucosamine binding sites (Glu, Asp, , His, , , and Asn). Homology analysis demonstrated that the aa sequence of ShLysG shared 60.7-67.4% identity and 72.6-79.3% similarity with the orthologs of other teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis of ShLysG indicated a closest relationship with the ortholog from Gadus morhua. In healthy seahorse, ShLysG mRNA showed a constitutive expression in all the tissues examined, with the highest expression in kidney and the least expression in liver. The ShLysG mRNA levels were also shown significant elevation upon the bacterial and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) challenges. Furthermore, lytic activities of ShLysG recombinant protein were detected against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species.

Evidence in  and type-2 diabetes suggests a role for a metabolic inflammasome ("metaflammasome") in mediating chronic inflammation in peripheral organs implicating IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and PKR (double-stranded RNA protein kinase). We hypothesized that these proteins are expressed in the brain in response to metabolic risk factors in AD. Neocortex from 299 participants from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies was analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the phosphorylated (active) form of IKKβ [pSer ], IRS1 [pS ], JNK [pThr / ] and PKR [pT ]. The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with metabolic disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKKβ and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKKβ and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKKβ and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR. The proteins were significantly associated with pathology in Alzheimer's participants with the relationship being inverse or not significant in participants without dementia. Expression of the proteins was not related to APOE genotype. These findings highlight a role for these proteins in AD pathophysiology but not necessarily as a complex.© 2016 The Authors.

The present study focused on the relationship between the gut  and the brain amino acids. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice were used as experimental models. Plasma and brain regions were sampled from mice at 7 and 16 weeks of age, and analysed for free d- and l-amino acids, which are believed to affect many physiological functions. At 7 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of d-aspartic acid (d-Asp), l-alanine (l-Ala), l-glutamine (l-Gln) and taurine were higher in SPF mice than in GF mice, but no differences were found at 16 weeks of age. Similar patterns were observed for the concentrations of l-Asp in striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and l-arginine (l-Arg), l-Ala and l-valine (l-Val) in striatum. In addition, the concentrations of l-Asp, d-Ala, l-histidine, l-isoleucine (l-), l-leucine (l-Leu), l-phenylalanine and l-Val were significantly higher in plasma of SPF mice when compared with those of GF mice. The concentrations of l-Arg, l-Gln, l- and l-Leu were significantly higher in SPF than in GF mice, but those of d-Asp, d-serine and l-serine were higher in some brain regions of GF mice than in those of SPF mice.

Computational models predicted that morelloflavone binds the putative allosteric pocket of Eg5, within the cavity surrounded by amino acid residues of -136, Glu-116, Glu-118, Trp-127, Gly-117, Ala-133, Glu-215, Leu-214 and -211.

Subsequent biochemical analysis in vitro confirmed that morelloflavone inhibited both the basal and microtubule-activated ATPase activity of Eg5 in a manner that does not compete with ATP binding. Morelloflavone also suppressed Eg5 gliding along microtubules.

Interestingly, within the module 6 catalytic unit, the effect of thiolation domain deletion differed from that of adenylation deletion. Absence of the T-domain resulted in a nonproductive strain, whereas deletion of the A-domain resulted in multiple assembly lines via module-skipping mechanism, generating three novel types of plipastatin derivatives, pentapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu), hexapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-), and octapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-Gln--).Notably, a unique module-skipping process occurred following deletion of the A-domain, which has not been previously reported for engineered NRPS systems.

That is, the enzymatic activities of the variants increased in proportion to the increase in π-electron density. Thus, the major function of Trp612 is to stabilize transient cations through a cation-π interaction. The Phe and  variants caused a distorted folding conformation, especially at the E-ring site, which generated the aberrantly cyclized products germanicol and lupeol. The L734G and L734A variants exhibited significantly decreased activities but yielded taraxerol in a high production ratio. The Val, , and Met variants showed markedly high activities (56-78 % of wild-type activity); therefore, appropriate steric bulk is required at this position. The aliphatic variants of Tyr736 showed markedly decreased activities, but the Phe mutant exhibited high activity (67 %), which indicates that the π electrons are critical for catalysis. Homology modeling indicated that Tyr736 and Leu734 are perpendicular to the substrate and are situated face to face, which suggests that a CH-π interaction occurs between Tyr736 and Leu734, reinforcing the protein architecture, and that Tyr736 cannot stabilize cationic intermediates through a cation-π interaction.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Translocated CagA is targeted by the membrane-recruited c-Src family kinases in which a tyrosine residue in the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA)-repeat region, which can be phosphorylated, induces cellular responses, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion and hummingbird phenotype formation. In this study, we explored the role of EPIYA-containing C-terminal domain (CTD) in CagA tethering to the membrane  rafts and in IL-8 activity. We found that disruption of the  rafts reduced the level of CagA translocation/phosphorylation as well as CagA-mediated IL-8 secretion. By CagA truncated mutagenesis, we identified that the CTD, rather than the N-terminal domain, was responsible for CagA tethering to the plasma membrane and association with detergent-resistant membranes, leading to CagA-induced IL-8 promoter activity.

These mutations revealed important electrostatic interactions that dampen the back-donation of the Fe(II) d(π) electrons into the CO π* orbitals. The most significant change occurred upon disruption of the H-bonds between the strictly conserved YxSxR motif and the heme propionate groups, producing two dominant CO-bound heme conformations. One conformer was structurally similar to Tt H-NOX WT, whereas the other displayed a decrease in ν(C-O) of up to ∼70 cm(-1) relative to the WT protein, with minimal changes in ν(Fe-CO). Taken together, these results show that the electrostatic interactions in the Tt H-NOX binding pocket are primarily responsible for the high ν(C-O) by decreasing the Fe d(π) → CO π* back-donation and suggest that the dominant mechanism by which this family modulates the Fe(II)-CO bond likely involves the YxSxR motif.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568370>Nutrient digestibility of solvent-extracted Brassica napus and Brassica juncea canola meals and their air-classified fractions fed to ileal-cannulated grower pigs.</a></h2><p>Energy and nutrient digestibility of solvent-extracted canola meal (CM) is limited in pigs by its relatively high fiber content. The seed hull, which greatly contributes to the fiber content of CM, is denser than the oil-free cotyledon. By utilizing streams of air, air classification partially separates these seed components on the basis of their different sizes and densities to produce a low-fiber, light-particle fraction and a high-fiber, heavy-particle fraction. Compared with parent CM, ADF and NDF were reduced by 31.9% and 29.5% in the light-particle fraction and were enriched by 16.5% and 9.0% in the heavy-particle fraction (DM basis), respectively. Particle size was 638, 18.9, and 76.1 µm for the parent CM and light- and heavy-particle fractions, respectively. To determine the nutrient digestibility of CM and their air-classified fractions, Brassica napus and B. juncea CM and their 2 air-classified fractions were evaluated in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement together with a basal diet and an N-free diet. The experiment was conducted as an 8 × 8 Latin square in which diets contained 40% B. napus or B. juncea CM or their air-classified fractions and 60% basal diet. Digesta data from pigs fed the N-free diet served to subtract basal endogenous AA losses. Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (32 kg initial BW) were fed the 8 diets at 2.7 times maintenance DE for eight 11-d periods. At the end of each period, feces were collected for 48 h, and ileal digesta were collected for two 12-h periods. The DE and calculated NE values and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE were 6.3%, 10.0%, and 7.8% greater (P < 0.001) for B. juncea CM than for B. napus CM; 6.1%, 10.8%, and 5.3% greater (P < 0.001) for the light-particle fraction than for parent CM; and 5.4%, 7.2%, and 3.8% lower (P < 0.001) for the heavy-particle fraction than for parent CM, respectively. The standardized ileal digestibilities (SID) of His, , Val, Asp, and  were greater (P < 0.05) for B. juncea CM than for B. napus CM. The SID of CP and AA were greater (P < 0.01) in the light-particle fraction than in the heavy-particle fraction. The SID of Trp, Glu, Pro, and  were greater (P < 0.05) in the light-particle fraction than in parent CM. In conclusion, B. juncea CM had greater energy and AA digestibility than B. napus CM because of reduced fiber content. Air classification of CM increased its energy and AA digestibility in the light-particle fraction for pigs because of the reduced dietary fiber content and decreased particle size.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8125961>Use of synthetic peptide libraries and phosphopeptide-selective mass spectrometry to probe protein kinase substrate specificity.</a></h2><p>To search for peptides which serve as substrates for protein kinases, an approach based on peptide libraries has been developed. These peptide libraries are chemically synthesized by a modified "divide-couple-recombine" strategy.

Negative ion LC-ESMS with stepped collision  is used to identify phosphorylated peptides in the enzyme reactions. As predicted, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is shown to preferentially phosphorylate Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) in a library consisting of 19 variants of Kemptide substituted at position 2. Additional experiments have been carried out on the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase v-Abl using a peptide library based on the v-Src autophosphorylation site (Arg-Arg-Leu--Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu--Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly). These results indicate that  is the optimal residue at the position N-terminal to tyrosine. Individual peptides containing the Glu-Asp-Ala-- motif have Vmax/Km values 6-fold higher than the peptide based on the autophosphorylation site itself, confirming the results of the library experiments.

In mammalian mitochondria, the initial step of the Fe-S cluster assembly process is assisted by the NFS1-ISD11 complex, which delivers sulfur to scaffold protein ISCU during Fe-S cluster synthesis. Although ISD11 is an essential protein, its cellular role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis is still not defined. Our study maps the important ISD11 amino acid residues belonging to putative helix 1 (Phe-40), helix 3 (Leu-63, Arg-68, Gln-69, -72, -76), and C-terminal segment (Leu-81, Glu-84) are critical for in vivo Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Importantly, mutation of these conserved ISD11 residues into alanine leads to its compromised interaction with NFS1, resulting in reduced stability and enhanced aggregation of NFS1 in the mitochondria. Due to altered interaction with ISD11 mutants, the levels of NFS1 and Isu1 were significantly depleted, which affects Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, leading to reduced electron transport chain complex (ETC) activity and mitochondrial respiration. In humans, a clinically relevant ISD11 mutation (R68L) has been associated in the development of a mitochondrial genetic disorder, COXPD19. Our findings highlight that the ISD11 R68A/R68L mutation display reduced affinity to form a stable subcomplex with NFS1, and thereby fails to prevent NFS1 aggregation resulting in impairment of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis. The prime affected machinery is the ETC complex, which showed compromised redox properties, causing diminished mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, the R68L ISD11 mutant displayed accumulation of mitochondrial iron and reactive oxygen species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with the phenotype observed in COXPD19 patients.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7700867>Molecular dynamics simulations of HIV-1 protease with peptide substrate.</a></h2><p>Molecular dynamics simulations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease with a model substrate were used to test if there is a stable energy minimum for a proton that is equidistant from the four delta  atoms of the two catalytic aspartic acids. The crystal structure of HIV-1 protease with a peptidic inhibitor was modified to model the peptide substrate Ser-Gln-Asn--Pro--Val-Gln for the starting geometry. A proton was positioned between the two closet  atoms of the two catalytic aspartic acids, and close to the carbonyl  of the scissile bond in the substrate. All crystallographic water molecules were included. Two molecular dynamics simulations were run: 30 ps with united-atom potentials and 40 ps using the more accurate all-atom potentials. The molecular dynamics used a new algorithm that increased the speed and allowed the elimination of a cut-off for non-bonded interactions and the inclusion of an 8 A shell of water molecules in the calculations. The overall structure of the protease dimer, including the catalytic aspartic acids, was stable during the course of the molecular dynamics simulations. The substrate and a water molecule, that is an important component of the binding site, were stable during the simulation using all-atom potentials, but more mobile when united-atom potentials were used. A Poincare map representation showed that the positions of the proton and its coordinating  atoms were stable for 93% of both simulations, although many of the buried and poorly accessible water molecules exchanged with solvent. The proton has a stable minimum energy position and maintains coordination with all four delta  atoms of the two catalytic aspartic acids and the carbonyl  of the scissile bond of the substrate. Therefore, a loosely bound hydrogen ion at this position will not be rapidly exchanged with solvent, and will rebond to either a catalytic aspartic acid or possibly the substrate.

The dependence of peptide helicity on N2 residue identity has been used to determine a free- scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory that includes a parameter for the N2  (n2). The rank order of DeltaDeltaG((relative to Ala)) is Glu(-), Asp(-) > Ala > Glu(0), Leu, Val, Gln, Thr, , Ser, Met, Asp(0), His(0), Arg, Cys, Lys, Phe > Asn, > Gly, His(+), Pro, . The results correlate very well with N2 propensities in proteins, moderately well with N1 and helix interior preferences, and not at all with N-cap preferences. The strongest energetic effects result from interactions with the helix dipole, which favors negative charges at the helix N terminus. Hydrogen bonds to side chains at N2, such as Gln, Ser, and Thr, are weak, despite occurring frequently in protein crystal structures, in contrast to the N-cap position. This is because N-cap hydrogen bonds are close to linear, whereas N2 hydrogen bonds have poor geometry.

This binding can be inhibited competitively by a specific pentapeptide sequence (--Gly-Ser-Arg) of the laminin B1 chain, and this peptide can prevent metastasis formation in vivo. However, other similar pentapeptide sequences (e.g., --Gly-Ser-Glu) have been found to be much less active in metastasis inhibition, raising the possibility that such amino acid substitutions produce structural changes responsible for altering binding to the laminin receptor. In this study, conformational  analysis has been used to determine the three-dimensional structures of these peptides.

During protein synthesis one of the labelled  atoms is removed, and thus release of the mono-labelled amino acid could be used to determine proteolysis. Primary cultures of embryonic-chick skeletal-muscle cells were used to test the use of 18(O2)-labelled Leu to measure proteolysis. For 9-day cultures, prelabelled on days 2-8 with medium containing one-half the Leu as [18O2]Leu and one-half as [2H3]Leu, release of [18(O)]Leu was less than 50% that of [2H]Leu over 24 h, suggesting a loss of the 18O label by a mechanism other than protein synthesis. Medium containing [18(O2)]Leu, [2H3]Leu, [18O2]Phe and [13C]Phe was then incubated with 9-day cultures to compare the rate of loss of the 18(O)-label from Leu and Phe with the rate of uptake of the non-carboxy--labelled amino acids. Results for Leu demonstrated an 81% loss of the 18(O) label compared with a 33% decrease in [2H]Leu over 12 h. Loss of the 18(O) label was four times as great for Leu as for Phe. Loss of the 18(O) label was not decreased by addition of cycloheximide or by addition of a 3-fold excess of , Val and ; thus the loss of label was not due to protein synthesis alone or to misbinding to incorrect tRNAs. Infusion of the isotopes into pigs showed that the 18(O) label of Leu was not lost during transamination to alpha-ketoisocaproate (alpha-oxoisohexanoate). The most probable explanation is that the 18(O) label is lost as a result of the enzymic deacylation of tRNA, that this process is substantially faster for Leu than for Phe, and that this represents a potentially costly futile cycle for Leu.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7430115>Amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of apoVLDL-II, a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins.</a></h2><p>ApoVLDL-II is a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins (Jackson, R.

Interaction of GRKs with activated receptors serves to stimulate their kinase activity. The extreme N-terminal helix (αN), the kinase small lobe, and the active site tether (AST) of the AGC kinase domain have previously been implicated in mediating the allosteric activation. Expanded mutagenesis of the αN and AST allowed us to further assess the role of these two regions in kinase activation and receptor phosphorylation in vitro and in intact cells. We also developed a bioluminescence resonance  transfer-based assay to monitor the recruitment of GRK2 to activated α(2A)-adrenergic receptors (α(2A)ARs) in living cells. The bioluminescence resonance  transfer signal exhibited a biphasic response to norepinephrine concentration, suggesting that GRK2 is recruited to Gβγ and α(2A)AR with EC50 values of 15 nM and 8 μM, respectively. We show that mutations in αN (L4A, V7E, L8E, V11A, S12A, Y13A, and M17A) and AST (G475I, V477D, and I485A) regions impair or potentiate receptor phosphorylation and/or recruitment.

Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of these mutants showed a distinctive negative peak at around 230 nm beside 220 nm, depending on the hydrophobicity of the amino acids introduced. The fluorescence intensity also increased in an order similar to that of the amino acids. These spectroscopic data suggest that the mutations do not affect the secondary structure, but strongly perturb the exciton coupling between Trp47 and Trp74. The free  of urea unfolding, deltaG(o)u, increased with increases in the side-chain hydrophobicity in the range 2.96-6.40 kcal x mol(-1), which includes the value for the wild-type enzyme (6.08 kcal x mol(-1)). The steady-state kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, also increased with increases in the side-chain hydrophobicity, with the M42W mutant showing the largest increases in Km (35-fold) and kcat (4.3-fold) compared with the wild-type enzyme. These results demonstrate that site 42 distal to the active site plays an important role in the stability and function of this enzyme, and that the main effect of the mutations is to modify of hydrophobic interactions with the residues surrounding this position.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28798365>Mass & secondary structure propensity of amino acids explain their mutability and evolutionary replacements.</a></h2><p>Why is an amino acid replacement in a protein accepted during evolution? The answer given by bioinformatics relies on the frequency of change of each amino acid by another one and the propensity of each to remain unchanged. We propose that these replacement rules are recoverable from the secondary structural trends of amino acids. A distance measure between high-resolution Ramachandran distributions reveals that structurally similar residues coincide with those found in substitution matrices such as BLOSUM: Asn ↔ Asp, P™he ↔ , Lys ↔ Arg, Gln ↔ Glu,  ↔ Val, Met → Leu; with Ala, Cys, His, Gly, Ser, Pro, and Thr, as structurally idiosyncratic residues. We also found a high average correlation ([Formula: see text] = 0.85) between thirty amino acid mutability scales and the mutational inertia (I  ), which measures the energetic cost weighted by the number of observations at the most probable amino acid conformation. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions follow two optimally-efficient principles: (a) amino acids interchangeability privileges their secondary structural similarity, and (b) the amino acid mutability depends directly on its biosynthetic  cost, and inversely with its frequency. These two principles are the underlying rules governing the observed amino acid substitutions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867576>Exploration of the Peptide Recognition of an Amiloride-sensitive FMRFamide Peptide-gated Sodium Channel.</a></h2><p>FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2)-activated sodium channel (FaNaC) is an amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activated by endogenous tetrapeptide in invertebrates, and belongs to the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily. The ENaC/DEG superfamily differs markedly in its means of activation, such as spontaneously opening or gating by mechanical stimuli or tissue acidosis. Recently, it has been observed that a number of ENaC/DEG channels can be activated by small molecules or peptides, indicating that the ligand-gating may be an important feature of this superfamily. The peptide ligand control of the channel gating might be an ancient ligand-gating feature in this superfamily. Therefore, studying the peptide recognition of FaNaC channels would advance our understanding of the ligand-gating properties of this superfamily of ion channels. Here we demonstrate that -131, Asn-134, Asp-154, and -160, located in the putative upper finger domain ofHelix aspersaFaNaC (HaFaNaC) channels, are key residues for peptide recognition of this ion channel. Two HaFaNaC specific-insertion motifs among the ENaC/DEG superfamily, residing at the putative α4-α5 linker of the upper thumb domain and the α6-α7 linker of the upper knuckle domain, are also essential for the peptide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. Chemical modifications and double mutant cycle analysis further indicated that those two specific inserts and key residues in the upper finger domain together participate in peptide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. This ligand recognition site is distinct from that of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) by a longer distance between the recognition site and the channel gate, carrying useful information about the ligand gating and the evolution of the trimeric ENaC/DEG superfamily of ion channels.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655798>The conserved Phe GH5 of importance for hemoglobin intersubunit contact is mutated in gadoid fish.</a></h2><p>Functionality of the tetrameric hemoglobin molecule seems to be determined by a few amino acids located in key positions. Oxygen binding encompasses structural changes at the interfaces between the α1β2 and α2β1 dimers, but also subunit interactions are important for the oxygen binding affinity and stability. The latter packing contacts include the conserved Arg B12 interacting with Phe GH5, which is replaced by Leu and  in the αA and αD chains, respectively, of birds and reptiles.Searching all known hemoglobins from a variety of gnathostome species (jawed vertebrates) revealed the almost invariant Arg B12 coded by the AGG triplet positioned at an exon-intron boundary. Rare substitutions of Arg B12 in the gnathostome β globins were found in pig, tree shrew and scaled reptiles. Phe GH5 is also highly conserved in the β globins, except for the Leu replacement in the β1 globin of five marine gadoid species, gilthead seabream and the Comoran coelacanth, while Cys and  were found in burbot and yellow croaker, respectively. Atlantic cod β1 globin showed a Leu/Met polymorphism at position GH5 dominated by the Met variant in northwest-Atlantic populations that was rarely found in northeast-Atlantic cod. Site-specific analyses identified six consensus codons under positive selection, including 122β(GH5), indicating that the amino acid changes identified at this position may offer an adaptive advantage. In fact, computational mutation analysis showed that the replacement of Phe GH5 with Leu or Cys decreased the number of van der Waals contacts essentially in the deoxy form that probably causes a slight increase in the oxygen binding affinity.The almost invariant Arg B12 and the AGG codon seem to be important for the packing contacts and pre-mRNA processing, respectively, but the rare mutations identified might be beneficial. The Leu122β1(GH5)Met and Met55β1(D6)Val polymorphisms in Atlantic cod hemoglobin modify the intradimer contacts B12-GH5 and H2-D6, while amino acid replacements at these positions in avian hemoglobin seem to be evolutionary adaptive in air-breathing vertebrates. The results support the theory that adaptive changes in hemoglobin functions are caused by a few substitutions at key positions.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3093430>Fengycin--a novel antifungal lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis F-29-3.</a></h2><p>Fengycin is an antifungal lipopeptide complex produced by Bacillus subtilis strain F-29-3.

The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, Thr, Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and Lys, consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and  ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, Lys, His, and Phe exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, , Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, , and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The strain grows heterotrophically on complex proteinaceous substrates or on appropriate salts plus amino acid mixtures and is also able to utilize maltose, starch, and pyruvate.

RasGRP2 is exceptional in that its C1 domain has very weak binding affinity (Kd = 2890 ± 240 nm for [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. We have identified four amino acid residues responsible for this lack of sensitivity. Replacing Asn(7), Ser(8), Ala(19), and (21) with the corresponding residues from RasGRP1/3 (Thr(7), (8), Gly(19), and Leu(21), respectively) conferred potent binding affinity (Kd = 1.47 ± 0.03 nm) in vitro and membrane translocation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in LNCaP cells. Mutant C1 domains incorporating one to three of the four residues showed intermediate behavior with S8Y making the greatest contribution. Binding activity for diacylglycerol was restored in parallel. The requirement for anionic phospholipid for [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding was determined; it decreased in going from the single S8Y mutant to the quadruple mutant. The full-length RasGRP2 protein with the mutated C1 domains also showed strong phorbol ester binding, albeit modestly weaker than that of the C1 domain alone (Kd = 8.2 ± 1.1 nm for the full-length protein containing all four mutations), and displayed translocation in response to phorbol ester. RasGRP2 is a guanyl exchange factor for Rap1. Consistent with the ability of phorbol ester to induce translocation of the full-length RasGRP2 with the mutated C1 domain, phorbol ester enhanced the ability of the mutated RasGRP2 to activate Rap1.

J., and Matthews, B. W. (1988) Nature 334, 406-410). Of the 13 mutant lysozymes made by site-directed mutagenesis, two variants, one with valine (I3V) and the other with tyrosine (I3Y), were crystallized and their structures solved. In this report we describe the crystal structures of these variants at 1.7 A resolution. While the structure of the I3V mutant is essentially the same as that of wild-type lysozyme, the I3Y mutant has substantial changes in its structure. The most significant of these are that the side chain of the tyrosine is not accommodated within the interior of the protein and the amino-terminal polypeptide (residues 1-9) moves 0.6-1.1 A relative to the wild-type structure. Using coordinates based on the wild-type and available mutant structures, solvent accessible surface area of residue 3 as well as the adjacent 9 residues in the folded form were calculated. The free  of stabilization based on the transfer of these residues from a fully extended form to the interior to the folded protein was found to correlate well with the protein stability determined by thermodynamic analysis. The enhanced thermostability of the variant -3----Leu, relative to wild-type lysozyme, can also be rationalized by surface-area calculations based on a model-built structure. Noncrystallization of most lysozyme variants at position 3 appears to be due to disruption of intermolecular contacts in the crystal. The -3----Val variant is closely isomorphous with wild-type and maintains the same crystal contacts. In the -3---- variant, however, a new set of contacts is made in which direct protein-protein hydrogen bonds are replaced by protein-water-protein hydrogen bonds as well as a novel hydrogen bond involving the phenolic hydroxyl of the substituted tyrosine.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185437>Crosslinked Network with Rotatable Binding Sites Based on Monocarboxylated α-Cyclodextrin [2]Rotaxane Capable of Angiotensin III Recognition.</a></h2><p>Synthetic receptors selective for target peptides or proteins have received attention because of their potential applications in the separation of biomolecules and biomedical diagnostics.

The crystal structures of the deoxy and oxy forms of the quadruple mutant were determined and compared with that of native Ascaris hemoglobin. (B10) myoglobin displays low O(2) affinity, high dissociation rate constants, and heterogeneous kinetic behavior, suggesting unfavorable steric interactions between the B10 phenol side chain and His(E7). In contrast, all mutants containing the (B10)/Gln(E7) pair show high O(2) affinity, low dissociation rate constants, and simple, monophasic kinetic behavior. Replacement of (107) with Phe enhances nanosecond geminate recombination singly and in combination with the (B10)/Gln(E7)/Arg(E10) mutation by limiting access to the Xe4 site. These kinetic results and comparisons with native Ascaris hemoglobin demonstrate the importance of distal pocket cavities in governing the kinetics of ligand binding. The approximately 150-fold higher O(2) affinity of Ascaris hemoglobin compared with that for (B10)/Gln(E7)-containing myoglobin mutants appears to be the result of favorable proximal effects in the Ascaris protein, due to a staggered orientation of His(F8), the lack of a hydrogen bonding lattice between the F4, F7, and F8 residues, and the presence of a large polar Trp(G5) residue in the interior portion of the proximal heme pocket.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26580610>Three Peptides from Soy Glycinin Modulate Glucose  in Human Hepatic HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>-Ala-Val-Pro-Gly-Glu-Val-Ala (IAVPGEVA), -Ala-Val-Pro-Thr-Gly-Val-Ala (IAVPTGVA) and Leu-Pro--Pro (LPYP), three peptides deriving from soy glycinin hydrolysis, are known to regulate cholesterol  in human hepatic HepG2 cells.
