Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid  and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular  accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

They play three major roles: energy , structural, and signaling. They are dynamic molecules strongly influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetics, diet, age, lifestyle, drugs, disease and inflammation. As precision medicine starts to become mainstream, there is a huge burgeoning interest in lipids and their potential to act as unique biomarkers or prognostic indicators. Lipids comprise a large component of all metabolites (around one-third), and our expanding knowledge about their dynamic behavior is fueling the hope that mapping their regulatory biochemical pathways on a systems level will revolutionize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and stratify major human diseases. Up to now, clinical  measurements have consisted primarily of total cholesterol or triglycerides, as a measure for cardiovascular risk and response to  lowering drugs. Nowadays, we are able to measure thousands of individual lipids that make up the lipidome. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) metabolomics is also being increasingly used in large cohort studies where it can report on total levels of selected  classes, and relative levels of fatty acid saturation. To support the application of lipidomics research,  MAPS was established in 2003, and since then has gone on to become the go-to resource for several  databases,  drawing tools, data deposition, and more recently lipidomics informatics tools, and a  biochemistry encyclopedia, LipidWeb. Alongside this, the recently established Lipidomics Standards Initiative plays a key role in standardization of lipidomics methodologies.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid  and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645268>The influence of post-infarct heart failure and high  diet on the expression of apelin APJ and vasopressin V1a and V1b receptors.</a></h2><p>Vasopressin and apelin are reciprocally regulated hormones which are implicated in the pathophysiology of heart failure and the regulation of ; however, little is known about their interactions under pathological conditions. In this study, we determined how post-infarct heart failure (HF) and a high  diet (HFD) affect expression of the apelin APJ receptor (APJR) and the V1a (V1aR) and V1b (V1bR) vasopressin receptors in the hypothalamus, the heart, and the retroperitoneal adipose tissue. We performed experiments in male 4-week-old Sprague Dawley rats. The animals received either a normal  diet (NFD) or a HFD for 8 weeks, then they underwent left coronary artery ligation to induce HF or sham surgery (SO), followed by 4 weeks of NFD or HFD. The HF rats showed higher plasma concentration of NT-proBNP and copeptin. The HF reduced the APJR mRNA expression in the hypothalamus. The APJR and V1aR protein levels in the hypothalamus were regulated both by HF and HFD, while the V1bR protein level in the hypothalamus was mainly influenced by HF. APJR mRNA expression in the heart was significantly higher in rats on HFD, and HFD affected the reduction of the APJR protein level in the right ventricle. The regulation of APJR, V1aR and V1bR expression in the heart and the retroperitoneal adipose tissue were affected by both HF and HFD. Our study demonstrates that HF and HFD cause significant changes in the expression of APJR, V1aR and V1bR, which may have an important influence on the cardiovascular system and .Copyright © 2019.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic  accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668661>Induction of membrane curvature by proteins involved in Golgi trafficking.</a></h2><p>The Golgi apparatus serves a key role in processing and sorting lipids and proteins for delivery to their final cellular destinations. Vesicle exit from the Golgi initiates with directional deformation of the  bilayer to produce a bulge. Several mechanisms have been described by which lipids and proteins can induce directional membrane curvature to promote vesicle budding.

It secretes unusually shaped nanotubular outer membrane vesicles (OMV) loaded with a number of virulence factors and immunoreactive proteins. In the present study, the vesicles were purified from a clinical isolate of subsp.  strain FSC200. We here provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of OMV using a novel approach in which a comparison of OMV and membrane fraction is performed in order to find proteins selectively enriched in OMV vs. membrane. Only these proteins were further considered to be really involved in the OMV function and/or their exceptional structure. OMV were also isolated from bacteria cultured under various cultivation conditions simulating the diverse environments of  life cycle. These included conditions mimicking the milieu inside the mammalian host during inflammation: oxidative stress, low pH, and high temperature (42°C); and in contrast, low temperature (25°C). We observed several-fold increase in vesiculation rate and significant protein cargo changes for high temperature and low pH. Further proteomic characterization of stress-derived OMV gave us an insight how the bacterium responds to the hostile environment of a mammalian host through the release of differentially loaded OMV. Among the proteins preferentially and selectively packed into OMV during stressful cultivations, the previously described virulence factors connected to the unique intracellular trafficking of  were detected. Considerable changes were also observed in a number of proteins involved in the biosynthesis and  of the bacterial envelope components like O-antigen,  A, phospholipids, and fatty acids.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular  content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic  fraction (HFF) and visceral  were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral  (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular  content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver  were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for -targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and diabetes, and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small  droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672943>TFEB activation in macrophages attenuates postmyocardial infarction ventricular dysfunction independently of ATG5-mediated autophagy.</a></h2><p>Lysosomes are at the epicenter of cellular processes critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal . Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal acid lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal  to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672758>Relationship of obstructive sleep apnoea severity and subclinical systemic atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<5, n=1096), mild OSA (5≤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-2.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTAC≥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial  volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=2.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial , as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647087>Daily red wine vinegar ingestion for eight weeks improves glucose homeostasis and affects the metabolome but does not reduce adiposity in adults.</a></h2><p>Some studies have reported that vinegar ingestion at mealtime attenuates postprandial glycemia in healthy adults and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts  and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral  were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral  were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic acid (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan . Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672941>Athletes feature greater rates of muscle glucose transport and glycogen synthesis during  infusion.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUNDInsulin resistance results from impaired skeletal muscle glucose transport/phosphorylation, linked to augmented  availability. Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic  availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0.2 [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased  availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks mitochondria down triggering metabolic rewiring in yeast.</a></h2><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate  droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole  suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646762>Blue light at night acutely impairs glucose tolerance and increases sugar intake in the diurnal rodent Arvicanthis ansorgei in a sex-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>In our modern society, the exposure to light at night (LAN) has increased considerably, which may impact human health negatively. Especially exposure to light at night containing short wavelength emissions (~450-500 nm) can disrupt the normal function of the biological clock, altering sleep-wake cycles and inducing metabolic changes. Recently, we reported that light at night acutely impairs glucose tolerance in nocturnal rats. However, light at night in nocturnal rodents coincides with their activity period, in contrast to artificial light at night exposure in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of blue (λ = 490 ± 20 nm) artificial light at night (bALAN) on glucose  and food intake in both male and female diurnal Sudanian grass rats (Arvicanthis ansorgei) fed either regular chow or a free choice high- high sucrose diet (HFHS). In both chow and HFHS fed male Arvicanthis, 1-hour of bALAN exposure induced a higher glucose response in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma insulin. Furthermore, in HFHS fed animals, bALAN induced an increase in sucrose intake during the dark phase in males but not in females. Additionally, 1-h of bALAN increased the nonfasted glucose levels together with plasma corticosterone in female grass rats. These results provide new and further evidence for the deleterious effects of exposure to short wavelength emission-containing artificial light at night on glucose  in a diurnal rodent in a sex-dependent manner.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of  in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several  classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty acids. This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty acids. The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and  homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change  concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in mitochondria, thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643424>Vitamin D.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D is a  soluble vitamin important in the regulation of calcium  and bone health and deficiency of which cause rickets, a disease marked by lack of mineralization of bone.

We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h2><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass.

Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve  signaling (linoleate ). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648564>Prednisone and Its Active Metabolite Prednisolone Attenuate  Accumulation in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Synthetic forms of glucocorticoids (GCs; eg, prednisone, prednisolone) are anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used in clinical practice. The role of GCs in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, is highly controversial, and their impact on macrophage foam cell formation is still unknown. We investigated the effects of prednisone and prednisolone on macrophage oxidative stress and .C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with prednisone or prednisolone (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, followed by  analyses in the aorta and peritoneal macrophages. We also analyzed the effect of serum samples obtained from 9 healthy human volunteers before and after oral administration of prednisone (20 mg for 5 days) on J774A.1 macrophage atherogenicity. Finally, J774A.1 macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations (0-200 ng/mL) of prednisone or prednisolone, followed by determination of cellular oxidative status, and triglyceride and cholesterol . Prednisone and prednisolone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, as observed in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. These effects were associated with GCs' inhibitory effect on triglyceride- and cholesterol-biosynthesis rates, through downregulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and HMG-CoA reductase expression. Glucocorticoid-induced reduction of cellular  accumulation was mediated by the GC receptors on the macrophages, because the GC-receptor antagonist (RU486) abolished these effects. In fibroblasts, unlike macrophages, GCs showed no effects.Prednisone and prednisolone exhibit antiatherogenic activity by protecting macrophages from  accumulation and foam cell formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651237>RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis during bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infection.</a></h2><p>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the member of the genus Pestivirus within the Flaviviridae family and responsible for severe economic losses in the cattle industry. BVDV can employ 'infect-and-persist' strategy and 'hit-and-run' strategy to remain associated with hosts and thus contributes to BVDV circulation in cattle herds. BVDV have also evolved various strategies to evade the innate immunity of host. To further understand the mechanisms by which BVDV overcomes the host cell innate immune response and provide more clues for further understanding the BVDV-host interaction, in this descriptive study, we conducted a investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the host during BVDV infection by RNA-Seq analysis.Our analysis identified 1297, 1732, 3072, and 1877 DEGs in the comparison groups mock vs. MDBK cells infected with BVDV post 2 h (MBV2h), mock vs. MBV6h, mock vs. MBV12h, and mock vs. MBV24h, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability of the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analyses of GO annotations and KEGG pathways revealed the host DEGs that are potentially induced by BVDV infection and may participate in BVDV-host interactions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the potential interactions among the DEGs. Our findings suggested that BVDV infection induced the upregulation of genes involved in . The expression of genes that have antiviral roles, including ISG15, Mx1, OSA1Y, were found to be downregulated and are thus potentially associated with the inhibition of host innate immune system during BVDV infection. The expression levels of F3, C1R, KNG1, CLU, C3, FB, SERPINA5, SERPINE1, C1S, F2RL2, and C2, which belong to the complement and coagulation signalling cascades, were downregulated during BVDV infection, which suggested that the complement system might play a crucial role during BVDV infection.In this descriptive study, our findings revealed the changes in the host transcriptome expression profile during BVDV infection and suggested that BVDV-infection induced altering the host's metabolic network, the inhibition of the expression of antiviral proteins and genes within the complement system might be contributed to BVDV proliferation. The above findings provided unique insights for further studies on the mechanisms underlying BVDV-host interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655086>Clinical Lipidomics In Understanding Of Lung Cancer: Opportunity And Challenge.</a></h2><p>Disordered  metabolisms have been evidenced in lung cancer as well as its subtypes. Lipidomics with in-depth mining is considered as a critical member of the multiple omics family and a -specific tool to understand disease-associated  and disease-specific dysfunctions of  species, discover biomarkers and targets for monitoring therapeutic strategies, and provide insights into  profiling and pathophysiological mechanisms in lung cancer. The present review describes the characters and patterns of lipidomic profiles in patients with different lung cancer subtypes, important values of comprehensive lipidomic profiles in understanding of lung cancer heterogeneity, urgent needs of standardized methodologies, potential mechanisms by -associated enzymes and proteins, and the importance of integration between clinical phenomes and lipidomic profiles. The characteristics of lipidomic profiles in different lung cancer subtypes are extremely varied among study designs, objects, methods, and analyses. Preliminary data from recent studies demonstrate the specificity of lipidomic profiles specific for lung cancer stage, severity, subtype, and response to drugs. The heterogeneity of lipidomic profiles and  may be part of systems heterogeneity in lung cancer and be responsible for the development of drug resistance, although there are needs for direct evidence to show the existence of intra- or inter-lung cancer heterogeneity of lipidomic profiles. With an increasing understanding of expression profiles of genes and proteins, lipidomic profiles should be associated with activities of enzymes and proteins involved in the processes of , which can be profiled with genomics and proteomics, and to provide the opportunity for the integration of lipidomic profiles with gene and protein expression profiles. The concept of clinical trans-omics should be emphasized to integrate data of lipidomics with clinical phenomics to identify disease-specific and phenome-specific biomarkers and targets, although there are still a large number of challenges to be overcome in the integration between clinical phenomes and lipidomic profiles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previously, we observed lower  oxidation in a porcine model of low birth weight. To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with  in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth weight (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth weight, diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary  was associated with decreased LD intermuscular  deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth weight groups.  uptake and intramuscular  deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis,  synthesis and transport increased in both birth weight groups.  uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary  reduction, LD mRNA associated with  synthesis and inter- and intramuscular  deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular  deposition increased in both birth weight groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle  associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth weight.

In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the microbiota-sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid . Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids.Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma.

It has been described that Zika virus impairs cell growth, raising a hypothesis about its oncolytic potential against cancer cells. ZIKV tumor cell growth inhibition was later confirmed for glioblastoma. It was also demonstrated that an inactivated ZIKV prototype (ZVp) based on bacterial outer membrane vesicles has antiproliferative activity upon other cancer cell lines, such as PC-3 prostate cancer cell. This study aims at understanding the pathways that might be involved with the antiproliferative effect of Zika virus against prostate cancer cells. A metabolomic approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis led to the identification of 21 statistically relevant markers of PC-3 cells treated with ZVp. The markers were associated with metabolic alterations that trigger  remodeling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammatory mediators, as well as disrupted porphyrin and folate . These findings highlight molecular signatures of ZVp-induced response that may be involved on cellular pathways triggered by its antiproliferative effect.

Thus, it might be a good strategy to decrease oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial changes in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we investigate the role of the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes in tertiary butyl-hydrogen (tBHP)-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Differentiated C2C12 muscle cells were pretreated with tBHP, followed by 1,25(OH)2D for additional 24 h. An exogenous inducer of oxidative stress, tBHP significantly increased oxidative stress,  peroxidation, intracellular damage, and cell death which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D in C2C12 myotubes. 1.25(OH)2D improves tBHP-induced mitochondrial morphological changes such as swelling, irregular cristae, and smaller size and number, as observed by transmission electron microscope. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D treatment increases mtDNA contents as well as gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1α, NRF1, and Tfam. Significant increments in mRNA levels related to antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, HMOX1, and TXNRD1, myogenic differentiation markers including myoglobin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and MHCІ and ІІ, and vitamin D  such as CYP24, CYP27, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated myotubes.

This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme "adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 2" (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide  binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolic turnover of PPIn species has received immense attention due to the essential functions of these lipids as universal regulators of membrane biology and their dysregulation in numerous human pathologies. The diverse functions of PPIn lipids occur, in part, by orchestrating the spatial organization and conformational dynamics of peripheral or integral membrane proteins within defined subcellular compartments. The emerging role of stable contact sites between adjacent membranes as specialized platforms for the coordinate control of ion exchange, cytoskeletal dynamics, and  transport has also revealed important new roles for PPIn species. In this review, we highlight the importance of membrane contact sites formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) for the integrated regulation of PPIn  within the PM. Special emphasis will also be placed on non-vesicular  transport during the control of the PtdIns biosynthetic cycle as well as towards balancing the turnover of the signaling PPIn species that define PM identity.

The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664920>Phenome-wide association analysis of LDL-cholesterol lowering genetic variants in PCSK9.</a></h2><p>We characterised the phenotypic consequence of genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus and compared findings with recent trials of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9.Published and individual participant level data (300,000+ participants) were combined to construct a weighted PCSK9 gene-centric score (GS). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration.The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma  and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials. ORs with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95% CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimer's disease - outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.Genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus recapitulates the effects of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 on major blood  fractions and MI.

We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic acid or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant  accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of diabetes mellitus, when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac metabolic signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and .</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet  in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high- diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced  accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced  deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell  accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

In recent years, lignin has attracted renewed interest as a feedstock for bio-based chemicals via catalytic and biological approaches and has emerged as a target for genetic engineering to improve lignocellulose digestibility by altering its composition. In lignin biosynthesis and microbial conversion, small phenolic lignin precursors or degradation products cross membrane bilayers through an unidentified translocation mechanism prior to incorporation into lignin polymers (synthesis) or catabolism (bioconversion), with both passive and transporter-assisted mechanisms postulated. To test the passive permeation potential of these phenolics, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for 69 monomeric and dimeric lignin-related phenolics with 3 model membranes to determine the membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients for each compound. The results support an accessible passive permeation mechanism for most compounds, including monolignols, dimeric phenolics, and the flavonoid, tricin. Computed lignin partition coefficients are consistent with concentration enrichment near  carbonyl groups, and permeability coefficients are sufficient to keep pace with cellular . Interactions between methoxy and hydroxy groups are found to reduce membrane partitioning and improve permeability. Only carboxylate-modified or glycosylated lignin phenolics are predicted to require transporters for membrane translocation. Overall, the results suggest that most lignin-related compounds can passively traverse plant and microbial membranes on timescales commensurate with required biological activities, with any potential transport regulation mechanism in lignin synthesis, catabolism, or bioconversion requiring compound functionalization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657086>PRRX1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma activates the metabolic reprogramming of free fatty acids to promote invasion and metastasis.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences demonstrate a close correlation between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction and cancer . However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clarified.In our study, the relative expression level of PRRX1 was detected, its relationship with free fatty acid (FFA) and PPARG2 was analysed in 85 SACC tissues and 15 salivary glands from the benign salivary tumours. We also compared the FFAs composition and levels in these SACC cells. PPARG2 was detected in PRRX1-induced FFAs treatment as well as Src and MMP-9 were detected in FFAs treatment-induced invasion and migration of SACC cells, and ChIP test was performed to identify the target interactions.Our data showed that overexpression of PRRX1 induced EMT and facilitated the invasion and migration of SACC cells, and PRRX1 expression was closely associated with high FFAs level and poor prognosis of SACC patients. Furthermore, PRRX1 silence led to the increase of PPARG2 and the reduction of FFAs level and the migration and invasion of SACC cells. And inhibition of PPARG2 rescued FFAs level and migration and invasion capabilities of SACC cells. Free fatty acids treatment induced an increase of Stat5-DNA binding activity via Src- and MMP-9-dependent pathway.Collectively, our findings showed that the PRRX1/PPARG2/FFAs signalling in SACC was important for accelerating tumour metastasis through the induction of EMT and the metabolic reprogramming of FFAs.© 2019 The Authors.

FXR plays critical roles in other  metabolic pathways, including  oxidation; however, little is known about cafestol's effects on fatty acid . Thus, the goal was to investigate cafestol's effects on fatty acid  using Caenorhabditis elegans. Cafestol at 60 µM reduced  accumulation and increased locomotor activity (an indicator of energy expenditure) by 20% and 38%, respectively, compared to the control. Cafestol's effects were dependent on daf-12 (a functional homolog of the human FXR) with upregulation of ech-1.1 (a homolog of enoyl-CoA hydratase involved in fatty acid β-oxidation) and tub-1 (an ortholog of the human TUBBY involved in the neurological regulation of energy expenditure) without any effects on lipogenesis, lipolysis or  uptake and transport.

Similar experiments were also performed with leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice.The results showed that the HFD group presented decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, /CD36 and NPC1L1, and increased NHE3, MTTP and L-FABP content. Animals fed an HFD also presented enhanced  transporter gene expression of , , ,  and . Additionally, /CD36 and NPC1L1 protein levels were reduced in both HFD-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. Ob/Ob mice also exhibited increased  and  mRNAs expression, but the protein expression levels remained unchanged. The HFD also attenuated PKA and PKC activities. The inhibition of PKA was associated with decreased /CD36 content, whereas increased L-FABP levels likely depend on CREB activation, independent of PKA. It is plausible that the HFD-induced changes in NPC1L1, MTTP and L-FABP protein content involve regulation at the level of transcription. Moreover, the changes in GLUT2 and PEPT1 content might be associated with low PKC activity.The results indicated that an HFD is capable of reducing nutrient transporter content, possibly attenuating nutrient uptake into the intestine, and may represent a feedback mechanism for regulating body weight. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NHE3, L-FABP and MTTP may account for the increased prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. All of these changes are potentially linked to reduced PKA or PKC activities.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646823>Correlations of recurrence after radical surgery for esophageal cancer with glucose-, insulin resistance, inflammation, stress and serum p53 expression.</a></h2><p>Esophageal cancer mortality trends vary substantially across the world.

The pathological significance of STAT5A in gastric cancer was explored by GESA assay, and the molecular mechanism of STAT5A-mediated FASN expression was investigated by Luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR. Fatty acid metabolic change was explored by detecting the content of neutral , triglycerides, and phospholipids in STAT5A silenced MKN28 and AGS cells. Furthermore, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation, and Mouse xenograft were used to detect the function of STAT5A-mediated fatty acid  on tumorigenic ability of gastric cancer cells.Upregulated STAT5A in gastric cancer was found to be not only an unconventional risk for over survival of gastric cancer patients, but also associated with fatty acid  signaling. Furthermore, STAT5A can regulate the expression of the fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) by binding to the promoter of FABP5 in MKN28 and AGS cells.

The growth status of abdominal  during postnatal late development ultimately affects meat yield and quality in chickens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in the biological processes involved in adipose tissue development. However, few studies have investigated miRNA expression profiles and their interaction networks associated with the postnatal late development of abdominal adipose tissue in chickens.We constructed four small RNA libraries from abdominal adipose tissue obtained from Chinese domestic Gushi chickens at 6, 14, 22, and 30 weeks. A total of 507 known miRNAs and 53 novel miRNAs were identified based on the four small RNA libraries. Fifty-one significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs were identified from six combinations by comparative analysis, and the expression patterns of these SDE miRNAs were divided into six subclusters by cluster analysis. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the SDE miRNAs were primarily involved in the regulation of  cell differentiation, regulation of , regulation of fatty acid , and unsaturated fatty acid  in the - or deposition-related biological process categories. In addition, we constructed differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA interaction networks related to abdominal adipose development. The results showed that miRNA families, such as mir-30, mir-34, mir-199, mir-8, and mir-146, may have key roles in , adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and cell junctions during abdominal adipose tissue development in chickens.This study determined the dynamic miRNA transcriptome and characterized the miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in Gushi chicken abdominal adipose tissue for the first time.

The aberrantly expressed methylation‑driven genes in HCC and normal tissues were identified using the Limma package and the MethylMix algorithm. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and ConsensusPathDB were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct a prognostic risk model of HCC. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the clinical utility of the risk model. A total of 238 methylation‑driven genes were successfully identified from cancer and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis indicated that these genes functioned in the extracellular space, interfering with  in hepatocytes and regulating adaptive immune responses. In total, 14 relevant pathways were identified. The following prognostic risk model was generated: Risk score=CALML3 (degree of methylation) x (‑4.860) + CCNI2 x (2.071) + TNFRSF12A x (‑3.369) + IFITM1 x (1.203) + ENPP7P13 x (‑1.366) + DDT x (2.139) + RASAL2‑AS1 x (‑1.384) + ANKRD22 x (‑3.215). The median risk score (0.970) derived from this model was set as cutoff value for assigning patients to high‑ or low‑risk group. The 5‑year survival rate was 35.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.1‑47.4%] in the high‑risk group and 61.7% (95% CI=51.4‑74.2%) in the low‑risk group (P<0.0001). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.742, indicating that this model is appropriate for predicting the survival rate of patients. Furthermore, the methylation and expression levels of two key genes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12A and D‑dopachrome decarboxylase, were significantly associated with prognosis and were correlated with cg00510447, cg26808293, cg11060661 and cg16132339 methylation.

Herein, the effects of recombinant BTI (rBTI) on  accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans were studied. rBTI prevented  accumulation under normal and high glucose conditions, and led to significantly shorter body widths without affecting C. elegans feeding behavior. Results also indicate that rBTI altered  breakdown, synthesis, and accumulation by altering the transcription, expression and activity of key enzymes in lipolysis and  synthesis. In daf-2 and daf-16 mutants, rBTI did not prevent  accumulation, indicating that rBTI activity relies on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway.

However, mutations in genes that control chromosome segregation are rare in human tumors as these mutations reduce cell fitness. Screening experiments indicate that the knockdown of multiple classes of genes that are not directly involved in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy induction. The possible contribution of these genes to cancer formation remains yet to be defined. Here we identified gene knockdowns that lead to an increase in aneuploidy in checkpoint-deficient human cancer cells. Computational analysis revealed that the identified genes overlap with recurrent mutations in human cancers. The knockdown of the three strongest selected candidate genes (ORP3, GJB3, and RXFP1) enhances the malignant transformation of human fibroblasts in culture. Furthermore, the knockout of Orp3 results in an aberrant expansion of lymphoid progenitor cells and a high penetrance formation of chromosomal instable, pauci-clonal B-cell lymphoma in aging mice. At pre-tumorous stages, lymphoid cells from the animals exhibit deregulated phospholipid  and an aberrant induction of proliferation regulating pathways associating with increased aneuploidy in hematopoietic progenitor cells.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular  contributes to malignant transformation and progression.  is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642410>Design and development of novel transdermal nanoemulgel for Alzheimer's disease: Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and biochemical investigations.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with depletion of acetylcholine. Oral treatment with tacrine hydrochloride; a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, finds limited use in Alzheimer's disease due to frequent dosing, hepatotoxicity and extensive pre-systemic .The objective of the study was to evaluate pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety and stability profile of transdermal w/o nanoemulsion gel of tacrine hydrochloride and determine its relative bioavailability from transdermal nanogel in contrast to marketed capsule and conventional hydrogel.The optimized nanoemulsion gel NEGT4 (droplet size 156.4 ±0.48 nm, with poly dispersity index 0.36 ±0.4, permeation flux 6.172±2.94 μg/cm2/h across rat skin) was prepared by spontaneous emulsification followed by sonication. NEGT4 contained 7 mg of drug in 10% w/w distilled water, 30% w/w surfactant (Labrafil M) and cosurfactant (Transcutol P) mixture in ratio 1:4 and 60 % Capryol 90 as oily phase thickened with 98.9 mg ethyl cellulose (20 cps). In vivo studies were carried out on male Wistar rats following standard guidelines. Scopolamine was used to induce amnesia in rats which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Various formulations were compared by performing pharmacokinetic, histopathological, behavioural and biochemical studies on rats. Stability studies on nanoemulsion gels were carried out in accordance with The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.Pharmacokinetic studies exhibited significantly greater extent of absorption from NEGT4 in comparison to capsule and hydrogel with a 2.18 & 5.26-fold increase respectively. Significant improvement in neurobehavioral parameters was observed with NEGT4 in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Biochemical assessment showed superior anti-amnesic activity of NEGT4 through augmentation of antioxidant enzymes, decreased  peroxidation & acetylcholinesterase activity. Low value of serum aminotransferase in rats treated with NEGT4 indicated absence of hepatotoxicity. NEGT4 was found to be non-irritant and possessed a shelf life of 4.11 years.Developed nanoemulsion gel of tacrine hydrochloride was found to be safe, stable, and efficacious and has immense potential to be used in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654514>Impact of Lopinavir/ritonavir-and Efavirenz-based Antiretroviral Therapy on the  Profile of Chinese HIV/AIDS Treatment-naïve Patients in Beijing: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with  abnormalities that contribute to increasing risk of cardiovascular (CV) events among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

This study aimed to examine the changes in  profile among patients with HIV/AIDS who initiated lopinavir/ritonavir LPV/r or efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral treatment regimens, which continue to be widely used China and other developing countries.This is a retrospective, matched case control study of HIV-positive patients initiating either LPV/r or EFV regimens at the Beijing You'an Hospital, Capital Medical University between July 2012 and January 2017. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the differences in total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides [TG], low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C], and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C] at baseline and up to 24-months after ART initiation between the two treatment arms.Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, CD4 cell count, viral load, and serum lipids, which were comparable between the two groups. The LPV/r-based regimen group had increased TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C after 24-months of treatment. In the EFV-regimen group, TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C were increased compared to baseline, while the TC/HDL-C ratio decreased, and TG did not change significantly. After 24-months of treatment, the percentage of patients with dyslipidemia in the LPV/r group was much higher than in the EFV group (84.0% vs. 52.6%, P<0.001), and 17(10%) patients on LPV/r-based regimens had severe dyslipidemia. Patients on LPV/r-based regimens were at increased odds of hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR]=1.709, P=0.038), hypertriglyceridemia (OR=4.315, P<0.001), and high TC/HDL-C ratio (OR=1.951, P=0.003). However, no significant difference was found in HDL-C (OR=1.246, P=0.186) or LDL-C (OR=1.253, P=0.410) between the treatment groups.Both LPV/r or EFV treatment regimens impacted patients'  profile. Compared to EFV-based regimens, patients on LPV/r-based regimens had increased odds of dyslipidemia, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or high TC/HDL-C ratio; however, there was no obvious effect on LDL-C, which is more relevant to the development of cardiovascular disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663569>Daily consumption of fruit-flavored yoghurt enriched with vitamins B contributes to lower energy intake and body weight reduction, in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Yoghurt naturally contains vitamins of B-complex which play a central role in energy . This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on body weight management and glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non- yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects  in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644883>Healthy lifestyle moderates the relationship between cardiovascular disease with blood pressure, body composition, carotid intima-media thickness, and glycated hemoglobin among adults.</a></h2><p>We investigate whether the adherence to healthy lifestyle recommendations (regular physical activity, healthy diet, reduced alcohol consumption, non-smoking) moderates the relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and their risk factors (obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension) with clinical variables among adults.

We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and  to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of 5-oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

Furthermore, several bioinformatic findings would be validated. Pathogenetic targets of CRC and pharmacological targets of Oxyres were identified by web-available databases. All identifiable biotargets were collected for functional enrichment analyses to reveal the biological processes and signaling pathways of Oxyres treating CRC. In addition, human CRC, non-CRC samples, and cell line study were used to validate the predictive biotargets of Oxyres treating CRC. In network pharmacological analyses, top therapeutic targets of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1), hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS), GTPase HRas (HRAS), and cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) in Oxyres treating CRC were identified, respectively. As shown in functional analysis, biological processes of Oxyres treating CRC were mainly involved in modulating cell communication, signal transduction, apoptosis, cell motility, cell proliferation, and . Furthermore, top 10 signaling pathways of Oxyres treating CRC were identified, respectively. In human study, CRC samples resulted in increased neoplastic expressions of Ki-67, MAPK1, IGF1, characterized with clinical imaging inspection, pathological diagnosis, and altered blood lipids in these CRC cases. In cell culture study, Oxyres-dosed CRC cells exhibited reduced cell proliferation, promoted cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, significantly decreased proteins of intracellular Ki-67, MAPK1, and IGF1 were observed in Oxyres-dosed cells when compared to those in controls. Collectively, anti-CRC pharmacological activity of Oxyres may be mainly associated with induction of apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation as revealed in bioinformatic findings. In addition, all core biotargets and molecular mechanisms of Oxyres treating CRC are unveiled respectively. Interestingly, the identifiable MAPK1, IGF1 biotargets may be potential molecules for treating and screening CRC.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654717>Identification of Nogo-B as a new molecular target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing chronic liver disease worldwide which can lead to liver cirrhosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays an important role in lipogenesis. Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the liver of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a liver specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high- diet (HFD) induced fatty liver associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo-B levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced fatty liver and Nogo-B expression. In summary, our study identifies Nogo-B as a new molecular target of PPARγ, and suggests increased Nogo-B might be a potential indicator for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019.

Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein 2 driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200 IU·kg) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. ΔEpoR mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein 2 ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated ΔEpoR mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and ΔEpoR-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and adipogenesis, while ΔEpoR bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis. In summary, endogenous erythropoietin signaling regulates bone marrow stromal cell fate and aberrant erythropoietin levels result in their impaired differentiation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656670>Discovery of potential plasma protein biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction via proteomics.</a></h2><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an acute disease with high mortality and seriously threatens human health. The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins,  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

But the molecular signatures related to the mechanism of HF have not been systematically explored. Here, we present comprehensive proteomic analysis of EAT in HF patients and non-HF patients as controls. A total of 771 proteins were identified in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Amongst them, 17 increased in abundance in HF and seven decreased. They were involved in HF-related processes including inflammation and oxidative stress response and lipid . Of these proteins, serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (Serpina3) levels in EAT were highly up-regulated in HF, with HF/non-HF ratio of 4.63 (P = .0047). Gene expression of Serpina3 via quantitative polymerase chain reaction was significantly increased in the HF group. ELISA analysis confirmed a significant increase in circulating plasma Serpina3 levels in the HF group (P = .004). In summary, for the first time, we describe that parts of EAT proteome may be reactive and work as modulators of HF. Our profiling provides a comprehensive basis for linking EAT with pathogenesis of HF. Understanding the role of EAT may offer new insights into the treatment of HF.© 2019 The Authors.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of - and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal  alters circulating  metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min resulted in a significant decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine (PC) content, intensification of  peroxidation (LPO), and inhibition of the antioxidant system (AOS) in cardiomyocytes. Uridine in a dose of 30 mg/kg, administered intravenously prior to reperfusion, had a protective effect on myocardial  in the I/RP zone. It prevented the decrease of ATP and PC, limited the LPO processes, evaluated by the content of  hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes, and improved the AOS state by, preventing the decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increasing the content of reduced glutathione (GSH). The mitoKATP-channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD, 5 mg/kg) eliminated the ability of uridine to maintain the ATP level and to exhibit its positive effect on the intensity of the LPO and activity of AOS.

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced obesity mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine  accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of adipogenesis by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and total  mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related  in the central nervous system, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high  diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated  could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase 2)-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high- diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated  activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated  does not. The high saturated  diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured  diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated  diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated  diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac  to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac  overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671741>Physical Activity and/or High Protein Intake Maintains -Free Mass in Older People with Mild Disability; the Fukuoka Island City Study: A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Body composition changes with age, with  mass (FM) increasing and -free mass (FFM) decreasing. Higher physical activity and high or adequate protein intake are thought to be beneficial in preventing the loss of skeletal muscle mass in the elderly. We aimed to investigate the relationships between physical activity, protein intake, and FFM in older people with mild disability. Total energy expenditure (TEE) under free-living conditions was assessed using the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method, and physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometer. Dietary intake was assessed using a self-recorded food intake diary during the DLW period.

In multiple linear regression analysis, when PAL, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), or protein intake were included, 31%, 32%, and 55%, respectively, of the variation in %FFM was explained. Moreover, the addition of both PAL/MVPA and protein intake explained 61%/60%, respectively, of the variation in %FFM.

Atherosclerotic vascular complications greatly contribute to morbidity and mortality in diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the relation of  peroxidation and interleukin-6 with carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus.This cross-sectional study included 90 type 2 diabetes mellitus male patients with age ≥ 40 years and 30 healthy male subjects matched for age. All of them were subjected to measuring of 8-iso prostaglandin F2α as a marker of  peroxidation, interleukin-6 and carotid intima media thickness as a marker of carotid atherosclerosis.Both 8-iso prostaglandin F2α and interleukin-6 were found to have significant positive correlation with carotid intima media thickness ( < 0.001) and both were found to be significant predictors of the presence of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in multiple regression analysis. peroxidation and interleukin-6 may play an important role in atherogenesis in type 2 diabetes mellitus and limiting their effects may reduce atherosclerotic vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The two isoforms, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), are differentially expressed, with the former expressed predominantly in metabolically active tissues and the latter more ubiquitously. Both are activated by oxidised cholesterol metabolites, endogenously produced oxysterols. LXRs have important roles in  and inflammation, plus a number of newly emerging roles. They are implicated in regulating  balance in normal male reproductive function and may provide a link between male infertility and  disorders and/or obesity.

NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance, obesity and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate  to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and energy  including glucose and  during inflammatory conditions.

Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the metabolic pathways that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving  is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar  mixtures, and milk  globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic  concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body  percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and  droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated  droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and  in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669255>Time-resolved Phosphoproteomic Analysis Elucidates Hepatic 11,12-Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid Signaling .</a></h2><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are potent lipid mediators with well-established effects in vascular tissues. Recent studies indicated an emerging role of these eicosanoids in  diseases and the EET signaling pathway was shown to be involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity. However, compared to vascular tissues, there is only limited knowledge about the underlying signaling  in the liver. Therefore, we employed an LC-MS/MS-based time-resolved phosphoproteomics approach to characterize 11,12-EET-mediated signaling events in the liver cell line Hepa 1-6. 11,12-EET treatment resulted in the time-dependent regulation of phosphopeptides involved in processes as yet unknown to be affected by EETs, including RNA processing, splicing and translation regulation. Pathway analysis combined with western blot-based validation revealed enhanced AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling as demonstrated by increased acute phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and p70S6K (Thr389). In addition, 11,12-EET treatment led to differential regulation of phosphopeptides including important mediators of the DNA damage response and we observed a prolonged induction of the etoposide-induced DNA damage marker γH2AX in response to 11,12-EET. In summary, our findings extend current knowledge of 11,12-EET signaling events and emphasize the importance of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in hepatic 11,12-EET signaling. Based on the results presented in this study, we furthermore propose a novel role of EET signaling in the regulation of the DNA damage response.Copyright © 2019.

Enhancing DIT can lead to weight loss. Factors that increase DIT are expected to lower body mass index and body  mass. Although various methods have been developed for measuring DIT in humans, there is currently no method available for calculating absolute DIT values in mice. Therefore, we attempted to measure DIT in mice by applying the method more commonly used for humans. Mouse energy  was first measured under fasting conditions; EE was plotted against the square root of the activity count, and a linear regression equation was fit to the data. Then, energy  was measured in mice that were allowed to feed ad libitum, and EE was plotted in the same way. We calculated the DIT by subtracting the predicted EE value from the fed EE value for the same activity count. The methodology for measuring DIT in mice may be helpful for researching ways of combatting obesity by increasing DIT. •The methodology for measuring absolute DIT values in mice is developed.•For mice, the proportion of DIT compared with calorie intake and EE are 12.3% and 21.7%, respectively.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671156>Transcriptome sequencing reveals the effect of biochar improvement on the development of tobacco plants before and after topping.</a></h2><p>The application of biochar is one of the most useful methods for improving soil quality, which is of the utmost significance for the continuous production of crops.

Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of , especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte browning yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human  as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS.

Here we performed small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) of tissue, serum and serum exosomes to investigate changes in miRNA expression between the different sample types and correlated the expression with clinical parameters. We also performed gene expression arrays on tumor and normal tissue.Paired tissue, serum and serum exosomes sequencing revealed consistent positive correlation of miR-21 between serum exosomes and tumor tissue, indicating that miR-21 could be exported from tissue to circulation via exosomes. We found that let-7 miRNAs are generally upregulated in serum exosomes compared to whole serum, indicating that these miRNAs could be preferentially loaded into exosomes. Comparing serum from HCC patients with serum from healthy individuals revealed a global increase of miRNAs in serum from HCC patients, including an almost 4-fold increase of several miRNAs, including the liver-specific miR-122. When correlating miRNA expression with clinical parameters we detected significant association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and miR-122 in serum as well as several serum and tissue-miRNAs that correlated with surgery type. We found that miR-141 and miR-146 correlated with cirrhosis in tumor tissue and normal tissue, respectively. Finally, high expression of miR-21 in tumors were associated with poor survival. Focusing on gene expression we found several significant messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between tumor and normal tissue and a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these changes were mainly related to cell cycle and . Further, we detected mRNAs that correlated with cirrhosis and HBV infection in tissue. Finally, GO analysis of predicted targets for miRNAs down-regulated in tumor found that these were enriched for functions related to collagen synthesis.Our combined data point to altered miRNA and mRNA expression contributing to both generally impaired  and increased cell proliferation and a miRNA-driven increase in collagen synthesis in HCC. Our results further indicate a correlation in miRNA expression between exosomes, serum, and tissue samples suggesting export from tumors via exosomes.

This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous acetate buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and 5 fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose. In addition, marginal decreases of T in all tissues and considerable increases in DHEA in male iWAT and eWAT in response to high- diet further strengthen the inference regarding role of steroid  in adipogenesis.

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD)  are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling  in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino acids (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal  in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal  in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

The mice in the L group exhibited anxiety-like behaviours in the OFT and depressive-like behaviours in the FST. A significant difference was observed in β-diversity indices between the L group and the F group. The abundance of  and  was significantly higher in the F group than in the L and N groups. The prefrontal cortex fatty acid composition was altered in various -treated groups and was highly correlated with depressive-like behaviours. In conclusion, the degree of  saturation affects depressive-like behaviour, gut microbiota composition, and the prefrontal cortex fatty acid profile in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile acid pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile acid pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic acid and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of  and glucose . Bile acid levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile acid levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic acid) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile acid and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile acid synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile acids can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic acid is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile acid synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) acid for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic acid is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Severely compromised LPL activity causes familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which is associated with very high plasma triglyceride levels and increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. Currently, no approved pharmacological intervention can acutely lower plasma triglycerides in FCS. Low yield, high aggregation, and poor stability of recombinant LPL have thus far prevented development of enzyme replacement therapy. Recently, we showed that LPL monomers form 1:1 complexes with the LPL transporter glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and solved the structure of the complex. In the present work, we further characterized the monomeric LPL/GPIHBP1 complex, and its derivative, the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein, with the goal of contributing to the development of an LPL enzyme replacement therapy. Fusion of LPL to GPIHBP1 increased yields of recombinant LPL, prevented LPL aggregation, stabilized LPL against spontaneous inactivation, and made it resistant to inactivation by the LPL antagonists angiopoietin-like protein 3(ANGPTL3) or ANGPTL4. The high stability of the fusion protein enabled us to identify LPL amino acids that interact with ANGPTL4. Additionally, the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein exibited high enzyme activity in in vitro assays. Importantly, both intravenous and subcutaneous administrations of the fusion protein lowered triglycerides in several mouse strains without causing adverse effects. These results indicate that the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein has potential for use as a therapeutic for managing FCS.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659627>Impact of Carbohydrate on Glucose Variability in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Assessed Through Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to objectively analyze the correlation between dietary components and blood glucose variation by means of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who received CGM to manage their blood glucose levels were enrolled into the study, and the components of their total caloric intake were analyzed. Glycemic variation parameters were calculated, and dietary components, including percentages of carbohydrate, protein and  in the total dietary intake, were analyzed by a dietitian. The interaction between parameters of glycemic variability and dietary components was analyzed.Sixty-one patients with T1DM (33 females, 28 males) were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years, and the average duration of diabetes was 14 years. Glycated hemoglobin before CGM was 8.54%. Participants with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake had a longer DM duration and a higher protein and  intake than did those with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for ≥ 50% of total caloric intake, but there was no between-group difference in total caloric intake per day. The group with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake also had lower nocturnal continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA) 1, - 2 and - 4 values. The percentage of protein intake had a slightly negative correlation with mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) (r = - 0.286, p < 0.05) and a moderately negative correlation with coefficient of variation (CV) (r = 0.289, p < 0.05). One additional percentage of protein calories of total calories per day decreased the MAGE to 4.25 mg/dL and CV to 0.012 (p < 0.05). The optimal dietary protein percentage for MAGE < 140 mg/dL was 15.13%. The performance of predictive models revealed the beneficial effect of adequate carbohydrate intake on glucose variation when combined with protein consumption.Adequate carbohydrate consumption-but not more than half the daily total calories-combined with protein calories that amount to approximately 15% of the daily caloric intake is important for glucose stability and beneficial for patients with T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645965>Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data from tree peony () seeds reveals key developmental stages and candidate genes related to oil biosynthesis and fatty acid .</a></h2><p>Tree peony ( section  DC.) seeds are an excellent source of beneficial natural compounds that promote health, and they contain high levels of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In recent years, tree peony has been emerging as an oil crop. Therefore, combined analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tree peony () seeds at 25, 32, 39, 53, 67, 81, 88, 95, and 109 days after pollination (DAP) was conducted to better understand the transcriptional and translational regulation of seed development and oil biosynthesis. A total of 38,482 unigenes and 2841 proteins were identified. A total of 26,912 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 592 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were clustered into three groups corresponding to the rapid growth, seed inclusion enrichment and conversion, and late dehydration and mature stages of seed development. Fifteen  pathways were identified at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that a period of rapid fatty acid biosynthesis occurred at 53-88 DAP. Furthermore, 211 genes and 35 proteins associated with the fatty acid  pathway, 63 genes and 11 proteins associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and 115 genes and 24 proteins associated with ALA  were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 16 putative fatty acid desaturase (FAD)-encoding genes clustered into four  groups, eight of which exhibited the highest expression at 53 DAP, suggesting that they play an important role in ALA accumulation. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the temporal expression patterns of oil biosynthesis genes were largely similar to the RNA-seq results. The expression patterns of fatty acid - and seed development-related proteins determined by MRM were also highly consistent with the results obtained in the proteomic analysis. Correlation analysis indicated significant differences in the number and abundance of DEGs and DEPs but a high level of consistency in expression patterns and metabolic pathways. The results of the present study represent the first combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of tree peony seeds and provide insight into tree peony seed development and oil accumulation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664798>Hepatocellular Carcinoma [Internet].</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, has become a major global health problem.

To identify the insertion/deletion (InDel) variations of the  gene and evaluate their effects on -tail measurements and growth traits, 166 healthy individuals from Tong sheep were identified and analyzed. Herein, 10 novel InDel polymorphisms were founded in the Tong sheep  gene, which displayed intermediate polymorphism (0.25 < PIC < 0.5) and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( > .05). Correlation analysis of 78 Tong sheep phenotypic traits data and InDel polymorphisms showed that eight InDel loci were significantly associated with partial growth traits ( < .05), four InDel loci were significantly correlated with -tail measurements ( < .05). In particular, individuals with genotype DD showed better phenotypic traits than individuals with other genotypes at male sheep InDel 5 and InDel 8 loci, which had small tail- dimensions while having good growth traits.

Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the  of 5-10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate . To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on  membranes. Free energy calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. It is hoped that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669663>Biochemical responses and proximate analysis of Piaractus brachypomus (Pisces: Characidae) exposed to phenanthrene.</a></h2><p>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex compounds generated from industrial and anthropogenic activities, although natural phenomena are also responsible for their presence in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of phenanthrene on proximate composition and antioxidant activity in Piaractus brachypomus during a subacute exposure. Fish were exposed intraperitoneally to phenanthrene (0.1, 1.0, and 10 μg g) and a solvent control (0 μg g). Muscle tissue, liver and bile were collected at 0 h, 11 days and 21 days. In dorsal muscle, parameters such as dry matter, protein, crude fat, and pH did not show alterations with exposure to phenanthrene (p ≥ 0.05). At 11 days, a significant increase of hepatic lipid peroxidation was observed in fish exposed to 10 μg g. Additionally, a dose-dependent response was observed in the muscle, although no significant differences were observed in the activity of catalase and lipid peroxidation. Phenanthrene metabolites in bile were analysed by fixed fluorescence at 260/380 nm (excitation/emission) wavelengths and levels indicated a dose-dependent response. Likewise, bioaccumulation of phenanthrene in bile was observed for 21 days, suggesting slow  of this xenobiotic at 10 μg g. This study provides important information on the oxidative effects generated by phenanthrene exposure for 21 days in P. brachypomus, generating fundamental information on adverse effects induced by PAHs on the most important Colombian native fish species. These data contribute to the development of additional research in environments contaminated with PAHs and can be applied to monitor areas contaminated with oil spills.Copyright © 2019.

This study aims to establish metabolic factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with obesity-related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum  levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high- diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk  and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid, and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty acid (palmitic acid, PA) to gauge its effects on cell  and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660733>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry enables rapid characterisation of enzyme kinetics and inhibition for the human soluble Epoxide Hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is conventionally used to acquire thermodynamic data for biological interactions. In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors.

Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher body weight and weight gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and  peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive oxygen species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group. Based on these data, we conclude that 100 mg thymol/kg dietary supplementation increased growth performance of fingerling grass carp. Finally, hepatic adenylate kinase activity was lower in the thymol supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group. Thymol supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) improved hepatic energy , while practically all tested concentrations of thymol enhanced hepatic antioxidant status, all of which may be pathways involved in increased growth performance in fingerling grass carp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668391>miR-873-5p targets mitochondrial GNMT-Complex II interface contributing to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex pathology in which several dysfunctions, including alterations in metabolic pathways, mitochondrial functionality and unbalanced  import/export, lead to  accumulation and progression to inflammation and fibrosis. The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve  accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The presence of microplastics have been recorded in the tissues of many wild fish species, and laboratory studies have demonstrated that microplastics can exert adverse health effects. To further investigate the biological mechanisms underlying microplastics toxicity we applied an integrated approach, analyzing the effects of microplastics at transcriptomic, histological and behavioral level. Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and .

Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time.

This trade-off is modulated by the energy requirements of prey, yet relatively few studies have incorporated physiological mechanisms for energy savings when considering the behavioural response of prey to predation risk. In our study, we aimed to determine individual variation in behaviour, resting , body temperature and response to 24-h starvation within a captive population of -tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata; 15-g insectivorous marsupials), and then, using semi-outdoor enclosures, test whether foraging effort and thermal energetics are adjusted in response to manipulation of ground cover, which for small mammals can simulate predation risk. We found that, under the low cover (high predation risk) treatment, dunnarts consumed less food and employed a greater daily reduction in body temperature between their active and rest phase. This result supports the hypothesis that rest-phase thermoregulatory energy savings are employed, even when food is available, if predation risk is perceived to increase the cost of foraging. Individuals exhibited correlated variation along two orthogonal axes incorporating the measured behavioural and metabolic variables, but these differences were not correlated with responses to starvation and predation risk. Our experiment demonstrates that flexibility in daily energy requirements provided by heterothermy can have important consequences for how small mammals respond to both starvation and predation risks. Such challenges are amplified in degraded habitat with introduced predators, making the capacity for heterothermy an even more important mechanism for survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646124>Effect of vitamin D status on  profile in premenopausal women: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>High  levels play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and some authors suggest vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for atherosclerosis.

Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and log parathormone levels were made, no correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and  (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG) levels (=0.91, 0.06, 0.95, 0.79, respectively).There may be an association between vitamin D insufficiency and dyslipidemia.

Moreover, the gene expression of leptin and adiponectin was assessed. For the first time, we have shown that ostarine has a significant effect on the intensity of . Ostarine downregulates the expression of leptin and adiponectin mRNAs, as well as decreases their release from rat adipocytes. According to our results, ostarine acts via AR with a similar effect as testosterone in the regulation of  and endocrine function of mature rat adipocytes in vitro. Our results indicate the need for further studies on the effects of SARM on the whole organism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671239>Duck Egg White-Derived Peptide VSEE (Val-Ser-Glu-Glu) Regulates bone and  Metabolisms by Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Pathway and Intestinal Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Val-Ser-Glu-Glu (VSEE), identified from duck egg white peptides, has been proved to facilitate calcium absorption in previous study. Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal  metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and  metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-2/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min. Additionally, VSEE was found to reverse bone loss and regulate dyslipidemia through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in OVX rats. Firmicutes phylum, Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae and six genera in VSEE group were significantly different compared with Model group (P <0.05).VSEE promotes bone growth and inhibit abnormal  in OVX model through the regulation of intestinal microbiota compositions and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.

Olive oil is the primary  source in the Mediterranean diet ; however, only a few studies have investigated the effect of olive oil on aging. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether consumption of olive oil significantly influences aging and memory in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8). Methods : SAMP8 and senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice were fed either 7% soy oil or 1% olive oil and 6% soy oil during a six-month study period. Reduction in memory in passive avoidance learning was examined after two months from the initiation of the experiment. Results : The weight of organs including the liver, kidney, spleen, and  tissue changed significantly and memory performance was reduced in SAMP8 than in SAMR1 mice. There were no significant differences in SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice; however, blood triglyceride level decreased significantly in SAMP8 mice fed on olive oil. Conclusions : These results suggest that consuming olive oil may not have a protective role in aging and memory recall, but beneficial effects may be related to improvement in . J. Med.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose . Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing browning of  cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the  of glucose and insulin. The Hcrt/orexin system may thus be a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.This article is protected by copyright.

Current insights and future perspectives for novel therapies.</a></h2><p>Dyslipidemia and inflammation are closely interrelated contributors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Disorders of  initiate an inflammatory and immune-mediated response in atherosclerosis, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering has possible pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects that extend beyond  lowering.Activation of the immune system/inflammasome destabilizes the plaque, which makes it vulnerable to rupture, resulting in major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The activated immune system potentially accelerates atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis activates the immune system, creating a vicious circle. LDL-C enhances inflammation, which can be measured through multiple parameters like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, multiple studies have shown that CRP is a marker of residual risk and not, itself, a causal factor. Recently, anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to decelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in fewer MACE. Nevertheless, an important side effect of anti-inflammatory therapy is the potential for increased infection risk, stressing the importance of only targeting patients with high residual inflammatory risk. Multiple (auto-)inflammatory diseases are potentially related to/influenced by LDL-C through inflammasome activation.Research suggests that LDL-C induces inflammation; inflammation is of proven importance in atherosclerotic disease progression; anti-inflammatory therapies yield promise in lowering (cardiovascular) disease risk, especially in selected patients with high (remaining) inflammatory risk; and intriguing new anti-inflammatory developments, for example, in nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrine receptor inflammasome targeting, are currently underway, including novel pathway interventions such as immune cell targeting and epigenetic interference. Long-term safety should be carefully monitored for these new strategies and cost-effectiveness carefully evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662443>CXCL12 promotes atherosclerosis by downregulating ABCA1 expression via the CXCR4/GSK3β/β-catenin/TCF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) is a member of CXC chemokine family and mainly acts on cell chemotaxis. CXCL12 also elicits a pro-atherogenic role, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined yet. We aimed to reveal if and how CXCL12 promoted atherosclerosis via regulating . In vitro, our data showed that CXCL12 reduced ABCA1 expression and it-mediated cholesterol efflux from THP-1-derived macrophages to apoA-I. Data from the Luciferase reporter gene and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TCF21 stimulated transcription of ABCA1 via binding to its promoter region, which was repressed by CXCL12. We found that CXCL12 increased the levels of phosphorylated GSK3β and phosphorylation of β-catenin at the position Thr120. Inactivation of GSK3β or β-catenin increased expression of TCF21 and ABCA1. Further, knockdown or inhibition of CXCR4 (CXC chemokine receptor 4) blocked the effects of CXCL12 on TCF21 and ABCA1 expression and phosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin. In vivo, overexpression of CXCL12 in Apoe-/- mice via lentivirus enlarged atherosclerotic lesion area and increased macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques. We further found that overexpression of CXCL12 reduced the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport and plasma HDL-C levels, decreased ABCA1 expression in aorta and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs), and suppressed cholesterol efflux from MPMs to apoA-I in Apoe-/- mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that CXCL12 interacts with CXCR4 and then activates the GSK-3β/β-cateninT120/TCF21 signaling pathway to inhibit ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages and aggravate atherosclerosis. Targeting CXCL12 may be a novel and promising strategy for the prevention  of atherosclerosis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653107>Impact of Fenugreek on Milk Production in Rodent Models of Lactation Challenge.</a></h2><p>Fenugreek, a herbal remedy, has long been used as galactologue to help mothers likely to stop breastfeeding because of perceived insufficient milk production. However, few studies highlight the efficacy of fenugreek in enhancing milk production. The aims of our study were to determine whether fenugreek increased milk yield in rodent models of lactation challenge and if so, to verify the lack of adverse effects on dam and offspring . Two lactation challenges were tested: increased litter size to 12 pups in dams fed a 20% protein diet and perinatal restriction to an 8% protein diet with eight pups' litter, with or without 1 g.kg.day dietary supplementation of fenugreek, compared to control dams fed 20% protein diet with eight pups' litters. Milk flow was measured by the deuterium oxide enrichment method, and milk composition was assessed.  and glucose  parameters were assessed in dam and offspring plasmas. Fenugreek increased milk production by 16% in the litter size increase challenge, resulting in an 11% increase in pup growth without deleterious effect on dam-litter . Fenugreek had no effect in the maternal protein restriction challenge.

In atorvastatin (ator)-treated high- diet-fed mice, we found reduced pancreatic β-cell size and β-cell mass, fewer mature insulin granules and reduced insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. Transcriptome profiling of primary pancreatic islets showed that ator inhibited the expression of pancreatic transcription factor (TF), mTOR signaling and small G protein (sGP) genes. Supplementation of the mevalonate pathway intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is produced by 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, significantly restored the attenuated mTOR activity, v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (MafA) expression and β-cell function after ator, lovastatin, rosuvastatin and fluvastatin treatment; this effect was potentially mediated by sGP prenylation. Rab5a, the sGP in pancreatic islets most affected by ator treatment, was found to positively regulate mTOR signaling and β-cell function. Rab5a knockdown mimicked the effect of ator treatment on β-cells. Thus, ator impairs β-cell function by regulating sGPs, for example, Rab5a, which subsequently attenuates islet mTOR signaling and reduces functional β-cell mass. GGPP supplementation could constitute a new approach to preventing statin-induced hyperglycemia.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651077>Metabolomic Profiling to Identify Molecular Biomarkers of Cellular Response to Methotrexate In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Variation in methotrexate (MTX) efficacy represents a significant barrier to early and effective disease control in the treatment of autoimmune arthritis. We hypothesize that the utilization of metabolomic techniques will allow for an improved understanding of the biochemical basis for the pharmacological activity of MTX, and can promote the identification and evaluation of novel molecular biomarkers of MTX response. In this work, erythroblastoid cells were exposed to MTX at the physiologic concentration of 1,000 nM and analyzed using three metabolomic platforms to give a broad spectrum of cellular metabolites. MTX pharmacological activity, defined as cellular growth inhibition, was associated with an altered cellular metabolomic profile based on the analysis of 724 identified metabolites. By discriminant analysis, MTX treatment was associated with increases in ketoisovaleric acid, fructose, galactose, and 2-deoxycytidine, and corresponding reductions in 2-deoxyuridine, phosphatidylinositol 32:0, orotic acid, and inosine monophosphate. Inclusion of data from analysis of folate  in combination with chemometric and metabolic network analysis demonstrated that MTX treatment is associated with dysregulated folate  and nucleotide biosynthesis, which is in line with its known mechanism of action. However, MTX treatment was also associated with alterations in a diversity of metabolites, including intermediates of amino acid, carbohydrate, and . Collectively, these findings support a robust metabolic response following exposure to physiologic concentrations of MTX. They also identify various metabolic intermediates that are associated with the pharmacological activity of MTX, and are, therefore, potential molecular biomarker candidates in future preclinical and clinical studies of MTX efficacy in autoimmune arthritis.© 2019 The Authors.

Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of positive islet autoimmunity in T2DM community patients.495 community patients with T2DM were recruited totally using the method of Cluster sampling in this cross-sectional study. Three islet autoantibodies including GADA, IAA and ICA were measured, and clinical characteristics involved in those individuals were evaluated.The positive rate of islet autoantibodies was 28.5% in total. Compared with GADA negative group, positive counterparts significantly tended to have lower levels of BMI, WHR, and mALB. Adjusted for confounding factors, WHR, Triglycerides (TG), mALB seemed to be negative independent predictors of GADA. Patients with positive IAA tended to receive insulin treatment (P<0.0001). Besides, FBG, HDL-CH, AST, and GGT were more likely to be higher in IAA positive subgroup in comparison with the negative counterparts. While after AST was adjusted by unconditional logistic regression analysis, history of insulin treatment, FBG, HDL-CH, and GGT were confirmed as positive predictors of IAA. Furthermore, in patients with IAA positive, those treated with exogenous insulin tended to have longer duration of diabetes than non-insulin treatment counterparts. With regard to ICA, however, there were no significant differences between the two subgroups, except that serum level of AST/ALT seemed to be slightly different (P=0.064).These data suggested thatT2DM community patients with positive GADA tended to be lean and were able to maintain normal , while patients with positivity of IAA were frequently accompanied with insulin treatment and more closely associated with diabetic liver damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668386>Fibroblast growth factor 21 is required for the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG against fructose-induced fatty liver in mice.</a></h2><p>High fructose feeding changes fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after 5-weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic  accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine . This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and  in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose , hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671770>Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Dysregulation of Glucose : Beyond Weight Gain.</a></h2><p>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia because of their high clinical efficacy.

Marantodes pumilum (Blume) Kuntze (Primulaceae) is believed to have phytoestrogenic properties and is claimed to have beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), but the mechanism behind its phytoestrogenic effects on estrogen-deficient diabetic condition have not been fully examined.The present study investigated the effects of oral treatment with M. pumilum var. alata (MPA) extracts on the estrogen receptor, metabolic characteristics and insulin signaling pathway in pancreas and liver of ovariectomised nicotidamide streptozotocin-induced diabetes in female rats.Ovariectomised diabetic (OVXS) Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with either aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA (50 or 100 mg/kg) respectively for 28 days. Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, oral glucose and insulin tolerance test. Distribution and expression level of insulin, oxidative stress and inflammatory marker in the pancreatic islets and liver were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot, respectively.Oral treatment with aqueous leaf and ethanol (50%) stem-root extracts of MPA (100 mg/kg) significantly reversed the elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. The protein expression of insulin, glucose transporter (GLUT-2 and GLUT-4) increased in the pancreatic islets and liver. Furthermore, marked improvement in the tissue morphology following treatment with MPA was observed. Similarly, the western blots analysis denotes improved insulin signaling in the liver and decreased reactive oxygen species producing enzymes, inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules with MPA treatment.Taken together, this work demonstrate that 100 mg/kg of aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA improves β-cell function and insulin signaling in postmenopausal diabetes through attenuation of oxidative stress and partially mediated by oestrogen receptor stimulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic acid and CDCA into deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA  under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672443>FGF21 in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of pathologies ranging from uncomplicated hepatic  accumulation to a state of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic  content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic  in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans.

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and  homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high  diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of  and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic  accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body  in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Currently, SPO PUFAs and its main component α-Linolenic acid (ALA) on regulation of cholesterol  was investigated.  denatured cell model was constructed by oleic acid for  accumulation, cholesterol  and transformation. In addition, real-time PCR and western-blot were used to analyze the expression levels of related the genes and proteins for cholesterol efflux regulation mechanism investigation. The data indicated that SPO PUFAs and ALA dose-dependently decreased intracellular total cholesterol (TC), enhanced total bile acid (TBA). Furthermore, SPO PUFAs and ALA could promote cholesterol removal through enhancing bile acid secretion and up-regulating genes LXRα, PPARγ, ABCA1, ABCG1, and CYP7A1, which were regulated by LXRα/PPARγ-ABCA1/ABCG1-CYP7A1 nuclear receptor signal pathways.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These patients receive low-toxicity disease-stabilizing treatment. The combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid can stabilize the disease for a subset of such patients. We performed untargeted serum metabolomic profiling for 44 AML patients receiving treatment based on ATRA and valproic acid combined with low-dose cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) which identified 886 metabolites. When comparing pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, metabolites mainly belonging to amino acid and  (i.e., fatty acid) pathways were altered. Furthermore, patients with rapidly progressive disease showed an extensively altered . Both ATRA and valproic acid monotherapy also altered the amino acid and  metabolite profiles; however, these changes were only highly significant for valproic acid treatment. Twenty-three metabolites were significantly altered by seven-day valproic acid treatment ( < 0.05,  < 0.05), where the majority of altered metabolites belonged to  (especially fatty acid ) and amino acid pathways, including several carnitines.

Patients were evaluated for glycemic control, blood  profiles, body composition and physical fitness, and skeletal muscle gene expression.Exercise training was well tolerated without any incident of hypoglycemia. Exercise training significantly decreased whole-body  mass (-1.6kg) and increased HDL concentrations (+2mg*dL), physical fitness (+1.7mL*min*kg) and  oxidation during exercise in both groups (PTIME<0.05), with no between group differences (PTIME*GROUP>0.05). HbA1c concentrations significantly decreased after exercise training (PTIME<0.001), with a significant greater reduction in FedEx (-0.30±0.06%) compared to FastEx (-0.08±0.06%; mean difference 0.21%; PTIME*GROUP=0.016). No interaction effects were observed for skeletal muscle genes related to  or oxidative capacity.Endurance-type exercise training in the fasted or fed state do not differ in their efficacy to reduce  mass, increase  oxidation capacity, increase cardiorespiratory fitness and HDL concentrations or their risk of hypoglycemia in male patients with type 2 diabetes.

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, 5) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis. C2CD5 represent a new target and pathway that could be targeted in Obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Each LD is enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids, distinct from bilayer membranes. During LD biogenesis and growth, this monolayer of lipids expands by acquiring phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through nonvesicular mechanisms. Here, in a mini-screen, we find that ORP5, an integral membrane protein of the ER, can localize to ER-LD contact sites upon oleate loading. ORP5 interacts with LDs through its ligand-binding domain, and ORP5 deficiency enhances neutral  synthesis and increases the size of LDs. Importantly, there is significantly more phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and less phosphatidylserine (PS) on LDs in ORP5-deficient cells than in normal cells. The increased presence of PI(4)P on LDs in ORP5-deficient cells requires phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2-α. Our results thus demonstrate the existence of PI(4)P on LDs and suggest that LD-associated PI(4)P may be primarily used by ORP5 to deliver PS to LDs.© 2019 Du et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666810>Association of thyroid hormones with resting energy expenditure and complement C3 in normal weight high body  women.</a></h2><p>A high body  percentage has a specific effect on activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of obesity and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor function on the gut microbiome composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0.2 mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP-2 receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut microbiome signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial metabolic pathways. The microbiome alterations may potentially associate to the converging biological actions of GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor signaling on caloric intake, glucose  and  handling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657789>A Fluorescence-based Assay for Characterization and Quantification of  Droplet Formation in Human Intestinal Organoids.</a></h2><p>Dietary lipids are taken up as free fatty acids (FAs) by the intestinal epithelium. These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic  droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic  species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency.

Although there are many factors that influence  storage, it has been clearly demonstrated that the homeostatic cornerstone of  lies within the hypothalamus. Moreover, neuronal damage to vital areas of the hypothalamus can drive reregulation or dysregulation of endocrine function, energy expenditure and appetite, thereby promoting a shift in overall metabolic function towards a state of obesity. Therefore, identification of treatments that influence the hypothalamus to improve obesity and associated metabolic diseases has long been a medical goal. Interestingly, evidence from animal studies suggests that activating the vestibular system, specifically the macular gravity receptor, influences the hypothalamus in a way that decreases body  storage and causes a metabolic shift towards a leaner state. Given that the macular element of the vestibular system has been shown to activate with transdermal electrical stimulation applied to the mastoids, this may be a potential therapeutic approach for obesity, diabetes or related metabolic diseases, whereby repetitive stimulation of the vestibular system influences hypothalamic control of metabolic homeostasis, thereby encouraging decreased  storage. Here, we present an up-to-date review of the current literature surrounding the vestibular influence of the hypothalamus and associated homeostatic sites in the context of current and novel therapeutic approaches for improved clinical management of obesity and diabetes.© 2019 Diabetes UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663477>In vivo antiplasmodial activity of curcumin-loaded Nanostructured  Carriers.</a></h2><p>It was shown that curcumin (Cur) has anti-plasmodium activity, however, its weak bioavailability, rapid , and limited chemical stability has restricted its application in clinical usages.

Recently, studies on experimental animals showed that AM2 is an adipokine with beneficial effects on energy . However, there is little information regarding AM2 expression in human adipose tissue.To investigate the pattern and regulation of AM2 expression and that of its receptor component in human adipose tissue, in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes.We measured metabolic parameters, serum AM2 and expression of ADM2 and its receptor component genes in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese (with or without type 2 diabetes) and normal-weight women. Serum AM2 was assessed before and 6-9 months after bariatric surgery. Expression/secretion of AM2 and its receptor was assessed in human adipocytes.ADM2 mRNA in both  depots was higher in obese patients, whether diabetic or not. Although serum AM2 was significantly lower in obese patients, it was not changed after bariatric surgery. AM2 and its receptor complex were predominantly expressed by adipocytes, and expression of CALCRL, encoding a component of the AM2 receptor complex, was lower in both  depots of obese patients. Incubating adipocytes with substances mimicking the microenvironment of obese adipose tissue increased ADM2 mRNA but reduced AM2 secretion into culture media and CALCRL mRNA expression.Our data indicate that AM2 signalling is suppressed in adipose tissue in obesity, involving lower receptor expression and ligand availability, likely contributing to insulin resistance and other aspects of the pathophysiology associated with obesity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not  or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant ( = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log Δ -0.35 ± 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log Δ -0.49 ± 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log Δ -0.50 ± 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log Δ -0.51 ± 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log Δ -0.4476 ± 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption. In support of this finding, we also found significant ( < 0.05) and inverse linear associations between dietary carbohydrate and log salivary cortisol, with the strongest negative association (β: -0.004 ± 0.0015,  = 0.009) occurring at 30 min post-TSST, but only in the DGA group and at week 9 of the intervention.

This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy  was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test.

Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy  expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy ; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice.

We, therefore, examined whether physical conditioning status (maximal oxygen uptake, V̇O) was associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume and mtDNA, and was predictive of T2DM in overweight, middle-aged men.Whole-body physiological (ISI-insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR, V̇O) and muscle biochemical/molecular (vastus lateralis; mtDNA, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes activity,  content and markers of  peroxidation) measurements were performed in three groups of overweight, middle-aged male volunteers (n = 10 per group): sedentary T2DM (ST2DM); sedentary control (SC) and non-sedentary control (NSC), who differed in aerobic capacity (ST2DM < SC < NSC).mtDNA was greater in NSC versus SC and ST2DM (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and less in ST2DM versus SC (P < 0.01). Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free  mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty acids, triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643348>Insulin.</a></h2><p>Insulin is a pancreatic hormone that plays an essential role in regulation of blood glucose as well as  and carbohydrate . Both natural and recombinant forms of insulin are used therapeutically to treat type 1 diabetes. While insulin itself is not hepatotoxic and has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations or instances of clinically apparent liver injury, high doses including overdoses of insulin and glucose can result in hepatic glycogenosis and serum aminotransferase elevations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652245>Exercise Effects on Mitochondrial Function and  during Energy Balance.</a></h2><p>Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and upregulate proteins related to . However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty acid substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or  transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty acid substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668873>Proteomics-Based Comparative Mapping of the Secretomes of Human Brown and White Adipocytes Reveals EPDR1 as a Novel Batokine.</a></h2><p>Adipokines secreted from white adipose tissue play a role in metabolic crosstalk and homeostasis, whereas the brown adipose secretome is less explored. We performed high-sensitivity mass-spectrometry-based proteomics on the cell media of human adipocytes derived from the supraclavicular brown adipose and from the subcutaneous white adipose depots of adult humans. We identified 471 potentially secreted proteins covering interesting categories such as hormones, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and proteins of the complement system, which were differentially regulated between brown and white adipocytes. A total of 101 proteins were exclusively quantified in brown adipocytes, and among these was ependymin-related protein 1 (EPDR1). EPDR1 was detected in human plasma, and functional studies suggested a role for EPDR1 in thermogenic determination during adipogenesis. In conclusion, we report substantial differences between the secretomes of brown and white human adipocytes and identify novel candidate batokines that can be important regulators of human .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The progressive decline in mobility promoted by aging has been previously attributed to the loss of skeletal mass and function and more recently linked to changes in body  composition and quantity. Regardless of body size, visceral and intermuscular adipose depots increase with aging and are associated with adverse health outcomes. However, the quality of adipose tissue, in particular abdominal subcutaneous as it is the largest depot, likely plays a significant role in aging outcomes, such as mobility decline, though its communication with other tissues such as skeletal muscle. In this review, we discuss the age-associated development of a pro-inflammatory profile, cellular senescence, and metabolic inflexibility in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Collectively, these facets of adipose tissue quality influence its secretory profile and crosstalk with skeletal muscle and likely contribute to the development of muscle atrophy and disability. Therefore, the identification of the key structural and functional components of adipose tissue quality-including necrosis, senescence, inflammation, self-renewal, metabolic flexibility-and adipose tissue-secreted proteins that influence mobility via direct effects on skeletal muscle are necessary to prevent morbidity/mortality in the aging population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672355> metabolic response to polystyrene particles in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Nanoplastics can be used in various fields, such as personal care products. Nevertheless, the effect of nanoplastic exposure on  and its association with stress response remain largely unclear. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model, we determined the effect of nanopolystyrene exposure on  and its association with the response to nanopolystyrene. Exposure (from L1-larave to adult day-3) to 100 nm nanopolystyrene (≥1 μg/L) induced severe  accumulation and increase in expressions of mdt-15 and sbp-1 encoding two  metabolic sensors. Meanwhile, we found that SBP-1 acted downstream of intestinal MDT-15 during the control of response to nanopolystyrene. Intestinal transcriptional factor SBP-1 activated two downstream targets, fatty acyl CoA desaturase -6 and heat-shock protein HSP-4 (a marker of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER UPR)) to regulate nanopolystyrene toxicity. Both MDT-15 and SBP-1 were involved in the activation of ER-UPR in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. Moreover, SBP-1 regulated the innate immune response by activating -6 in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. In the intestine, function of MDT-15 and SBP-1 in regulating nanopolystyrene toxicity was under the control of upstream signaling cascade (PMK-1-SKN-1) in p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, our data raised an important molecular basis for potential protective function of  metabolic response in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Blood samples were obtained from 181 Wagyu-crossbred steers between 300-400 days before slaughter when carcass data was collected. H NMR spectroscopy identified 35 metabolites with 7 positively associated with marbling (3-hydroxybutyrate, propionate, acetate, creatine, histidine, valine, and isoleucine; P ≤ 0.05). Subcutaneous rump  thickness was positively associated with glucose, leucine and lipids (P ≤ 0.05) and negatively associated with anserine and arabinose (P ≤ 0.05). Carcass weight and growth rate were negatively associated with 3-hydroxybutyrate (P < 0.05), and growth rate was negatively associated with creatine (P < 0.05) and positively associated with aspartate (P < 0.05). Glucose and arginine showed a significant interaction between marbling and number of days animals consumed a high-starch diet (P < 0.05). Sire was the single variable with the largest effect on the relative concentration of metabolites and carcass and production traits. Blood metabolomics helps understand  and muscle , and is associated with genotype, and carcass and production traits in cattle offering potential biomarkers suitable to select animals for management and genetic improvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654769>The hepatoprotective effects of Salvia plebeia R. Br. extract in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</a></h2><p>Salvia plebeia R. Br. is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been widely used for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism about the hepatoprotective effects of S. plebeia remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts of S. plebeia (SPEE) in the zebrafish model. Firstly, we determined the chemical compositions of SPEE and identified three major constituents by using GC-MS analysis. After that, SPEE exhibited significantly antioxidant properties in the LPS-induced zebrafish embryos, and the enzyme activities of ROS, CAT and SOD were obviously inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Secondly, SPEE greatly reduced  vacuoles (HE staining),  accumulation (Oil O staining) and hepatocyte fibrosis (Gemori staining) in the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatocyte injury of adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, the NO contents and -related genes were substantially down-regulated after SPEE exposure. Thirdly, we used RNA-Seq analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after SPEE exposure in adult zebrafish liver. The results showed that 1289 DEGs including 558 up-regulated and 731 down-regulated were identified between the TAA + SPEE and TAA groups. KEGG pathway and GO functional analysis revealed that steroid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction and innate immunity were significantly enriched. Mechanistically, SPEE can considerably reduce the cell apoptosis of hepatocytes and promote the translocation of Nrf2 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in TAA-induced zebrafish. Moreover, SPEE can modulate various inflammatory cytokines and immune genes both in the control and HO-stimulated conditions. The pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α was markedly up-regulated but the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β was greatly down-regulated after SPEE treatment. In addition, some key genes in the TLR signaling were also activated in the HO-stimulated conditions. In summary, our results suggested that SPEE had an important role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in zebrafish. Some of the components identified in this study may be served as potential sources of new hepatoprotective compounds for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise <0.1% of the tumor bulk and possess high self-renewal, tumor initiating properties, and are responsible for therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and tumor metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to understand the metabolic rewiring occurring in CSCs, especially their , on which there have been recent reports. CSCs rely highly upon  for maintaining their stemness properties and fulfilling their biomass and energy demands, ultimately leading to cancer growth and invasion. Hence, in this review we will shed light on the aberrant  that CSCs exploit to boost their survival, which comprises upregulation in de novo lipogenesis,  droplet synthesis,  desaturation, and β-oxidation. Furthermore, the metabolic regulators involved in the process, such as key lipogenic enzymes, are also highlighted. Finally, we also summarize the therapeutic strategies targeting the key regulators involved in CSCs' , which thereby demonstrates the potential to develop powerful and novel therapeutics against the CSC  metabolome.

To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced  peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain , we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling pathways while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty acid , and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652865>Development of a Food-Based Diet Quality Score from a Short FFQ and Associations with Obesity Measures, Eating Styles and Nutrient Intakes in Finnish Twins.</a></h2><p>We constructed a food-based diet quality score (DQS) and examined its association with obesity measures, eating styles and nutrient intakes. Participants were 3592 individuals (764 dizygotic [DZ] and 430 monozygotic [MZ] twin pairs) from the FinnTwin16 study. The DQS (0-12 points) was constructed from a short 14 item food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measures and eating styles were self-reported. Nutrient intakes were calculated from food diaries completed in a subsample of 249 individuals (45 same-sex DZ and 60 MZ twin pairs). Twins were analyzed both as individuals and as twin pairs. The DQS was inversely associated with body mass index (β = -0.12, per one-unit increase in DQS,  < 0.001), waist circumference (β = -0.34,  < 0.001), obesity (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95,  = 0.004) and abdominal obesity (OR: 0.88,  < 0.001), independent of sex, age, physical activity and education. A higher DQS was associated with health-conscious eating, having breakfast, less snacking, fewer evening meals, and a higher frequency and regularity of eating. The DQS was positively correlated with the intakes of protein, fiber and magnesium and negatively correlated with the intakes of total , saturated  and sucrose. Within twin pairs, most of the associations between the DQS with eating styles and some nutrients remained, but the DQS was not associated with obesity measures within twin pairs. The DQS is an easy-to-use tool for ranking adults according to diet quality and shows an association with obesity measures, eating styles and key nutrients in the expected direction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic  mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic  mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and  mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body  mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and  loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644425>Single cell analysis reveals immune cell-adipocyte crosstalk regulating the transcription of thermogenic adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Immune cells are vital constituents of the adipose microenvironment that influence both local and systemic . Mice lacking IL10 have enhanced thermogenesis, but the roles of specific cell types in the metabolic response to IL10 remain to be defined. We demonstrate here that selective loss of IL10 receptor a in adipocytes recapitulates the beneficial effects of global IL10 deletion, and that local crosstalk between IL10-producing immune cells and adipocytes is a determinant of thermogenesis and systemic energy balance. ingle uclei diocyte RNAuencing (SNAP-seq) of subcutaneous adipose tissue defined a metabolically-active mature adipocyte subtype characterized by robust expression of genes involved in thermogenesis whose transcriptome was selectively responsive to IL10Ra deletion. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adipose stromal populations identified lymphocytes as a key source of IL10 production in response to thermogenic stimuli. These findings implicate adaptive immune cell-adipocyte communication in the maintenance of adipose subtype identity and function.© 2019, Rajbhandari et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650134>Regulation effects of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis Linn.) on hepatic  in OA induced NAFLD rats.</a></h2><p>Rosmarinus officinalis Linn. is a kind of medicinal and edible homologous plant, which is popular in the Mediterranean region with a significant effect on mind tranquilization, anti-oxidation, and metabolic improvement. However, the hypolipidemic effects and mechanism of rosemary ethanol extract (RO) and their metabolites are less known. In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic acid (RA) and carnosic acid (CA) significantly reduced the contents of liver triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the liver of orotic acid induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related pathways of RO and its main metabolites against  disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of fatty acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671663>Gender Differences in the Pharmacological Actions of Pegylated Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 on Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Angiogenic Precursor Cells in a Combination of Metabolic Disorders and Lung Emphysema.</a></h2><p>In clinical practice, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is often associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although gender differences in MetS are well documented, little is known about sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of COPD, especially when combined with MetS. Consequently, it is not clear whether the same treatment regime has comparable efficacy in men and women diagnosed with MetS and COPD. In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated  disorders, obesity, hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of  disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), obesity, and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific. Thus, we concluded that a pegGLP-1-based treatment regime for metabolic disorder and COPD should be further developed primarily for male patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479>Diosgenin Supplementation Prevents  Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h2><p>Diosgenin (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral  was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral  accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653213>Sex differences in the prevalence and adverse outcomes of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in community dwelling elderly in East China using the AWGS criteria.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (SO) have a greater impact on the elderly.

The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and , insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and  metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the pathophysiological impact of dermokine, we generated mice deficient for two (βγ) or all dermokine isoforms (αβγ). Both variants, especially dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited scale and wrinkle formation resembling ichthyosis accompanied by transepidermal water imbalance at the neonatal stage. When reared under low humidity several dermokine αβγ-deficient mice died by postnatal day 21. Moreover, the cornified envelope (CE) was vulnerable, and skin barrier lipid ceramides were reduced in the epidermis of dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays of the epidermis revealed upregulation of small proline-rich protein and late CE family members, as well as antimicrobial peptides in dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. These barrier gene signatures were similar to that seen in psoriasis, whereas recent studies demonstrated that congenital ichthyosis has gene profiles resembling psoriasis. In line with these findings, adult dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited aggravated phenotypes in psoriasis-like dermatitis models but not in allergic dermatitis models. Dermokine may play a regulatory role in inflammatory dyskeratotic diseases such as congenital ichthyosis and psoriasis in the crosstalk between barrier dysfunction and inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Fasudil has been shown to attenuate kidney injury caused by certain substances. In the present study, metabolomic analysis of mouse kidney tissues ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine the metabolomic changes in cisplatin-induced kidney injury and the fasudil-induced attenuation of cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling of kidney tissues revealed significant differences in metabolites between the control group and the cisplatin group and between the cisplatin group and the fasudil-intervention group. With metabolomic approach, 68 endogenous differential metabolites were found, and multivariate statistical analysis, accurate molecular weights, isotope tracers, mass-spectrometry secondary-fragment information, and standard-reference comparisons were used to identify these substances. Based on these differential metabolites, a -pathway network was constructed and revealed that fasudil primarily attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury by modulating lipid and amino-acid . These results further demonstrate that kidney injury can be induced by cisplatin and, moreover, suggest that fasudil can be used to reduce kidney injury at early stages in patients treated with cisplatin.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671667>Methods and Guidelines for Measurement of Glucagon in Plasma.</a></h2><p>Glucagon circulates in concentrations in the low picomolar range, which is demanding regarding the sensitivity of the methods for quantification applied. In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian , but its precise physiological role in glucose and  and in metabolic disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error. We also reviewed some of the dogmas regarding glucagon secretion in the light of the methodological difficulties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h2><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral  to subcutaneous  is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against Obesity-induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h2><p>Patients with asthma with obesity experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease insulin resistance, and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high- diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin (5 days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose , and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide could be a promising therapy for obesity-induced asthma and showed additive effects in combination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668874>Lipids in the Bone Marrow: An Evolving Perspective.</a></h2><p>Because of heavy energy demands to maintain bone homeostasis, the skeletal system is closely tied to whole-body  via neuronal and hormonal mediators. Glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids are the chief fuel sources for bone resident cells during its remodeling. Lipids, which can be mobilized from intracellular depots in the bone marrow, can be a potent source of fatty acids. Thus, while it has been suggested that adipocytes in the bone marrow act as "filler" and are detrimental to skeletal homeostasis, we propose that marrow lipids are, in fact, essential for proper bone functioning. As such, we examine the prevailing evidence regarding the storage, use, and export of lipids within the skeletal niche, including from both in vitro and in vivo model systems. We also highlight the numerous challenges that remain to fully appreciate the relationship of  turnover to skeletal homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino acid cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652726>Transcriptomic Revelation of Phenolic Compounds Involved in Aluminum Toxicity Responses in Roots of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.</a></h2><p> Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) is one of the most important coniferous evergreen tree species in South China due to its desirable attributes of fast growth and production of strong and hardy wood. However, the yield of Chinese fir is often inhibited by aluminum (Al) toxicity in acidic soils of South China. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity might help to further increase its productivity. Here we used the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform to carry out transcriptome analysis of Chinese fir roots subjected to Al toxicity conditions. A total of 88.88 Gb of clean data was generated from 12 samples and assembled into 105,732 distinct unigenes. The average length and N50 length of these unigenes were 839 bp and 1411 bp, respectively. Among them, 58362 unigenes were annotated through searches of five public databases (Nr: NCBI non-redundant protein sequences, Swiss-Prot: A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database, GO: Gene Ontology, KOG/COG: Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins, and KEGG: the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database), which led to association of unigenes with 44 GO terms. Plus, 1615 transcription factors (TFs) were functionally classified. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs, |log(fold change)| ≥ 1 and FDR ≤ 0.05) were identified in comparisons labelled TC1 (CK-72 h/CK-1 h) and TC2 (Al-72 h/Al-1 h). A large number of TC2 DEGs group were identified, with most being down-regulated under Al stress, while TC1 DEGs were primarily up-regulated. Combining GO, KEGG, and MapMan pathway analysis indicated that many DEGs are involved in primary , including cell wall  and , while other DEGs are associated with signaling pathways and secondary , including flavonoids and phenylpropanoids . Furthermore, TFs identified in TC1 and TC2 DEGs represented 21 and 40 transcription factor families, respectively. Among them, expression of bHLH, C2H2, ERF, bZIP, GRAS, and MYB TFs changed considerably under Al stress, which suggests that these TFs might play crucial roles in Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity. These differentially expressed TFs might act in concert with flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathway genes in fulfilling of key roles in Chinese fir roots responding to Al toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h2><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and  that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high  diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver  targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

The inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε) was originally described as an inducible protein kinase; whole-body gene deletion or systemic pharmaceutical targeting of this kinase improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice. To investigate the primary sites of action associated with IKKε during weight gain, we describe the first mouse line with conditional elimination of IKKε in the liver (IKKε ). IKKε  mice and littermate controls gain weight, show similar changes in body composition, and do not display any improvements in insulin sensitivity or whole-body glucose tolerance. These studies were conducted using both breeder chow diets and also matched low-  high- diets. While glycogen accumulation in the liver is reduced in IKKε mice,  storage in liver is similar IKKε mice and littermate controls.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and -lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655471>Relationships between adiponectin and bone: Sex difference.</a></h2><p>Despite being secreted exclusively by adipocytes, circulating adiponectin (ApN) is negatively associated with obesity.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between ApN, measures of obesity, and bone mineral density (BMD) in healthy adults living in Singapore.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 300 participants (112 men), and measured body composition (i.e.,  mass, -free mass, BMD, and bone mineral content) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum leptin and ApN levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.Our results showed that serum ApN levels were significantly associated with obesity measures in both men and women, and the greater effect was observed in men. In contrast, the relationship between ApN and BMD was sex-dependent. Levels of ApN were negatively associated with BMD in women, but not in men. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for potential confounding factors, such as leptin and body mass index. Moreover, serum ApN was found to be a major determinant of BMD in women on the multivariate regression analysis.Our results suggest that ApN, an adipocyte-derived hormone, may affect bone , which may be mediated by sex hormones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and , and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the liver. Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into liver suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the liver after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

It had been unclear how lack of ZDHHC13 proteins resulted in cutaneous abnormalities. In this study, we first demonstrate that enzymatic palmitoylation activity, rather than protein scaffolding, by ZDHHC13 is essential for skin barrier integrity, showing that knock-in mice bearing an enzymatically dead DQ-to-AA ZDHHC13 mutation cyclically lost their hair after weaning, recapitulating knock-out phenotypes of skin inflammation and dermatitis. To establish the ZDHHC13 substrates responsible for skin barrier development, we employed quantitative proteomic approaches to identify protein molecules whose palmitoylation is tightly controlled by ZDHHC13. We identified over 300 candidate proteins that could be classified into four biological categories: immunological disease, skin development and function, dermatological disease, and lipid . Palmitoylation of three of these candidates-loricrin, peptidyl arginine deiminase type III and keratin fiber crosslinker transglutaminase 1-by ZDHHC13 was confirmed by biochemical assay. Palmitoylation was critical for in vivo protein stability of the latter two candidates. Our findings reveal the importance of protein palmitoylation in skin barrier development, partly by promoting envelope protein crosslinking and the filaggrin processing pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Rice, a good dietary source of carbohydrates, also contains RS. However, it remains unclear if RS at the amount consumed in cooked rice has health benefit. To address the question, we examined the effects of cooked rice containing different levels of RS in a diet-induced obesity rodent model. Rice containing RS as low as 1.07% attenuated adipose weight and adipocyte size gain, induced by a moderately high- (HF) diet which correlated with lower leptin levels in plasma and adipose tissue. Rice with 8.61% RS increased fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, modulated HF diet-induced adipose triacylglycerol  and inflammation related genes' expression, and increased fecal triglyceride excretion.

Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are -vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and metabolic proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of immunity, infection, cholesterol and drug , while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG pathways of HIF-1 signalling and glycolysis. The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia.

Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body , an accrued progressive character.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low- diet (LFD) or high- diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT.

It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione , pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty acid , biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655089>Preadipocyte factor 1 regulates adipose tissue browning via TNF-α-converting enzyme-mediated cleavage.</a></h2><p>Increasing adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming obesity and obesity-related disorders. Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige  biogenesis.Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6N mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige  markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige  formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible -specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis. This offers a unique target for improving energy homeostasis and treating obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by  analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty acids in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661927>A Shifty Target: Tumor-Initiating Cells and Their .</a></h2><p>Tumor-initiating cells (TICs), or cancer stem cells, constitute highly chemoresistant, asymmetrically dividing, and tumor-initiating populations in cancer and are thought to play a key role in metastatic and chemoresistant disease. Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive metabolic plasticity, TIC  is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with metabolic features, with some focus on oxidative , including fatty acid and . These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their  will require advanced methodologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642867>Association of Lipidomic Profiles With Progression of Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis in HIV Infection.</a></h2><p> disruption and excess risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been observed in HIV-infected individuals, but the associations among HIV infection, plasma lipidome, and CVD risk have not been well understood.To evaluate plasma lipidomic profiles and their associations with carotid artery atherosclerosis in individuals with HIV and individuals without HIV.Prospective analysis in the Women's Interagency HIV Study and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study during a 7-year follow-up (from 2004-2006 to 2011-2013) at multicenter HIV cohorts in the United States. The study included 737 participants aged 35 to 55 years (520 with HIV and 217 without HIV) without CVD or carotid artery plaque at baseline. Data were analyzed between April 2017 and July 2019.Two hundred eleven plasma  species.Poisson regression was used to examine the associations of baseline  species with risk of plaque measured by repeated B-mode carotid artery ultrasonography imaging.Of the 737 included participants, 398 (54%) were women, 351 (48%) were African American (non-Hispanic), 156 of 737 (21%) were nonwhite Hispanic, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (6) years. After adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, we identified 12  species, representing independent signals for 10  classes, associated with risk of plaque. Nine  species remained significant after further adjusting for conventional CVD risk factors, although many of them showed moderate to high association with conventional blood lipids (eg, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols and triglycerides). Cholesteryl ester (16:1) (risk ratio [RR] per standard deviation, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.52), ceramide (16:0) (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.63), lysophosphatidylcholine (20:4) (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.58), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (16:0) (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.57), phosphatidylethanolamine (38:6) (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.08-1.64), phosphatidylethanolamine-plasmalogen (36:2) (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52), phosphatidylserine-plasmalogen (36:3) (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.43), and triacylglycerol (54:6) (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) were associated with increased risk of plaque, while phosphatidylcholine (36:4) (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77) was associated with decreased risk of plaque. Most of these plaque-increased  species showed higher levels in individuals with HIV, particularly among individuals with HIV using antiretroviral therapy compared with individuals without HIV. Network analysis identified 9  modules, and 2 modules composed of triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines with long and unsaturated acyl chains, respectively, showed the strongest associations with increased risk of plaque.This study identified multiple plasma  species associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, and alterations in these  species might be associated with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. Our data suggest unfavorable associations of long-chain and unsaturated triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines with carotid artery plaque formation.</p></html>
