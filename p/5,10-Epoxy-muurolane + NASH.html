The proper and on time identification of at-risk HIV-positive individuals would be relevant in order to reduce the rate of progression from NAFLD into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.The aim of this study was to explore visceral fat thickness (VFT) and anthropometric measurements associated with the development of NAFLD in patients mono-infected with HIV and on long-standing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).Eighty-eight ( = 88) HIV-positive male patients, average age 39.94 ± 9.91 years, and stable on cART, were included in this prospective study. VFT was measured using ultrasonography. Anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (W/H), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC). Differences between variables were determined using the chi-square test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index were used to determine optimal cut-off values of VFT and hepatic steatosis. The area under the curve (AUC), 95% confidence intervals, sensitivity and specificity are reported for the complete sample. Significance was set at  < 0.05.Patients with steatosis had significantly higher values of BMI, HC, WC, W/H and WHtR. The VFT was higher in patients with steatosis ( < 0.001). Specifically, VFT values above 31.98 mm and age > 38. years correlated with steatosis in HIV-positive patients, namely sensitivity 89%, specificity 72%, AUC 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index = 0.61. The sensitivity of the age determinant above this cut-off point was 84%, specificity 73% and AUC 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index of 0.57.In the absence of more advanced radiographic and histological tools, simple anthropometric measurements and VFT could assist in the early identification of persons at risk of hepatic steatosis in low- and middle-income regions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393787>Exogenous PP2A inhibitor exacerbates the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via NOX2-dependent activation of miR21.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging global pandemic. Though significant progress has been made in unraveling the pathophysiology of the disease, the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and its subsequent inhibition by environmental and genetic factors in NAFLD pathophysiology remains unclear. The present report tests the hypothesis that an exogenous PP2A inhibitor leads to hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis via an NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent pathway in NAFLD. Results showed that microcystin (MC) administration, a potent PP2A inhibitor found in environmental exposure, led to an exacerbation of NAFLD pathology with increased  immunoreactivity, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and stellate cell activation, a process that was attenuated in mice that lacked the  gene and miR21 knockout mice. Mechanistically, leptin-primed immortalized Kupffer cells (a mimicked model for an NAFLD condition) treated with apocynin or nitrone spin trap , dimethyl-1- pyrroline -oxide (DMPO) had significantly decreased  and decreased miR21 and α-smooth muscle actin levels, suggesting the role of NOX2-dependent reactive oxygen species in miR21-induced Kupffer cell activation and stellate cell pathology. Furthermore, NOX2-dependent peroxynitrite generation was primarily responsible for cellular events observed following MC exposure since incubation with phenylboronic acid attenuated miR21 levels, Kupffer cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine release. Furthermore, blocking of the AKT pathway attenuated PP2A inhibitor-induced NOX2 activation and miR21 upregulation. Taken together, we show that PP2A may have protective roles, and its inhibition exacerbates NAFLD pathology via activating NOX2-dependent peroxynitrite generation, thus increasing miR21-induced pathology. Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () progression via NADPH oxidase 2. In addition to a novel emchanism of action, we describe a new tool to describe  histopathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292843>Long-term luseogliflozin therapy improves histological activity of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis accompanied by type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>A 60-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital for further examination of persistent liver dysfunction. She had been suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus since the age of 50 years. Her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value was as high as 7.8% despite treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, metformin, and sulfonylurea. After excluding viral hepatitis, alcohol or drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune liver diseases, liver histology evidence of macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and pericellular fibrosis confirmed a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). Luseogliflozin (2. mg/day), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I), was co-administered to strengthen glycemic control. Liver enzymes and HbA1c gradually improved without any adverse events. A second liver biopsy at 15 months after luseogliflozin commencement revealed improvements in steatosis, fibrosis, and overall histological activity score. This case demonstrates that long-term luseogliflozin may be a good therapeutic option for diabetic NAFLD/ patients. The merits of persistent SGLT2I administration for NAFLD/ patients warrant validation in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31436362>Plasma N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen accurately predicts liver fibrosis severity in children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>We examined the diagnostic performance of plasma N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) levels, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for predicting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and liver fibrosis stage in children/adolescents with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).We enrolled 204 children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD at the "Bambino Gesù" Children's Hospital. We measured plasma PIIINP levels using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and calculated APRI and FIB-4 scores using standard methods.Children with  had higher plasma PIIINP levels, APRI and FIB-4 scores compared with those without  (all P < .001). However, PIIINP levels had much better diagnostic performance and accuracy than APRI and FIB-4 scores for predicting liver fibrosis stage. PIIINP levels correlated with the total NAFLD activity score (NAS) and its constituent components (P < .0001). The risk of either  or F ≥ 2 fibrosis progressively increased with increasing PIIINP levels (P < .0001), independent of age, gender, adiposity measures, insulin resistance, NAS score and the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein-3 rs738409 polymorphism. For every 3.6 ng/mL increase in PIIINP levels, the likelihood of having F ≥ 2 fibrosis increased by ~14-fold (adjusted-odds ratio 14.1, 95% CI .50-35.8, P < .0001) after adjustment for the aforementioned risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.921 (95% CI 0.87-0.97) for F ≥ 2 fibrosis, and 0.993 (95% CI 0.98-1.0) for F3 fibrosis respectively.Unlike APRI and FIB-4 scores, plasma PIIINP levels are a promising, non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing liver fibrosis stage in children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Obesity is a risk factor for cancers; however, the role of NAFLD in this association is unknown. We investigated the effect of NAFLD versus obesity on incident cancers.We identified all incident cases of NAFLD in a US population between 1997-2016. Individuals with NAFLD were matched by age and sex to referent individuals from the same population (1:3) on the index diagnosis date. We ascertained the incidence of cancer after index date until death, loss to follow-up or study end. NAFLD and cancer were defined using a code-based algorithm with high validity and tested by medical record review. The association between NAFLD or obesity and cancer risk was examined using Poisson regression.A total of 4,722 individuals with NAFLD (median age 54, 46% male) and 14,441 age- and sex-matched referent individuals were followed for a median of 8 (range 1-21) years, during which 2,224 incident cancers occurred. NAFLD was associated with 90% higher risk of malignancy: incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.9 (95% CI 1.3-2.7). The highest risk increase was noted in liver cancer, IRR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.6-.1), followed by uterine IRR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.4-4.1), stomach IRR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-4.1), pancreas IRR = 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.3) and colon cancer IRR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.8). In reference to non-obese controls, NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of incident cancers (IRR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.-2.9), while obesity alone was not (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.4).NAFLD was associated with increased cancer risk, particularity of gastrointestinal types. In the absence of NAFLD, the association between obesity and cancer risk is small, suggesting that NAFLD may be a mediator of the obesity-cancer association.We studied the incidence of malignancies in a community cohort of adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in reference to age- and sex-matched adults without NAFLD. After 21 years of longitudinal follow-up, NAFLD was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in the risk of developing cancers, predominantly of the liver, gastrointestinal tract and uterus. The association with increased cancer risk was stronger in NAFLD than obesity.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days.The trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (between-group difference, -0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.4 to .9; P = 0.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group. There were no consistent between-group differences in end points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months.Among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets.

The major risk factors for HCC development are chronic liver disease and cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), steatohepatitis, intake of aflatoxin-contaminated food, diabetes, and obesity.In Western countries, the number of -related HCC cases is increasing, that of HBV- or HCV-related cases is declining due to the wide application of HBV universal vaccination and the introduction of effective therapies against HBV and HCV infections, and that of alcohol-related cases remaining substantially unchanged. Nevertheless, the burden of HCC is expected to increase worldwide in the next few decades, due to the population growth and aging expected in coming years. Overall, the abovementioned changes and future variations in lifestyle and in the impact of environmental factors in Western countries and a decreasing exposure to dietary aflatoxins and improved socio-economic conditions in developing countries will create new HCC epidemiology in the next few decades.A substantial further reduction in cases of HCC requires a wider application of universal HBV vaccination and effective treatment of HBV- and HCV-related chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, more effective campaigns to favor correct dietary habits and reduce alcohol consumption and the intensification of studies on HCC pathogenesis for future optimized prevention strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602526>Hepatic FATP5 expression is associated with histological progression and loss of hepatic fat in NAFLD patients.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () are characterized by the accumulation of excess hepatic fat. However, in the progression from  to cirrhosis, hepatic fat is often lost. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism underlying hepatic fat loss during  progression.Liver biopsies were performed at The University of Tokyo Hospital between November 2011 and March 2016 on 146 patients with NAFLD and 14 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who were not being treated with any diabetes or dyslipidemia drugs. Among them, 70 patients underwent liver biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied  h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several fatty acid metabolism-related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of fatty acid transport protein  (FATP5), which is associated with free fatty acid intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding fatty acid metabolism-related proteins were comparable between  with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic fat loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic fat loss during  progression to cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556124>Clinical utility of an increase in magnetic resonance elastography in predicting fibrosis progression in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Cross-sectional studies have shown that magnetic-resonance-elastography (MRE) is accurate in non-invasive detection of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. However, there are limited data on the longitudinal association between an increase in liver-stiffness on MRE and fibrosis progression in NAFLD. Therefore, utilizing a well-characterized prospective cohort of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, we aimed to examine the longitudinal association between a 15% increase in liver-stiffness on MRE and fibrosis progression in NAFLD.This prospective cohort study including 102 patients (62.7% women) with biopsy-proven NAFLD who underwent contemporaneous MRE and liver biopsy at baseline followed by a repeat paired liver biopsy and MRE assessment. Primary outcome was odds of fibrosis progression by ≥ 1 stage as assessed by  CRN-Histologic-Scoring-System.The mean (±SD) of age and BMI were 52 (±14) years and 32.6 (±.3) kg/m , respectively. The median time interval between the two paired assessment was 1.4 years (interquartile range: 2.15 years). The number of patients with fibrosis stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 27, 36, 12, 17, and 10, respectively. In unadjusted analysis, a 15% increase in MRE was associated with increased odds of histologic fibrosis progression (OR=3.56, 95% CI:1.17 - 10.76, p=0.0248). These findings remained clinically and statistically significant even after multivariable-adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (adjusted OR=3.36, 95% CI:1.10 - 10.31, p=0.0339). A 15% increase in MRE was the strongest predictor of progression to advanced fibrosis (OR=4.90, 95%CI:1.35-17.84, p=0.0159).A 15% increase in liver stiffness on MRE may be associated with histologic fibrosis progression and progression from early fibrosis to advanced fibrosis.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672994>The AgeGuess database, an open online resource on chronological and perceived ages of people aged -100.</a></h2><p>In many developed countries, human life expectancy has doubled over the last 180 years.

The performance of cathepsin D in the diagnosis and monitoring of  was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.Data for 216 liver biopsies and 34 healthy controls were analyzed. The mean cathepsin D level was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and controls; between  and non- patients; and across the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of NAFLD and  was 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. The AUROC of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades ranged from 0.51 to 0.58. Of the 216 liver biopsies, 152 were paired liver biopsies from 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks. There was no significant change in the cathepsin D level at follow-up compared to baseline in patients who had histological improvement or worsening for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. Cathepsin D was poor for predicting improvement or worsening of steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning, with AUROC ranging from 0.47 to 0.54. It was fair for predicting worsening (AUROC 0.73) but poor for predicting improvement (AUROC 0.54) of lobular inflammation.Cathepsin D was a poor biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of  in our cohort of Asian patients, somewhat inconsistent with previous observations in Caucasian patients.

In this study, we modeled the Fort Cobb Reservoir watershed located in southwestern Oklahoma, USA using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and evaluated the impacts of five agricultural BMP scenarios on surface runoff, sediment yield, and crop yield. The hydrological model, with 43 sub-basins and 15,217 hydrological response units, was calibrated (1991-2000) and validated (2001-2010) against the monthly observations of streamflow, sediment grab samples, and crop-yields. The coefficient of determination ( ), -Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) and percentage bias (PB) were used to determine model performance with satisfactory values of   (0.64 and 0.79) and NS (0.61 and 0.62) in the calibration and validation period respectively for streamflow. We found that contouring practice reduced surface runoff by more than 18% in both conservation tillage and no-till practices for all crops used in this modeling study. In addition, contour farming with either conservation tillage or no-till practice reduced sediment yield by almost half. Compared to the conservation tillage practice, no-till practice decreased sediment yield by 25.3% and 9.0% for cotton and grain sorghum, respectively. Using wheat as cover crop for grain sorghum generated the lowest runoff followed by its rotation with canola and cotton regardless of contouring. Converting all the crops in the watershed into Bermuda grass resulted in significant reduction in sediment yield (72.-96.3%) and surface runoff (6.8-38.%). The model can be used to provide useful information for stakeholders to prioritize ecologically sound and feasible BMPs at fields that are capable of reducing sediment yield while increasing crop yield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186641>Segmental Distribution of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Correlates with Microvascular Invasion in Liver Explants Undergoing Transplantation.</a></h2><p>Microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is a poor prognostic factor after liver transplantation and/or resection.

Another objective of the study is to assess the treatment history (ablation or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)) and size of the tumor with respect to the risk of MVI.A single center, retrospective chart review, including 98 HCC patients, aged 18 years and older who had liver transplantation in our institute between 2012 and 2017. We reviewed the radiological images of the HCC tumors, the pathological findings of the explanted livers, and the follow-up imaging after transplantation.98 patients with the diagnosis of HCC underwent liver transplantation between 2012 and 2017. The mean age of the cohort was 63 ± 8.2. Males represented 75% and Caucasian race represented 75% of the cohort. The most common etiology of cirrhosis was chronic hepatitis C virus infection followed by alcohol abuse and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with percentages of 50%, 23%, and 10%, respectively. Microvascular invasion was found in 16% of the patients while PVT and the recurrence of HCC were found in 17% and 6 % of the cohort, respectively. MVI was found in 10 single HCC and 6 multifocal HCC. Right lobe HCC had more MVI when compared to the left and multilobar HCC, with percentages of 11%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. Localization of HCC in segment 8 was associated with the highest percentage of MVI when compared to all other segments. The risk of MVI in segment 8 HCC was 3. times higher than the risk from the other segments (p=0.002) while no vascular invasion was found in segments 1, 3, and . The risk of vascular invasion in untreated HCC is 3 times the risk in treated HCC (P=0.03).Our data indicate that the risk of microvascular invasion is highest in tumors localized to segment 8.

A combination of ultrasound and liver elastography was used to screen NAFLD patients and healthy persons. General clinical characteristics, peripheral blood cell count and liver biochemical test results were collected synchronously, plasma samples were retained, and plasma HO-1 level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SPSS21.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis, multivariate logistic regression analyses was used to analyse the independent risk factors affecting the incidence and progression of NAFLD. The diagnostic efficacy of indicators related to development of NAFLD was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve(ROC).  A total of 328 patients with NAFLD and 113 healthy controls were included.

Some of the forces driving this deinstitutionalization have been scientific and patient-centered, such as better differentiation between acute and subacute risk, innovations in outpatient and crisis care (assertive community treatment programs, dialectical behavioral therapy, treatment-oriented psychiatric emergency services), gradually improving psychopharmacology, and an increased appreciation of the negative effect of coercive hospitalization, except when risk is very high. On the other hand, some of the forces have been less focused on patient needs: budget-driven cuts in public hospital beds divorced from population-based need; managed care's profit-driven impact on private psychiatric hospitals and outpatient services; and purported patient-centered approaches promoting non-hospital care that may under-recognize that some extremely ill patients need years of painstaking effort to make a community transition.The result has been a reconfiguration of the country's mental health system that, at times, leaves large numbers of people without adequate mental health and substance abuse services. Often their only option is to seek care in medical emergency departments (ED) that have not been designed for the needs of mentally ill patients. Increasingly, many of those individuals end up waiting in EDs for appropriate care and disposition for hours or days. This overflow phenomenon has become so prevalent that it has been given a name: "boarding." This practice is almost certainly detrimental to patients and staff, and it has spawned efforts on multiple fronts to understand and resolve it. When considering solutions, both ED-focused and systemwide considerations must be explored. This resource document provides an overview and recommendations regarding this complex topic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555572>Role of Soluble Adiponectin Receptor 2 in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children.</a></h2><p>The incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children is gradually increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of serum adiponectin and soluble adiponectin receptor 2 (soluble Adipo R2) levels for the diagnosis of fatty liver disease in obese and overweight children.The study included 51 obese and overweight children between the ages of 6 and 18 years diagnosed with NAFLD using ultrasonography and 20 children without fatty liver disease. Patients whose alanine transaminase level was two times higher than normal (≥80 U/L) were included in the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () group. was observed in 11 (21.6%) of the patients with NAFLD. The incidence of obesity was higher in patients with  (80% and 45%, =0.021). While the adiponectin levels were similar in patients with NAFLD and those without, they were below the normal level in the whole study group. Adiponectin and soluble Adipo R2 levels of patients with  were lower than those in patients without ; however, this difference was not statistically significant (=0.064 and =0.463). Soluble Adipo R2 levels in obese patients with NAFLD were higher than those in obese children without NAFLD (<0.001).Soluble adiponectin receptor 2 level is a noninvasive marker that can be used for the diagnosis of NAFLD in obese children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234738>Invasive breast cancer among Alaska Native women in Alaska.</a></h2><p>Female breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among Alaska Native (AN) women. We examined characteristics of and trends for female breast cancer among AN women. We assessed descriptive statistics, incidence trends (1969-2014), and cause-specific survival for female breast cancers recorded in the Alaska Native Tumor Registry. Results indicated that the majority of breast cancers among AN were diagnosed among women aged over 50 years, at local stage, and with Hormone receptor (HR)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor (HER) 2 subtype. Five-year average incidence (95% CI) in the most recent time-period (2009-2014) was 145.0/100,000 (130.4, 159.)); this was not statistically different from the previous time-period. Survival from breast cancer was high and varied by stage and cancer subtype. Hazard of death was greater among those diagnosed with regional/distant/unknown disease, relative to local disease (HR (95%CI): 4.65 (1.66, 12.98)), and higher among those with HER2/HR cancers, relative to those with HER2-/HR+ cancers (HR (95%CI): 6.59 (2.23, 19.49)). This study provides a comprehensive description of breast cancer among AN women, providing new and updated information on clinical and demographic factors, cancer incidence trends, regional variations and breast cancer survival.

Elevations in serum or plasma have been associated with viral and autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), hepatocellular carcinoma, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). However, these associations were primarily based upon population differences between the disease state and the controls. Thus, little is known about the variability and subsequent variance components of circulating miR-122 in healthy humans, which has implications for the practical use of the biomarker clinically. To address this, we set out to perform variance components analysis of miR-122 in a cohort of 40 healthy volunteers. Employing a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay to detect miR-122 and other circulating miRNAs in human serum, the relative expression of miR-122 was determined using two different normalization approaches: to the mean expression of a panel of several endogenous miRNAs identified using an adaptive algorithm (miRA-Norm) and to the expression of an exogenous miRNA control (Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39). Results from a longitudinal study in healthy volunteers (N = 40) demonstrated high variability with 117- and 111-fold 95% confidence reference interval, respectively. This high variability of miR-122 in serum appeared to be due in part to ethnicity, as 95% confidence reference intervals were approximately three-fold lower in volunteers that identified as Caucasian relative to those that identified as Non-Caucasian. Variance analysis revealed equivalent contributions of intra- and inter-donor variability to miR-122. Surprisingly, miR-122 exhibited the highest variability compared to other 36 abundant miRNAs in circulation; the next variable miRNA, miR-133a, demonstrated a 45- to 62-fold reference interval depending on normalization approaches. In contrast, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity levels in this population exhibited a -fold total variance, with 80% of this variance due to inter-donor sources. In conclusion, miR-122 demonstrated higher than expected variability in serum from healthy volunteers, which has implications for its potential utility as a prospective biomarker of liver damage or injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415032>Incidence and Risks for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Steatohepatitis Post-liver Transplant: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The true incidence and unique risk factors for recurrent and de novo nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () post-liver transplant (LT) remain poorly characterized. We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for recurrent and de novo NAFLD/ post-LT.MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for studies from 2000 to 2018. Risk of bias was adjudicated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Seventeen studies representing 2378 patients were included. All were retrospective analyses of patients with post-LT liver biopsies, with the exception of 2 studies that used imaging for outcome assessment. Seven studies evaluated occurrence of recurrent NAFLD/, 3 evaluated de novo occurrence, and 7 evaluated both recurrent and de novo. In studies at generally high or moderate risk of bias, mean 1-, 3-, and ≥-year incidence rates may be 59%, 57%, and 82% for recurrent NAFLD; 67%, 40%, and 78% for de novo NAFLD; 53%, 57.4%, and 38% for recurrent ; and 13%, 16%, and 17% for de novo . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that post-LT body mass index (summarized odds ratio = 1.27) and hyperlipidemia were the most consistent predictors of outcomes.There is low confidence in the incidence of recurrent and de novo NAFLD and  after LT due to study heterogeneity. Recurrent and de novo NAFLD may occur in over half of recipients as soon as 1 year after LT.  recurs in most patients after LT, whereas de novo  occurs rarely. NAFLD/ after LT is associated with metabolic risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201552>Obeticholic Acid: An Update of Its Pharmacological Activities in Liver Disorders.</a></h2><p>Obeticholic acid (OCA), 6α-ethyl-3α,7α-dihydroxy--cholan-24-oic acid, is a semisynthetic derivative of the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 3α,7α-dihydroxy--cholan-24-oic acid), a relatively hydrophobic primary bile acid synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-CDCA or INT-747, was originally described by investigators at the Perugia University in 2002 as a selective ligand for the bile acid sensor, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). In addition to FXR and similarly to CDCA, OCA also activates GPBAR1/TGR5, a cell membrane G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile acids. In 2016, based on the results of phase II studies showing efficacy in reducing the plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate biomarker for disease progression in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), OCA has gained approval as a second-line treatment for PBC patients nonresponsive to UDCA. The use of OCA in PBC patients associates with several side effects, the most common of which is pruritus, whose incidence is dose-dependent and is extremely high when this agent is used as a monotherapy. Additionally, the use of OCA associates with the increased risk for the development of liver failure in cirrhotic PBC patients. Currently, OCA is investigated for its potential in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Phase II and III trials have shown that OCA might attenuate the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with , but it has no efficacy in reversing the steatotic component of the disease, while reduces the circulating levels of HDL-C and increases LDL-C. In summary, OCA has been the first-in-class of FXR ligands advanced to a clinical stage and is now entering its third decade of life, highlighting the potential benefits and risk linked to FXR-targeted therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392448>A green racer snake (Philodryas nattereri, Colubridae) killed but not eaten by a blonde capuchin monkey (Sapajus flavius, Cebidae).</a></h2><p>We report the killing of a snake (Philodryas nattereri, Colubridae) by a blonde capuchin monkey (Sapajus flavius, Cebidae). This endemic primate species from the northeast of Brazil includes vertebrates such as lizards and marsupials in its diet, but we can find no previously published record of an attack upon or consumption of snakes by this species of platyrhine monkey. During the attack, the group mobbed the snake, with individuals uttering agonistic vocalizations and displaying behaviors such as raising their tails, moving tree branches, piloerecting, and baring their teeth. An adult male monkey seized the snake, bit and twisted its body, thereby killing it; he then dropped the carcass onto tree branches, but did not consume it. This single event suggests that this Cebidae species may be able to distinguish dangerous from harmless snakes, and it also may be an example of a lethally violent reaction to a potential predator or competitor, exemplifying the plasticity and cognitive skills exhibited by genus Sapajus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372557>Estimating sediment yield at Kaduna watershed, Nigeria using soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model.</a></h2><p>Over the years, sedimentation has posed a great danger to the storage capacity of hydropower reservoirs. Good understanding of the transport system and hydrological processes in the dam is very crucial to its sustainability. Under optimal functionality, the Shiroro dam in Northern Nigeria can generate ∼600 MW, which is ideally sufficient to power about 404,000 household. Unfortunately, there have not been reliable monitoring measures to assess yield in the upstream, where sediments are sourced into the dam. In this study, we applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict the hydrological processes, the sediment transport mechanism and sediment yield between 1990 and 2018 in Kaduna watershed (32,124 km) located upstream of the dam. The model was calibrated and validated using observed flow and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) data. Performance evaluation of the model was achieved statistically using -Sutcliffe (NS), coefficient of determination (r) and percentage of observed data (p-factor). SWAT model evaluation using NS (0.71), r (0.80) and p-factors of 0.86 suggests that the model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and sediment yield predictions. The model identified the threshold depth of water (GWQMN.gw) and base flow (ALPHA_BF.gw) as the most sensitive parameters for streamflow and sediment yield estimation in the watershed. Our finding showed that an estimated suspended sediment yield of about 84.1 t/ha/yr was deposited within the period under study. Basins 67, 71 and 62 have erosion prone area with the highest sediment values of 79.4, 75.1 and 73.8 t/h respectively. Best management practice is highly recommended for the dam sustainability, because of the proximity of erosion-prone basins to the dam.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265003>Search for supersymmetry in events with a photon, jets,  -jets, and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at 13 .</a></h2><p>A search for supersymmetry is presented based on events with at least one photon, jets, and large missing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13  . The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  and were recorded at the LHC with the CMS detector in 2016. The analysis characterizes signal-like events by categorizing the data into various signal regions based on the number of jets, the number of  -tagged jets, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant excess of events is observed with respect to the expectations from standard model processes. Limits are placed on the gluino and top squark pair production cross sections using several simplified models of supersymmetric particle production with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Depending on the model and the mass of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, the production of gluinos with masses as large as 2120  and the production of top squarks with masses as large as 1230  are excluded at 95% confidence level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233523>Apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibition with volixibat improves metabolic aspects and components of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice.</a></h2><p>Interruption of bile acid recirculation through inhibition of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is a promising strategy to alleviate hepatic cholesterol accumulation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), and improve the metabolic aspects of the disease. Potential disease-attenuating effects of the ASBT inhibitor volixibat (, 15, and 30 mg/kg) were investigated in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice over 24 weeks. Plasma and fecal bile acid levels, plasma insulin, lipids, and liver enzymes were monitored. Final analyses included liver histology, intrahepatic lipids, mesenteric white adipose tissue mass, and liver gene profiling. Consistent with its mechanism of action, volixibat significantly increased the total amount of bile acid in feces. At the highest dose, volixibat significantly attenuated the HFD-induced increase in hepatocyte hypertrophy, hepatic triglyceride and cholesteryl ester levels, and mesenteric white adipose tissue deposition. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) was significantly lower in volixibat-treated mice than in the HFD controls. Gene profiling showed that volixibat reversed the inhibitory effect of the HFD on metabolic master regulators, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β, insulin receptor, and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2. Volixibat may have beneficial effects on physiological and metabolic aspects of  pathophysiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061949>Looking Into the Crystal Ball: Predicting the Future Challenges of Fibrotic  Treatment.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide, and its aggressive form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is becoming a leading cause for end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in the United States. In patients with , the presence of advanced fibrosis is considered the most important prognostic factor in predicting liver-related morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications to treat patients with -induced advanced fibrosis. However, the field of drug development to treat  and fibrosis has witnessed major advances over the past  years with several medications in phase III trials. Results from some of these trials are expected in 2019 with potential FDA approval in 2020. Clinicians who treat patients with NAFLD are likely to face several challenges over the next few years related to identifying patients with advanced fibrosis who may derive most benefit from pharmacologic treatment, the requirement for liver biopsy to assess histologic severity and response to treatment, and the urgent need to validate noninvasive tests to replace liver biopsy-to determine treatment initiation, response, futility, and the need for combination therapy with multiple drugs.  In this review, we aim to dissect each of these challenges and attempt to provide suggested solutions while fully realizing that knowledge gaps still exist where future research is likely to provide urgently needed answers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576191>Modeling of runoff water and runoff pesticide concentrations in upland bare soil using improved SPEC model.</a></h2><p>The SPEC model (Predicted Environmental Concentrations in agricultural Soils) was developed and improved for the simulation of pesticide runoff. The model was applied to the Sakaecho upland bare soil field (Tokyo, Japan) to predict runoff water, sediment concentration in runoff water, pesticide concentrations in runoff water, and runoff sediment (clothianidin and imidacloprid) under artificial rainfall conditions. The results showed that the simulated time to first runoff agreed very well with the observed data. The simulated cumulative runoff, sediment yield, and imidacloprid concentration in sediment agreed well with the observed data (-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)>0.75). The simulated runoff rate agreed reasonably well with the observed data (NSE >0.). The predicted clothianidin concentrations in sediment and in runoff water had acceptable agreement with the observed data (NSE >0).

We hypothesized that the hepatoprotective anti-inflammatory benefits of catechin-rich green tea extract (GTE) would protect against HCC progression by inhibiting -associated liver injury and pro-oncogenic responses. We used an HCC model in high-fat (HF)-fed mice that mimics early oncogenic events during  without inducing tumorigenesis and premature mortality. Male C57BL/6J mice (4-weeks old) were fed a HF diet containing GTE at 0% or 2%. Mice were administered saline or diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 60 mg kg-1, i.p.) at -weeks and 7-weeks of age. , inflammation, fibrosis, and oncogenic responses were assessed at 25-weeks of age. Saline-treated mice showed prominent histopathological signs of steatosis and hepatocellular ballooning. Although DEN did not impact adiposity, steatosis, ballooning and hepatic lipid accumulation, these parameters were attenuated by GTE regardless of DEN. Hepatic lipid peroxidation and fibrosis that were increased by DEN were attenuated by GTE. Hepatic TLR4, MCP1 and TNFα mRNA levels were unaffected by DEN, whereas iNOS was increased by DEN. These transcripts were lowered by GTE. GTE attenuated the frequency of PCNA+ hepatocytes and mRNA expression of cyclin D1, MIB1 and Ki-67 that were otherwise increased by DEN. GTE increase APAF1 mRNA that was otherwise lowered by DEN. Relative to saline-treated mice, DEN increased mRNA levels of oncostatin M, gp130, c-Fos, c-Myc and survivin; each was lowered by GTE in DEN-treated mice. These findings indicate that GTE may protect against hepatic oncogenesis by limiting early steps in the carcinogenic cascade related to -associated HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085211>Determination of narcotic potency using a neurobehavioral assay with larval zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Identifying chemicals with narcotic potency is an important aspect of assessing the safety of consumer products that may be accidentally ingested. A rapid and efficient assay of narcotic potency is desired for assessing chemicals with such suspected activity.This purpose of this research was to develop a non-mammalian vertebrate, high throughput, neurobehavioral method to assess the narcotic potency of chemicals using larval zebrafish.Larval zebrafish were acutely exposed to chemicals beginning at  days post fertilization ( dpf). Locomotor activity, elicited by regular, periodic photostimulation, was quantified using a video tracking apparatus. Narcotic potency was determined as the molar concentration at which photostimulated locomotor activity was reduced by 50% (IC). Toxicity was assessed based on observations of morbidity or mortality. Recovery was assessed following removal of test material by serial dilution and reassessment of photostimulated behavior 24 hr later (6 dpf).A total of 21 chemicals were assessed. Etomidate, a human narcotic analgesic agent, was used as a reference material. Investigating a series of eleven linear, primary alcohols (C6 to C16), a relationship between narcotic potency and carbon number was observed; narcotic potency increased with carbon number up to C12, consistent with historical studies. For a set of technical grade surfactants, nonionic surfactants (i.e., alcohol ethoxylates) were observed to be narcotic agents while anionic surfactants produced evidence of reduced locomotor activity only in combination with toxicity. Of the solvents evaluated, only ethanol exhibited narcotic activity with an IC of 261 mM and was the least potent of the chemicals investigated. Etomidate was the most potent material evaluated with an IC of 0.39 μM.The larval zebrafish neurobehavioral assay provides a method capable of estimating the narcotic potency of chemicals and can identify if toxicity contributes to observed neurobehavioral effects in the test organism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although validated on multiple separate cohorts, the nomogram requires periodic updating as patient care changes over time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the nomogram's accuracy in a contemporary cohort and modify the tool to reflect improvements in outcome related to advances in colon cancer therapy.A contemporary patient cohort was compiled, including consecutive colon cancer patients undergoing curative resection for stage I-III colon adenocarcinoma at MSK from 2007 to 2014. The nomogram's predictive accuracy was assessed by concordance index and calibration plots of predicted vs actual freedom from recurrence at  years after surgery.Data from a total of 999 eligible patients with complete records were used for validation. Median follow-up among survivors was 37 months. The concordance index was 0.756 (95% confidence interval = 0.707 to 0.805), indicating continued discriminating power, but the calibration plot revealed that the nomogram overestimated recurrence risk. Recalibration of the nomogram by estimating a new baseline freedom-from-recurrence function restored the nomogram's accuracy.The updated nomogram retains the original nomogram's variables but includes a lower baseline estimation of recurrence risk, reflecting improvements in outcomes for all stages of colon cancer, likely resulting from advances in imaging and integration of multiple treatment modalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271665>Noninvasive Tests Accurately Identify Advanced Fibrosis due to : Baseline Data From the STELLAR Trials.</a></h2><p>Accurate noninvasive tests (NITs) are needed to replace liver biopsy for identifying advanced fibrosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). We analyzed screening data from two phase 3 trials of selonsertib to assess the ability of NITs to discriminate advanced fibrosis. Centrally read biopsies from the STELLAR studies, which enrolled patients with bridging fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, were staged according to the  Clinical Research Network classification. We explored associations between fibrosis stage and NITs, including the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test, and liver stiffness by vibration-controlled transient elastography (LS by VCTE). The performance of these tests to discriminate advanced fibrosis, either alone or in combinations, was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) with -fold cross-validation repeated 100 times. Of the 4,404 patients screened for these trials, 3,202 had evaluable biopsy data: 940 with F0-F2 fibrosis and 2,262 with F3-F4 fibrosis. Significant differences between median values of NITs for patients with F0-F2 versus F3-F4 fibrosis were observed: -0.972 versus 0.318 for NFS, 1.18 versus 2.20 for FIB-4, 9.22 versus 10.39 for ELF, and 8.8 versus 16. kPa for LS by VCTE (all P < 0.001). AUROCs ranged from 0.75 to 0.80 to discriminate advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 followed by an LS by VCTE or ELF test in those with indeterminate values (FIB-4 between 1.3 and 2.67) maintained an acceptable performance while reducing the rate of indeterminate results. Conclusion: Among patients being considered for enrollment into clinical trials, NITs alone or in combination can reduce the need for liver biopsy to discriminate advanced fibrosis caused by .

Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic liver disease.

NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3 fatty acid desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents.Liver damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of .

Twenty-two patients with osteoarthritis were evaluated at a mean of 40 years post-meniscectomy using standardised weight-bearing radiographs of the operated and non-operated knees. Patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis was diagnosed by the presence of osteophytes and joint space narrowing to less than  mm. Kellgren and Lawrence scores were calculated from the radiographs. Patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis and tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis were correlated with International Knee Documentation Committee scores and range of movement measurements. A significant difference was observed between the operated and non-operated knees in terms of patellofemoral joint osteophyte formation. There was a significant difference in tibiofemoral joint Kellgren and Lawrence scores, International Knee Documentation Committee scores and range of movement measurements between knees with lateral facet patellofemoral joint space of <  mm and >  mm. This study shows an association between open total meniscectomy and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis at 40 years following surgery. There was also an association between patellofemoral joint space narrowing in the lateral facet and tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis. Possible causes include altered biomechanical loading patterns following meniscectomy as well as global processes within the knee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515437>Hospital-level evaluation of the effect of a national quality improvement programme: time-series analysis of registry data.</a></h2><p>A clinical trial in 93 National Health Service hospitals evaluated a quality improvement programme for emergency abdominal surgery, designed to improve mortality by improving the patient care pathway. Large variation was observed in implementation approaches, and the main trial result showed no mortality reduction. Our objective therefore was to evaluate whether trial participation led to care pathway implementation and to study the relationship between care pathway implementation and use of six recommended implementation strategies.We performed a hospital-level time-series analysis using data from the Enhanced Peri-Operative Care for High-risk patients trial. Care pathway implementation was defined as achievement of >80% median reliability in 10 measured care processes. Mean monthly process performance was plotted on run charts. Process improvement was defined as an observed run chart signal, using probability-based 'shift' and 'runs' rules. A new median performance level was calculated after an observed signal.Of 93 participating hospitals, 80 provided sufficient data for analysis, generating 800 process measure charts from 20 305 patient admissions over 27 months. No hospital reliably implemented all 10 processes. Overall, only 279 of the 800 processes were improved (3 (2-) per hospital) and 14/80 hospitals improved more than six processes. Mortality risk documented (57/80 (71%)), lactate measurement (42/80 (53%)) and cardiac output guided fluid therapy (32/80 (40%)) were most frequently improved. Consultant-led decision making (14/80 (18%)), consultant review before surgery (17/80 (21%)) and time to surgery (14/80 (18%)) were least frequently improved. In hospitals using ≥ implementation strategies, 9/30 (30%) hospitals improved ≥6 care processes compared with 0/11 hospitals using ≤2 implementation strategies.Only a small number of hospitals improved more than half of the measured care processes, more often when at least five of six implementation strategies were used. In a longer term project, this understanding may have allowed us to adapt the intervention to be effective in more hospitals.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Furthermore,  is the more aggressive necro-inflammatory form, which may accumulate fibrosis and result in End stage liver disease (ESLD). NAFLD is also linked to systemic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis. NAFLD is currently the most common cause of ESLD in Western countries, becoming a serious public health concern. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a systemic inflammatory/autoinflammatory disease of the terminal follicular epithelium of the apocrine gland with a prevalence of 0.05% to 4.10%. Due to its systemic inflammatory behavior several comorbidities were recently associated, however liver ones were scarcely assessed.To evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of /NAFL in HS patients.This retrospective study is a sub-analysis of a larger study carried out in 4 Italian dermatological centers. In this cohort, there were 83 patients: 51 patients with HS only, 20 patients with HS/NAFL and 12 with HS/.Inflammatory comorbidities were present in 3.9% of HS only patients, 25% of HS/NAFL patients and 58.3% of HS/ patients ( 0.001). Similarly, mean Autoinflammatory Disease Damage Index (ADDI) was significantly higher among patients with HS/ (.3 ± 2.2,  0.001) compared to patients with HS/NAFL or HS only (2.8 ± 1.6 and 2.6 ± 1.4 respectively). Furthermore, ADDI correlates with IHS4 in HS, HS/NAFL and HS/. Diabetic patients have higher Hurley score than not diabetic ones. Ultrasound examination was significantly different in the three groups.HS patients displayed a high prevalence of /NAFLD and ultrasound examination should be particularly addressed to patients that display high ADDI scores.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369606>Increasing metabolic co-morbidities are associated with higher risk of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Hepatic fibrosis and advanced fibrosis in particular is the strongest predictor of liver-related outcomes and mortality among nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () patients. Understanding prevalence and predictors of  with advanced fibrosis is critical for healthcare resource planning. Using a large U.S. clinical laboratory database from 10/1/2017-9/30/2018, adults negative for hepatitis B and hepatitis C and after excluding for alcoholic liver disease and pregnancy were evaluated for prevalence of F3 and F4 fibrosis using a systematic algorithm of five fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) criteria: Criteria 1 (≥F3: >2.67), Criteria 2 (2.67<F3≤4.12 and F4>4.12), Criteria 3 (2.67<F3≤3.15, F4>3.15), Criteria 4 (3.25<F3≤3., F4>3.), Criteria  (3.25<F3≤4.12, F4>4.12). Metabolic co-morbidities evaluated included decreased high density lipoprotein (<40 mg/dL men, <50 mg/dL women), high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), elevated hemoglobin A1C (≥6.%). Parallel analyses of patients with specific NAFLD/ ICD-9/10 codes from 10/1/2013-9/30/2018 were performed. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of ≥F3 fibrosis. Among patients with NAFLD/ ICD-9/10 codes, ≥F3 prevalence ranged from 4.35% - 6.90%, and F4 prevalence ranged from 2.52%- 3.67%. Increasing metabolic co-morbidities was associated with higher risk of ≥F3 fibrosis. Compared to  patients without metabolic co-morbidities,  with four concurrent metabolic co-morbidities had higher risk of ≥F3 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.40-1.73, p<0.001). In summary, prevalence of  with advanced fibrosis among U.S. adults was as high as 6.90% and prevalence of  with cirrhosis was as high as 3.67%, representing .18 million and 2.75 million, respectively, when using an estimate of 75 million U.S. adults with NAFLD. Co-morbid metabolic abnormalities were associated with higher risk of advanced fibrosis among  patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589740>Direct Exports of Phosphorus from Fertilizers Applied to Grazed Pastures.</a></h2><p>Since its discovery in 1669, phosphorus (P) in the form of fertilizer has become an essential input for many agroecosystems. By introducing a concentrated P source, fertilizers increase short-term P export potential soon after their application and longer-term export potential by increasing soil fertility (legacy P). The 4R concept was developed to help mitigate P exports from the fertilizers that sustain agricultural productivity. This review investigates the factors affecting P exports soon after the application of mineral fertilizers to pasture-based grazing systems and studies quantifying its potential impact in different systems, with an emphasis on Australasia. Initially, P fertilizers and reactions that might affect their short-term P export potential are reviewed, along with P transport pathways, the forms of P exported from grazing systems, factors affecting P mobilization into water, and studies demonstrating the possible short-term effects of fertilizer application on P exports. Using that foundation, we review studies quantifying the short-term impact of fertilizer application in different regions; they show that under poor management, recently applied fertilizer can contribute a considerable proportion (30-80%) of total farm P exports in drainage, but when fertilizer is well-managed, that figure is expected to be <10%. We then use three model systems of varying hydrology that are common to Australasia to demonstrate the principles for selecting fertilizers that are likely to minimize P exports soon after their application.© 2019 The Author(s).

RC tears are common in individuals older than 60 years and the repair of these tears is amongst the most prevalent of orthopedic procedures. However, most current models of this injury are established in young animals, which may not accurately recapitulate the clinical condition. In this study, we used a murine model of massive RC tears to evaluate age-related muscle degeneration following chronic injury. The expression of the fibro-adipogenic genes encoding collagen type III and leptin was higher in aged RC compared with matched injured young tissue at 2 weeks post-injury, and development of fibrosis was accelerated in aged mice within  days post-injury. Furthermore, the synthesis of collagens type I and III and fat tissue accumulation were significantly higher in injured RCs of aged mice. Similar frequency of fibro-adipogenic PDGFRβ PDGFRα progenitor cells was measured in non-injured RC of aged and young mice, but PDGFRβ PDGFRα cells contributed to significantly larger fibrotic lesions in aged RCs within 2 weeks post-injury, implying a more robust fibrotic environment in the aged injured muscle. Altogether, these findings demonstrate age-dependent differences in RC response to chronic injury with a more profound fibro-adipogenic change in aged muscles. Clinically, cell therapies for muscular pathologies should not only consider the cell type being transplanted but also the recipient milieu into which these cells are seeded. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The expression profiles of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) were examined using microarray and verified by RT-qPCR.QG significantly improved the phenotypic characteristics of , as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and liver inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased. By the cutoff of a 1.-fold change and P < 0.05, 6193 mRNAs, 5692 lncRNAs and 4843 circRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between the MCD and normal groups, and 514 mRNAs, 1182 lncRNAs and 443 circRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between the QG and MCD groups. The intersections (244 mRNAs, 259 lncRNAs and 98 circRNAs) among the three groups were chosen for analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment revealed that most overlapping mRNAs were related to immune functions such as natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, intestinal immune network for IgA production, and T cell receptor signaling pathway. Pathway interactions, protein-protein interactions and molecular complex detection (MCODE) analysis identified numerous immune-related hub genes e.g. natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1(Ncr1), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (Cxcl9), Klra1, and Cd28.

Trachoma impact surveys (TIS) were conducted in all districts between 2010 and 2015, following 3- years of intervention with the WHO-recommended SAFE (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement) strategy. A multistage cluster random sampling design was used to estimate the district-level prevalence of trachoma. In total, 1,887 clusters in 152 districts were surveyed, from which 208,265 individuals from 66,089 households were examined for clinical signs of trachoma.

However, the exact mechanisms of NAFLD pathophysiology remain poorly understood including its progression to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). New advances for early detection and monitoring of  progression are limited due to the lack of specific blood biomarkers, thus requiring invasive liver biopsies for histopathology. Herein, multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS/MS) is validated as a high throughput, robust, and quantitative platform for targeted analysis of a panel of 16 serum γ-glutamyl dipeptides from a cohort of  adult patients from Japan (median age = 53 years, median BMI = 27 kg/m,  = 116). Multiplexed separations based on MSI-CE-MS/MS enable the design of unique data workflows that rely on customizable serial sample injection formats for accurate determination of γ-glutamyl dipeptides with quality control. Also, the introduction of a liquid coolant device to the capillary outlet improves long-term migration time stability in CE. Unsupervised pattern recognition methods revealed two distinctive  subgroups based on their contrasting γ-glutamyl dipeptide status despite patients having similar clinical phenotypes and  activity scores (median NAS ≈ 6.0). There was an inverse correlation between serum γ-glutamyl dipeptide concentrations and γ-glutamyltransferease (GGT) enzyme activity ( = -0.46;  = 2. × 10), which was indicative of a low-risk ( = 64) as compared to a high-risk ( = 52) patient subgroup with impaired glutathione salvage pathway and likely poor clinical prognosis. Our findings highlight the key role of defects in the γ-glutamyl cycle for differentiation of  patients, which may enable better risk assessment of long-term survivorship as a complement to standard liver enzyme screens and histopathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647137>Ultrasound Fatty Liver Indicator: A Simple Tool for Differentiating Steatosis From Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Validity in the Average Obese Population.</a></h2><p>Steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), and fibrosis/cirrhosis represent a spectrum of fatty liver disease.

Liver/biliary disease and a history of alcohol intake were excluded. Ultrasound metrics included liver-kidney contrast, posterior attenuation, vessel blurring, difficulty visualizing the gallbladder wall, difficulty visualizing the diaphragm, and areas of focal fatty sparing.

Logistic regression identified independent predictors of .Gallbladder wall visualization and vessel blurring were different between the steatosis and  groups (P ≤ .01). Gallbladder wall visualization was specific for  (89%), and vessel blurring was sensitive for  (93%).

However, the area under the curve (0.649) showed poor performance in differentiating steatosis from  when the US-FLI score was  or higher.Our data suggest that the US-FLI may differentiate steatosis from  in the average obese population.

The prevalence of NAFLD is increasing in parallel with the global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD represents a spectrum of liver disease severity. NAFLD begins with accumulation of triacylglycerols in the liver (steatosis), and is defined by hepatic fatty infiltration amounting to greater than % by liver weight or the presence of over % of hepatocytes loaded with large fat vacuoles. In almost a quarter of affected individuals, steatosis progresses with the development of liver inflammation to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().  is a potentially progressive liver condition and with ongoing liver injury and cell death can result in fibrosis. Progressive liver fibrosis may lead to the development of cirrhosis in a small proportion of patients. With the growing prevalence of NAFLD, there is an increasing need for a robust, accurate and non-invasive approach to diagnosing the different stages of this condition. This review will focus on (1) the biochemical tests and imaging techniques used to diagnose the different stages of NAFLD; and (2) a selection of the current management approaches focusing on lifestyle interventions and pharmacological therapies for NAFLD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, no drug with cyclophilin inhibition as the primary mode of action has advanced completely through clinical development to market. In this study, we present findings on the cyclophilin inhibitor, CRV431, that highlight its potential as a drug candidate for chronic liver diseases. CRV431 was found to potently inhibit all cyclophilin isoforms tested-A, B, D, and G. Inhibitory constant or IC values ranged from 1 to 7 nM, which was up to 13 times more potent than the parent compound, cyclosporine A (CsA), from which CRV431 was derived. Other CRV431 advantages over CsA as a nontransplant drug candidate were significantly diminished immunosuppressive activity, less drug transporter inhibition, and reduced cytotoxicity potential. Oral dosing to mice and rats led to good blood exposures and a - to 15-fold accumulation of CRV431 in liver compared with blood concentrations across a wide range of CRV431 dosing levels. Most importantly, CRV431 decreased liver fibrosis in a 6-week carbon tetrachloride model and in a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Additionally, CRV431 administration during a late, oncogenic stage of the  disease model resulted in a 50% reduction in the number and size of liver tumors. These findings are consistent with CRV431 targeting fibrosis and cancer through multiple, cyclophilin-mediated mechanisms and support the development of CRV431 as a safe and effective drug candidate for liver diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cyclophilin inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic activities in many disease models, but no drug candidates have yet advanced completely through development to market. In this study, CRV431 is shown to potently inhibit multiple cyclophilin isoforms, possess several optimized pharmacological properties, and decrease liver fibrosis and tumors in mouse models of chronic liver disease, which highlights its potential to be the first approved drug primarily targeting cyclophilin isomerases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563894>A head-to-head comparison of the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab and adalimumab in biological-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis: 24-week results of a randomised, open-label, blinded-assessor trial.</a></h2><p>To compare efficacy and safety of ixekizumab (IXE) to adalimumab (ADA) in biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naïve patients with both active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and skin disease and inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARDs).Patients with active PsA were randomised (1:1) to approved dosing of IXE or ADA in an open-label, head-to-head, blinded assessor clinical trial. The primary objective was to evaluate whether IXE was superior to ADA at week 24 for simultaneous achievement of a ≥50% improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) and a 100% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI100). Major secondary objectives, also at week 24, were to evaluate whether IXE was: (1) non-inferior to ADA for achievement of ACR50 and (2) superior to ADA for PASI100 response. Additional PsA, skin, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcome measures were assessed at week 24.The primary efficacy endpoint was met (IXE: 36%, ADA: 28%; p=0.036). IXE was non-inferior for ACR50 response (IXE: 51%, ADA: 47%; treatment difference: 3.9%) and superior for PASI100 response (IXE: 60%, ADA: 47%; p=0.001). IXE had greater response versus ADA in additional PsA, skin, nail, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcomes. Serious adverse events were reported in 8.% (ADA) and 3.% (IXE) of patients.IXE was superior to ADA in achievement of simultaneous improvement of joint and skin disease (ACR50 and PASI100) in patients with PsA and inadequate response to csDMARDs.

Household surveys included rosters of residents, household characteristics, adult and child deaths in the past year, child health, and healthcare access and utilization. Individual surveys of two randomly sampled adults from each household included sociodemographic data, maternal health, and adult health. Additionally, blood pressure, height, weight, and psychological distress were measured by study staff. Data were weighted for complex survey design and non-response. A total of 525 households and 894 individuals completed the survey (96% household and 90% individual response rate, respectively). The estimated population density was 58,000 persons/km. Across slums, 55% of all residents were female, and 38% were adolescents and youth 10-24 years. Among adults, 58% were female with median age 29 years (22-38). The most common adult illnesses were severe psychological distress (24%), hypertension (20%), history of physical injury/trauma (10%), asthma (7%), history of cholera (4%), and history of tuberculosis (3%).

One-third of households reported needing medical care for a child in the past year but not being able to access it, largely due to financial constraints. Unique features of these slums are a population structure dominated by adolescents and youth, a high proportion of females, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases including hypertension and psychological distress.

In rats, higher incidences of stereotypic behaviors were observed in 10 mg/kg females and 40 mg/kg males, and slower responses for reflex and sensory tests were observed only in males at 10 and 40 mg/kg during neurobehavioral testing. Sporadic minimal incidences of decreased activity (males) and seizures (both sexes) were observed in rats during daily clinical observations, without any clear dose-relationship. Male dogs at 75 mg/kg during treatment period, but not recovery period, had an increased incidence of gut associated lymphoid tissue hyperplasia and inflammation in the intestine. In both species, highest dose resulted in lower AUCs indicative of non-linear kinetics.

Past work of The Liver Forum has focused on recommendations for disease definitions and baseline parameters to be implemented in clinical trials that are designed to assess disease status and prevent progression to cirrhosis, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The purpose of this summary is to review currently available clinical data to identify parameters that change in parallel with liver histology and are likely to reflect clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of developing cirrhosis and its complications. We review available data on exploratory histological, blood-based, and imaging pharmacodynamic biomarkers that may reflect meaningful treatment responses and provide recommendations regarding measurements to be considered in phase 2 and 3 trials as well as during postmarketing monitoring trials.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430765>Total Colonic Hirschsprung's Disease: The Hypermotility and Skin Rash Protocol.</a></h2><p> Total colonic Hirschsprung's disease (TCHD) presents a postoperative challenge due to multiple stools and perineal rash. We propose a protocol developed by pediatric surgeons and ostomy nurses to help prevent and treat hypermotility and severe perineal rash, especially in younger children who are not toilet trained. We retrospectively reviewed our TCHD patients' charts from 2014 to 2017. All patients received a prescribed protocol for the treatment of hypermotility and perineal rash. We describe patients who underwent their pull through before and after the age of urine toilet training, and assessed the number of bowel movements, the perineal skin status, and growth. We treated 25 patients. Out of 25, 9 patients received a straight ileoanal pull through before the age of 18 months. Nine of 25 patients presented for a second opinion and had redo pull through. The remaining seven presented for bowel management after having a pull through at another institution. All these were treated following the hypermotility protocol. In total, 19 of 25 patients were not toilet trained. The mean number of bowel movements in all groups was 4 (3-). All had a resolution of perineal rash and liquid stools after 3 months. Eleven of the 25 patients presented with failure to thrive. Two older patients experienced severe proctalgia requiring replacement of the ileostomy. TCHD patients who underwent definitive pull through had nine high incidence of multiple stool, perineal rash, and low growth. With the implementation of bowel management care to slow the stools and a perineal skin protocol to treat the skin, we believe that these symptoms can be minimized even in patients who are not toilet trained. Since the implementation of this protocol, we have changed our practice to perform the pull through in such patients between the age of 6 and 18 months.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050516>Jet Shapes of Isolated Photon-Tagged Jets in Pb-Pb and pp Collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=.02  TeV.</a></h2><p>The modification of jet shapes in Pb-Pb collisions, relative to those in pp collisions, is studied for jets associated with an isolated photon.

The Gore® Acuseal graft is an early-cannulation graft, needled before incorporation and thus may be especially prone to pseudoaneurysm formation. In addition, as this is a relatively new product, there are limited data on long-term outcomes such as pseudoaneurysm. We report one center's experience of the incidence, and etiological factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation over  years and 265 grafts.265 Acuseal grafts were placed in the last  years. All patients had prospective data entered into an electronic searchable patient record. Surveillance was performed with 3 monthly imaging (DSA or ultrasound), clinical examination and hemodynamic performance. Data examined included the incidence, causative factors and outcomes for pseudoaneurysm.11 grafts (4.15%) developed a pseudoaneurysm, with 2 patients developing significant hemorrhage. The median time to development of a pseudoaneurysm was 25 months (IQR 20-28 months). Several common etiological factors were identified. All but one patient had over-use of needling sites (n=10; 90.9%). Other factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation were inadequate surveillance (n=9; 81.8%); venous outflow stenosis (n=9; 81.8%) and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy (n=7; 63.6%). Management included observation and needle rotation (n=, 45.%); stent-grafting (n=3; 27.3%), or excision (n=1; 9.1%) of the pseudoaneurysm. Surgical or endovascular augmentation of the venous outflow was required in 9 patients (81.8%). Graft ligation and explantation was required in  patients (45.%) with graft preservation achieved in 6/11 patients (54.%).Pseudoaneurysm formation occurs less frequently in Acuseal grafts compared with historical data for standard PTFE grafts. Pseudoaneurysm formation did not occur in any graft within the first 13 months following implantation; suggesting early-cannulation prior to incorporation is not in itself a risk factor for pseudoaneurysm development. Poor needling, venous stenosis, inadequate surveillance and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy are remediable factors, and graft preservation is possible. Acuseal is a robust graft with lower rates of pseudoaneurysm formation on long-term follow up than standard PTFE grafts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The objectives of this study were (i) to calibrate and validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model using measurements of silage corn ( L.) biomass, N uptake, soil temperature, tile drain flow, NO leaching, NO emissions, and soil mineral N in eastern Canada, and (ii) to investigate the long-term impacts of manure management under climate variability. The treatments investigated included a zero-fertilizer control, inorganic fertilizer, and dairy manure amendments (raw and digested). The DNDC model overall demonstrated statistically "good" performance when simulating silage corn yield and N uptake based on normalized RMSE (nRMSE) < 10%, index of agreement () > 0.9, and -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) > 0.. In addition, DNDC, with its inclusion of a tile drainage mechanism, demonstrated "good" predictions for cumulative drainage (nRMSE < 20%, > 0.8, and NSE > 0.). The model did, however, underestimate daily drainage flux during spring thaw for both organic and inorganic amendments. This was attributed to an underestimation of soil temperature and soil water under frequent soil freezing and thawing during the 2013-2014 overwinter period. Long-term simulations under climate variability indicated that spring applied manure resulted in less NO leaching and NO emissions than fall application when manure rates were managed based on crop N requirements. Overall, this study helped highlight the challenges in discerning the short-term climate interactions on fertilizer-induced N losses compared with the long-term dynamics under climate variability.© 2019 The Author(s) and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656852>The impact of rising temperatures on water balance and phenology of European beech ( L.) stands.</a></h2><p>In this article, we outline the set-up and the application of an eco-hydrological box model, with the aim to describe the water balance of deciduous ( L.) forest stands. The water balance model (WBM) uses standard meteorological parameters as input variables and runs on a daily time step. It consists of two modules. The aboveground module (1) comprises routines for fog precipitation generation, precipitation interception and snowfall/snowmelt dynamics. Covered belowground processes (2) are bypass flow, percolation, soil evaporation and transpiration, where the latter two processes are considered separately. Preceding to the WBM, a routine is introduced, specifying the intra-annual foliage dynamics of beech. Emphasis is also laid on the inter-annual variation of beech phenology. Leaf sprouting and leaf senescence are calculated as functions of day-length and air temperature. The WBM was applied to four European beech dominated forest stands in the northeastern part of Austria. They are located on a gradient of declining annual precipitation (from west to east). The two easterly sites are located close to the (dry) limit of the natural distribution of beech. Records of soil moisture were used for the adjustment of 26 parameters. On all sites the calibration process (simulated annealing) delivered good predictions of soil moisture (-Sutcliffe efficiency≥ 0.925). Then, the obtained parameterization was used to apply different scenarios of global warming. The temperature was increased step-wisely up to 4 °C. All scenarios were run (1) with present phenological conditions and (2) with phenology responding to higher temperatures. This way, we wanted to assign the effect of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons on the water dynamics of the forest stands. A warming of 1 °C corresponded roughly to an elongation of the growing season of 4. days, where the start of the growing season was affected more strongly than the end. Apparently, higher temperatures led to drier soils. The strongest change was observed in early summer, also amplified by an earlier start of the growing season. Rising temperatures led to lower export fluxes of liquid water, simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration (ET). The gain in ET was almost entirely assignable to increased soil evaporation. Drier soils led to a sharp depression of transpiration during summer months. This decline was compensated by the effect of elongated growing seasons. The risk of severe drought was increased by higher temperatures, but here the contribution of growing season length was negligible. Drier soils seem to hamper the stands' productivity. For all warming scenarios, the estimated increase of the gross primary production, caused by longer periods of assimilation, is nullified by the effect of soil water deficit in mid-summer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293912>Practical Use of Transient Elastography in Screening for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in a Japanese Population.</a></h2><p> Fatty infiltration of liver may induce insulin resistance (IR), and a proportion of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Transient elastography is gaining popularity as a means of non-invasively determining both liver stiffness (fibrosis level) and degree of fatty infiltration, expressed as controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value.  The aims of this study were to investigate the association between IR and level of fatty liver, and to identify the group at a greater risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis using transient elastography and other noninvasive fibrosis markers. A total of 169 patients without chronic hepatitis B and C were analyzed.  The CAP value was significantly associated with IR (HOMA-IR ≥2.; AUROC = 0.81), and the optimal cut-off to discriminate IR was 264 dB/m. The liver stiffness measurement and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index values were significantly higher for CAP ≥264 than in CAP <264. The 9 patients among the overall 169 patients (.3%) and among the 102 NAFLD patients (8.8%) who showed ≥264 dB and ≥7.0 kPa in transient elastography could represent good candidates for liver biopsy.  Evaluation of NAFLD based on CAP values was useful in diagnosing IR.

Our results showed that the cumulative energy intake, body weight gain and food efficacy during the 9-wk rearing period were highest in the youngest group and lowest in the oldest group. Serologically, almost all parameters including the serum triglyceride and total cholesterol were similar regardless of age. Histopathological findings, such as hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, were also similar regardless of age, but hepatic fibrosis was more evident in the oldest group.

The aim of this study was to assess expression of urea cycle-related genes to elucidate a possible gene regulatory basis to the functional problem.Liver mRNA expression analyses within the gene pathway governing hepatic nitrogen conversion were performed in 20 non-diabetic, biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (8 simple steatosis; 12 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis []) and 12 obese and 14 lean healthy individuals. Sixteen NAFLD patients were included for gene expression validation. Relationship between gene expressions and functional capacity for ureagenesis was described.Gene expression of most urea cycle-related enzymes were downregulated in NAFLD vs both control groups; markedly so for the urea cycle flux-generating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS1) (~3.-fold, P < .0001). In , CPS1 downregulation paralleled the deficit in ureagenesis (P = .03). Additionally, expression of several genes involved in amino acid uptake and degradation, and the glucagon receptor gene, were downregulated in NAFLD. Conversely, glutamine synthetase (GS) expression increased >1.-fold (P ≤ .03), inversely related to CPS1 expression (P = .004).NAFLD downregulated the expression of urea cycle-related genes. Downregulation of urea cycle flux-generating CPS1 correlated with the loss of functional capacity for ureagenesis in . On gene level, these changes coincided with an increase in the major ammonia scavenging enzyme GS. The effects seemed related to a fatty liver as such rather than  or obesity. The findings support gene regulatory mechanisms involved in the deficient ureagenesis of NAFLD, but it remains unexplained how hepatocyte fat accumulation exerts these effects.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Restoration of NO levels by nitrite have been associated with favorable metabolic effects in T2D. Moreover, HS can potentiate the effects of NO in the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of long-term co-administration of sodium nitrite and sodium hydrosulfide () on carbohydrate metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats.T2D was induced using chronic high fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) regimen. Rats were divided into  groups (N = 10/group): Control, T2D, T2D + nitrite, T2D + , and T2D + nitrite + . Nitrite (50 mg/L in drinking water) and  (0.28 mg/kg, daily i. p. injection) were administered for 9 weeks. Fasting serum glucose, insulin, lipid profile, liver function tests, and oxidative stress indices were measured. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed at the end of the eighth week, and three days later, intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) was done. Protein levels and mRNA expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in soleus muscle and epididymal adipose tissue as well as mRNA expression of HS-producing enzymes in the liver, soleus muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue were measured at the end of the study.Compared to the controls, HFD and STZ treated rats developed metabolic dysfunction.

However, co-administration of  and nitrite resulted in further improvement in serum insulin level, GTT, PTT, liver function, oxidative stress, protein level and mRNA expression of GLUT4, as well as mRNA expression of HS-producing enzymes in diabetic rats.Low dose of  per se had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism while it potentiated the favorable metabolic effects of inorganic nitrite in type 2 diabetic rats. These favorable effects were associated with decreased oxidative stress and increased GLUT4 expression in insulin-sensitive tissues as well as improvement of liver function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD in a large number of healthy male blood donors of urban north India.In a prospective study performed over 18 months, voluntary blood donors fulfilling the requisite blood donation criteria and consenting to participate in the study were evaluated. The study received the approval of the institute's ethics committee. Diagnosis of NAFLD was made by excluding significant alcohol intake, ultrasound showing hepatic steatosis, and exclusion of transfusion associated infections. Subjects were also evaluated for various metabolic risk factors and the presence of metabolic syndrome.Of 1388 subjects who consented for participation, 386 did not come for evaluation. Three females, nine (0.9%) HBsAg-positive, and four (0.4%) anti-HCV positive subjects were excluded. Of the 986 males evaluated with hepatobiliary ultrasound, 543(55.1%) had fatty liver on ultrasonography [15 (1.%) alcoholic fatty liver and 528 (53.%) NAFLD]. Among those with NAFLD, 469 (88.8%), 54 (10.2%), and  (0.9%) had mild, moderate, and severe hepatic steatosis, respectively. Subjects with NAFLD, when compared to those without NAFLD, had significantly higher age, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, total cholesterol and triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and fasting plasma glucose. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated age, BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and number of metabolic syndrome criteria as independent predictors of NAFLD.Urban Indian healthy male blood donors have a high prevalence of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060228>Inhibiting Extracellular Cathepsin D Reduces Hepatic Steatosis in Sprague⁻Dawley Rats .</a></h2><p>Dietary and lifestyle changes are leading to an increased occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Using a hyperlipidemic murine model for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), we have previously demonstrated that the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (CTSD) is involved with lipid dysregulation and inflammation. However, despite identifying CTSD as a major player in NAFLD pathogenesis, the specific role of extracellular CTSD in NAFLD has not yet been investigated. Given that inhibition of intracellular CTSD is highly unfavorable due to its fundamental physiological function, we here investigated the impact of a highly specific and potent small-molecule inhibitor of extracellular CTSD (CTD-002) in the context of NAFLD. Treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages with CTD-002, and incubation of hepatic HepG2 cells with a conditioned medium derived from CTD-002-treated macrophages, resulted in reduced levels of inflammation and improved cholesterol metabolism. Treatment with CTD-002 improved hepatic steatosis in high fat diet-fed rats. Additionally, plasma levels of insulin and hepatic transaminases were significantly reduced upon CTD-002 administration. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that modulation of extracellular CTSD can serve as a novel therapeutic modality for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104631>Risks and clinical predictors of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnoses in adults with diagnosed NAFLD: real-world study of 18 million patients in four European cohorts.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition that progresses in some patients to steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we used healthcare records of 18 million adults to estimate risk of acquiring advanced liver disease diagnoses in patients with NAFLD or  compared to individually matched controls.Data were extracted from four European primary care databases representing the UK, Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Patients with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD or  (NAFLD/) were followed up for incident cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses. Each coded NAFLD/ patient was matched to up to 100 "non-NAFLD" patients by practice site, gender, age ±  years and visit recorded within ± 6 months. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox models adjusted for age and smoking status and pooled across databases by random effects meta-analyses.Out of 18,782,281 adults, we identified 136,703 patients with coded NAFLD/. Coded NAFLD/ patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension and obesity than matched controls. HR for cirrhosis in patients compared to controls was 4.73 (95% CI 2.43-9.19) and for HCC, 3.51 (95% CI 1.72-7.16). HR for either outcome was higher in patients with  and those with high-risk Fib-4 scores. The strongest independent predictor of a diagnosis of HCC or cirrhosis was baseline diagnosis of diabetes.Real-world population data show that recorded diagnosis of NAFLD/ increases risk of life-threatening liver outcomes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of fructosylated-HSA-AGE in the pathogenesis of fatty liver (NAFLD and ) by biochemical, immunological and histological studies. Immunogenicity of fructosylated-HSA-AGE was probed by inducing antibodies in rabbits. Fructosylated-HSA-AGE was found to be highly immunogenic. Furthermore, fructosylated-HSA-AGE caused mild fibrosis with steatosis and portal inflammation of hepatocytes in experimental animals. Liver function test and dyslipidemic parameters in immunized animals were also found to be raised. Ultrasonography, which should form part of the assessment of chronically raised transaminases, shows fatty infiltration. Interestingly, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) profiles confirms USG images of overweight, obese patients.

Can simulations decipher the role of protein domains of unknown function in large macromolecular complexes? Here, we employ a wide-sampling computational approach to demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations, when carefully performed and combined with single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy experiments, can predict and explain the behavior of highly mechanostable protein complexes. As a test case, we studied a previously unreported homologue from  called X-module-Dockerin (XDoc) bound to its partner Cohesin (Coh). By performing dozens of short simulation replicas near the rupture event, and analyzing dynamic network fluctuations, we were able to generate large simulation statistics and directly compare them with experiments to uncover the mechanisms involved in mechanical stabilization. Our single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments show that the XDoc-Coh homologue complex withstands forces up to 1 nN at loading rates of 10 pN/s. Our simulation results reveal that this remarkable mechanical stability is achieved by a protein architecture that directs molecular deformation along paths that run perpendicular to the pulling axis. The X-module was found to play a crucial role in shielding the adjacent protein complex from mechanical rupture. These mechanisms of protein mechanical stabilization have potential applications in biotechnology for the development of systems exhibiting shear enhanced adhesion or tunable mechanics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445275>Augmented intelligence with natural language processing applied to electronic health records for identifying patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at risk for disease progression.</a></h2><p>Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain structured data (such as diagnostic codes) and unstructured data (clinical documentation). Clinical insights can be derived from analyzing both. The use of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to effectively analyze unstructured data has been well demonstrated. Here we examine the utility of NLP for the identification of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, assess patterns of disease progression, and identify gaps in care related to breakdown in communication among providers.All clinical notes available on the 38,575 patients enrolled in the Mount Sinai BioMe cohort were loaded into the NLP system. We compared analysis of structured and unstructured EHR data using NLP, free-text search, and diagnostic codes with validation against expert adjudication. We then used the NLP findings to measure physician impression of progression from early-stage NAFLD to  or cirrhosis. Similarly, we used the same NLP findings to identify mentions of NAFLD in radiology reports that did not persist into clinical notes.Out of 38,575 patients, we identified 2,281 patients with NAFLD. From the remainder, 10,653 patients with similar data density were selected as a control group. NLP outperformed ICD and text search in both sensitivity (NLP: 0.93, ICD: 0.28, text search: 0.81) and F2 score (NLP: 0.92, ICD: 0.34, text search: 0.81). Of 2281 NAFLD patients, 673 (29.%) were believed to have progressed to  or cirrhosis. Among 176 where NAFLD was noted prior to , the average progression time was 410 days. 619 (27.1%) NAFLD patients had it documented only in radiology notes and not acknowledged in other forms of clinical documentation. Of these, 170 (28.4%) were later identified as having likely developed  or cirrhosis after a median 1057.3 days.NLP-based approaches were more accurate at identifying NAFLD within the EHR than ICD/text search-based approaches. Suspected NAFLD on imaging is often not acknowledged in subsequent clinical documentation. Many such patients are later found to have more advanced liver disease. Analysis of information flows demonstrated loss of key information that could have been used to help prevent the progression of early NAFLD (NAFL) to  or cirrhosis.For identification of NAFLD, NLP performed better than alternative selection modalities. It then facilitated analysis of knowledge flow between physician and enabled the identification of breakdowns where key information was lost that could have slowed or prevented later disease progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We previously showed that iPla2β mice fed with a methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD) exhibited exaggerated liver fibrosis. As iPla2β is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we investigated the mechanisms for this by focusing on hepatic ER unfolded protein response (UPR), ER PL, and enterohepatic bile acids (BA).  Female WT (wild-type) and iPla2β mice were fed with chow or MCD for  weeks. PL and BA profiles were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gene expression analyses were performed.  MCD feeding of WT mice caused a decrease of ER PL subclasses, which were further decreased by iPla2β deficiency. This deficiency alone or combined with MCD downregulated the expression of liver ER UPR proteins and farnesoid X-activated receptor. The downregulation under MCD was concomitant with an elevation of BA in the liver and peripheral blood and an increase of biliary epithelial cell proliferation measured by cytokeratin 19.  iPla2β deficiency combined with MCD severely disturbed ER PL composition and caused inactivation of UPR, leading to downregulated Fxr, exacerbated BA, and ductular proliferation.

Oysters were exposed to medium (28 °C) and high (32 °C) temperatures under controlled laboratory conditions for 1 week. Oysters exposed to higher temperatures significantly decreased the number and diameter of eggs, and EPF protein concentrations compared with controls (24 °C). In contrast, EPF pH, ovarian HSP70 mRNA levels, and protein expression were increased after heat exposure, consistent with increased ovarian apoptosis. The enhanced apoptosis in ovaries was associated with increased ovarian caspase-3/7 activity, PC contents, NOx levels, and NTP and DNP expressions in heat-exposed oysters.

Whether functional status affects LT outcomes equally across cirrhosis etiologies is unclear.We evaluate the impact of functional status on waitlist and post-LT mortality stratified by etiology and age.Functional status among US adults from 2005 to 2017 United Network for Organ Sharing LT registry data was retrospectively evaluated using Karnofsky Performance Status Score (KPS-1 = functional status 80-100%, KPS-2 = 60-70%, KPS-3 = 40-50%, KPS-4 = 10-30%). Waitlist and post-LT survival were stratified by KPS and cirrhosis etiology, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), hepatitis C (HCV), and HCV/ALD, and evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.Among 94,201 waitlist registrants (69.4% men, 39.% HCV, 26.7% ALD, 23.2% ), ALD patients had worse functional status compared to HCV (KPS-4: 17.2% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001). Worse functional status at time of waitlist registration was associated with higher 90-day waitlist mortality with the greatest effect in ALD (KPS-4 vs. KPS-1: ALD HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.83-2.55; HCV HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.87-2.51). Similar trends occurred in -year post-LT survival with ALD patients the most harmed. Compared to patients < 50 years, patients ≥ 65 years had increased waitlist mortality at 90-days if they had HCV or HCV/ALD, and -year post-LT mortality regardless of cirrhosis etiology with ALD patients most severely affected.In a retrospective cohort study of patients, US ALD patients had disparately worse functional status at time of LT waitlist registration.

R17 derived from bouchardatine, shows benefits in the metabolic syndrome, but has not been tested in the liver. The present study examined the pharmacological effects of R17 in a model of NAFLD/ and its mode of action.The effects of R17 were examined in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet to induce the pathological characteristics of NAFLD/ and in cultures of HuH7 cells. We used histological and immunohistochemical techniques along with western blotting and siRNA. Generation of ROS and apoptosis were measured.Administration of R17 (20 mg·kg , i.p. every other day) for  weeks reversed HF-induced hepatic triglyceride content, inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and macrophage numbers), injury (hepatocyte ballooning and apoptosis, plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), and fibrogenesis (collagen deposition and mRNA expression of fibrosis markers). In cultured cells, R17 reduced cell steatosis from both lipogenesis and fatty acid influx. The attenuated inflammation and cell injury were associated with inhibition of both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress. Notably, R17 activated the liver kinase B1-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by inhibiting activity of ATP synthase, rather than direct stimulation of AMPK.R17 has therapeutic potential for NAFLD/.

We undertook this study to elucidate the interplay between macrophage activation, insulin resistance (IR) in target organs/tissues and hepatic damage.In 40 non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD we assessed: i) endogenous glucose production (EGP), glucose clearance and indexes of IR in the adipose tissue (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) and in the liver (Hep-IR) by tracer infusion ([6,6-2H2]glucose and [2H5]glycerol); ii) macrophage activity (by soluble sCD163) and iii) hepatic expression of CD163 (hCD163).We found that sCD163 levels paralleled both the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels and lipolysis from adipose tissue. Consistently, sCD163 significantly correlated with adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR: r = 0.32, p = 0.042; Lipo-IR: r = 0.39, p = 0.012). At multiple regression analysis, sCD163 levels were associated with FFA levels (r = 0.35, p = 0.026). In vitro exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to palmitate enhanced sCD163 secretion. Conversely, sCD163 did not correlate with EGP or with Hep-IR. In the liver, hCD163 positively correlated with sCD163 (r = 0.58, p = 0.007) and the degree of steatosis (r = 0.34, p = 0.048), but not with EGP or Hep-IR (r = -0.27 and r = 0.11, respectively, p >0.10, both).Our findings suggest a link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, possibly in response to FFA overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes. Conversely, our findings do not support a link between activated hepatic macrophages and glucose metabolism (EGP or Hep-IR). The relationship between adipose tissue IR and hepatic macrophages should be considered to define therapeutic targets for NAFLD.The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis () is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in the insulin resistant state. This study provides in vivo support for a possible link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, most likely in response to free fatty acid overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Hispanics had similar patient (76.6% vs 75.6%; P = .12) and graft (71.7% vs 70.8%; P = .28) survival at  years and significantly better patient (62.9% vs 59.7%; P < .001) and graft (58.6% vs 55.6%; P = .002) survival at 10 years. In multivariable analysis, Hispanics had lower associated all-cause mortality (HR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.82-0.91; P < .001) and graft failure (HR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.85-0.93; P < .001) compared to non-Hispanic whites. In etiology-specific subanalysis, Hispanics transplanted for ALD,  and HCV had lower all-cause mortality compared to non-Hispanic whites.Hispanics have similar or better long-term post-LT outcomes compared to non-Hispanic whites despite a worse pretransplant risk factor profile. Further research is needed to clarify if this survival advantage reflects uncaptured protective factors or more stringent transplant selection in the Hispanic population.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

After baseline surveys demonstrated that Sudan was endemic for trachoma, the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Trachoma Control Program conducted trachoma prevention and treatment interventions in endemic localities. The Sudan FMOH conducted population-based trachoma prevalence surveys between September 2016 and April 2017 in seven localities across five states of Sudan to document current trachoma prevalence estimates and measure water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators. Children aged 1-9 years were examined for five clinical signs of trachoma, and participants of all ages were examined for trachomatous trichiasis (TT). A household questionnaire was administered to gather demographic and WASH-related information. The prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-1.1%) to 6.4% (95% CI: 3.3-11.9%). Trachomatous trichiasis in those aged 15 years and older ranged from 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0-0.6%) to a high of 4.4% (95% CI: 2.1-9.1%). Of seven localities surveyed, four localities had achieved the elimination threshold of less than % TF in children aged 1-9 years. Six localities still required interventions to achieve less than 0.2% TT in those aged 15 years and older. The presence of latrine ranged from a low of 10.8% (95% CI: .2-21.1%) to 88.4% (CI: 81.-93.0%) and clean face among children ranged between 69.% (95% CI: 63.-75.0%) and 87.% (95% CI: 81.2-91.9%). These results demonstrate that Sudan is within reach of eliminating trachoma as a public health problem.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487525>The Value of Persistent Value.</a></h2><p>In this issue of Neuron, Bari et al.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary iron restriction on disease progression in rats fed a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet. Male F344 rats were fed a choline-sufficient amino acid-defined (control) diet, a CDAA diet or an iron-restricted CDAA diet for 4, 8 and 12 weeks. At each time point, hepatic iron levels, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The iron-restricted CDAA diet significantly decreased serum iron levels for 12 weeks compared with the CDAA diet. Histological analysis confirmed that feeding with the CDAA diet induced hepatic iron overload and that this was associated with oxidative stress (number of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive cells), inflammation (CD68 positive area) and fibrosis (Sirius Red positive area). Iron restriction with the CDAA diet significantly led to a reduction in the hepatic iron levels, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, dietary iron restriction could be a useful therapeutic approach for  patients with hepatic iron overload.© 2019.

Herein we report the design of a new multifunctional MOL, Hf-Ir-Ni, by laterally linking Hf secondary building units (SBUs) with photosensitizing Ir(DBB)[dF(CF)ppy] [DBB-Ir-F, DBB = 4,4'-di(4-benzoato)-2,2'-bipyridine; dF(CF)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)--(trifluoromethyl)pyridine] bridging ligands and vertically terminating the SBUs with catalytic Ni(MBA)Cl [MBA = 2-(4'-methyl-[2,2'-bipyridin]-4-yl)acetate] capping agents. Hf-Ir-Ni was synthesized in a bottom-up approach and characterized by TEM, AFM, PXRD, TGA, NMR, ICP-MS, UV-vis, and luminescence spectroscopy. The proximity between photosensitizing Ir centers and catalytic Ni centers (∼0.85 nm) in Hf-Ir-Ni facilitates single electron transfer, leading to a 15-fold increase in photoredox reactivity.

Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of NAFLD, , and advanced fibrosis among patients with T2DM, by regions of the world.We searched for terms including NAFLD,  and T2DM in studies published from January 1989 to September 2018, using PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE®, EMBASE and Web of Science. Strict exclusion criteria were applied. Regional and global mean prevalence weighted by population size in each country were estimated and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression.Among 80 studies from 20 countries that met our inclusion criteria, there were 49,419 individuals with T2DM (mean age 58. years, mean body mass index 27.9 kg/m, and males 52.9%). The global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM was 55.% (95% CI 47.3-63.7). Studies from Europe reported the highest prevalence (68.0% [62.1-73.0%]).

Meta-regression models showed that geographic region and mean age (p <0.) were associated with the prevalence of NAFLD, jointly accounting for 63.9% of the heterogeneity.This study provides the global prevalence rates for NAFLD, , and advanced fibrosis in patients with T2DM. These data can be used to estimate the clinical and economic burden of  in patients with T2DM around the world.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for NAFLD. Additionally, T2DM seems to accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD. Despite the high prevalence and serious clinical implications of NAFLD in patients with T2DM, it is usually overlooked in clinical practice. This meta-analysis provides evidence of the high prevalence of NAFLD and  in patients with T2DM. In this context, increasing awareness about the importance of NAFLD in patients with T2DM among all important stakeholders (primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers) must be prioritized.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

At the best cut-offs, the two q-FPs had 88.3%-96.2% sensitivity and 78.1%-91.1% specificity for different fibrosis stages in the validation cohort. q-FPs and histological scoring had nearly identical correlations with liver stiffness measurement, suggesting that the accuracy of q-FPs approached that of histological assessment. Among patients with paired liver biopsies, changes in the same q-FPs were associated with changes in fibrosis stage. At a median follow-up of .6 years, baseline q-FPs predicted liver-related events.q-FP is highly accurate in the assessment of fibrosis in NAFLD patients. This automated platform can be used in future studies as objective and reliable evaluation of histological fibrosis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the changing pattern of etiologic causes of LT in our center for the past 15 years.A cohort of 967 consecutive adult patients with history of LT between 2004 and 2018 in our center was reviewed regarding etiologies for LT. All patients who had a transplant during this time frame were divided into 3 time periods as follows: 2004 to 2009, 2010 to 2013, and 2014 to 2018. All explanted liver samples were sent to pathology for establishment of a definitive etiologic cause.Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was the leading cause of LT in the overall cohort (37%), followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (11%), and alcoholic liver disease (9.%).  accounted for 7.% of the cases. While HBV decreased from 44% in 2004 to 2009 to 36% in 2014 to 2018,  increased from 1.1% to 9.4% in overall transplants during the same period, accounting for one-third of the etiologies for LT following HBV and HCV.There might be a global changing figure regarding etiology for LT in Turkey, especially , which is the fastest growing cause of LT. However, this topic needs to be evaluated in large cohort series from collaborative multicenter studies from Turkey.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The failure of preclinical approaches to provide significant sepsis survival benefit in the clinic is often attributed to inappropriate animal disease models. It has been demonstrated that high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) blockade can reduce inflammation, mortality and morbidity in experimental sepsis without promoting immunosuppression. Within this study, we explored the use of ovine anti-HMGB1 antibodies in a model of ovine septic shock incorporating intensive care supports (OSSICS). Results: Septic sheep exhibited elevated levels of HMGB1 within 12 h after the induction of sepsis. In this study, sepsis was induced in six anaesthetized adult Border Leicester × Merino ewes via intravenous instillation of  and sheep monitored according to intensive care unit standard protocols for 26 h, with the requirement for noradrenaline as the primary endpoint. Septic sheep exhibited a hyperdynamic circulation, renal dysfunction, deranged coagulation profile and severe metabolic acidosis. Sheep were assigned a severity of illness score, which increased over time. While a therapeutic effect of intravenous anti-HMGB1 antibody could not be observed in this model due to limited animal numbers, a reduced bacterial dose induced a septic syndrome of much lower severity. With modifications including a reduced bacterial dose, a longer timeframe and broad spectrum antibiotics, the OSSICS model may become a robust tool for preclinical assessment of sepsis therapeutics.Copyright: © Stevens et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258138>Growing burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in Turkey: A single-center experience.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which consists of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), is a growing epidemic in Turkey, considering the recent alarming prevalence of 48.3%. Patients with  and/or liver fibrosis are more likely to progress to advanced liver disease. In this single-center study, we sought to describe the clinical and histological characteristics of a sample of Turkish patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, who were enrolled over a 4-year period.This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a total of 468 patients (224 males, 244 females; median age, 47 [18-71]. The study cohort consisted of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD who were followed up at our outpatient clinic from 2009 to 2010 and from 2017 to 2018. Histological classification of the biopsies was performed according to the Steatosis, Activity and Fibrosis (SAF) scoring allowing the use of Fatty Liver Inhibition of Progression (FLIP) algorithm and the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) scoring system.Based on the SAF scoring, most patients (90.4%) had biopsy-proven , whereas the NAFL was much rarer (9.6%). The prevalence of significant fibrosis (≥F2), advanced fibrosis (≥F3), and cirrhosis (F=4) was 35.0%, 17.%, and 3.8%, respectively. The percentage of lean, overweight, and obese patients with NAFLD was 6.4%, 32.6%, and 61%, respectively. Metabolic syndrome was prevalent in 63% of the patients and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in 33.%.The growing burden of NAFLD as a public health problem in Turkey is underscored by its marked histological severity in terms of  and fibrosis.

Simple hepatic steatosis is mild, but the coexistence of steatohepatitis () and fibrosis increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Proper dietary and pharmacological treatment is essential for preventing NAFLD progression. The first-line treatment should include dietary intervention and increased physical activity. The diet should be based on the food pyramid, with a choice of products with low glycemic index, complex carbohydrates in the form of low-processed cereal products, vegetables, and protein-rich products. Usage of insulin-sensitizing substances, pro- and prebiotics, and vitamins should also be considered. Such a therapeutic process is intended to support both liver disease and obesity-related pathologies, including insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and blood hypertension. In the pharmacological treatment of NAFLD, apart from pioglitazone, there are new classes of antidiabetic drugs that are of value, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 antagonists, while several other compounds that target different pathogenic pathways are currently being tested in clinical trials. Liver biopsies should only be considered when there is a lack of decline in liver enzymes after 6 months of the abovementioned treatment. Dietary intervention is recommended in all patients with NAFLD, while pharmacological treatment is recommended especially for those with  and showing significant fibrosis in a biopsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108012>Changes in the multidisciplinary management of rectal cancer from 2009 to 2015 and associated improvements in short-term outcomes.</a></h2><p>Significant recent changes in management of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) include preoperative staging, use of extended neoadjuvant therapies and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This study was aimed at characterizing these changes and associated short-term outcomes.We retrospectively analysed treatment and outcome data from patients with T3/4 or N+ LARC ≤ 15 cm from the anal verge who were evaluated at a comprehensive cancer centre in 2009-2015.In total, 798 patients were identified and grouped into five cohorts based on treatment year: 2009-2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014-2015. Temporal changes included increased reliance on MRI staging, from 57% in 2009-2010 to 98% in 2014-2015 (P < 0.001); increased use of total neoadjuvant therapy, from 17% to 76% (P < 0.001); and increased use of MIS, from 33% to 70% (P < 0.001). Concurrently, median hospital stay decreased (from 7 to  days; P < 0.001), as did the rates of Grade III-V complications (from 13% to 7%; P < 0.05), surgical site infections (from 24% to 8%; P < 0.001), anastomotic leak (from 11% to 3%; P < 0.05) and positive circumferential resection margin (from 9% to 4%; P < 0.05).

This MAIC assessed the comparative effectiveness of secukinumab (an anti-interleukin-17A) and etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) in a target population of biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).Individual patient data pooled from FUTURE 2 (), FUTURE 3 (), and FUTURE  () (secukinumab: 150 mg, n=458 and 300 mg, n=461) were matched to data from the population in the  trial (etanercept 25 mg, n=101) using MAIC methodology, by adjusting for clinical and demographic baseline characteristics. Recalculated outcomes from FUTURE 2, 3, and  (150 mg, effective sample size (ESS) post-matching=104; 300 mg, ESS=75; and placebo, ESS=159) were compared with the  trial. Pairwise comparisons using odds ratios (ORs) were performed for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 response criteria at week 12 (placebo-adjusted) and week 24 (non-placebo-adjusted).At week 12, there were no significant differences in ACR responses between secukinumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between secukinumab 150 mg and etanercept at week 24 with respect to ACR 20 and 50 response rates; however, ACR 70 response rates were higher for secukinumab 150 mg (OR (95% confidence interval (CI)): 4.48 (2.01-9.99), p<0.001).

We compared patient-reported outcomes (PRO) during CRT in patients who had received induction chemotherapy versus those who did not.We reviewed records of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were treated with CRT between September 2009 and October 2014, and who had completed ≥ 4 PRO assessments during treatment. Clinician- and patient-reported toxicities were collected each week during treatment. We fit binomial generalized linear models to maximum toxicity scores across all patients' visits.Of 123 patients with ≥ 4 PRO assessments, 87 (71%) patients reported a clinically meaningful PRO score of 3 or higher for diarrhea, and 91 (74%) patients reported a PRO score of ≥ 3 for urgency, during 1 or more weeks of treatment, corresponding to 'very frequent' or worse. Of 116 patients who had also completed ≥ 4 clinician-reported assessments for descriptive analysis, clinically significant diarrhea (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade ≥ 2) was reported in 9% of patients, and grade 2 proctitis and cystitis were reported in 20% and 4%, respectively. Eighty-four (68%) patients had undergone induction chemotherapy prior to CRT. Patients who received induction chemotherapy had 68% lower odds of experiencing significant urgency (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.95; P = .04), 76% lower odds of bleeding (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.1-0.62; P < .01), and 75% lower odds of tenesmus (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.6; P < .01) versus those treated with upfront CRT.Based on PROs, a high proportion of patients experienced clinically significant symptoms during pelvic CRT, with diarrhea and urgency being most commonly reported. This appears to be under-reported on clinician-reported assessments. Delivery of induction chemotherapy was associated with lower odds of experiencing urgency, bleeding, and tenesmus on PROs during subsequent CRT, with no significant impact on diarrhea and rectal pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the modulation of NADPH-producing enzymes associated with the antifibrotic, antioxidant and antilipemic effects of nicotinamide (NAM) in a model of  induced by excess fructose consumption. Male rats were provided drinking water containing 40% fructose for 16 weeks. During the last 12 weeks of fructose administration, water containing NAM was provided to some of the rats for  h/day. The biochemical profiles and the ghrelin, leptin, lipoperoxidation and TNF-α levels in serum and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), malic enzyme (ME) and NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase (IDP) levels, the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) ratios, and the levels of various lipogenic and fibrotic markers in the liver were evaluated. The results showed that hepatic fibrosis induced by fructose consumption was associated with weight gain, hunger-satiety system dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, lipoperoxidation and inflammation. Moreover, increased levels of hepatic G6PD and ME activity and expression, the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios, and GSSG concentration and increased expression of lipogenic and fibrotic markers were detected, and these alterations were attenuated by NAM administration. Specifically, NAM diminished the activity and expression of G6PD and ME, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratios, increased GSH levels and decreased lipoperoxidation and inflammation, ameliorating fibrosis and  development. NAM reduces liver steatosis and fibrosis by regulating redox homeostasis through a G6PD- and ME-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035998>Elevated plasma copeptin levels identify the presence and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obesity.</a></h2><p>Copeptin is the stable surrogate marker of vasopressin (VP), which is released in response to elevated plasma osmolality or low blood pressure. Elevated plasma copeptin levels are associated with higher risk of insulin resistance-related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM), metabolic syndrome (MS), and cardiovascular disease, and experimental reduction of circulating VP levels is shown to significantly decrease hepatic fat content in obese rats, independently from body adiposity. However, the association between copeptin and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis (NAFLD/) in humans has not been explored yet. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between plasma copeptin and the presence/severity of NAFLD/.For this study, we recruited 60 obese patients candidate to bariatric surgery for clinical purposes in which intraoperative liver biopsies were performed for diagnosing NAFLD/. Circulating copeptin levels were also assessed in 60 age- and sex-comparable non-obese individuals without NAFLD at liver ultrasonography. Plasma copeptin was measured by sandwich immunoluminometric assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (53%) had significantly higher copeptin levels than both obese individuals without NAFLD and non-obese subjects (ob/NAFLD+ 9. ± 4.9; ob/NAFLD- 6.4 ± 2.6; and non-ob/NAFLD- 7.4 ± .1 pmol/L; p = 0.004 and p = 0.01 respectively).

Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED technologies are relatively new; therefore, the long-term effects of exposure to blue light across the lifespan are not understood. We investigated the effects of light in the model organism, , and determined that flies maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12 h of blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure acts as a stressor during aging. We also determined that several known blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting in pathways mediating detrimental light effects. Our study reveals the unexpected effects of blue light on fly brain and establishes  as a model in which to investigate long-term effects of blue light at the cellular and organismal level.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535207>Association between body size-metabolic phenotype and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and significant fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Body size-metabolic phenotype may help predict whether or not individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develop advanced liver disease.

Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more metabolic components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese (≥ 25 kg/m) or non-obese (< 25 kg/m). Body size-metabolic phenotypes were divided into four study groups: (1) non-obese metabolic syndrome (MS)-, (2) non-obese MS+ , (3) obese MS-, and (4) obese MS+.Obese MS- and non-obese MS+ groups demonstrated comparable levels of insulin resistance, adipose tissue insulin resistance indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas. The VAT area was significantly higher in the obese MS+ group versus obese MS- group. However, the VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio was highest in the non-obese MS+ group. There was no difference in histology between the non-obese MS+, obese MS-, and obese MS+ groups.

Dissolution of ZnPT particles followed by molecular speciation results in the organic portion, i.e. pyrithione, being more susceptible to skin penetration than the inorganic component, i.e. zinc, or the chelate itself, i.e. ZnPT.To further test the hypothesis that ZnPT skin penetration is rate-limited by dissolution and molecular speciation, the effect of different formulations and artificial sebum on the in vitro percutaneous absorption of radiolabel associated with Zn[14C]PT was investigated.In vitro penetration of [14C]PT into and through excised human skin was measured following application of Zn[14C]PT prepared as suspensions in distinct vehicles including water-based carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), diluted body wash comprised of surfactants, and castor oil, in the presence and absence of artificial sebum.The steady-state flux and cumulative absorption of Zn[14C]PT increased 4- to -fold when deposited from a body wash or castor oil compared to a water-based CMC suspension. Tritiated water flux measured before and after treatment showed that neither the surfactant vehicle nor castor oil significantly altered barrier function versus water alone. An artificial sebum layer on the skin potentiated Zn[14C]PT and 3H2O absorption when dosed from both aqueous formulations, but not from castor oil.These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ZnPT percutaneous absorption, as measured by [14C]PT kinetics, is controlled by particle dissolution and molecular speciation.© 2019 S.

C57BL6/J mice were fed a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%), and cholic acid (0.%), along with 2% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet). Histological and biological parameters were measured at 1 and 3 wk. After 1-wk diet induction, liraglutide was administrated daily for 2 wk and then -associated phenotypic aspects were evaluated in comparison with control mice. Prior to treatment with liraglutide, mice fed the HFCC-CDX diet for 1 wk developed liver steatosis and had increased levels of oxidative-stress markers and hepatic and systemic inflammation. For mice not treated with liraglutide, these aspects were even more pronounced after 3 wk of the dietary period, with additional liver insulin resistance and fibrosis.

We used the HFCC-CDX model to reproduce the main features of disease development in humans for the purpose of facilitating the rapid screening of drug candidates and prioritizing the more promising candidates for advanced preclinical assessment and subsequent clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654279>Population-Level Resistance to Chytridiomycosis is Life-Stage Dependent in an Imperiled Anuran.</a></h2><p>Amphibian declines caused by chytridiomycosis have been severe, but some susceptible populations have persisted or even recovered. Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-38), metamorphs (stage 45-46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were . times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554969>Harnessing global fisheries to tackle micronutrient deficiencies.</a></h2><p>Micronutrient deficiencies account for an estimated one million premature deaths annually, and for some nations can reduce gross domestic product by up to 11%, highlighting the need for food policies that focus on improving nutrition rather than simply increasing the volume of food produced. People gain nutrients from a varied diet, although fish-which are a rich source of bioavailable micronutrients that are essential to human health-are often overlooked. A lack of understanding of the nutrient composition of most fish and how nutrient yields vary among fisheries has hindered the policy shifts that are needed to effectively harness the potential of fisheries for food and nutrition security. Here, using the concentration of 7 nutrients in more than 350 species of marine fish, we estimate how environmental and ecological traits predict nutrient content of marine finfish species. We use this predictive model to quantify the global spatial patterns of the concentrations of nutrients in marine fisheries and compare nutrient yields to the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. We find that species from tropical thermal regimes contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc; smaller species contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and omega-3 fatty acids; and species from cold thermal regimes or those with a pelagic feeding pathway contain higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. There is no relationship between nutrient concentrations and total fishery yield, highlighting that the nutrient quality of a fishery is determined by the species composition. For a number of countries in which nutrient intakes are inadequate, nutrients available in marine finfish catches exceed the dietary requirements for populations that live within 100 km of the coast, and a fraction of current landings could be particularly impactful for children under  years of age. Our analyses suggest that fish-based food strategies have the potential to substantially contribute to global food and nutrition security.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248114>Biphasic Effect of Sildenafil on Energy Sensing is Mediated by Phosphodiesterases 2 and 3 in Adipocytes and Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Sirt1 (Sirtuin 1), AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) modulate hepatic energy metabolism and inflammation and play a major role in the development of . Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play an important role in signal transduction by modulating intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides. We previously found the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil to synergize with leucine and leucine-metformin combinations in preclinical studies of  and obesity. However, efficacy is diminished at higher sildenafil concentrations. Herein, we have successfully modeled the U-shaped sildenafil dose-response in vitro and utilized this model to assess potential mechanisms of this dose-response relationship. Adipocytes and liver cells were treated with leucine (0. mM) and different concentrations of sildenafil (1 nM to 100 µM). cAMP, cGMP, and P-AMPK protein expression were used to demonstrate the biphasic response for increasing concentrations of sildenafil. The reversal with higher sildenafil levels was blunted by PDE2 inhibition. These data indicate that sildenafil-mediated increases in cGMP inhibits PDE3 at lower concentrations, which increases cAMP. However, further increases in cGMP from higher sildenafil concentrations activate PDE2 and consequently decrease cAMP, which demonstrates crosstalk between cAMP and cGMP via PDE2, PDE3, and PDE5. These changes in cAMP concentration are further reflected in downstream effects, including AMPK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309602>Diabetes Is Associated With Increased Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Cirrhosis From Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Diabetes increases the risk of liver disease progression and cirrhosis development in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). The association between diabetes and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in  patients with cirrhosis is not well quantified. All patients with the diagnosis of  cirrhosis seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 2006 and December 2015 were identified. All adult liver transplant registrants with  between 2004 and 2017 were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation registry for external validation. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to investigate the association between diabetes and HCC risk. Among 354 Mayo Clinic patients with  cirrhosis, 253 (71%) had diabetes and 145 (41%) were male. Mean age at cirrhosis evaluation was 62. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 30 patients developed HCC. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.9; P = 0.04) and multivariable analysis (HR = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.2-14.2; P = 0.02). In addition, age (per decade, HR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-2.6; P < 0.01) and low serum albumin (HR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.-2.9; P < 0.01) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in multivariable analysis. Other metabolic risk factors, including body mass index, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, were not associated with HCC risk. Among UNOS  registrants (N = 6,630), 58% had diabetes. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-1.8; P < 0.01) and multivariable (HR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.7; P = 0.03) analysis.

In this paper, a finite element (FE) ring stent bundle has been developed and evaluated with a combination of beam and surface elements. With this approach, the shape, the global stiffness and the strains of the structure can all be well predicted at a low computational cost while the approach is suitable for application to non-symmetrical, patient-specific implant simulations. The model has been validated against analytical and experimental data showing that the manufacturing strains can be predicted to a 0.1% accuracy and the structural stiffness with 0-7% precision. The model has also been compared with a more computationally expensive FE model of higher fidelity, revealing a discrepancy of 0-% of the strain value. Finally, it has been shown that the exclusion of the manufacturing process from the simulation, a technique used in the literature, quadruples the analysis error. This is the first model that can capture the mechanical state of a full ring stent bundle, suitable for complex implant geometry simulations, with such accuracy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536118>Optimizing the growth of very-low-birth-weight infants requires targeting both nutritional and nonnutritional modifiable factors specific to stage of hospitalization.</a></h2><p>Data on how baseline characteristics, acuity, morbidity, and nutrition work in combination to affect the growth of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW, <1500 g) infants are limited.We aimed to determine factors associated with in-hospital weight, length, and head circumference (HC) trajectories of VLBW infants.VLBW infants (n = 316) from the GTA-DoMINO trial were included. Linear mixed-effects models assessed relations of baseline characteristics, acuity (at birth, across hospitalization), major morbidities, and nutrition (enteral feeding type, macronutrient/energy intakes) with changes in anthropometrics over hospitalization (days 1-8, 9-29, 30-75).Specific factors and the strength of their associations with growth depended on in-hospital time interval. Small-for-gestational-age infants experienced weight gain (4.3   g · kg-1 · d-1; 95% CI: 2.0, 6.   g · kg-1 · d-1) during days 1-8, versus weight loss (-4.6     g · kg-1 · d-1; 95% CI: -.6, -3.7     g · kg-1 · d-1) among appropriate-for-gestational-age infants (P < 0.001). Positive-pressure ventilation (versus oxygen/room air) was associated with slower weight (-1.8    g · kg-1 · d-1) and HC (-0.25 cm/wk) gain during days 9-29 (P < 0.001). Morbidities were negatively associated with growth after days 1-8, with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) showing negative associations with weight (-2.7     g · kg-1 · d-1), length (-0.11 cm/wk), and HC (-0.21 cm/wk) gain during days 9-29 (P < 0.001). Macronutrient/energy intakes were associated with weight across hospitalization (P ≤ 0.01), with greater weight gain (1.3-3.0 g  ·  kg-1  ·  d-1) among infants achieving macronutrient/energy recommendations during days 9-29 and 30-75. Macronutrient/energy intakes were associated with HC during the first month (P = 0.013-0.003), with greater HC gain (0.07-0.12 cm/wk) among infants achieving protein, lipid, and energy recommendations during days 9-29.Baseline characteristics, acuity, morbidity, and nutrition factors were independently associated with VLBW infant growth.

Patients with fatty liver disease are primarily asymptomatic. Currently, specialists are predicting that fatty liver related cirrhosis will the be leading reason for liver transplants in the next 10-20 years, displacing hepatitis C and alcohol related liver transplants. NAFLD exists on a spectrum of simple steatosis to steatosis with inflammation and different levels of fibrosis. It is currently estimated that 20% of simple steatosis patients will progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Patients with  are at risk for further progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no single factor that triggers progression from simple steatosis to , however, we do know that  is more prevalent in patients with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and is closely tied with hyperinsulinemia. Currently there are no approved FDA treatments for NAFLD. NAFLD is typically found incidentally on imaging such as abdominal ultrasound and CT. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may prompt the clinician to evaluate for NAFLD however ALT should not be used as a diagnostic tool. The gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and  is a liver biopsy. Only a liver biopsy can distinguish simple steatosis from . In patients whom NAFLD is suspected, appropriate biochemical assessment and imaging should be evaluated. Also, the presence of fibrosis should be assessed. Weight loss and dietary modifications are currently the only recommendations provided to NAFLD patients. There is histological improvement seen in in patients whom lose -10% of their body weight. Certain dietary factors play a role in the development of NAFLD including excessive caloric intake and high fructose consumption. There are pharmacological treatments currently being studied as well as non-pharmacological agents. This overview focuses on evaluation, management and treatments in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589891>Change in hepatic fat content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Proof-of-concept studies frequently assess changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content by magnetic resonance-based techniques as a surrogate marker of histology. The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Patients with  who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (2-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from 2 different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of  without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with .Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

To prevent a rotational deformity, the correct angle of the zygoma relative to the cranial base must be restored. Clinically, this can be a challenge, especially when there is comminution of the zygomaticosphenoid suture. Defining a zygomaticosphenoidal angle would provide a reference for use with stereotactic navigation to achieve anatomic reduction.A single-center retrospective analysis of 100 patients was designed to determine normative zygomaticosphenoidal angle values. An angle subtended by the midline and a best-fit line through the zygomaticosphenoid suture on axial computed tomography was measured bilaterally in patients with isolated mandibular or nasal fractures. The mean of this measurement for 3 vertically adjacent cuts was calculated with position of central cut determined by the equator of the globe and trigone of the sphenoid. Multivariate regression was completed to identify changes in zygomaticosphenoidal angle with age, sex, and race.The mean zygomaticosphenoidal angle was 47° (range 39°-55°). 97% of angles were within 2 standard deviations (8°) of mean. Regression analysis demonstrated no significant change in angle with age (P = 0.74) or sex (P = 0.89). For each angle, the variation across the 3 sample cuts was ≤4.°. Patients demonstrated high fidelity in zygomaticosphenoidal angle bilaterally with mean difference of 3°.The zygomaticosphenoidal angle is a useful reference, in conjunction with stereotactic navigation, for reduction of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures.

Loss of Growth Hormone (GH) signaling is reported to predispose to NAFLD and  through direct actions on the liver. Here, we report that aged mice lacking hepatocyte Jak2 (JAK2L), an obligate transducer of Growth Hormone (GH) signaling, spontaneously develop the full spectrum of phenotypes found in patients with metabolic liver disease, beginning with insulin resistance and lipodystrophy and manifesting as NAFLD,  and even HCC, independent of dietary intervention. Remarkably, insulin resistance, metabolic liver disease, and carcinogenesis are prevented in JAK2L mice via concomitant deletion of adipocyte Jak2 (JAK2LA). Further, we demonstrate that GH increases hepatic lipid burden but does so indirectly via signaling through adipocyte JAK2. Collectively, these data establish adipocytes as the mediator of GH-induced metabolic liver disease and carcinogenesis. In addition, we report a new spontaneous model of NAFLD, , and HCC that recapitulates the natural sequelae of human insulin resistance-associated disease progression. The work presented here suggests a attention be paid towards inhibition of adipocyte GH signaling as a therapeutic target of metabolic liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279904>Prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>We undertook a cross-sectional study of children/adolescents with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to compare the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes, and to examine the role of abnormal glucose tolerance as a predictor of liver disease severity.We recruited a cohort of 599 Caucasian children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD, and 118 children/adolescents without NAFLD, who were selected to be similar for age, sex, body mass index and waist circumference to those with NAFLD.

Germline mutations in BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) are associated with unique disease profiles in mesothelioma, atypical spitz nevi, and uveal melanoma, but the patient characteristics of an unselected population of BAP1 carriers identified by an ascertainment prevalence study are unknown.We collected blood samples, cancer histories, and occupational exposures from 183 unselected patients with BAP1-related diseases. Clinical information for each patient was obtained from medical records. Germline DNA was extracted from blood samples and sequenced using a next-generation sequencing assay. We tested screening criteria developed to identify patients with a possible germline BAP1 mutation.Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline BAP1 mutations were observed in  of 180 sequenced specimens and were exclusively found in patients identified by our screening criteria. Several patients with characteristics suspicious for a heritable deleterious mutation did not have a germline BAP1 mutation. The prevalence of pathogenic germline BAP1 mutations in patients with mesothelioma was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 1.1-11.1).Results from the first unselected prevalence ascertainment study of germline BAP1 alterations suggest that the frequency of this mutation is low among patients with mesothelioma. The proposed screening criteria successfully identified all patients with germline BAP1-mutant mesothelioma. These screening guidelines may assist physicians in selecting patients who would benefit from genetic testing. Future efforts should validate and refine these criteria and search for other germline mutations associated with mesothelioma and related diseases.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

We studied the effectiveness of a national quality improvement (QI) programme to implement a care pathway to improve survival for these patients.We did a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial of patients aged 40 years or older undergoing emergency open major abdominal surgery. Eligible UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals (those that had an emergency general surgical service, a substantial volume of emergency abdominal surgery cases, and contributed data to the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit) were organised into 15 geographical clusters and commenced the QI programme in a random order, based on a computer-generated random sequence, over an 85-week period with one geographical cluster commencing the intervention every  weeks from the second to the 16th time period. Patients were masked to the study group, but it was not possible to mask hospital staff or investigators. The primary outcome measure was mortality within 90 days of surgery. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN80682973.Treatment took place between March 3, 2014, and Oct 19, 2015. 22 754 patients were assessed for elegibility. Of 15 873 eligible patients from 93 NHS hospitals, primary outcome data were analysed for 8482 patients in the usual care group and 7374 in the QI group. Eight patients in the usual care group and nine patients in the QI group were not included in the analysis because of missing primary outcome data. The primary outcome of 90-day mortality occurred in 1210 (16%) patients in the QI group compared with 1393 (16%) patients in the usual care group (HR 1·11, 0·96-1·28).No survival benefit was observed from this QI programme to implement a care pathway for patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Future QI programmes should ensure that teams have both the time and resources needed to improve patient care.National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two years of online measurement of flow data, combined with spatial analysis, was linked through runoff modelisation with EPA SWMM. The coefficients of  obtained varying between 0.75 and 0.87 demonstrated an adequate modelling approach. A 1-year rain series was applied to evaluate the runoff behaviour of actual land cover and that of 2002. The peak flows normalised to watershed surfaces revealed as the most urbanised (85%) watershed Ressaca with 178 L/ha/s, three times more runoff intensive than the least urbanised (41%) Mergulhão with 67 L/ha/s. Statistical analysis of land cover data and modelling results on watershed and sub-watershed level showed main correlations between hydrological parameters such as peak flow, average event flow and restitution time, but also between land cover and runoff coefficient. This approach gave a linear relation between runoff and green surface, with a runoff coefficient of 0.86 for fully urbanised zone and 0.43 for full "green" cover. Prospective simulation with actual urbanisation rates varying from 4 to 34 ha/year suggested an increase between 6 and 18% of the flows and a possible end of urbanisation within the next two to three decades. These findings should contribute to a better understanding of hydrological impact of Belo Horizonte urbanisation and to the restauration of its Lake Pampulha.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415926>Hydrological modelling of green and grey roofs in cold climate with the SWMM model.</a></h2><p>Rooftop retrofitting targets the largest land-use type available for reduction in impervious surfaces area in urban areas. Extensive green and grey roofs offer solution for retention and detention of stormwater in densely developed urban areas. Among the available green roof types, the extensive green roof has become a popular selection and commonly adopted choice. These solutions provide multiple benefits for stormwater and environmental management due to stormwater retention and detention capacities. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) .1.012 with Low Impact Development (LID) Controls was used to model the hydrological performance of a green and a grey (non-vegetated detention roof based on extruded lightweight aggregates) roof (located in the coastal area of Trondheim, Norway) by defining the physical parameters of individual layers in LID Control editor. High-resolution 1-min data from a previously monitored green and grey roof were used for calibration. Six parameters within the individual LID layers: soil (four parameters) and drainage mat (two parameters) were selected for calibration. After calibration, the SWMM model simulated runoff with a -Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSME) of 0.94 (green roof) and 0.78 (grey roof) and a volume error of 3% for the green roof, and 10% for the grey roof. Validation of the calibrated model indicates good fit between observed and simulated runoff with a NSME of 0.88 (green roof) and 0.81 (grey roof) and with volume errors of 29% (green roof) and 11% (grey roof). Concerning the snowmelt modelling, the calibrated model showed a NSME of 0.56 (green roof) and 0.37 (grey roof) through the winter period. However, regarding volume errors, additional model development for winter conditions is needed; 30% (green roof) and 11% (grey roof). Optimal parameter sets were proposed within both the green and grey configurations. The results from calibration and especially validation indicated that SWMM could be used to simulate the performance of different rooftop solutions. The study provides insight for urban planners of how to target and focus the implementation of rooftop solutions as stormwater measures.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In an earlier study, Google Maps application programming interface (API) was used to perform modeling on the combination of hospitals optimizing for catchment in terms of current traveling time and road conditions. It is not known if these findings would remain the same if the modeling was performed with a large-scale transport demand model such as Victorian Integrated Transport Model (VITM). This model is developed by the Victorian State Government Transport has the capability to forecast travel demand into the future including future road conditions which is not possible with a Google Maps based applications. The aim of this study is to compare the travel time to potential ECR hubs using both VITM and the Google Maps API and model stability in the next  and 10 years.  The VITM was used to generate travel time from randomly generated addresses to four existing ECR capable hubs in Melbourne city, Australia (i.e., Royal Melbourne Hospital/RMH, Monash Medical Center/MMC, Alfred Hospital/ALF, and Austin Hospital/AUS) and the optimal service boundaries given a delivering time threshold are then determined.  The strategic transport model and Google map methods were similar with the   of 0.86 (peak and off peak) and the -Sutcliffe model of efficiency being 0.83 (peak) and 0.76 (off-peak travel). Futures modeling using VITM found that this proportion decreases to 82% after  years and 80% after 10 years. The combination of RMH and ALF provides coverage for 74% of cases, 68% by  years, and 66% by 10 years. The combination of RMH and AUS provides coverage for 70% of cases in the base case, 65% at  years, and 63% by 10 years.  The results from strategic transport model are similar to those from Google Maps. In this paper we illustrate how this method can be applied in designing and forecast stroke service model in different cities in Australia and around the world.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359195>Impact of sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/steatohepatitis () is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Our aim was to study the long-term effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on NAFLD/.Between 2008 and 2015, 3813 patients had an intraoperative liver biopsy performed at the time of primary RYGB and SG at a single academic center. Utilizing strict inclusion criteria, 487 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD who had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values (≥ 40 IU/L) at baseline were identified. Matching of SG to RYGB patients (1:4) was performed via logistic regression and propensity scores adjusting for clinical and liver histological characteristics. Changes in liver function tests (LFTs) at least 1 year after surgery were compared to baseline values and between the surgical groups.A total of 310 (weighted) patients (SG n = 62, and RYGB n = 248) with a median follow-up time of 4 years (range, 1-10) were included in the analysis. The distribution of covariates was well-balanced after propensity matching. In 84% of patients, LFT values normalized after bariatric surgery at the last follow-up time. The proportions of patients having normalized LFT values did not differ significantly between the SG and RYGB groups (82% vs. 84%, p = 0.66). The AST decreased from (SG: 49.1 ± 21. vs. RYGB: 49.3 ± 22.0, p = 0.93) at baseline to (SG: 28.0 ± 16. vs. RYGB: 26. ± 15., p = 0.33) at the last follow-up. Similarly, a significant reduction in ALT values from (SG: 61.7 ± 30.0 vs. RYGB 59.4 ± 24.9, p = 0.75) at baseline to (SG: 27.2 ± 21. vs. RYGB: 26.1 ± 19.2, p = 0.52) at the last follow-up was observed.In patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD/, abnormal LFTs are normalized in most SG and RYGB patients by the end of the first postoperative year and remain normal until the last follow-up.

Its prevalence is increasing because of obesity, metabolic syndrome or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). NAFLD can cause liver inflammation and progress to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (), fibrosis, cirrhosis or Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC). Nevertheless, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in NAFLD/ patients. Current guidelines suggest the use of pioglitazone both in patients with T2DM and in those without. The newer antidiabetic drugs such as Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RA), Sodium-Glucose co- Transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and statins plus ezetimibe, are considered safe by the guidelines, and may have a beneficial effect on NAFLD/ as well as Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Future drugs seem to have a potential for holding down the evolution of NAFLD and reduce liver- and CVD-related morbidity and mortality, but they will take some years to be approved for routine use. Until then pioglitazone, GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i, and statins plus ezetimibe, especially in combination might be useful for treating the huge number of patients with NAFLD/.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641060>Identifying Ontario geographic regions to assess adults who present to hospital with laboratory-defined conditions: a descriptive study.</a></h2><p>In 2007, an electronic repository called the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS) was introduced to allow health care providers timely access to laboratory test results. Since not all laboratories began submitting their data to OLIS simultaneously, we sought to create a date-dependent table of geographic regions (forward sortation areas [FSAs]) from which people would likely present to a hospital linked to OLIS.In this descriptive study, we used administrative data to capture adults in Ontario who presented to the emergency department for any reason from 2007 to 2017. To assess changes over time, we classified all emergency department visits into fiscal quarters. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of people in a given FSA presenting to an emergency department at an OLIS-linked hospital (v. a hospital not linked to OLIS). To be included in the catchment area, at least 90% of all emergency department visits in a given quarter from a given FSA must have occurred at an OLIS-linked hospital.By Dec. 31, 2017, 323 (61.4%) of 526 Ontario FSAs were in the catchment area (a population of about 8. million). There were no differences in selected demographic characteristics or comorbidities between people residing within the catchment area of OLIS-linked hospitals and those residing in the catchment area of unlinked hospitals on Dec. 31, 2017. We used the FSA information to construct a date-dependent table of geographic areas likely to have hospital laboratory data available in OLIS for future studies.We identified relevant Ontario geographic regions from which people would likely present to a hospital linked to OLIS.

Survey results were discussed as a group before voting.Current measures of disease activity and fibrosis may not fully capture important features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). Alternative methods to evaluate ballooning degeneration are needed. Panellists were uncertain whether portal inflammation, degree of steatosis and Mallory-Denk bodies are important measures of disease activity. Furthermore, it was felt that current staging systems do not capture the full spectrum of fibrosis in . A consensus definition and sub-stages for bridging fibrosis are needed.

We recently identified adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1) as a member of a core set of dysregulated fibrosis-specific genes in human . Here we sought to investigate the relationship between AEBP1 and hepatic fibrosis. We confirmed that hepatic AEBP1 expression is elevated in fibrosis compared to lobular inflammation, steatosis, and normal liver, and increases with worsening fibrosis in  patients. AEBP1 expression was upregulated .8-fold in activated hepatic stellate cells and downregulated during chemical and contact induction of biological quiescence. In LX-2 and HepG2 cells treated with high glucose (25 mM), AEBP1 expression increased over 7-fold compared to normal glucose conditions. In response to treatment with either fructose or palmitate, AEBP1 expression in primary human hepatocytes increased 2.4-fold or 9.6-fold, but was upregulated 55.8-fold in the presence of fructose and palmitate together. AEBP1 knockdown resulted in decreased expression of nine genes previously identified to be part of a predicted AEBP1-associated  co-regulatory network and confirmed to be upregulated in fibrotic tissue. We identified binding sites for two miRNAs known to be downregulated in  fibrosis, miR-372-3p and miR-373-3p in the AEBP1 3' untranslated region.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () or advanced fibrosis. Weight loss of at least 3% to % generally reduces , but greater weight loss (7% to 10%) is needed to improve most histopathologic features, including fibrosis.

Finally, exposure to BAR502 reshaped the intestinal microbiota by increasing the amount of .

To characterize -related cases and to compare the post-transplant outcome of these two conditions represents our major objective.Patients undergoing LT for  between 1997 and 2016 were retrieved. Those transplanted between 1997 and 2006 were compared to an "age and LT date" matched group of patients transplanted for alcoholic cirrhosis (ratio 1:2). Baseline features and medium-term outcome measures were compared.Of 1986 LT performed between 1997 and 2016, 40 (2%) were labeled as -related indications. -related cases increased initially (from 0.8% in 1997-2001 to 2.7% in 2002-2006) but remained stable in subsequent years (2.3%). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence was greater in -vs alcohol-related cirrhosis (40% vs 3%, p=0.001). The incidence of overweight, obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hyperuricemia, renal insufficiency and cardiovascular (CV) disease was similar in both groups at  years post-LT. Five-year survival was higher in  but without reaching statistical significance (83% vs 72%, p=0.21). The main cause of mortality in -LT patients was HCC recurrence.Most previously considered cryptogenic cases are actually -cirrhosis. While the incidence of this indication is increasing in many countries, it has remained relatively stable in our Unit, the largest LT center in Spain. HCC is common in these patients and represents a main cause of post-transplant mortality. Metabolic complications, CV-related disease and -yr survival do not differ in patients transplanted for  vs alcohol.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

We aim to investigate whether C-peptide is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression in type 2 diabetic adults.A total of 4937 diabetic participants were enrolled from China in 2018. Liver steatosis was detected by ultrasound. Subjects with NAFLD were categorized into simple NAFLD and probable  by the concurrent presence of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD fibrosis score was used to identify patients with probable advanced fibrosis.Individuals with a longer history of type 2 diabetes had a lower C-peptide level and a lower prevalence of probable  but a higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis. C-peptide was positively associated with simple NAFLD and probable , with odds ratios (ORs) of 4.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16, 6.55] and .28 (95% CI 3.94, 7.09), respectively, comparing quartile 4 with quartile 1 (both p for trend <0.001). However, C-peptide quartiles were negatively associated with the probable presence of advanced fibrosis (Q4 vs. Q1, OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36, 0.97, p for trend <0.05). A 1-SD increment of ln(C-peptide) was also significantly associated with inflammatory and fibrotic progression (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.27, 1.41; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.98, respectively).Significant but opposite associations between C-peptide and inflammatory and fibrotic progression of NAFLD were observed.

Traditional preclinical rodent studies for putative  therapies are often limited by not knowing the level of liver disease/ present at the start of therapeutic intervention, instead of randomizing treatment groups on easily measurable endpoints such as body weight, metabolic status or similar. Here, we describe a liver biopsy technique in a diet-induced  mouse model, for the assessment of baseline liver disease in order to exclude mice that do not exhibit fibrosis and to equally distribute animals with similar fibrosis between treatment groups. These levels can then be compared to the terminal, post-intervention levels for a truer understanding of in vivo pharmacological effects and thus more accurately reflect clinical trial design strategies. The mouse is properly anesthetized and prepared for the surgery using sterile conditions. A small incision is made in the upper abdomen and the left lateral lobe of the liver is exposed. A wedge of the liver is surgically removed, and a similar-sized piece of absorbable gelatin is put in its place to stop any bleeding. The mouse is surgically sutured and stapled closed and will recover back to normal within 1 day. The entire process takes -10 min per mouse. Here we exemplify the utility of this procedure by leveraging the pre-study biopsy to assess the impact of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide on  endpoints in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672989>GWAS for systemic sclerosis identifies multiple risk loci and highlights fibrotic and vasculopathy pathways.</a></h2><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease that shows one of the highest mortality rates among rheumatic diseases. We perform a large genome-wide association study (GWAS), and meta-analysis with previous GWASs, in 26,679 individuals and identify 27 independent genome-wide associated signals, including 13 new risk loci. The novel associations nearly double the number of genome-wide hits reported for SSc thus far. We define 95% credible sets of less than  likely causal variants in 12 loci. Additionally, we identify specific SSc subtype-associated signals. Functional analysis of high-priority variants shows the potential function of SSc signals, with the identification of 43 robust target genes through HiChIP. Our results point towards molecular pathways potentially involved in vasculopathy and fibrosis, two main hallmarks in SSc, and highlight the spectrum of critical cell types for the disease.

Vitamin E supplementation is recommended for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () patients, but only for non-diabetic subjects. We aimed to investigate whether serum vitamin E levels differently impact long-term prognosis in diabetic versus non-diabetic NAFLD individuals. A total of 2404 ultrasonographically defined NAFLD individuals from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III were stratified by their glycemic statuses into diabetic ( = 662), pre-diabetic ( = 836) and non-diabetic ( = 906), and the relationship between serum vitamin E levels and all-cause mortality was analyzed. The serum vitamin E concentrations were 31.1 ± 14.1, 26.7 ± 9.6, and 24.7 ± 9.8 µmol/L and vitamin E: total cholesterol ratios were .16 ± 1.70, 4.81 ± 1.46, and 4.80 ± 1.34 µmol/mmol in in diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-diabetic groups, respectively. Of 2404 NAFLD subjects, 2403 have mortality information and 152 non-diabetic, 244 pre-diabetic, and 342 diabetic participants died over a median follow-up period of 18.8 years. Both serum vitamin E levels and vitamin E: total cholesterol ratios were negatively associated with all-cause mortality after adjusting for possible confounders in non-diabetic subjects (HR = 0.483, and 0.451, respectively,  < 0.005), but not in either diabetic or pre-diabetic subjects. In NAFLD individuals, both serum vitamin E and lipid-corrected vitamin E were (1) higher in the diabetic group; and (2) negatively associated with all-cause mortality only in the non-diabetic group. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this inverse association of serum vitamin E concentration with all-cause mortality in non-diabetic but not pre-diabetic or diabetic subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104850>A Positive Association Between Dietary Intake of Higher Cow's Milk-Fat Percentage and Non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young Children.</a></h2><p>To determine the association between cow's milk-fat and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol, a marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in young children, and whether this association is mediated by the typical volume of cow's milk consumed.A longitudinal study in 2- to 8-year-old children (n = 2890) was conducted through The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!), a practice-based research network in Toronto, Canada. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between parent-reported cow's milk-fat percentage intake and serum non-HDL cholesterol concentrations as well as having high non-HDL cholesterol (≥3.75 mmol/L [145 mg/dL]), adjusting for covariates including age, sex, body mass index z score, breastfeeding duration, mother's ethnicity, and parental history of CVD. Bootstrap resampling (10 000 repetitions) was used to assess whether typical volume consumed mediated the association between cow's milk-fat percentage and non-HDL cholesterol.In total, 156 (.4%) had high non-HDL cholesterol. Each percent increase in cow's milk-fat was associated with a 0.035 mmol/L (1.35 mg/dL) (P < .001) and 0.024 mmol/L (0.92 mg/dL) (P = .01) increase in non-HDL cholesterol, unadjusted and adjusted for covariates respectively. Cow's milk-fat percentage was not associated with greater odds of having high non-HDL cholesterol. Volume of cow's milk partially mediated the association between cow's milk-fat percentage and non-HDL cholesterol, accounting for 28% of the relationship (P < .001).Consumption of higher-fat cow's milk was associated with a small increase in non-HDL cholesterol but not greater odds of having high non-HDL cholesterol. Further research is needed to assess this relationship with other CVD risk factors in young children.ClinicalTrials.gov: .Copyright © 2019.

This paper proposes the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to predict the TWSA derived from GRACE. We designed a case study in six regions in China (North China Plain (NCP), Southwest China (SWC), Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), Tianshan Mountains Region (TSMR), Heihe River Basin (HRB), and Lishui and Wenzhou area (LSWZ)) using GRACE RL06 data from January 2003 to August 2016 for inversion, which were compared with Center for Space Research (CSR), Helmholtz-Centre Potsdam-German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s Mascon (Mass Concentration) RL05, and JPL's Mascon RL06. We evaluated the accuracy of SSA prediction on different temporal scales based on the correlation coefficient (), -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), which were compared with that of an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model. The TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were predicted using SSA, which was verified using Mascon RL06, the Global Land Data Assimilation System model, and GRACE-FO results. The results show that: (1) TWSA derived from GRACE agreed well with Mascon in most regions, with the highest consistency with Mascon RL06 and (2) prediction accuracy of GRACE in TRHR and SWC was higher. SSA reconstruction improved , NSE, and RMSE compared with those of ARMA. The  values for predicting TWS in the six regions using the SSA method were 0.34-0.98, which was better than those for ARMA (0.26-0.97), and the RMSE values were 0.03-.55 cm, which were better than the 2.29-.11 cm RMSE for ARMA as a whole. (3) The SSA method produced better predictions for obvious periodic and trending characteristics in the TWSA in most regions, whereas the detailed signal could not be effectively predicted. (4) The predicted TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were basically consistent with Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) results, and the predicted TWSA during June 2018 to May 2019 agreed well with GRACE-FO results.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota, which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity. Finally, we summarize the most recent lipidomic strategies utilized to explore the liver lipidome and its modifications in the course of NALFD. These include measures of lipid profiles in blood plasma and erythrocyte membranes that can surrogate to some extent lipid investigation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, its activity on helminth parasites has not been previously reported. Here, we show that sclareol is active against larval (IC ≈ 13 μM), juvenile (IC = .0 μM), and adult (IC = 19.3 μM) stages of , a parasitic trematode responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Microwave-assisted synthesis of Heck-coupled derivatives improved activity, with the substituents choice guided by the Matsy decision tree. The most active derivative  showed improved potency and selectivity on larval (IC ≈ 2.2 μM, selectivity index (SI) ≈ 22 in comparison to HepG2 cells), juvenile (IC = 1.7 μM, SI = 28.8), and adult schistosomes (IC = 9.4 μM, SI = .2). Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that compound  induced blebbing of the adult worm surface at sublethal concentration (12. μM); moreover, the compound inhibited egg production at the lowest concentration tested (3.13 μM). The observed phenotype and data obtained by untargeted metabolomics suggested that compound  affects membrane lipid homeostasis by interfering with arachidonic acid metabolism. The same methodology applied to praziquantel (PZQ)-treated worms revealed sugar metabolism alterations that could be ascribed to the previously reported action of PZQ on serotonin signaling and/or effects on glycolysis. Importantly, our data suggest that compound  and PZQ exert different antischistosomal activities. More studies will be necessary to confirm the generated hypothesis and to progress the development of more potent antischistosomal sclareol derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31418094>Accurate total solar irradiance estimates under irradiance measurements scarcity scenarios.</a></h2><p>Accurate estimates of total global solar irradiance reaching the Earth's surface are relevant since routine measurements are not always available. This work aimed to determine which of the models used to estimate daily total global solar irradiance (TGSI) is the best model when irradiance measurements are scarce in a given site. A model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and empirical models based on temperature and sunshine measurements were analyzed and evaluated in Córdoba, Argentina. The performance of the models was benchmarked using different statistical estimators such as the mean bias error (MBE), the mean absolute bias error (MABE), the correlation coefficient (r), the -Sutcliffe equation (NSE), and the statistics t test (t value). The results showed that when enough measurements were available, both the ANN and the empirical models accurately predicted TGSI (with MBE and MABE ≤ |0.11| and ≤ |1.98| kWh m day, respectively; NSE ≥ 0.83; r ≥ 0.95; and |t values| < t critical value). However, when few TGSI measurements were available (2, 3, , 7, or 10 days per month) only the ANN-based method was accurate (|t value| < t critical value), yielding precise results although only 2 measurements per month were available for 1 year. This model has an important advantage over the empirical models and is very relevant to Argentina due to the scarcity of TGSI measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658178>Missed Study Visits and Subsequent HIV Incidence Among Women in a Predominantly Sex Worker Cohort Attending a Dedicated Clinic Service in Kampala, Uganda.</a></h2><p>There is limited evidence on the relationship between sustained exposure of female sex workers (FSWs) to targeted HIV programmes and HIV incidence. We investigate the relationship between the number of missed study visits (MSVs) within each episode of 2 consecutively attended visits (MSVs) and subsequent HIV risk in a predominantly FSW cohort.Women at high risk of HIV are invited to attend an ongoing dedicated clinic offering a combination HIV prevention intervention in Kampala, Uganda. Study visits are scheduled once every 3 months. The analysis included HIV-seronegative women with ≥1 follow-up visit from enrollment (between April 2008 and May 2017) to August 2017. Cox regression models were fitted adjusted for characteristics on sociodemographic, reproductive, behavioral, and sexually transmitted infections (through clinical examination and serological testing for syphilis).Among 2206 participants, HIV incidence was 3.1/100 (170/5540) person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6 to 3.]. Incidence increased from 2.6/100 person-years (95% CI: 2.1 to 3.2) in episodes without a MSV to 3.0/100 (95% CI: 2.2 to 4.1) for 1-2 MSVs and 4.3/100 (95% CI: 3.3 to .6) for ≥3 MSVs. Relative to episodes without a MSV, the hazard ratios (adjusted for confounding variables) were 1.40 (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.12) for 1-2 MSVs and 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35 to 2.95) for ≥3 MSVs (P-trend = 0.001).Missing study visits was associated with increased subsequent HIV risk.

Each of (7,) and (7,6) sorted SWCNTs were non-covalently loaded with their specific payload: the PI3 kinase inhibitor targeting liver fibrosis or CCR5 siRNA targeting inflammatory pathways with the goal of addressing these processes in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), ultimately to prevent its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma.

While the clinical results of rotator cuff repair can be good, failure of tendon healing remains a significant problem. Molecular mechanisms underlying structural failure following surgical repair remain unclear. Histologically, enhanced inflammation, disorganization of the collagen fibers, calcification, apoptosis and tissue necrosis affect the normal healing process. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to provide improved healing following rotator cuff repair via the release of mediators from secreted 30-100 nm extracellular vesicles called exosomes. They carry regulatory proteins, mRNA and miRNA and have the ability to increase collagen synthesis and angiogenesis through increased expression of mRNA and release of proangiogenic factors and regulatory proteins that play a major role in proper tissue remodeling and preventing extracellular matrix degradation. Various studies have shown the effect of exosomes on improving outcome of cutaneous wound healing, scar tissue formation, degenerative bone disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In this article, we critically reviewed the potential role of exosomes in tendon regeneration and propose the novel use of exosomes alone or seeded onto biomaterial matrices to stimulate secretion of favorable cellular factors in accelerating the healing response following rotator cuff repair.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597206>The characteristics and risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease without cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) without cirrhosis.We prospectively followed NAFLD patients at our University hospital. NAFLD was diagnosed from detection of steatosis by histology or imaging, no alcohol intake, and exclusion of other liver diseases. Cirrhosis was defined by histological features, imaging data, and symptoms. We compared NAFLD-related HCC with or without cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic NAFLD with or without HCC.There were 48 non-cirrhotic HCC patients and 71 cirrhotic HCC patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that other than liver function factors male gender (OR: .603, 95%CI: 1.577-19.900), light drinker (OR: 2.797, 95%CI: 1.031-7.589), and tumor size (OR: 1.031, 95%CI 1.009-1.055) differ significantly between these two groups. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the non-cirrhotic HCC group than the cirrhotic HCC group, with risk factors being des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and the number of HCCs. The non-cirrhotic HCC group showed significantly better survival due to absence of non-cancerous liver failure. Comparison between non-cirrhotic NAFLD patients with or without HCC (n=612) revealed the following risk factors for HCC: male gender (OR: 7.774, 95%CI: 2.176-27.775), light drinker (OR: 4.893, 95%CI: 1.923-12.449), and high FIB4-index (OR 2.634, 95%CI: 1.787-3.884).In patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD, important risk factors for HCC were male gender, alcohol consumption, and the FIB4-index.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism and therapeutic prospect of berberine in the treatment of -HCC mice. Combination of STZ injection and high fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHC) was used to establish -HCC model. The effect of berberine intervention is studied from histology, biochemistry and molecular level. Our results showed that administration of berberine to -HCC mice reduced the incidence of tumors and mitigated . Berberine significantly reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose (GLU), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC). Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis identified numberous genes and various pathways may participate in the favorite effect of berberine. Specifically, berberine suppressed the expressions of genes related to lipogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. Moreover, our results showed that berberine suppressed phosphorylation of p38MAPK and ERK as well as COX2 expression significantly. This suggested berberine achieved its biological functions mainly by regulating inflammation and angiogenesis genes involving p38MAPK/ERK-COX2 pathways. This study demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of berberine and its possible mechanism, providing a potential drug for treating -HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181056>Changes in rapid HIV treatment initiation after national "treat all" policy adoption in 6 sub-Saharan African countries: Regression discontinuity analysis.</a></h2><p>Most countries have formally adopted the World Health Organization's 2015 recommendation of universal HIV treatment ("treat all"). However, there are few rigorous assessments of the real-world impact of treat all policies on antiretroviral treatment (ART) uptake across different contexts.We used longitudinal data for 814,603 patients enrolling in HIV care between 1 January 2004 and 10 July 2018 in 6 countries participating in the global International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium: Burundi (N = 11,176), Kenya (N = 179,941), Malawi (N = 84,558), Rwanda (N = 17,396), Uganda (N = 96,286), and Zambia (N = 425,246). Using a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, we assessed the change in the proportion initiating ART within 30 days of enrollment in HIV care (rapid ART initiation) after country-level adoption of the treat all policy. A modified Poisson model was used to identify factors associated with failure to initiate ART rapidly under treat all. In each of the 6 countries, over 60% of included patients were female, and median age at enrollment ranged from 32 to 36 years. In all countries studied, national adoption of treat all was associated with large increases in rapid ART initiation. Significant increases in rapid ART initiation immediately after treat all policy adoption were observed in Rwanda, from 44.4% to 78.9% of patients (34. percentage points [pp], 95% CI 27.2 to 41.7; p < 0.001), Kenya (25.7 pp, 95% CI 21.8 to 29.; p < 0.001), Burundi (17.7 pp, 95% CI 6. to 28.9; p = 0.002), and Malawi (12. pp, 95% CI 7. to 17.; p < 0.001), while no immediate increase was observed in Zambia (0.4 pp, 95% CI -2.9 to 3.8; p = 0.804) and Uganda (-4.2 pp, 95% CI -9.0 to 0.7; p = 0.090). The rate of rapid ART initiation accelerated sharply following treat all policy adoption in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia; slowed in Kenya; and did not change in Rwanda and Burundi. In post hoc analyses restricted to patients enrolling under treat all, young adults (16-24 years) and men were at increased risk of not rapidly initiating ART (compared to older patients and women, respectively). However, rapid ART initiation following enrollment increased for all groups as more time elapsed since treat all policy adoption. Study limitations include incomplete data on potential ART eligibility criteria, such as clinical status, pregnancy, and enrollment CD4 count, which precluded the assessment of rapid ART initiation specifically among patients known to be eligible for ART before treat all.Our analysis indicates that adoption of treat all policies had a strong effect on increasing rates of rapid ART initiation, and that these increases followed different trajectories across the 6 countries.

Masked assessment of liver histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the  CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent 2 liver biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline  (84 [18.8%]), and definite  (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (2.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%). Steatohepatitis resolved in 24 (28.6%) of the patients with borderline  and 61 (22.1%) of those with definite . Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively. Metabolic syndrome (20 [95%] vs 108 [72%]; P = .03), baseline NAS (mean [SD], .0 [1.4] vs 4.3 [1.6]; P = .005), and smaller reduction in NAS (-0.2 [2] vs -0.9 [2]; P < .001) were associated with progression to advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis vs those without progression to stage 3 to 4 fibrosis. Fibrosis regression was associated with lower baseline insulin level (20 vs 33 μU/mL; P = .02) and decrease in all NAS components (steatosis grade -0.8 [0.1] vs -0.3 [0.9]; P < .001; lobular inflammation -0. [0.8] vs -0.2 [0.9]; P < .001; ballooning -0.7 [1.1] vs -0.1 [0.9]; P < .001).

Changes in the AST level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and NAS were also associated with fibrosis regression and progression (ΔAST level: regression, cOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.2; P = .47; progression, cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P = .02; ΔALT level: regression, cOR, 0.7 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.-0.9; P = .002; progression, cOR, 1.0 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2; P = .93; ΔNAS: regression, cOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9; P = .001; progression, cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.; P = .01).Improvement or worsening of disease activity may be associated with fibrosis regression or progression, respectively, in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667206>Mesenchymal stem cells cultured under hypoxic conditions had a greater therapeutic effect on mice with liver cirrhosis compared to those cultured under normal oxygen conditions.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be easily expanded. They can be acquired from medical waste such as adipose and umbilical cord tissues, are influenced by culturing conditions, and exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and angiogenic effects. We analyzed the multi-directional effects of MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions and their underlying mechanisms in the treatment of liver cirrhosis in a mouse model.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxic (% O; hypoMSCs) and normoxic (21% O; norMSCs) conditions were compared by cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with or without serum from liver cirrhosis patients. The therapeutic effects of MSCs, including serum liver enzyme induction, fibrosis regression, and hepatic oxidative stress, were evaluated by injecting 1 × 10, 2 × 10, or 4 × 10 MSCs/mouse into the tail veins of mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced liver cirrhosis. Intravital imaging was performed with a two-photon excitation microscope to confirm the various MSC migration paths to the liver.CAGE analysis revealed that the RNA expression levels of prostaglandin E synthase () and miR210 were significantly higher in hypoMSCs than in norMSCs.  analysis revealed that both hypoMSCs and norMSCs reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, oxidative stress, and fibrosis compared to that in control mice in a dose-dependent manner. However, hypoMSCs had stronger therapeutic effects than norMSCs. We confirmed this observation by an  study in which hypoMSCs changed macrophage polarity to an anti-inflammatory phenotype via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation. In addition, miR210 reduced the rate of hepatocyte apoptosis. Intravital imaging after MSC administration showed that both cell types were primarily trapped in the lungs. Relatively a few hypoMSCs and norMSCs migrated to the liver. There were no significant differences in their distributions.The therapeutic effect of hypoMSCs was mediated by PGE2 and miR210 production and was greater than that of norMSCs. Therefore, MSCs can be manipulated to improve their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and could potentially serve in effective cell therapy. MSCs produce several factors with multidirectional effects and function as "conducting cells" in liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

Their capacity to build enduring crusts that underpin the formation of tropical reefs, rhodolith beds and other benthic substrate is dependent on the formation of a calcified thallus. However, this important process of skeletal carbonate formation is not well understood. We undertook a study of cellular carbonate features to develop a model for calcification. We describe two types of cell wall calcification; 1) calcified primary cell wall (PCW) in the thin-walled elongate cells such as central medullary cells in articulated corallines and hypothallial cells in crustose coralline algae (CCA), 2) calcified secondary cell wall (SCW) with radial Mg-calcite crystals in thicker-walled rounded cortical cells of articulated corallines and perithallial cells of CCA. The distinctive banding found in many rhodoliths is the regular transition from PCW-only cells to SCW cells. Within the cell walls there can be bands of elevated Mg with Mg content of a few mol% higher than radial Mg-calcite (M-type), ranging up to dolomite composition (D-type).We propose the following three-step model for calcification. 1) A thin (< 0. μm) PCW forms and is filled with a mineralising fluid of organic compounds and seawater. Nanometer-scale Mg-calcite grains precipitate on the organic structures within the PCW. 2) Crystalline cellulose microfibrils (CMF) are extruded perpendicularly from the cellulose synthase complexes (CSC) in the plasmalemma to form the SCW. 3) The CMF soaks in the mineralising fluid as it extrudes and becomes calcified, retaining the perpendicular form, thus building the radial calcite. In Clathromorphum, SCW formation lags PCW creating a zone of weakness resulting in a split in the sub-surface crust. All calcification seems likely to be a bioinduced rather than controlled process. These findings are a substantial step forward in understanding how corallines calcify.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108854>Chemical Composition, Antioxidant, and Antimicrobial Activities of  (L.)

A green novel method using an eco-friendly solvent, CO-pressurized ethanol, or carbon dioxide expanded ethanol (CXE) was employed to isolate the essential oil from the root of  (L.)  with the purpose of replacing the traditional method and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). After investigating the major operating factors of CXE, the optimal conditions were obtained as follows: 8.4 MPa, 50 °C,  mL/min ethanol, and 0.22 mole fraction of CO, presenting an extraction oil that ranged from .12% to 7.42%, higher than that of hydrodistillation (HD) or indirect vapor distillation (IVD). The Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that three major components, including valerenol (18.48%), valerenal (10.21%), and β-Cadinene (6.23%), are found in CXE oil, while a total of 23 components were identified, 48 components less than using conventional hydrodistillation. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activities of root oils were evaluated by the microdilution method, which showed that CXE oil exhibited an ability against Gram-positive bacteria, especially , approximately equivalent to traditional samples. Additionally, the DPPH free radical scavenging assay demonstrated that the antioxidant abilities of root oils were sorted in the descending order: IVD > HD > CXE > SFE. In conclusion, after a comprehensive comparison with the conventional methods, the CXE-related technique might be a promising green manufacturing pattern for the production of quality vetiver oil, due to the modification of ethanol by the variable addition of non-polar compressible CO, ultimately resulting in a prominent dissolving capability for the extraction of vetiver solutes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253630>Prognostic Score and Cytogenetic Risk Classification for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients: Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Report.</a></h2><p>To develop a prognostic model and cytogenetic risk classification for previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) undergoing reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes of 606 patients with CLL who underwent RIC allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2014 reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research.On the basis of multivariable models, disease status, comorbidity index, lymphocyte count, and white blood cell count at HCT were selected for the development of prognostic model. Using the prognostic score, we stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk [4-year progression-free survival (PFS) 58%, 42%, 33%, and 25%, respectively,  < 0.0001; 4-year overall survival (OS) 70%, 57%, 54%, and 38%, respectively,  < 0.0001]. We also evaluated karyotypic abnormalities together with del(17p) and found that del(17p) or ≥ abnormalities showed inferior PFS. Using a multivariable model, we classified cytogenetic risk into low, intermediate, and high ( < 0.0001). When the prognostic score and cytogenetic risk were combined, patients with low prognostic score and low cytogenetic risk had prolonged PFS (61% at 4 years) and OS (75% at 4 years).In this large cohort of patients with previously treated CLL who underwent RIC HCT, we developed a robust prognostic scoring system of HCT outcomes and a novel cytogenetic-based risk stratification system. These prognostic models can be used for counseling patients, comparing data across studies, and providing a benchmark for future interventions.

We have assessed the therapeutic effects of digoxin to reduce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () by the clinically relevant oral route in mice and analyzed the cellular basis for this effect with differential involvement of liver cell subsets. C57BL/6J male mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 wk and started concurrently with the gavage of digoxin (2., 0., 0.125 mg/kg twice a week) for  wk. Digoxin significantly reduced HFD-induced hepatic damage, steatosis, and liver inflammation across a wide dosage range. The lowest dose of digoxin (0.125 mg/kg) showed significant protective effects against liver injury and sterile inflammation. Consistently, digoxin attenuated HIF-1α sustained NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. We have reported for the first time that PKM2 is upregulated in hepatocytes with hepatic steatosis, and digoxin directly improved hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction and steatosis. Mechanistically, digoxin directly bound to PKM2 and inhibited PKM2 targeting HIF-1α transactivation without affecting PKM2 enzyme activation. Thus, oral digoxin showed potential to therapeutically inhibit liver injury in  through the regulation of PKM2-HIF-1α pathway activation with involvement of multiple cell types. Because of the large clinical experience with oral digoxin, this may have significant clinical applicability in human . This study is the first to assess the therapeutic efficacy of oral digoxin on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model and to determine the divergent of cell type-specific effects. Oral digoxin reduced liver damage, steatosis, and inflammation in HFD mice. Digoxin attenuated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α axis-sustained inflammasome activity in macrophages and hepatic oxidative stress response in hepatocytes via the regulation of PKM2-HIF-1α axis pathway activation.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been reported to play a pivotal role in fibrosis development during  progression via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. This study aimed to clarify the impact of low-dose LPS challenge on  pathological progression and to establish a novel murine  model. C57BL/6J mice were fed a choline-deficient l-amino-acid-defined (CDAA) diet to induce , and low-dose LPS (0. mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected thrice a week. CDAA-fed mice showed hepatic CD14 overexpression, and low-dose LPS challenge enhanced TLR4/NF-κB signaling activation in the liver of CDAA-fed mice. LPS challenge potentiated CDAA-diet-mediated insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis with upregulated lipogenic genes, and F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration with increased proinflammatory cytokines. It is noteworthy that LPS administration extensively boosted pericellular fibrosis with the activation of hepatic stellate cells in CDAA-fed mice. Exogenous LPS administration exacerbated pericellular fibrosis in CDAA-mediated steatohepatitis in mice.

Iron deposition is also found in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () patients. We have now developed a mouse model of  with hepatic iron deposition by combining a methione- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet with an iron-overload diet. Using this model, we evaluated the effects of human placenta extract (HPE), which has been shown to ameliorate the pathology of . Four-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed the MCD diet with 2% iron for 12 weeks. In liver sections, iron deposition was first detected around the portal vein after 1 week. From there it spread throughout the parenchyma. Biliary iron concentrations were continuously elevated throughout the entire 12-week diet. As a compensatory response, the diet caused elevation of serum hepcidin, which accelerates excretion of iron from the body. Accumulation of F4/80-positive macrophages was detected within the sinusoids from the first week onward, and real-time PCR analysis revealed elevated hepatic expression of genes related inflammation and oxidative stress. In the model mice, HPE treatment led to a marked reduction of hepatic iron deposition with a corresponding increase in biliary iron excretion. Macrophage accumulation was much reduced by HPE treatment, as was the serum oxidation-reduction potential, an index of oxidative stress. These data indicate that by suppressing inflammation, oxidative stress and iron deposition, and enhancing iron excretion, HPE effectively ameliorates iron overload-induced liver injury.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and liver elastography tests, defining the level of liver fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to liver biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis.

We describe the epidemiology of travel-associated CL and MCL among international travelers and immigrants over a 20-year period through descriptive analysis of GeoSentinel data.Demographic and travel-related data on returned international travelers diagnosed with CL or MCL at a GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 1, 1997 and August 31, 2017 were analyzed.Nine-hundred, fifty-five returned travelers or migrants were diagnosed with travel-acquired CL (n=916) or MCL during the study period, of whom 10% (n=97) were migrants. For the 858 non-migrant travelers, common source countries were Bolivia (n=156, 18.2%) and Costa Rica (n=97, 11.3%), while for migrants, they were Syria (n=34, 35%) and Afghanistan (n=22, 22.7%). Ninety-nine travelers (10%) acquired their disease on trips of ≤2 weeks. Of 274 cases for which species identification was available, Leishmania Viannia braziliensis was the most well represented strain (n=117, 42.7%), followed by L. major (n=40, 14.6%), and L. V. panamensis (n=38, 13.9%). Forty cases of MCL occurred, most commonly in tourists (n=29, 72.%) and from Bolivia (n=18, 45%). 10% of MCL cases were acquired in the Old World.Amongst GeoSentinel reporting sites, CL is predominantly a disease of tourists traveling mostly to countries in Central and South America such as Bolivia where risk of acquiring L. V. braziliensis and subsequent MCL is high. The finding that some travelers acquired leishmaniasis on trips of short duration challenges the common notion that CL is a disease of prolonged travel. Migrants from areas of conflict and political instability, such as Afghanistan and Syria, were well represented, suggesting that as mass migration of refugees continues, CL will be increasingly encountered in intake countries.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has evolved into a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Herein, we investigated whether a dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation improves the outcome of progressive NAFLD.Feeding three high-fat diets, differing in n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents and ratios (n-3/n-6: 1:8, 1:1, :1), the impact of n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on NAFLD-related liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis was analyzed in 12- and 20-week-old streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-treated mice.Feeding of n-3 PUFA-rich diets (1:1 and :1) resulted in increased hepatic n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio with decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. In 20-week-old mice, n-3 PUFA-rich diets alleviated tumor load significantly, with reduced liver/body weight index, tumor size, and tumor number. Finally, these effects were accompanied by a significant improvement of survival of these mice.Herein, we showed that increased n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios lead to improved survival and attenuated tumor progression in STZ/HFD-treated mice. Thus, n-3 PUFAs could be the basis for new therapeutic options against NAFLD-related tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038214>Enzyme-mediated hydrogel encapsulation of single cells for high-throughput screening and directed evolution of oxidoreductases.</a></h2><p>Directed evolution of oxidoreductases to improve their catalytic properties is being ardently pursued in the industrial, biotechnological, and biopharma sectors. Hampering this pursuit are current enzyme screening methods that are limited in terms of throughput, cost, time, and complexity. We present a directed evolution strategy that allows for large-scale one-pot screening of glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme libraries in well-mixed homogeneous solution. We used GOx variants displayed on the outer cell wall of yeasts to initiate a cascade reaction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), resulting in peroxidase-mediated phenol cross-coupling and encapsulation of individual cells in well-defined fluorescent alginate hydrogel shells within ~10 min in mixed cell suspensions. Following application of denaturing stress to whole-cell GOx libraries, only cells displaying GOx variants with enhanced stability or catalytic activity were able to carry out the hydrogel encapsulation reaction. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was then used to isolate the enhanced variants. We characterized three of the newly evolved Aspergillus niger GOx enzyme sequences and found up to ~-fold higher specific activity, enhanced thermal stability, and differentiable glycosylation patterns. By coupling intracellular gene expression with the rapid formation of an extracellular hydrogel capsule, our system improves high-throughput screening for directed evolution of H  O  -producing enzymes many folds.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), but there is scarcity of data for lean  subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean .We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven  patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ % weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, /6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ % was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean .© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

The botanical natural product silymarin, which has been investigated as a treatment of , contains flavonolignans that inhibit organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter function. The purpose of this study was to assess the individual and combined effects of  and silymarin on the disposition of the model OATP substrate pitavastatin. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a control or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet ( model) for 8 weeks. Silymarin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle followed by pitavastatin (0. mg/kg) were administered intravenously, and the pharmacokinetics were determined.  increased mean total flavonolignan area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 1.7-fold. Silymarin increased pitavastatin AUC in both control and  animals approx. 2-fold.  increased pitavastatin plasma concentrations from 2 to 40 minutes, but AUC was unchanged. The combination of silymarin and  had the greatest effect on pitavastatin AUC, which increased 2.9-fold compared with control vehicle-treated animals.  increased the total amount of pitavastatin excreted into the bile 2.7-fold compared with control animals, whereas silymarin decreased pitavastatin biliary clearance approx. 3-fold in both control and  animals. This double hit of  and silymarin on hepatic uptake transporters is another example of a multifactorial pharmacokinetic interaction that may have a greater impact on drug disposition than each hit alone. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Multifactorial effects on xenobiotic pharmacokinetics are within the next frontier for precision medicine research and clinical application. The combination of silymarin and  is a probable clinical scenario that can affect drug uptake, liver concentrations, biliary elimination, and ultimately, efficacy and toxicity.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497990>Characteristics and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver.</a></h2><p>the characteristics, screening, and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients without cirrhosis have not been fully studied.A retrospective cohort study was performed in non-cirrhotic patients with histological HCC, between January 2004 and October 2018.
