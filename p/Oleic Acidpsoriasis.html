Transdermal drug delivery is hypothesized as an alternative to conventional therapies to alleviate its adverse effects. In our study, MTX was entrapped in deformable liposomes and loaded in a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel. This system was evaluated by the Box Behnken statistical design for optimization. The effect of formulation variables on particle size, entrapment and ex vivo skin permeation was studied. The MTX nanogel was evaluated for its dermal toxicity (acute and repeat dose safety), in vivo biodistribution (using I radio-labelled MTX) and therapeutic efficacy (collagen induced arthritis [CIA] model). The optimized formulation demonstrated appreciable nanosize (110 ± 20 nm), drug entrapment (42 ± 1.9%) and high ex vivo transdermal flux (17.37 ± 1.5 μg/cm2/hr). In the dermal toxicity studies, nanogel formulation did not show any signs of irritation or toxicity, whereas in the biodistribution study, the MTX nanogel formulation depicted sustained systemic delivery up to 48 h with low accumulation in its organs of toxicity such as the liver, kidneys and gut. In the CIA model, the MTX nanogel significantly ameliorated hind paw swelling, reduced arthritic score, joint damage (histological, radiological examination) and attenuated the rise in serum cytokines such as TNF-ɑ and IL-6. In conclusion, the optimized MTX nanogel formulation displayed skin biocompatibility, sustained systemic delivery, safety as well as therapeutic efficacy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Pseudo ternary phase diagrams were constructed using different combinations of surfactant and co-surfactants to study the microemulsion existence range. Different compositions were selected from the phase diagram showing maximum microemulsion region and were converted into NLCs by dilution in water (1:20). The optimized formulation was characterised for droplet size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and morphology was studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy. Ex vivo permeation studies were carried out using Wistar rat skin. The potential of this formulation in treating psoriatic inflammation was studied using imiquimod induced skin inflammation animal model.The optimized formulation (F4) has droplet size of 163.2±0.522 nm, zeta potential - 0.086±0.099 mV and entrapment efficiency of 60.0±0.187%. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed spherical shape of nanostructured lipid carrier. Carbopol 940 was used to convert NLC dispersion into NLC based hydrogel to improve its viscosity for topical administration. Drug permeation studies showed prolonged drug release from the NLC based gel as compared to marketed formulation following Higuchi release kinetics. The skin deposition of MF loaded NLC based hydrogel was found to 2.5 fold higher than marketed formulation with primary skin irritation index of 0.20. In vivo studies showed complete clearance of parakeratosis by treatment with the prepared NLC formulation. Accelerated stability studies signify high robustness scale of optimized formulation under one month storage period.The prepared NLC based formulation has proved to be a promising carrier system for the treatment of .Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29132974>Topical electrophilic nitro-fatty acids potentiate cutaneous inflammation.</a></h1><p>Endogenous electrophilic fatty acids mediate anti-inflammatory responses by modulating metabolic and inflammatory signal transduction and gene expression. Nitro-fatty acids and other electrophilic fatty acids may thus be useful for the prevention and treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory skin disorders. In this regard, subcutaneous (SC) injections of nitro  (OA-NO), an exemplary nitro-fatty , inhibit skin inflammation in a model of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Given the nitration of unsaturated fatty acids during metabolic and inflammatory processes and the growing use of fatty acids in topical formulations, we sought to further study the effect of nitro-fatty acids on cutaneous inflammation. To accomplish this, the effect of topically applied OA-NO on skin inflammation was evaluated using established murine models of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). In contrast to the effects of subcutaneously injected OA-NO, topical OA-NO potentiated hapten-dependent inflammation inducing a sustained neutrophil-dependent inflammatory response characterized by psoriasiform histological features, increased angiogenesis, and an inflammatory infiltrate that included neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and γδ T cells. Consistent with these results, HPLC-MS/MS analysis of skin from  patients displayed a 56% increase in nitro-conjugated linoleic  (CLA-NO) levels in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin. These results suggest that nitro-fatty acids in the skin microenvironment are products of cutaneous inflammatory responses and, in high local concentrations, may exacerbate inflammatory skin diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Several side effects associated with chronic application of corticosteroids limit its uses. Hence, there is a need to find a safe and effective alternative agent for  treatment.The study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of petroleum ether extract of Annona squamosa seeds (ASO) as an antipsoriatic agent. The toxicity profile of ASO and its effect on -induced inflammation has also been determined.Physicochemical characterization was performed to determine constituents of ASO. Anti-proliferative activity of ASO was studied by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay using HaCaT cell lines. Oxazolone-induced  in female Balb/C mice was used as an animal model for investigating in vivoefficacy of ASO. Inflammatory markers were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of mice ears. Safety profile of ASO was confirmed by performing acute dose dermal toxicity and repeated dose dermal toxicity testing.Predominant presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids viz. linoleic  and  in ASO was confirmed by H NMR, C NMR and GC-MS analysis. The petroleum ether extract of Annona squamosa seeds showed inhibition of cell proliferation of keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). The growth inhibitory property of ASO was significantly higher than that was observed in presence of corticosteroid, clobetasol propionaste (CP). Application of ASO to the ears of Balb/C mice with oxazolone induced  showed marked reduction in erythema and edema, which was comparable to treatment with 0.05% CP cream. The increased levels of cytokines IL6, IL17, TNF-α, INF-γ, GMCSF, and infiltration of CD4 T cells observed in  lesions were decreased upon application of ASO. Acute and repeated dermal toxicity studies of ASO did not reveal any adverse events affirming the safety of ASO.The present data has demonstrated that ASO is a safe and effective anti-psoriatic agent when tested in animal models. The efficacy of ASO in preclinical studies could further be exploited for the development of potential novel topical antipsoriatic agent for therapy in humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The present investigation was focused to evaluate the antipsoriatic activity of V. anthelmintica fruit extracts and fractions.Ointment containing dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) extracts at topical dose of 2.5% and 5% (w/w) was evaluated using mouse tail model of . Bioactivity-guided fractionation (F-F) of most active extract was carried out and fractions were again subjected to mouse tail model. Further the activity of bioactive fraction was confirmed in HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell line using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and its chemical characterization was done via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The dichloromethane extract (5%, w/w) showed statistically significant (* p < 0.05) antipsoriatic activity (66.97 ± 2.68%) with respect to control (25.45 ± 1.80%) and equivalent to that of the standard drug, retino-A 0.05%, (72.47 ± 2.14%) in terms of degree of orthokeratosis, whereas methanol extract (5%, w/w) showed significant (* p < 0.05) differentiation (45.86 ± 2.02%) in comparison to the control group. Out of all fractions, F showed statistically significant (* p < 0.05) antipsoriatic activity (69.27 ± 2.76%) with respect to control and equivalent to that of the standard. F (15.6-1000 µg/ml) showed dose-dependent inhibition of HaCaT cell lines proliferation which suggests keratinocyte modulating activity of V. anthelmintica. Chemical characterization of F revealed that essential fatty acids (i.e., linoleic , palmitic ,  and stearic ) formed the bulk of bioactive fraction.Ameliorative effect of V. anthelmintica in  might be attributed to the presence of essential fatty acids and thus corroborates its traditional use in the treatment of skin ailments.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lipidic nanoparticles were prepared by solvent diffusion method and were characterized for average particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency. TEM photomicrographs revealed that the particles were nanometric in size. Higher amount of CAP can be encapsulated in the NLCs (87.4 ± 3.28) as compared with SLNs (79.7 ± 2.93%). The cumulative amounts of CAP permeated through the skin and retained in the SC were higher in the case of NLCs as compared with plain drug solution and SLNs. SLNs and NLCs exhibited minimum to no irritation. All the results concluded that NLCs and SLNs have shown a good ability to increase drug accumulation in the various skin layers but NLCs may be a more potential carrier for topical delivery of CAP for an effective therapy of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28506203>Optimization of Microemulsion Based Transdermal Gel of Triamcinolone.</a></h1><p>Triamcinolone is a long acting corticosteroid used in the treatment of arthritis, eczema,  and similar conditions which cause inflammation. Triamcinolone has half-life of 88min. Prolonged oral use is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects as peptic ulcer, abdominal distention and ulcerative esophagitis as described in various patents. Microemulgel offers advantage of better stability, better loading capacity and controlled release especially for drug with short half life.Objective of the present study was to optimize microemulgel based transdermal delivery of triamcinolone.Saturated solubility of triamcinolone in various oils, surfactants and co-surfactants is estimated. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the region of transparent microemulsion. Microemulsion was evaluated for globule size (FE-SEM, zetasizer), % transmittance, pH, viscosity, conductivity etc. Design of experiment was used to optimize microemulsion based gel. Carbopol 971P and HPMC K100M were used as independent variables. Microemulsion based gel was evaluated for in-vitro as well as ex-vivo parameters.Microemulsion was formulated with , lauroglycol FCC and propylene glycol. PDI 0.197 indicated microemulsion is mono-disperse. 32 factorial design gave batch F8 as optimized. Design expert suggested drug release; gel viscosity and bio-adhesive strength were three significant dependant factors affecting the transdermal delivery. F8 showed drug release 92.62.16±1.22% through egg membrane, 95.23±1.44% through goat skin after 8hr and Korsmeyer-Peppas release model was followed.It can be concluded that a stable, effective controlled release transdermal microemulgel was optimised for triamcinolone. This would be a promising tool to deliver triamcinolone with enhanced bioavailability and reduced dosing frequency.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214608>Free fatty acids sensitize dendritic cells to amplify TH1/TH17-immune responses.</a></h1><p>Obesity is associated with body fat gain and impaired glucose metabolism. Here, we identified both body fat gain in obesity and impaired glucose metabolism as two independent risk factors for increased serum levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Since obesity is associated with increased and/or delayed resolution of inflammation observed in various chronic inflammatory diseases such as , we investigated the impact of FFAs on human monocyte-derived and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (DCs) functions relevant for the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. FFAs such as palmitic  (PA) and  (OA) did not affect the pro-inflammatory immune response of DCs. In contrast, PA and OA sensitize DCs resulting in augmented secretion of TH1/TH17-instructive cytokines upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Interestingly, obesity in mice worsened a TH1/TH17-driven -like skin inflammation. Strong correlation of the amount of total FFA, PA, and OA in serum with the severity of skin inflammation points to a critical role of FFA in obesity-mediated exacerbation of skin inflammation. Our data suggest that increased levels of FFAs might be a predisposing factor promoting a TH1/TH17-mediated inflammation such as  in response to an inflammatory danger signal.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Its mild-to-moderate form, representing approximately 80% of the total cases, is treated by topical application, with corticosteroid being the standard treatment. However, in case of , no single treatment works for every patient and optimizing topical therapy is a key aspect. A possible alternative is represented by cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant cyclic peptide administered orally in the treatment of the severe form. Its topical application could avoid the problems related to systemic immunosuppression, but the unfavourable physico-chemical properties (MW: 1202 Da; LogP ≈ 3) hinder its permeation across the stratum corneum. The aim of the paper was the preparation, characterization and ex-vivo evaluation of cyclosporine loaded microemulsions using  as oil phase, either Tween80 or a soluble derivative of vitamin E (TPGS) as surfactants and either Transcutol, propylene glycol or 1,3 propanediol as co-surfactants. The issue of formulation viscosity was also addressed 1) by evaluating the thickening of Tween80-based microemulsions by direct addition of different rheological modifiers, 2) by building pseudo-ternary phase diagrams using TPGS, to identify the water/oil/surfactants proportions resulting in viscous self-gelifying systems. Nine formulations (five Tween80-based and four TPGS-based) were selected, characterized in terms of droplets size (low viscosity systems) or rheological properties (high viscosity systems), loaded with 6 mg/g cyclosporine and applied ex-vivo on porcine skin for 22 h. A relevant skin accumulation was obtained either with a low-viscosity Tween80-based microemulsion (9.78 ± 3.86 µg/cm), or with a high viscosity TPGS-based microemulsion (18.3 ± 5.69 µg/cm), with an increase of about 3 and 6 times respectively for comparison with a control cyclosporine solution in propylene glycol. The role of water content, surfactant, co-surfactant and viscosity was also addressed and discussed. The kinetic of skin uptake from the best performing formulation was finally evaluated, highlighting a relatively quick skin uptake and the achievement, after 2 h of contact, of potentially therapeutic cyclosporine skin concentrations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, difficulties related to administration and body distribution limit the clinical use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. In this study, we proposed to use nanocarriers to enable siRNA application in the topical treatment of skin disorders. A siRNA nanodispersion based on liquid crystalline phase and composed of monoolein (MO),  (OA) and polyethylenimine (PEI) was developed and its physicochemical properties, efficiency of complexation and carrier/siRNA stability were assessed. Subsequently, cell viability, cellular uptake, in vitro skin irritation test using reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) and in vitro IL-6 knockdown in  skin model were evaluated. The results showed that the liquid crystalline nanodispersion is a promising topical delivery system for administration of siRNA, being able to overcome the limitations of the route of administration, as well those resulting from the characteristics of siRNA molecules. The formulation was effective at complexing the siRNA, presented high rate of cell uptake (∼90%), increased the skin penetration of siRNA in vitro, and did not cause skin irritation compared with Triton-X (a moderate irritant), resulting in a 4-fold higher viability of reconstructed human epidermis and a 15.6-fold lower release of IL-1α. A single treatment with the liquid crystalline nanodispersion carrying IL-6 siRNA for 6h was able to reduce the extracellular IL-6 levels by 3.3-fold compared with control treatment in  skin model. Therefore, liquid crystalline nanodispersion is a suitable nanocarrier for siRNA with therapeutic potential to suppress skin disease-specific genes. This study also highlights the applicability of reconstructed skin models in pharmaceutical field to evaluate the performance of delivery systems without the use of animal models.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effectiveness and sub-acute toxicity of these topical formulations were investigated in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced  in a mouse model (IMQP). The particle sizes of formulations were around 100 nm with a mean zeta potential of -72.87 mV. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of MTX in liposomal formulations were more than 85%. Franz cell permeability studies indicated that permeation of MTX through the healthy BALB/c mice skin is very low; however, in the inflammatory skin, which was induced by IMQ it was significant (50%). Liposomal MTX (LM 0.05 and 0.1%) caused significant reduction of thickness score dose-dependently in IMQP compared to the injected MTX. Moreover, investigation of the inflammatory factor and pathological examinations of skin proved the superiority of the LM treating group. Pathological examinations also showed there are no toxicity in organs of the mice that received the LM. Blood cell count test didn't show any abnormality. MTX-entrapped deformable liposomes could be a topical option in future for the treatment of human  with a less toxicity and merit further investigations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to identify and visualize the metabolic data clusters.A total of 22 differential metabolites contributing to the clusters were identified, among which the levels of threonine (p<0.001), leucine (p<0.001), phenylalanine (p<0.001), tryptophan (p=0.018), palmitamide (p<0.001), Linoleic amide (p<0.001), oleamide (p<0.001), stearamide (p<0.001), cis-11- eicosenamide (p< 0.001), trans-13-Docosenamide (p<0.001), uric  (p=0.034), LysoPC (16:0) (p<0.001), LysoPC (18:3) (p<0.001), LysoPC (18:2) (p=0.024), LysoPC (18:1) (P=0.012) and LysoPC (18:0) (p=0.002) were significantly higher in the plasma of  vulgaris patients compared with the healthy controls, whereas  (p<0.001), arachidonic  (p<0.001) and N-linoleoyl taurine (p<0.001) were significantly lower. These biomarkers are related to glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino  metabolism, nucleic  metabolism and so on.The data suggest that  vulgaris patients may have disrupted lipid and amino  metabolism, as well as inflammation and functional lesions in the liver and kidney.

Combinatorial agents are anticipated to offer an advanced strategy for efficient therapy. We prepared cilomilast-loaded  (OA) nanocarriers to test the inhibitory capability against human neutrophil stimulation and a murine  model. OA played dual roles in the nanocarriers as both the active ingredient and lipid matrix in the nanoparticulate core. OA nanoparticles but not free OA could restrain calcium mobilization in activated neutrophils. The inhibition level of superoxide anion and elastase by cilomilast-loaded OA nanocarriers approximated that of free forms. In the mouse model, the intradermal nanosystems reduced imiquimod-induced epidermal thickening from 230.4 to 63.1 μm. Transepidermal water loss was decreased from 30.2 to 11.3 g/m/h by integrated nanocarriers. The nanosystems mitigated neutrophil infiltration and hyperproliferation in the psoriasiform lesion via decreased expression of cytokines and chemokines. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The long-term therapy for  is unsatisfactory due to the possible adverse effects and inefficiency after prolonged use. Both phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibitors and omega-9 fatty acids such as  (OA) show anti-inflammatory activity for treating inflamed skin diseases. Combinatorial agents are anticipated to offer an advanced strategy for efficient therapy. OA is also ideal for incorporation into nanoparticles to enhance particulate emulsification, drug entrapment, and biocompatibility. We prepared cilomilast-loaded  (OA) nanocarriers to test the inhibitory capability against human neutrophil stimulation and a murine  lesion. OA nanocarriers are indigenous to prevent neutrophil activation and the deterioration of psoriatic lesion. Cilomilast incorporation in OA nanocarriers could further mitigate the clinical score and suppressing proinflammatory mediators.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
