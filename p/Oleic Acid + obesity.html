For acetaminophen (APAP), a role of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is suspected since the activity of this enzyme is consistently enhanced during NAFLD. The first aim of our study was to set up a cellular model of NAFLD characterized not only by triglyceride accumulation but also by higher CYP2E1 activity. To this end, human HepaRG cells were incubated for one week with stearic  or , in the presence of different concentrations of insulin. Although cellular triglycerides and the expression of lipid-responsive genes were similar with both fatty acids, CYP2E1 activity was significantly increased only by stearic . CYP2E1 activity was reduced by insulin and this effect was reproduced in cultured primary human hepatocytes. Next, APAP cytotoxicity was assessed in HepaRG cells with or without lipid accretion and CYP2E1 induction. Experiments with a large range of APAP concentrations showed that the loss of ATP and glutathione was almost always greater in the presence of stearic . In cells pretreated with the CYP2E1 inhibitor chlormethiazole, recovery of ATP was significantly higher in the presence of stearate with low (2.5mM) or high (20mM) concentrations of APAP. Levels of APAP-glucuronide were significantly enhanced by insulin. Hence, HepaRG cells can be used as a valuable model of NAFLD to unveil important metabolic and hormonal factors which can increase susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592064>The Lentiviral System Construction for Highly Expressed Porcine Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase-1 and Functional Characterization in Stably Transduced Porcine Swine Kidney Cells.</a></h2><p>The most highly regulated and abundant fatty  in animal tissue is  (18:1n9).  is synthesized by the Δ9 desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which is responsible for the synthesis of the putative cytokine palmitoleic  (16:1n7) and 18:2 cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic .

The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for NAFLD is of recent interest. Because primary de novo lipogenesis occurs in chicken liver as in human liver, adult chickens with age-associated steatosis resembling human NAFLD is an appealing animal model. The objective of this study was to screen potential biomarkers in the chicken model for NAFLD by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Hy-Line W-36 laying hens were fed standard feed from 25 to 45 wk of age to induce fatty liver. They were killed every 4 wk, and liver and plasma were collected at each time point to assess fatty liver development and for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Next, selected biomarkers were confirmed in additional experiments by providing supplements of the hepatoprotective nutrients betaine [300, 600, or 900 parts per million (ppm) in vivo; 2 mM in vitro] or docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) to 30-wk-old Hy-Line W-36 laying hens for 4 mo and to Hy-Line W-36 chicken primary hepatocytes with -induced steatosis. Liver or hepatocyte lipid contents and the expression of biomarkers were then examined. Plasma acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), glutamine synthetase (GLUL), and glutathione -transferase (GST) concentrations are well-established biomarkers for NAFLD. Selected biomarkers had significant positive associations with hepatic lipid deposition ( < 0.001). Betaine (900 ppm in vivo; 2 mM in vitro) and DHA (1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) supplementation both resulted in lower steatosis accompanied by the reduced expression of selected biomarkers in vivo and in vitro ( < 0.05). This study used adult laying hens to identify biomarkers for NAFLD and indicated that AACS, DPP4, GLUL, and GST could be considered to be potential diagnostic indicators for NAFLD in the future.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28389247>-derived oleoylethanolamide: A nutritional science perspective.</a></h2><p>The fatty  ethanolamide oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator derived from the monounsaturated fatty , .

However, previous epidemiological studies on the association between TFAs, based primarily on self-reported intake from the diet, and diabetes in humans have yielded conflicting results. Herein we examined the associations of objectively measured plasma TFA concentrations with diabetes in a large population-based study among US adults.We included 3801 participants aged ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2009-10. Four major TFAs, namely palmitelaidic  (C16:1 n-7t), elaidic  (C18:1 n-9t), vaccenic  (C18:1 n-7t), and linolelaidic  (C18:2 n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Diabetes was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis, plasma fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quintile of plasma TFAs was 2.19 (1.27-3.79) for total TFAs (P  = 0.01), 2.34 (1.48-3.72) for elaidic  (P  = 0.0004), 1.33 (0.82-2.15) for linolelaidic  (P  = 0.18), 1.58 (0.97-2.58) for palmitelaidic  (P  = 0.02), and 1.64 (0.95-2.84) for vaccenic  (P  = 0.08). In addition, total TFAs, elaidic , palmitelaidic , and vaccenic  were significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the insulin resistance index, and HbA1c.In a nationally representative population, plasma TFAs, in particular elaidic , were positively associated with diabetes and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545039>Extra Virgin Olive Oil Minor Compounds Modulate Mitogenic Action of  on Colon Cancer Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Experimental and clinical findings suggest that olive oil has a protective effect, whereas  consumption induces colorectal cancer (CRC). Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty acids, mainly  and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that  (1-100 μM) but not elaidic  induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic  (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by . These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic  that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the arachidonic  cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action.

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of glycine remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that glycine regulates adipocyte differentiation, adipogenesis, and lipolysis, therefore, contributing to white-fat reduction. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were induced to differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of glycine (0, 0.25, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L) or resveratrol (50 or 100 μmol/L, served as a positive control) during the differentiation process. Hela and HepG2 cells cultured with  to induce lipid accumulation in the presence of glycine (0, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L) or 10 μmol/L isoproterenol (served as a positive control) for 24 h. Intracellular lipid accumulation, intracellular triglycerides, lipid droplets' diameters of mature adipocytes, mRNA, and protein levels of genes involved in the adipogenesis and lipolysis were analyzed. Isobutylxanthine-dexamethasone-insulin (MDI)-induced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells were blocked by resveratrol, but not by glycine, as shown by decreased lipid contents, reduced diameters of lipid droplets, decreased protein abundances for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), as well as increased protein abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), critical transcriptional factors that regulates adipogenesis. However, the mRNA levels of adiponectin and interleukin-10 (IL-10), two adipose-derived adipocytokines with anti-inflammatory effects, were greatly enhanced (P < 0.05) by 2 mmol/L glycine. Compared with non-treated controls, 10 μmol/L isoproterenol significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the intracellular lipid and triglyceride contents induced by  in Hela and HepG2 cells. mRNA level of fatty  synthase (FASN), a gene involved in fatty  synthesis, was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), while that for ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), genes involved in lipolysis were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) by isoproterenol. However,  induced the accumulation of intracellular triglyceride and lipid contents were not affected by glycine. In conclusion, glycine exposure enhanced the mRNA levels of adipose-derived adiponectin and IL-10 without affecting adipogenesis and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings provide a possible explanation for the anti- and anti-diabetic effects of glycine that were previously reported in animal models. More studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for this regulatory effect of glycine on anti-inflammatory adipocytokines expression in both in vitro and in vivo models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30235452>Fisetin Protects Against Hepatic Steatosis Through Regulation of the Sirt1/AMPK and Fatty  β-Oxidation Signaling Pathway in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Fisetin is a naturally abundant flavonoid isolated from various fruits and vegetables that was recently identified to have potential biological functions in improving allergic airway inflammation, as well as anti-oxidative and anti-tumor properties. Fisetin has also been demonstrated to have anti- properties in mice. However, the effect of fisetin on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still elusive. Thus, the present study evaluated whether fisetin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and regulates lipid metabolism of FL83B hepatocytes in vitro.NAFLD was induced by HFD in male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with fisetin for 10 weeks. In another experiment, FL83B cells were challenged with  to induce lipid accumulation and treated with various concentrations of fisetin.NAFLD mice treated with fisetin had decreased body weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight compared to NAFLD mice. Fisetin treatment also reduced liver lipid droplet and hepatocyte steatosis, alleviated serum free fatty , and leptin concentrations, significantly decreased fatty  synthase, and significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα and the production of sirt-1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the liver tissue. In vitro, fisetin decreased lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.This study suggests that fisetin is a potential novel treatment for alleviating hepatic lipid metabolism and improving NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK and β-oxidation pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

Enhanced incretin release may have beneficial metabolic effects. However, dietary fat may promote weight gain and should therefore be restricted in . We designed C4-dietary oil (1,3-di-butyryl-2-oleoyl glycerol) as a 2-oleoyl glycerol (2-OG)-generating fat type, which would stimulate incretin release to the same extent while providing less calories than equimolar amounts of common triglycerides, e.g., olive oil.We studied the effect over 180 min of (a) 19 g olive oil plus 200 g carrot, (b) 10.7 g C4 dietary oil plus 200 g carrot and (c) 200 g carrot, respectively, on plasma responses of gut and pancreatic hormones in 13 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Theoretically, both oil meals result in formation of 7.7 g 2-OG during digestion.Both olive oil and C4-dietary oil resulted in greater postprandial (P ≤ 0.01) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses (incremental area under curve (iAUC)): iAUC: 645 ± 194 and 702 ± 97 pM × min; iAUC: 4,338 ± 764 and 2,894 ± 601 pM × min) compared to the carrot meal (iAUC: 7 ± 103 pM × min; iAUC: 266 ± 234 pM × min). iAUC for GLP-1 and GIP were similar for C4-dietary oil and olive oil, although olive oil resulted in a higher peak value for GIP than C4-dietary oil.C4-dietary oil enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP to almost the same extent as olive oil, in spite of liberation of both 2-OG and , which also may stimulate incretin secretion, from olive oil. Thus, C4-dietary oil is more effective as incretin releaser than olive oil per unit of energy and may be useful for dietary intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27745558>Higher membrane fluidity mediates the increased subcutaneous fatty  content in pigs fed reduced protein diets.</a></h2><p>The production of pork with moderate amounts of intramuscular fat (IMF) without an increase in subcutaneous fat is highly desirable for the meat industry. Several studies indicate that dietary protein reduction during the growing-finishing period of pigs enhances IMF content, but its consequence on carcass fat deposition is still contradictory. In this study, we hypothesized that the effects of reduced protein diets (RPD), corrected or not with the limiting amino  lysine, on subcutaneous fat deposition from pigs with distinct genotypes are mediated by adipose membranes biophysical properties. In total, 36 crossbred (Large White×Landrace×Pietrain - a lean genotype) and purebred (Alentejana breed - a fatty genotype) male pigs were randomly assigned to the control group, the RPD group or the reduced protein diet equilibrated for lysine (RPDL) group, allowing a 2×3 factorial arrangement (n=6). Backfat thickness and total fatty  content were higher in Alentejana relative to crossbred pigs. Although dietary treatments did not change backfat thickness, RPD and RPDL increased total fatty acids content of subcutaneous fat. In order to understand this effect, adipose tissue membranes isolated from pig's subcutaneous fat were assayed for glycerol permeability and fluidity, using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-(4-(trimethylamino)-phenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) probes. The glycerol transport across adipose membranes was not mediated by aquaglyceroporins and remained unchanged across dietary groups. Regardless of lysine correction, RPD increased membrane fluidity at the hydrocarbon region (lower DPH fluorescence anisotropy) in both genotypes of pigs. This result was associated with a lower ratio between  and linoleic  on membrane's fatty  composition. Adipose membrane's cholesterol content was independent from genotype and diet. Taken together, the present study shows that dietary protein reduction is successful in maintaining backfat thickness, although a negative side effect was observed on total fatty acids in subcutaneous fat, which may be due to changes in the fluidity of adipose membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769284>Electrophilic nitro- reverses -induced hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to  and insulin resistance and is the most prevalent chronic liver disease. During the development of  and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty  oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than weight loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver weight and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by , without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recently, other positional and geometrical MUFA isomers belonging to the hexadecenoic family (C16 MUFA) were found in circulating lipids, such as sapienic  (6cis-16:1), palmitelaidic  (9trans-16:1) and 6trans-16:1. In this work we report: i) the identification of sapienic  as component of human erythrocyte membrane phospholipids with significant increase in morbidly obese patients (n = 50) compared with age-matched lean controls (n = 50); and ii) the first comparison of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids (PL) and plasma cholesteryl esters (CE) in morbidly obese patients highlighting that some of their fatty  levels have opposite trends: increases of both palmitic and sapienic acids with the decrease of linoleic  (9cis,12cis-18:2, omega-6) in red blood cell (RBC) membrane PL were reversed in plasma CE, whereas the increase of palmitoleic  was similar in both lipid species. Consequentially, desaturase enzymatic indexes gave different results, depending on the lipid class used for the fatty  content. The fatty  profile of morbidly obese subjects also showed significant increases of stearic  (C18:0) and C20 omega-6, as well as decreases of  (9cis-18:1) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 omega-3) as compared with lean healthy controls. Trans monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were also measured and found significantly increased in both lipid classes of morbidly obese subjects. These results highlight the C16 MUFA isomers as emerging metabolic marker provided that the assignment of the double bond position and geometry is correctly performed, thus identifying the corresponding lipidomic pathway. Since RBC membrane PL and plasma CE have different fatty  trends, caution must also be used in the choice of lipid species for the interpretation of lipidomic profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008091>The Association between Dietary Fat Pattern and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Despite several studies examining single dietary fats on type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, little is known about the effects of multiple fatty acids on the risk of T2D.

Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, , linoleic , linolenic , and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary total fat intake hazard ratio [HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77~2.23 and HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.27~1.76, in the second and third tertile, respectively] was not related to the development of T2D. Animal- and plant-based dietary fat intakes were additionally not related to the risk of T2D. After adjustment for confounding variables, there was no significant association between dietary fat pattern score and T2D incidence.

Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue weight and lipid droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of lipogenesis and fatty  synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty  chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.

Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis.

One hyperglycemic remedy is reduction of glucose absorption performed by suppressing digestion of carbohydrates and lipids through the use of inhibitors. Phalaris canariensis (P canariensis) is a species belonging to the Graminaceae family and is used in traditional medicine in Mexico for treatment of diabetes and .The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of different extracts of the seeds of P canariensis on enzymes metabolizing fat and carbohydrates, obtained using 3 solvents.The seeds of P canariensis were extracted using hexane (ALH), chloroform (ALC), and methanol (ALM) and were investigated for their antiobesity potential.This research was conducted in the Laboratory of Research of Natural Products in the School of Chemical Engineering at the National Polytechnic Institute and in the Research Laboratory of Enzymology in the National School of Biological Sciences.Different concentrations of the extracts were used to study the inhibition of enzymatic activity by porcine pancreatic α-amylase, with carbose as a positive control. The inhibitory activity of α-glucosidase was determined using the standard method with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Pancreatic lipase (PL) activity was measured by absorbance at 412 nm, and the data obtained were compared with orlistat. The PL activity was assessed using a second method measuring the rate of release of  from triolein. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was measured by released (3H)-. Lipolytic activity in cultured, mouse, 3T3-Ll adipocytes was used as a measure of hormone-sensitive lipase activity. The inhibitory activity of rat intestinal sucrase was determined by measuring the glucose released. A Caco-2 cell assay determined the content of free glucose.The ALH extract of P canariensis showed potent inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 2.13 and 1.25 mg/mL as compared with α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively, and produced inhibition in rat intestinal sucrose. Further, the ALM extract showed significantly inhibitory effects against PL, LPL, and lipolysis of 3T3-LI adipocytes.The results provide evidence for the effects of the seeds of P canariensis for a retarded absorption of carbohydrates and lipids through the inhibition of enzymes that are related to  and diabetes mellitus type 2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130822>High-fat diet-dependent modulation of the delayed rectifier K(+) current in adult guinea pig atrial myocytes.</a></h2><p> is associated with hyperlipidemia, electrical remodeling of the heart, and increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmias in both male and female patients. The delayed rectifier K(+) current (IK), is an important regulator of atrial repolarization. There is a paucity of studies on the functional role of IK in response to . Here, we assessed the -mediated functional modulation of IK in low-fat diet (LFD), and high-fat diet (HFD) fed adult guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were randomly divided into control and obese groups fed, ad libitum, with a LFD (10 kcal% fat) or a HFD (45 kcal% fat) respectively. Action potential duration (APD), and IK were studied in atrial myocytes and IKr and IKs in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. HFD guinea pigs displayed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol and total triglycerides within 50 days. Atrial APD at 30% (APD30) and 90% (APD90) repolarization were shorter, while atrial IK density was significantly increased in HFD guinea pigs. Exposure to palmitic  (PA) increased heterologously expressed IKr and IKs densities, while  (OA), severely reduced IKr and had no effect on IKs. The data are first to show that in obese guinea pigs abbreviated APD is due to increased IK density likely through elevations of PA. Our findings may have crucial implications for targeted treatment options for -related arrhythmias.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26989489>A single oral dose of a polyglucosamine influences the bioavailability of [9-(14)C]- in adult female Göttingen minipigs.</a></h2><p>Worldwide  has nearly doubled since 1980 and is a leading risk for global deaths, profoundly affecting morbidity, mortality, health-care costs, and professional and personal quality of life. Treatment of  and its consequences include lifestyle intervention, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Polyglucosamines have been proposed as an alternative strategy for treating , by reducing the amount of absorbed fat through interaction with dietary fat through various mechanisms. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of polyglucosamine on the bioavailability of the model compound [9-(14)C]- in female Göttingen minipigs.The study consisted of two treatment groups, each consisting of six adult female Göttingen minipigs with a catheterized vena jugularis to enable frequent blood sampling. One group served as the untreated group (control) and the other group was pre-treated with 2 tablets of 500 mg formoline L112. After 30 min, all animals were dosed orally with [9-(14)C]-. Excreta and blood samples were collected for analysis of radioactivity from 48 h pre-dose up to 144 h post-dosing. At sacrifice, the liver and contents of the gastrointestinal tract were collected for radioanalysis.Upon treatment with polyglucosamine (formoline L112), the Tmax of [(14)C]- in plasma was shifted from 4 to 16 h, and the Cmax decreased significantly from 14.1 μg/g to 3.3 μg/g. In addition, upon treatment with polyglucosamine the internal exposure to [(14)C]- as reflected by the area under the curve during the 0-12 h post-dose time interval (AUC0-12h), is significantly decreased to 32.9 % of the plasma value of [(14)C]- in untreated animals. Even up to 24 h post-dose, the AUC0-24h is significantly decreased to 50.7 % of the plasma value in untreated animals and this significant effect is prolonged up to 60 h post-dose.This study shows that treatment with polyglucosamine (formoline L112) reduces (as judged by Cmax & AUC) and delays (as judged by Tmax) fat absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation and limits peak exposure to free fatty acids which may contribute to a more beneficial condition in overweight humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413241>Elaeagnus mollis Oil Attenuates Non-alcoholic Fatty Disease in High-fat Diet Induced Obese Mice via Modifying the Expression of Lipid Metabolismrelated Genes.</a></h2><p>Elaeagnus mollis oil (EMO), which is a type of plant oil, was extracted from the nuts of Elaeagnus mollis Diels that is known as a precious woodyoilcrop in China. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%),  (34.20%) and linolenic  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight, fat weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high-fat diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30228616>Good Fats versus Bad Fats: A Comparison of Fatty Acids in the Promotion of Insulin Resistance, Inflammation, and .</a></h2><p>Recently, debate has erupted in both the scientific community and throughout the lay public around whether a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet is better for weight loss. In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for weight loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, inflammation, and . The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (, found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly palmitic  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to , whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective. Importantly, both olive oil as part of a Mediterranean diet, and omega-3 from fish and fish oil have been proven to reduce risk of cardiovascular (CV) events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113798>Fucoxanthin attenuates fatty -induced lipid accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes through regulated Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>The fucoxanthin, isolated from brown algae, was reported to have multiple biological functions to anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and ameliorated  in mice. In this study we investigated whether fucoxanthin could inhibit lipids accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes. FL83B cells were induced as fatty liver cell model by 0.5 mM  for 48 h, and treated with various concentration of fucoxanthin for 24 h. The results demonstrated that fucoxanthin significantly suppressed lipid accumulation and decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes. Fucoxanthin could decrease lipogenesis-related transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. It also reduced fatty  synthase expression and increased adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase production for lipolysis. Furthermore, fucoxanthin significantly increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for regulating fatty  synthesis. The results suggest that fucoxanthin is an effective marine nature compound for increasing lipolysis and inhibiting lipogenesis in  induced fatty liver cells through promoted Sirt1/AMPK pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, , palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential metabolic benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982401>The negative effect of lipid challenge on autophagy inhibits T cell responses.</a></h2><p> is associated with changes in the immune system that significantly hinder its ability to mount efficient immune responses. Previous studies have reported a dysregulation of immune responses caused by lipid challenge; however, the mechanisms underlying that dysregulation are still not completely understood. Autophagy is an essential catabolic process through which cellular components are degraded by the lysosomal machinery. In T cells, autophagy is an actively regulated process necessary to sustain homeostasis and activation. Here, we report that CD4 T cell responses are inhibited when cells are challenged with increasing concentrations of fatty acids. Furthermore, analysis of T cells from diet-induced obese mice confirms that high lipid load inhibits activation-induced responses in T cells. We have found that autophagy is inhibited in CD4 T cells exposed in vitro or in vivo to lipid stress, which causes decreased autophagosome formation and degradation. Supporting that inhibition of autophagy caused by high lipid load is a key mechanism that accounts for the effects on T cell function of lipid stress, we found that ATG7 (autophagy-related 7)-deficient T cells, unable to activate autophagy, did not show additional inhibitory effects on their responses to activation when subjected to lipid challenge. Our results indicate, thus, that increased lipid load can dysregulate autophagy and cause defective T cell responses, and suggest that inhibition of autophagy may underlie some of the characteristic -associated defects in the T cell compartment.

Changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism in BrCa have been widely reported, yet the contribution of fatty acids (FAs) in BrCa biology remains to be determined. We recently reported that adipocyte coculture alters MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell metabolism and promotes proliferation and migration. Since adipocytes are FA-rich, and these FAs are transferred to BrCa cells, we sought to elucidate the FA metabolism of BrCa cells and their response to FA-rich environments. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in serum-containing media supplemented with FAs accumulate extracellular FAs as intracellular triacylglycerols (TAG) in a dose-dependent manner, with MDA-MB-231 cells accumulating more TAG. The differences in TAG levels were a consequence of distinct differences in intracellular partitioning of FAs, and not due to differences in the rate of FA uptake. Specifically, MCF-7 cells preferentially partition FAs into mitochondrial oxidation, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells partition FAs into TAG synthesis. These differences in intracellular FA handling underpin differences in the sensitivity to palmitate-induced lipotoxicity, with MDA-MB-231 cells being highly sensitive, whereas MCF-7 cells are partially protected. The attenuation of palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in MCF-7 cells was reversed by inhibition of FA oxidation. Pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FAs increased TAG synthesis and reduced palmitate-induced apoptosis. Our results provide novel insight into the potential influences of  on BrCa biology, highlighting distinct differences in FA metabolism in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and how lipid-rich environments modulate these effects.© 2018 The Authors.

We tested the hypothesis that a high SFA diet, compared to a high MUFA ( 18:1n-9) diet, reduces ALA conversion to long chain n-3 fatty acids. Mice were fed for 12 weeks on three diets: (1) a control, 16 % fat energy diet consisting of similar levels of SFA and MUFA (2) a 50 % fat energy high MUFA energy diet (35 % MUFA and 7 % SFA) or (3) a 50 % fat energy, high SFA energy diet (34 % SFA, 8 % MUFA). ALA and LNA content remained constant. Analysis of hepatic lipids demonstrated a selective reduction (40 %) in ALA but not LNA and a 35 % reduction in eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3) in the high MUFA mice compared to the other groups. Lower content of ALA was reflected in the neutral lipid fraction, while smaller levels of phospholipid esterified EPA and docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5n-3) were evident. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) content was elevated by the high SFA diet. Expression of Fads1 (Δ5 desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6 desaturase) was elevated by the high MUFA and reduced by the high SFA diet. These data indicate that a high MUFA diet, but not a high SFA diet, reduces ALA metabolism and point to selective hepatic disposition of ALA versus LNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804268>Effects of canola and high- canola oils on abdominal fat mass in individuals with central .</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of diets low in saturated fatty acids and high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids on body composition in participants at risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS).This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study. Participants (n = 101, ages 49.5 ± 1.2, BMI 29.4 ± 0.4 kg/m ) were randomized to five isocaloric diets containing treatment oils: Canola, CanolaOleic, CanolaDHA, Corn/Safflower, and Flax/Safflower. Each diet period was 4 weeks followed by a 2- to 4-week washout period.Canola (3.1 kg, P = 0.026) and CanolaOleic oil diets (3.09 kg, P = 0.03) reduced android fat mass compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet (3.2 kg), particularly in men. The decrease in abdominal fat mass was correlated with the reduction in blood pressure after the Canola (systolic blood pressure: r = 0.26, P = 0.062; diastolic blood pressure: r = 0.38, P = 0.0049) and CanolaOleic oil diets (systolic blood pressure: r = 0.39 P = 0.004; diastolic blood pressure: r = 0.45, P = 0.0006). The decrease in abdominal fat mass also was associated with a reduction in triglyceride levels after the CanolaOleic oil diet (r = 0.42, P = 0.002).Diets high in MUFA (compared with PUFA) reduced central  with an accompanying improvement in MetS risk factors.

Actually, inadequate dietary habits together with physical inactivity are primary determinants of  and cancer risk. Changes in lipid metabolism play a crucial role in different types of cancer and key enzymes involved in lipid-metabolic pathways, such as stearoyl-coA-desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues.Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were analyzed by Winfood software. FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically palmitic (p = 0.0042) and stearic  (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular  (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the metabolic pathways.

Fat and salt are a common and appetitive combination in food; however, the effect of either on food intake is unclear. Fat taste sensitivity has been negatively associated with dietary fat intake, but how fat taste sensitivity influences the intake of fat within a meal has, to our knowledge, not yet been investigated.Our objectives were, first, to investigate the effects of both fat and salt on ad libitum food intake and, second, to investigate the effects of fat taste sensitivity on satiation responses to fat and whether this was affected by salt.Forty-eight healthy adults [16 men and 32 women, aged 18-54 y, body mass index (kg/m(2)): 17.8-34.4] were recruited and their fat taste sensitivity was measured by determination of the detection threshold of  (18:1n-6). In a randomized 2 × 2 crossover design, participants attended 4 lunchtime sessions after a standardized breakfast. Meals consisted of elbow macaroni (56%) with sauce (44%); sauces were manipulated to be1) low-fat (0.02% fat, wt:wt)/low-salt (0.06% NaCl, wt:wt),2) low-fat/high-salt (0.5% NaCl, wt:wt),3) high-fat (34% fat, wt:/wt)/low-salt, or4) high-fat/high-salt. Ad libitum intake (primary outcome) and eating rate, pleasantness, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness (secondary outcomes) were measured.Salt increased food and energy intakes by 11%, independent of fat concentration (P= 0.022). There was no effect of fat on food intake (P= 0.6), but high-fat meals increased energy intake by 60% (P< 0.001). A sex × fat interaction was found (P= 0.006), with women consuming 15% less by weight of the high-fat meals than the low-fat meals. Fat taste sensitivity was negatively associated with the intake of high-fat meals but only in the presence of low salt (fat taste × salt interaction on delta intake of high-fat - low-fat meals;P= 0.012).The results suggest that salt promotes passive overconsumption of energy in adults and that salt may override fat-mediated satiation in individuals who are sensitive to the taste of fat.

A. Mayer (Ephedraceae), Lithospermum erythrorhizon Siebold et Zuccarini (Borraginaceae), and Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), is used to treat  in local Korean clinics. The constituents of DF have traditionally been reported to exert anti- and anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of DF on  and NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms.DF was extracted with water (DF-FW), 30% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA30), or 70% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA70). The chemical profile of DF was monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet analysis. The effects of DF on indices of  and NAFLD in high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Oil red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry.The presence of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, aloe-emodin, and emodin in DF was determined by 3D chromatography using HPLC. Administration of DF-GA70 to HFD-fed obese mice decreased body weight, epididymal adipose tissue mass, and epididymal adipocyte size. DF-GA70 reduced serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All three DF extracts lowered serum alanine transaminase levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages, with the largest effects observed for DF-GA70. DF-GA70 increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation genes and decreased mRNA levels of genes for lipogenesis and inflammation in the liver of obese mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, whereas all three DF extracts inhibited lipid accumulation. DF-GA70 also altered the expression of lipolytic and lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells.These results indicate that DF inhibits  and -induced severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation without any adverse effects and that these effects may be mediated by regulation of the hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and inflammatory genes. These findings suggest that DF is a safe and efficient anti- and anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatosis drug.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

HepG2 cells treated with  (OA) in the presence of SCE exhibited reduced OA-induced lipid accumulation, which was likely mediated by reductions in SREBP-1c expression. SCE attenuated the acetylation of total lysine and H3K9 that was otherwise increased by OA. Male obese mice fed with either a low-fat diet or Western diet exhibited reduced body and liver weights when supplemented with 1% SCE. The SCE-mediated attenuation of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of lipogenic genes. SCE also attenuated the expression of acetylated lysine and non-acetylated forms of H3K9 acetylation in the livers of these mice. Taken together, these results suggest that SCE has potential for further development as a novel therapeutic agent for the prevention of steatosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolic parameters were measured on maternal venous blood samples. Expression of 88 genes involved in lipid metabolism was measured in whole placenta tissue. Proteins of genes differently expressed in response to maternal  were quantified, correlated with maternal parameters and immunolocalized in placenta sections. Isolated primary trophoblasts were used for in vitro assays.Triglyceride (TG) content was increased in placental tissue of obese (1.10, CI 1.04-1.24 mg g, P<0.05) vs lean (0.84, CI 0.72-1.02 mg g) women. Among target genes examined, six showed positive correlation (P<0.05) with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, namely ATGL (PNPLA2), FATP1 (SLC27A1), FATP3 (SLC27A3), PLIN2, PPARG and CGI-58 (ABHD5). CGI-58 protein abundance was twofold higher (P<0.001) in placentas of obese vs lean women. CGI-58 protein levels correlated positively with maternal insulin levels and pre-pregnancy body mass index (R=0.63, P<0.001 and R=0.64, P<0.001, respectively). CGI-58 and PLIN2 were primarily located in the syncytiotrophoblast and, were upregulated (1.38- and 500-fold, respectively) upon  and insulin treatment of cultured trophoblast cells.Pre-gravid  significantly modifies the expression of placental genes related to transport and storage of neutral lipids. We propose that the upregulation of CGI-58, a master regulator of TG hydrolysis, contributes to the turnover of intracellular lipids in placenta of obese women, and is tightly regulated by metabolic factors of the mother.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28106735>Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomic and Lipidomic Analyses of the Effects of Dietary Platycodon grandiflorum on Liver and Serum of Obese Mice under a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>We aimed to identify metabolites involved in the anti- effects of  (PG) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice using mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic techniques. C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: normal diet (ND)-fed mice, HFD-fed mice, HFD with 1% PG extract-fed mice (HPGL), and HFD with 5% PG extract-fed mice (HPGH). After 8 weeks, the HFD group gained more weight than the ND group, while dietary 5% PG extract attenuated this change. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots showed a clear distinction between experimental groups in serum and liver markers. We also identified 10 and 32 metabolites in the serum and liver, respectively, as potential biomarkers that could explain the effect of high-dose PG added to HFD-fed mice, which were strongly involved in amino  metabolism (glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, glutamate, phenylalanine, ornithine, lysine, and tyrosine), TCA cycle (fumarate and succinate), lipid metabolism (linoleic and  methyl esters, oleamide, and cholesterol), purine/pyrimidine metabolism (uracil and hypoxanthine), carbohydrate metabolism (maltose), and glycerophospholipid metabolism (phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylethanolamines). We suggest that further studies on these metabolites could help us gain a better understanding of both HFD-induced  and the effects of PG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27116638>Niacin and olive oil promote skewing to the M2 phenotype in bone marrow-derived macrophages of mice with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with , dyslipemia, type 2 diabetes and chronic low-grade inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on polarisation and inflammatory potential in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from niacin (NA)-treated Lep(ob/ob)LDLR(-/-) mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and serum triglycerides, and their BMDMs accumulated triglycerides over the animals fed with HFLCD-MUFAs or -PUFAs. Furthermore, BMDMs from animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs were polarised towards the M1 phenotype with functional competence to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas BMDMs from animals fed with HFLCD-MUFAs or -PUFAs were skewed to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. These findings open opportunities for developing novel nutritional strategies with olive oil as the most important dietary source of MUFAs (notably ) to prevent development and progression of metabolic complications in the NA-treated MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673191>[Biological role of insulin: transformation of carnivores leaving in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient  variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient palmitic variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and . We believe that the food of herbivores should contain palmitic  in the amounts that hepatocytes can esterify into  very low density lipoproteins and cells can internalize as ligand  by apoЕ/В-100 endocytosis without formation of low density lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28564636>Depot-specific differences in fat mass expansion in WT and ob/ob mice.</a></h2><p>The study was designed to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the differential fat expansion in different fat depots in wild type (WT) and ob/ob (OB) mice. At 6 weeks old, no differences in fat mass were found between SAT and VAT in WT mice, while O-SAT showed significantly higher weight than that of O-VAT. The average adipocyte size of SAT (~ 4133.47 μm2) was smaller than that of VAT (~ 7438.91 μm2) in OB mice. O-SAT preadipocytes gained higher triglyceride contents and higher levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα than did O-VAT preadipocytes upon in vitro differentiation. W-SAT and W-VAT displayed no significant differences in fatty  uptake, while 1.36 fold significantly higher fatty  uptake was found in O-SAT compared to O-VAT. Approximately 52% of the radioactivity recovered in cellular lipids was found in TAG in O-SAT, which was significantly higher than the other three adipocyte types. Significantly more radiolabelled  was β-oxidized to CO2 in adipocytes from O-VAT than that from O-SAT. ATP production was significantly lower in W-SAT compared with W-VAT, whereas no significantly ATP level was observed between O-SAT and O-VAT. Expression of UCP-1 in SAT from either WT or OB mice was significantly higher than the counterpart of VAT, which demonstrated higher uncoupled respiration and lower oxidative phosphorylation in SAT. Together, a combined increase in adipogenesis and FA uptake, and decreases in β-oxidation and ATP production, contributed to greater expansion of SAT compared to VAT in obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255704> increases the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 by promoting its nuclear translocation and β-catenin binding in pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>In the setting of metabolic overload, chronic elevations of free fatty acids in blood and tissues are associated with pancreatic β-cell lipotoxicity and failure. Ultimately,  combined with insulin resistance increases the dysfunctional demand of β-cells and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) is a potent transcriptional regulator of pancreatic β-cell function and tolerance to lipid stress. The present study examined the effects of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)-metabolized precursors and products, notably , on the compensatory capacity of β-cells and their relationship with regulation of the FoxO1 and Wnt pathways. The trioleate-induced compromise of insulin sensitivity blunted the compensatory response of pancreatic β-cells in primary rat islets. These events were associated with increases in the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of FoxO1. Such effects were also observed in INS-1E cells that were subjected to oleate treatment. The overexpression of human SCD1 that was accompanied by endogenously generated  also led to an increase in the nuclear abundance of FoxO1. The mechanism of the oleate-mediated subcellular localization of FoxO1 was independent of the fatty  receptor GPR40. Instead, the mechanism involved diversion of the active β-catenin pool from an interaction with transcription factor 7-like 2 toward FoxO1-mediated transcription in β-cells. Our findings identify a unique role for  in the compensatory response of pancreatic β-cells and emphasize the importance of FoxO1 in β-cell failure in -induced insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The testicular feminised mouse (non-functional androgen receptor and low testosterone) develops fatty liver and aortic lipid streaks on a high-fat diet, whereas androgen-replete XY littermate controls do not. Testosterone treatment ameliorates these effects, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We compared the influence of testosterone on the expression of regulatory targets of glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism in muscle, liver, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Testicular feminised mice displayed significantly reduced GLUT4 in muscle and glycolytic enzymes in muscle, liver and abdominal subcutaneous but not visceral adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase required for fatty  uptake was only reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue; enzymes of fatty  synthesis were increased in liver and subcutaneous tissue. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 that catalyses  synthesis and is associated with insulin resistance was increased in visceral adipose tissue and cholesterol efflux components (ABCA1, apoE) were decreased in subcutaneous and liver tissue. Master regulator nuclear receptors involved in metabolism-Liver X receptor expression was suppressed in all tissues except visceral adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ was lower in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue and PPARα only in abdominal subcutaneous. Testosterone treatment improved the expression (androgen receptor independent) of some targets but not all. These exploratory data suggest that androgen deficiency may reduce the buffering capability for glucose uptake and utilisation in abdominal subcutaneous and muscle and fatty acids in abdominal subcutaneous. This would lead to an overspill and uptake of excess glucose and triglycerides into visceral adipose tissue, liver and arterial walls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26806592>Interactions between dietary oil treatments and genetic variants modulate fatty  ethanolamides in plasma and body weight composition.</a></h2><p>Fatty  ethanolamides (FAE), a group of lipid mediators derived from long-chain fatty acids (FA), mediate biological activities including activation of cannabinoid receptors, stimulation of fat oxidation and regulation of satiety. However, how circulating FAE levels are influenced by FA intake in humans remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the response of six major circulating FAE to various dietary oil treatments in a five-period, cross-over, randomised, double-blind, clinical study in volunteers with abdominal . The treatment oils (60 g/12 552 kJ per d (60 g/3000 kcal per d)) provided for 30 d were as follows: conventional canola oil, high  canola oil, high  canola oil enriched with DHA, flax/safflower oil blend and corn/safflower oil blend. Two SNP associated with FAE degradation and synthesis were studied. Post-treatment results showed overall that plasma FAE levels were modulated by dietary FA and were positively correlated with corresponding plasma FA levels; minor allele (A) carriers of SNP rs324420 in gene fatty  amide hydrolase produced higher circulating oleoylethanolamide (OEA) (P=0·0209) and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels (P=0·0002). In addition, elevated plasma DHEA levels in response to DHA intake tended to be associated with lower plasma OEA levels and an increased gynoid fat mass. In summary, data suggest that the metabolic and physiological responses to dietary FA may be influenced via circulating FAE. Genetic analysis of rs324420 might help identify a sub-population that appears to benefit from increased consumption of DHA and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30467983>N-ϒ-(l-Glutamyl)-l-Selenomethionine Inhibits Fat Storage via the Stearoyl-CoA Desaturases FAT-6 and FAT-7 and the Selenoprotein TRXR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Selenium is an important nutrient for human health. The influence of dietary selenium on lipid metabolism remains largely unknown. N-γ-(l-glutamyl)-l-selenomethionine (Glu-SeMet) on inhibition of fat accumulation and its underlying mechanisms in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are investigated.Triacylglyceride quantification and post-fixed Nile red staining methods are conducted to evaluate fat accumulation in wild-type N2 worms in normal or high-glucose diet. Glu-SeMet (0.01 µm) treatment effectively reduces fat storage in wild-type N2 C. elegans in both a normal and high-glucose diet. Further evidence shows that Glu-SeMet (0.01 µm) decreases the ratio of /stearic  (C18:1Δ9/C18:0) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The mRNA levels of fatty  stearoyl-CoA desaturases, FAT-6 and FAT-7, and the mediator-15 (MDT-15) are downregulated while the wild-type N2 worms are co-treated with high glucose and Glu-SeMet (0.01 µm). The effect of reduced fat accumulation is absent in fat-6, fat-7, and trxr-1 mutant worms under high glucose and Glu-SeMet (0.01 µm) co-treatment.This study demonstrates that Glu-SeMet inhibiting fat accumulation may be associated with FAT-6 and FAT-7 and the selenoprotein TRXR-1 in C. elegans.

This single-blinded 3-way cross-over pilot study aimed to investigate the ability of the two most abundant dietary plant-derived fats,  (OA) and linoleic (LA) acids, to modulate postprandial appetite and levels of circulating appetite and metabolic regulators in overweight/obese individuals. Meals were a high-carbohydrate control, a high-OA or a high-LA meal, and provided 30% of participants' estimated energy requirements. Meals were consumed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected over 3¼ h. Appetite parameters were assessed via a validated visual analogue scale questionnaire. Hormones and other circulating factors were quantified using multiplex immunoassays. Eight participants (age 45.8 ± 3.6 (years), body mass index 32.0 ± 1.3 (kg/m²)) completed the study. All meals significantly increased fullness and reduced desire to eat. The control and high-OA meals significantly decreased prospective food intake. The high-LA meal increased ghrelin levels ( < 0.05), a hormone which encourages food intake. This was coupled with a significant acute increase in resistin levels, which impairs insulin signaling. Taken together, this study indicates that in overweight/obese individuals, high-LA meals may promote excess energy intake and alter glucose handling, though a larger cohort may be required to strengthen results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159805>Oleate attenuates palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in placental trophoblasts.</a></h2><p>Pre-pregnancy  is increasingly common and predisposes pregnant women and offspring to gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth abnormalities and stillbirth. Obese women exhibit elevated levels of the two most common dietary fatty acids, palmitate and oleate, and the maternal blood containing these nutrients bathes the surface of trophoblasts of placental villi in vivo We test the hypothesis that the composition and concentration of free fatty acids modulate viability and function of primary human villous trophoblasts in culture. We found that palmitate increases syncytiotrophoblast death, specifically by caspase-mediated apoptosis, whereas oleate does not cause enhanced cell death. Importantly, exposure to both fatty acids in equimolar amounts yielded no increase in death or apoptosis, suggesting that oleate can protect syncytiotrophoblasts from palmitate-induced death. We further found that palmitate, but not oleate or oleate with palmitate, increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, signaling through the unfolded protein response, and yielding CHOP-mediated induction of apoptosis. Finally, we show that oleate or oleate plus palmitate both lead to increased lipid droplets in syncytiotrophoblasts, whereas palmitate does not. The data show palmitate is toxic to human syncytiotrophoblasts, through the induction of ER stress and apoptosis mediated by CHOP, whereas oleate is not toxic, abrogates palmitate toxicity and induces fat accumulation. We speculate that our in vitro results offer pathways by which the metabolic milieu of the obese pregnant woman can yield villous trophoblast dysfunction and sub-optimal placental function.© 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926950>Effects of imidazoline-like drugs on liver and adipose tissues, and their role in preventing  and associated cardio-metabolic disorders.</a></h2><p>We previously observed that selective agonists of the sympatho-inhibitory I imidazoline receptors (LNP ligands) have favorable effects on several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders defining the metabolic syndrome, including body weight. The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of LNPs on adiposity and the mechanisms involved, and to evaluate their impact on metabolic homeostasis.Young Zucker fa/fa rats were treated with LNP599 (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Effects on body weight, adiposity (regional re-distribution, morphology, and function of adipose tissues), cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, and liver function were evaluated. Direct effects on insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling were studied in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.LNP599 treatment limited the age-dependent remodeling and inflammation of subcutaneous, epididymal, and visceral adipose tissues, and prevented total fat deposits and the development of . Body-weight stabilization was not related to reduced food intake but rather to enhanced energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were also improved and were significantly correlated with body weight but not with plasma norepinephrine. Insulin and AMPK signaling were enhanced in hepatic tissues of treated animals, whereas blood markers of hepatic disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced. In cultured HepG2 cells, LNP ligands phosphorylated AMPK and the downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevented -induced intracellular lipid accumulation. They also significantly potentiated insulin-mediated AKT activation and this was independent from AMPK.Selective I imidazoline receptor agonists protect against the development of adiposity and , and the associated cardio-metabolic disorders. Activation of I receptors in the liver, leading to stimulation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK and insulin sensitization, and in adipose tissues, leading to improvement of morphology and function, are identified as peripheral mechanisms involved in the beneficial actions of these ligands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30532639>Ginkgolide C reduced -induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Ginkgolide C, isolated from , is a diterpene lactone that has multiple biological functions and can improve Alzheimer disease and platelet aggregation. Ginkgolide C also inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present study evaluated whether ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and regulated the molecular mechanism of lipogenesis in -induced HepG2 hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM  for 48 h to induce a fatty liver cell model. Then, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of ginkgolide C for 24 h. Staining with Oil Red O and the fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 revealed that ginkgolide C significantly reduced excessive lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Ginkgolide C decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c to block the expression of fatty  synthase. Ginkgolide C treatment also promoted the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation level of hormone-sensitive lipase to enhance the decomposition of triglycerides. In addition, ginkgolide C stimulated CPT-1 to activate fatty  β-oxidation, significantly increased sirt1 and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for suppressed fatty  synthesis in hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis through the sirt1/AMPK pathway in -induced fatty liver cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794005>Pu-erh tea extract ameliorates high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and insulin resistance by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling in mice.</a></h2><p>Pu-erh tea, made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, possesses activities beneficial for human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti- properties.We investigated the effects of a pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects.Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks, during which PTE was simultaneously administered in drinking water. Body weight, hepatic inflammation, steatosis, insulin sensitivity, expression of lipogenesis- and gluconeogenesis-associated genes, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation were examined. The anti-steatotic effects of PTE and/or interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated in HepG2 cells.

PTE treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PTE treatment maintained the intact insulin signal and significantly decreased expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. PTE treatment strikingly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the livers of HFD-fed mice.

However, it is largely unknown whether OFS affects taste preference and eating habits. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate (1) the association between body mass index (BMI) and OFS and (2) the relationship of OFS with four types of taste preference (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) and eating habits using serial concentrations of  (OA) homogenized in non-fat milk and a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were 25 healthy Japanese individuals (mean age: 27.0 ± 5.6 years), among whom the OA detection threshold was significantly associated with BMI. Participants were divided into two subgroups based on oral sensitivity to 2.8 mM OA: hypersensitive (able to detect 2.8 mM OA, n = 16) and hyposensitive (unable to detect 2.8 mM OA, n = 9). The degree of sweet taste preference of the hypersensitive group was significantly higher than that of the hyposensitive group. Furthermore, there was significantly higher degree of preference for high-fat sweet foods than low-fat sweet foods in the hypersensitive group. There was also a significant inverse correlation between the OA detection threshold and the degree of both spare eating and postprandial satiety. Thus, OFS is associated not only with BMI, but also with the preference for high-fat sweet foods and eating habits. The present study provides novel insights that measuring OFS may be useful for assessing the risk of  associated with overeating in countries, including Japan, where BMI is increasing in the population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29372051>Effects of krill oil and lean and fatty fish on cardiovascular risk markers: a randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Fish consumption and supplementation with -3 fatty acids reduce CVD risk. Krill oil is an alternative source of marine -3 fatty acids and few studies have investigated its health effects. Thus, we compared krill oil supplementation with the intake of fish with similar amounts of -3 fatty acids on different cardiovascular risk markers. In an 8-week randomised parallel study, thirty-six healthy subjects aged 18-70 years with fasting serum TAG between 1·3 and 4·0 mmol/l were randomised to receive either fish, krill oil or control oil. In the fish group, subjects consumed lean and fatty fish, according to dietary guidelines. The krill and control group received eight capsules per d containing 4 g oil per d. The weekly intake of marine -3 fatty acids from fish given in the fish group and from krill oil in the krill group were 4103 and 4654 mg, respectively. Fasting serum TAG did not change between the groups. The level of total lipids ( = 0·007), phospholipids ( = 0·015), cholesterol ( = 0·009), cholesteryl esters ( = 0·022) and non-esterified cholesterol ( = 0·002) in the smallest VLDL subclass increased significantly in response to krill oil supplementation.

Furthermore, plasma levels of marine -3 fatty acids increased significantly in the fish and krill groups compared with the control (all  ≤ 0·0003). In conclusion, supplementation with krill oil and intake of fish result in health-beneficial effects. Although only krill oil reduced fasting glucose, fish provide health-beneficial nutrients, including vitamin D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28966553>Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Grown as Spheroids.</a></h2><p>Understanding the process of adipogenesis is critical if suitable therapeutics for  and related metabolic diseases are to be found. The current study presents proof of feasibility of creating a 3-D spheroid model using human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and their subsequent adipogenic differentiation. hASC spheroids were formed atop an elastin-like polypeptide-polyethyleneimine (ELP-PEI) surface and differentiated using an adipogenic cocktail. Spheroids were matured in the presence of dietary fatty acids (linoleic or ) and evaluated based on functional markers including intracellular protein, CD36 expression, triglyceride accumulation, and PPAR-γ gene expression. Spheroid size was found to increase as the hASCs matured in the adipocyte maintenance medium, though the fatty  treatment generally resulted in smaller spheroids compared to control. A stable protein content over the 10-day maturation period indicated contact-inhibited proliferation as well as minimal loss of spheroids during culture. Spheroids treated with fatty acids showed greater amounts of intracellular triglyceride content and greater expression of the key adipogenic gene, PPAR-γ. We also demonstrated that 3-D spheroids outperformed 2-D monolayer cultures in adipogenesis. We then compared the adipogenesis of hASC spheroids to that in 3T3-L1 spheroids and found that the triglyceride accumulation was less profound in hASC spheroids than that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, correlated with smaller average spheroids, suggesting a relatively slower differentiation process. Taken together, we have shown the feasibility of adipogenic differentiation of patient-derived hASC spheroids, which with further development, may help elucidate key features in the adipogenesis process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290500>Palmitic and : The Yin and Yang of Fatty Acids in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>Increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) link  with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The levels of blood HDL, apolipoprotein A1( ApoA1), apolipoprotein A2( ApoA2), triglyceride( TG), total cholesterol( TC), high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol( HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol( HDL-c) in serum were measured at the fourth and eighth week. The levels of HDL, ApoA1, and ApoA2 in liver and small intestine were measured by ELISA. Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of ApoA1 and ApoA2 in liver and small intestine from rats at the eighth week.At the eighth week, significant decreases in levels of serum TG and TC were observed in octanoic  and decanoic  groups as compared with  group( P < 0. 05). Greater increases in levels of serum HDL and HDL-c/LDL-c were observed in octanoic  group than in  group( P < 0. 05). Greater increases in protein expression of HDL and ApoA1 and in mRNA expression of ApoA1 in small intestine were observed in octanoic  group than in  group( P < 0. 05).MCFA can elevate the levels of HDL, HDL-c/LDL-c in serum, and increase the expressions of HDL and ApoA1 in small intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29241749>Acne vulgaris: The metabolic syndrome of the pilosebaceous follicle.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is an epidemic inflammatory disease of the human sebaceous follicle and represents the most common skin disease affecting about 85% of adolescents in Westernized populations. Acne vulgaris is primarily a disease of wealthy countries and exhibits higher prevalence rates in developed compared with developing countries. No acne has been found in non-Westernized populations still living under Paleolithic dietary conditions constraining hyperglycemic carbohydrates, milk, and dairy products. The high prevalence rates of adolescent acne cannot be explained by the predominance of genetic factors but by the influence of a Western diet that overstimulates the key conductor of metabolism, the nutrient- and growth factor-sensitive kinase mTORC1. Increased mTORC1 activity has been detected in lesional skin and sebaceous glands of acne patients compared with acne-free controls. Increased mTORC1 signaling is a characteristic feature of insulin resistance, , type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Acne vulgaris is a family member of mTORC1-driven diseases of civilization and represents the MetS of the sebaceous follicle.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated associations between fatty  taste, olfaction, mouthfeel of fat, dietary intake, eating behaviour, and body mass index (BMI). Fifty women attended three sessions to assess  taste and olfaction thresholds, the olfactory threshold for -butanol and subjective mouthfeel ratings of custard samples. Dietary intake and eating behaviour were evaluated using a Food Frequency and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, respectively. Binomial regression analysis was used to model fat taste and olfaction data. Taste and olfactory detection for  were positively correlated ( = 0.325;  < 0.02).  taste hypersensitive women had significantly increased -butanol olfactory sensitivity ( < 0.03). The eating behaviour disinhibition and BMI were higher in women who were hyposensitive to  taste ( < 0.05). Dietary intake of nuts, nut spreads, and seeds were significantly correlated with high olfactory sensitivity to  ( < 0.01). These findings demonstrate a clear link between fatty  taste sensitivity and olfaction and suggest that fat taste perception is associated with specific characteristics of eating behaviour and body composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343843>Monounsaturated Fatty Acids in a High-Fat Diet and Niacin Protect from White Fat Dysfunction in the Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p> is a principal causative factor of metabolic syndrome. Niacin potently regulates lipid metabolism. Replacement of saturated fatty acids by MUFAs or inclusion of omega-3 long-chain PUFAs in the diet improves plasma lipid levels. However, the potential benefits of niacin in combination with MUFAs or omega-3 long-chain PUFAs against white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction in the high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome are unknown.Male Lep LDLR mice are fed a chow diet or HFDs based on milk cream (21% kcal), olive oil (21% kcal), or olive oil (20% kcal) plus 1% kcal from eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, including immediate-release niacin (1% w/v) in drinking water, for 8 weeks. Mice are then phenotyped. Dietary MUFAs are identified as positive regulators of adipose NAD signaling pathways by triggering NAD biosynthesis via the salvage pathway. This coexists with overexpression of genes involved in recognition of NAD and fatty acids, a surrounding lipid environment dominated by exogenous  and an alternatively activated macrophage profile, which culminate in a healthy expansion of WAT and improvement of several hallmarks that typify the metabolic syndrome.Niacin in combination with dietary MUFAs can favor WAT homeostasis in the development of HFD-induced  and metabolic syndrome.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Thus, it is important to explore its underlying mechanisms.Total RNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples from 50 NAFLD patients and 50 healthy controls. In addition, human liver specimens were obtained through liver biopsies from NAFLD patients and healthy controls. The level of miRNA was studied using real-time PCR. The expression of lipogenic genes was analyzed using western blot, and a dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to identify the possible target gene. Adenovirus vectors were injected into the tail vein of the high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice to study the role of miR-155 on lipid accumulation in vivo.The level of miR-155 was markedly reduced in the livers and peripheral blood of NAFLD patients compared with healthy controls. Upregulation of miR-155 decreased intracellular lipid content and the SREBP1 and FAS protein levels, while inhibition of miR-155 enhanced the intracellular lipid content. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that Liver X receptor (LXR)α was the target gene of miR-155, and silencing miR-155 reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS. An in vivo study showed that upregulation of miR-155 decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation mainly by suppressing the LXRα-dependent lipogenic signaling pathway.In summary, decreased expression of miR-155 in the peripheral blood may be utilized as a potential novel biomarker for NAFLD screening mainly by targeting LXRα.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, , and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and -associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty  profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear.The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty  profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central .The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high -canola oil, DHA-enriched high -canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively).Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty  and polyunsaturated fatty  profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, central  is inversely associated with cholesterol efflux capacity.

However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger inflammation is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and palmitic  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine),  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces inflammation in neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[Insulin resistance is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h2><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) , 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is a pathology associated primarily with FA and secondarily with glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206239>Type 1 diabetes alters lipid handling and metabolism in human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</a></h2><p>Triggers of the autoimmune response that leads to type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain poorly understood. A possibility is that parallel changes in both T cells and target cells provoke autoimmune attack. We previously documented greater Ca2+ transients in fibroblasts from T1D subjects than non-T1D after exposure to fatty acids (FA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These data indicate that metabolic and signal transduction defects present in T1D can be elicited ex vivo in isolated cells. Changes that precede T1D, including inflammation, may activate atypical responses in people that are genetically predisposed to T1D. To identify such cellular differences in T1D, we quantified a panel of metabolic responses in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) from age-matched T1D and non-T1D subjects, as models for non-immune and immune cells, respectively. Fibroblasts from T1D subjects accumulated more lipid, had higher LC-CoA levels and converted more FA to CO2, with less mitochondrial proton leak in response to oleate alone or with TNFα, using the latter as a model of inflammation. T1D-PBMCs contained and also accumulated more lipid following FA exposure. In addition, they formed more peroxidized lipid than controls following FA exposure. We conclude that both immune and non-immune cells in T1D subjects differ from controls in terms of responses to FA and TNFα. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity to inflammatory insults and FA that may precede and contribute to T1D by priming both immune cells and their targets for autoimmune reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566642>Modulatory Effect of an Isolated Triglyceride from Fenugreek Seed Oil on of α-Amylase, Lipase and ACE Activities, Liver-Kidney Functions and Metabolic Disorders of Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to examine physicochemical characteristics, chemical compositions and biological activities of fenugreek seed oil (FSO) and its pure triglyceride (TG). One fenugreek TG was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation and administrated to surviving diabetic rats. The free fatty acids percentage as well as, the peroxide, the saponification and the iodine values were 2%, 12 mequiv. O/kg of oil, 189 (mg KOH/g) and 110 (g/100 g of oil), respectively. Linolenic  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and  (C 17.07%) were the dominant fatty acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased insulin sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in liver and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected liver-kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230367>Palmitate aggravates proteinuria-induced cell death and inflammation via CD36-inflammasome axis in the proximal tubular cells of obese mice.</a></h2><p>High levels of serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and proteinuria have been implicated in the pathogenesis of -related nephropathy. CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced . HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating -related nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214608>Free fatty acids sensitize dendritic cells to amplify TH1/TH17-immune responses.</a></h2><p> is associated with body fat gain and impaired glucose metabolism.

Since  is associated with increased and/or delayed resolution of inflammation observed in various chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, we investigated the impact of FFAs on human monocyte-derived and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (DCs) functions relevant for the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. FFAs such as palmitic  (PA) and  (OA) did not affect the pro-inflammatory immune response of DCs. In contrast, PA and OA sensitize DCs resulting in augmented secretion of TH1/TH17-instructive cytokines upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Interestingly,  in mice worsened a TH1/TH17-driven psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Strong correlation of the amount of total FFA, PA, and OA in serum with the severity of skin inflammation points to a critical role of FFA in -mediated exacerbation of skin inflammation. Our data suggest that increased levels of FFAs might be a predisposing factor promoting a TH1/TH17-mediated inflammation such as psoriasis in response to an inflammatory danger signal.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

After 12 hours of fasting, each subject was given one of the two test meals standardized, including 2 muffins and water (HSM, 42.1% of saturated fat , or HMM, 34.5% of monounsaturated fat ). Plasma fatty  profile and concentrations of apolipoproteins A1 and B100, complement C3, and triacylglycerols were analyzed during fasting and at 2, 3, and 5 postprandial hours.Among the markers studied, the triacylglycerol (TAG) and complement C3 were significantly higher in the OW group, compared to NW. The increment in the C3 concentration was higher after HSM intake, compared with HMM (iAUC = 4365.5 ± 5477.4 vs. 1215.2 ± 882.4; p = 0.006), with no differences between groups. After 5 hours postprandial, plasma  values remained high compared with the fasting value in the NW group, but not in the OW group (26.0 ± 4.2 vs 23.7 ± 3.9%; p < 0.001).

Millions of years in life consistently in the waters of several oceans, all the ancestors of man were carnivorous (Carnivores), fish-eating mammals. When the ocean retreated and the carnivorous (fish-eating) were on land, each individual privatized a "piece" of the ocean. Animals transformed it ito a pool of intercellular medium in vivo. The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of fatty acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis- FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0 palmitic  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis- without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an  FA exogenous palmitic  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past. The idea of a person as omnivorous (Omnivor) - nonsense; such forms of nature did not form.

The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk energy-restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion.

A pharmacokinetic study indicated that CTMS and CCMS were distributed in almost all of the measured tissues, especially liver and kidney, and that their absorption was better than those of chitosan and capsaicin. Simultaneously, the prolonged circulating half-lives, the lower clearance and higher plasma concentration of CTMS and CCMS showed that their bioavailability was effectively enhanced. All of the results indicated that the lipid accumulation inhibition of CTMS and CCMS was better than that of chitosan and capsaicin, and that these microspheres can be developed as preventive agents for fatty liver or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889655>Improved anti- effect of herbal active and endogenous lipids co-loaded lipid nanocarriers: Preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.</a></h2><p>The association of numerous advantages of natural active compounds (from vegetal and herbs) and endogenous lipid in the same delivery system is a straightforward approach for the development of safe and better tolerated anti- therapy. In the present study we envisage a novel concept for  therapy, devoted to the development of innovative lipid nanostructured formulas with improved gastric tolerability and enhanced specificity in adipose cells targeting. For this purpose, an anti- herbal active from red pepper extract - Capsaicin (Cap) and an endogenous lipid regulator of appetite - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or a structural analogue of OEA - Phenylalaninol oleamide (PAO), are simultaneously integrated within the same delivery system - nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared with linseed oil that has anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties. The NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap presented mean diameters under 200 nm, size that allow an efficient uptake of actives by enterocytes and lead to an extended biological action of all actives - Cap, OEA/PAO and linolenic . NLC revealed a polidispersity index ranging from 0.16 to 0.22, which represents a narrow dispersion around mean size and suggests an adequate unimodal behavior. The two types of NLC co-loaded with Cap and OEA/PAO were both negatively charged, with zeta potentials of -42.8 mV and -58.5 mV that offered a guarantee for an excellent stability of NLC in time. Despite to the competition between the accommodations of both actives into the lipid core of nanocarriers, the entrapment efficiency exceeds 92% for OEA/PAO and is ranged between 71 and 82% for Cap. In the presence of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap, ABTS inhibition proceeded in a Capsaicin concentration dependent manner and was dependent on the type of NLC formulation. A remarkable radical-scavenging activity against ABTS was determined for Cap and OEA based-NLC. The in vitro release demonstrated that NLC played an important role on the delay of Cap dissolution; the NLC have ensured a slow release of Cap, eg only 21% Cap was released after 24 h of in vitro experiments. The in vivo pharmacological evaluation has revealed that the NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap treatment resulted in a body weight decrease and improves the lipid and glucose profile, as compared to the obese mice batch.  mice treated with NLC-OEA exhibited a weight loss of ~15% and ~10% weight loss for NLC-POA, after 10-days treatment. Administration of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap to the Albino Swiss mice led to significant decrease of glucose level (e.g. 117.4 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap treated mice versus 213.9 mg/dL for obese mice batch) and exhibited a desired decrease effect of triglyceride (e.g. 71.1 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap versus 129.5, for obese batch). Moreover, the cholesterol values have been lowered to almost half from the value determined for the control batches. Overall, study highlights that using appropriate lipid mediators in association with an herbal anti- active, both formulated into lipid nanocarriers, could enhance the therapeutic response in the  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown fat-specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous fat pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic  (STA; 18:0),  (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic  (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ-linolenic  (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or pinolenic  (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty  effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty  and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown fat-specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520777>Autophagy differentially regulates macrophage lipid handling depending on the lipid substrate ( vs. acetylated-LDL) and inflammatory activation state.</a></h2><p>The regulation of lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by autophagy in naïve macrophages is complex: Inhibiting autophagosome initiation steps attenuates  (OA) induced LD (OA-LD) biogenesis, whereas interfering with later-autophagosome maturation/lysosomal steps accelerates OA-LD biogenesis rate, but not OA-LD degradation. Here we hypothesized that regulation of macrophage lipid handling by autophagy may be lipid-substrate and activation-state-specific. Using automated quantitative live-cell imaging, initial LD biogenesis rate was ~30% slower when the lipid source was acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) compared to OA. Yet, both were similarly affected by triacsin-C, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, which inhibited, and etomoxir, an inhibitor of acylcarnitine palmitoyl transferase (fatty  oxidation), which augmented, LD biogenesis rates. An autophagy inducing peptide, Tat-Beclin1, enhanced the degradation, and inhibited (by 37%) the biogenesis of acLDL induced LD (acLDL-LD). Yet, Tat-Beclin1 increased OA-LD biogenesis rate by 70%. When macrophages were pre-activated with LPS + INFG they exhibited increased autophagosome number and area, and reduced BECN1 and ATG14 protein levels, which associated with a markedly attenuated autophagic flux. Concomitantly, OA-LD and acLDL-LD biogenesis rates increased 3 and 7.4-fold, respectively, but could not be further modulated by Tat-Beclin1, as observed in non-activated/naïve macrophages. We propose that macrophage autophagy, and/or components of its machinery, differentially regulate LD/foam-cell biogenesis depending on the lipid-source, and that inflammatory activation uncouples autophagy from LD biogenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated with  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As knowledge about FcγRIIb in the literature is mostly generated from studies on skeletal muscle tissue, the expression and function of FcγRIIb in the liver and hepatocytes are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to  (OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of , , , , and  in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower liver weight and liver to body weight ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers. In glycometabolism, FcγRIIb hindered insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1, and in turn upregulated  and  mRNA expression, suggesting that FcγRIIb promotes gluconeogenesis by suppressing the AKT/FOXO1// pathway in hepatocytes.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of feeding low (LO) or high  (HO) diets to AL pigs reared in individual pens (IND) or outdoors (OUT) with access to pasture. Biceps femoris and dorsal subcutaneous fat (DSF) samples were collected to analyse chemical composition and lipids fatty  (FA) profile. The expression of seven genes involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis and FA transport, as well as two transcription factors were also evaluated in the muscle. B. femoris and DSF presented lower lipid content in OUT-reared than in IND-reared pigs. Two genes involved in lipogenesis, ACACA and FASN, were under-expressed in B. femoris from OUT-reared pigs, while two involved in lipolysis, LPL and HSL were over-expressed. HO diet also significantly reduced FASN expression. Both rearing system and diet affected the FA profile of tissues, particularly DSF. Overall, OUT-reared pigs presented lower n6 to n3 FA ratios in all tissues, and lower monounsaturated (MUFA) and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content in DSF. When compared to LO-fed ones, HO-fed pigs presented higher  proportions in all tissues, and lower SFA, higher MUFA and PUFA levels, as well as lower saturation, atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes in DSF.

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether  impacts placental lipid transport and metabolism remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from palmitic  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal . Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA,  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese.

Because of this, there is a high interest in healthy natural products that could prevent the appearance of such diseases. This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl acetate and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty  (USFA) (palmitoleic, linolenic, linoleic, , araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty  content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty  ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI). The lower (best) index values are for ethanol extract, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.74 (AI) and 1.05 (TI), followed of ethyl acetate, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.87 (AI) and 1.24 (TI). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of PLE alga extracts in terms of total phenol content (TPC) was analyzed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method.

The effects of stable overexpression of γ-synuclein (γ-syn), a neuronal protein recently recognized as a novel regulator of lipid handling in adipocytes, and transient overexpression of Parkinson's disease (PD) α-synuclein [α-syn; wild-type (wt) and its pathogenic mutants A53T, A30P and E46K] in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, were also evaluated. The effects of co-treatment of PA with paraquat (PQ), a Parkinsonian pesticide, and leptin, a hormone involved in the brain-adipose axis, were also assessed. Cell death mode and cell cycle were analyzed by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was determined using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescien diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and lipid peroxidation level was determined using thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) assay.MTT assay revealed dose- and time-dependent PA cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, but not OA and LA. The cytotoxicity was significantly lower in SH-SY5Y-γ-syn cells, while transient overexpression of wt α-syn or its PD mutants (A30P and E46K, but not A53T) modestly (but still significantly) rescued the cytotoxicity of PA in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells. Co-treatment of increasing concentrations of PQ exacerbated PA's neurotoxicity. Pre-treatment of leptin, an anti-apoptotic adipokine, did not successfully rescue SH-SY5Y cells from PA-induced cytotoxicity-suggesting a mechanism of PA-induced leptin resistance. Annexin V/PI flow cytometry analysis revealed PA-induced increase in percentages of cells in annexin V-positive/PI-negative quadrant (early apoptosis) and subG-G fraction, accompanied by a decrease in G-M phase cells. The PA-induced ROS production and lipid peroxidation was at greater extent in T98G as compared to that in SH-SY5Y.In conclusion, PA induces apoptosis by increasing oxidative stress in neurons and astrocytes. Taken together, the results suggest that HFD may cause neuronal and astrocytic damage, which indirectly proposes that CNS pathologies involving neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis could be prevented via the diet regimen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576657>Screening of depression in overweight and obese pregnant women and its predictors.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the screening result of depression and its predictors in overweight and obese pregnant women in second and third trimester of pregnancy.The present cross-sectional study was carried out on 232 overweight or obese pregnant women older than 18 years in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

No changes were observed in the expression of lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells, however there was a 50%-300% elevation in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. CaSR activation in adipocytes may associate with decreased TG storage ability and increased aP2. Hepatic CaSR stimulation may elevate steatosis and proinflammatory factors.

Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with palmitic  (PA) and  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation.

On the other hand, the intake of ω-3 fatty acids, , calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric  and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> 2.5 l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading probiotics (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary.

The 60 g treatments included three MUFA-rich diets: (1) conventional canola oil (Canola); (2) DHA-enriched high  canola oil (CanolaDHA); (3) high  canola oil (CanolaOleic); and two PUFA-rich diets: (4) a blend of corn/saﬄower oil (25:75) (CornSaff); and (5) a blend of flax/saﬄower oil (60:40) (FlaxSaff). Stool samples were collected at the end of each period. DNA was extracted and amplified for 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. A total of 17 phyla and 187 genera were identified. While five novel oil treatments failed to alter bacterial phyla composition, obese participants resulted in a higher proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes than overweight or normal weight groups ( = 0.01). Similarly at the genus level, overall bacterial distribution was highly associated with subjects' body mass index (BMI).

Serum concentrations of CCL2, IP-10, chemerin, and RANTES were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with free fatty acids (FA) and with sex steroids and concentrations of CCL2 and chemerin in cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA.A significant reduction of circulating CCL2, IP-10, and chemerin concentrations was observed as a consequence of triglyceride ingestion whereas RANTES levels were increased. CCL2 serum concentrations were positively correlated with resistin and visfatin levels and with LDL/HDL ratio and negatively with adiponectin. There were significant differences in chemerin and RANTES serum concentrations in female and male subjects. CCL2 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited by treatment with linoleic (LA) and  (OA) whereas chemerin secretion was induced. Chemerin release from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited by testosterone.Oral lipid loading is linked to reduced circulating pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2, IP-10, and chemerin and to increased RANTES levels, suggesting that dietary lipids affect immune function.Copyright © 2016.

The formation of palmitic non-ligand very low density lipoproteins-β-proteins is affected and their collection and partial utilization in intima generates lipoidosis. In summary, all this becomes a cause of formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. The limitations in phylogenesis of cognitive biological function are considered as an etiological factor of metabolic pandemics. The etiological factors are specific for every one of metabolic pandemics and pathogenesis of all pandemics is developed following common algorithm. It is likely that metabolic pandemics (atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, metabolic essential arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, syndrome of insulin resistance,  and non-alcoholic fatty disease of liver)are quite not identical to nosologic forms of diseases if considered according etiological factors, pathogenesis and pathology rate in population. The exclusion of all inherent forms of disorder of metabolism of fatty acids and their transfer in β-lipoproteins demonstrates that problem of atherosclerosis, atheromatosis, coronarosclerosis and ischemic heart disease mainly turns out to be a case of eaten one's fill , a result of environment factors impact, disorder of biological function of trophology, biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition) and biological function of homeostasis. The prevention of atherosclerosis, atheromatosis and ischemic heart disease in population will be effective only under condition of obligatory individual support of actioning cognitive biological function by more complete biological function of intelligence. The active prevention of metabolic pandemics by force of personal development of cognitive biological function, intelligence function, provides no application of pharmaceuticals.

The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill resulted in a massive environmental release of crude oil and remediation efforts applied large quantities of Corexit dispersants to the oil spill. The Corexit-enhanced Water Accommodated Fraction (CWAF) of DWH crude oil contains PPARγ transactivation activity, which is attributed to dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a probable obesogen. In addition to its use in oil dispersants, DOSS is commonly used as a stool softener and food additive. Because PPARγ functions as a heterodimer with RXRα to transcriptionally regulate adipogenesis we investigated the potential of CWAF to transactivate RXRα and herein demonstrated that the Corexit component Span 80 has RXRα transactivation activity. Span 80 bound to RXRα in the low micromolar range and promoted adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Further, the combination of DOSS and Span 80 increased 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation substantially more than treatment with either chemical individually, likely increasing the obesogenic potential of Corexit dispersants. From a public health standpoint, the use of DOSS and Span 80 as food additives heightens concerns regarding their use and mandates further investigations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty acids in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty acids on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations.A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty acids and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines.Consumption fatty acids like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA:  and palmitoleic  was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty acids that have been associated with the presence or development of , T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty acids (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty acids (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes.Fatty acids can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410667>Comparative effects of high  vs high mixed saturated fatty  obesogenic diets upon PUFA metabolism in mice.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence indicates that the fatty  composition of obesogenic diets influences physiologic outcomes. There are scant data regarding how the content of non-essential fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impact the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that obesogenic diets enriched in  (OA; 18:1n-9) reduce polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels vs an obesogenic diet enriched in SFAs. Adult male mice were fed for eight weeks either (1) a control 16% fat energy (en) diet with 5.7% en OA and 4.4% en SFA, (2) a 50% fat en diet with 33% en OA and 9.9% en SFA, or (3) a 50% en diet with a high SFA diet with 33% en SFA and 9.1% en OA. Dietary levels and intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) and α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3n-3) were constant between the experimental groups. Several peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, and adipose) were analyzed for lipid composition and oxylipin analysis was performed for liver and adipose. Our data demonstrate that a high OA diet reduced tissue content of LA and ALA (≥30%) in phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions, reduced the content of some LA-derived and ALA-derived oxylipins in liver and adipose, and conversely, elevated hepatic content of PGF. In all tissues examined, except for adipose, levels of arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) were either elevated or unaffected by the obesogenic diets. Our data indicate that the non-essential fatty content of obesogenic diets impacts PUFA content in peripheral tissues and influences the levels of bioactive oxylipins.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931080>Cherry Anthocyanins Regulate NAFLD by Promoting Autophagy Pathway.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic disease that threatens human health, and present therapies remain limited due to the lack of effective drugs. Lipid metabolic disturbance and oxidative stress have strong links to the development of NAFLD, while autophagy was generally accepted as a key regulatory mechanism on these steps. Our previous studies indicated that cherry anthocyanins (CACN) protected against high fat diet-induced  and NALFD in C57BL/6 mice, while the underlying molecule mechanism is still unclear. Thus, in this study, we show that CACN protect against - (OA-) induced oxidative stress and attenuate lipid droplet accumulation in NAFLD cell models. According to the results of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), and adenovirus transfection (Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B), autophagy is in accordance with the lipid-lowering effect induced by CACN. Further studies illustrate that CACN may activate autophagy via mTOR pathways. In addition, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), was applied and the result suggested that autophagy indeed participates in the lipid clearance process in OA-induced lipid accumulation. All these results indicate that the positive effects of CACN on OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation are mediated via activating autophagy, showing a potential target for the therapeutic strategy of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754711>10-oxo-12()-octadecenoic , a linoleic  metabolite produced by gut lactic  bacteria, enhances energy metabolism by activation of TRPV1.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota can regulate the host energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms that could involve gut microbiota-derived compounds remain to be understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of KetoA [10-oxo-12()-octadecenoic ]-a linoleic  metabolite produced by gut lactic  bacteria-on whole-body energy metabolism and found that dietary intake of KetoA could enhance energy expenditure in mice, thereby protecting mice from diet-induced . By using Ca imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp methods, KetoA was noted to potently activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and enhance noradrenalin turnover in adipose tissues. In addition, KetoA up-regulated genes that are related to brown adipocyte functions, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT), which was later diminished in the presence of a β-adrenoreceptor blocker. By using obese and diabetic model KK-Ay mice, we further show that KetoA intake ameliorated -associated metabolic disorders. In the absence of any observed KetoA-induced antiobesity effect or UCP1 up-regulation in TRPV1-deficient mice, we prove that the antiobesity effect of KetoA was caused by TRPV1 activation-mediated browning in WAT. KetoA produced in the gut could therefore be involved in the regulation of host energy metabolism.-Kim, M., Furuzono, T., Yamakuni, K., Li, Y., Kim, Y.-I., Takahashi, H., Ohue-Kitano, R., Jheng, H.-F., Takahashi, N., Kano, Y., Yu, R., Kishino, S., Ogawa, J., Uchida, K., Yamazaki, J., Tominaga, M., Kawada, T., Goto, T. 10-oxo-12()-octadecenoic , a linoleic  metabolite produced by gut lactic  bacteria, enhances energy metabolism by activation of TRPV1.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27909891>Canola oil rich in  improves diastolic heart function in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h2><p> is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease.

Our previous studies showed that a high high-saturated -fat diet induced greater bone loss in mice than a high high-unsaturated-fat diet due to increased osteoclast numbers and activity. The impact of elevated FA levels on osteoblasts is not yet clear. We induced  in 4 week old male mice using a palmitic  (PA)- or  (OA)-enriched high fat high-fat diet (HFD) (20 % of calories from FA), and compared them to mice on a normal (R) caloric diet (10 % of calories from FA). We collected serum to determine FA and bone metabolism marker levels. Primary osteoblasts were isolated; cultured in PA, OA, or control (C) medium; and assessed for mineralization activity, gene expression, and ceramide levels. Obese animals in the PA and OA groups had significantly lower serum levels of bone formation markers P1NP and OC compared to normal weight animals (*p < 0.001), with the lowest marker levels in animals on an PA-enriched HFD (*p < 0.001). Accordingly, elevated levels of PA significantly reduced osteoblast mineralization activity in vitro (*p < 0.05). Elevated PA intake significantly increased C16 ceramide accumulation. This accumulation was preventable through inhibition of SPT2 (serine palmitoyl transferase 2) using myriocin. Elevated levels of PA reduce osteoblast function in vitro and bone formation markers in vivo. Our findings suggest that saturated PA can compromise bone health by affecting osteoblasts, and identify a potential mechanism through which  promotes bone loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27399675>The Effect of Resveratrol and Quercetin Treatment on PPAR Mediated Uncoupling Protein (UCP-) 1, 2, and 3 Expression in Visceral White Adipose Tissue from Metabolic Syndrome Rats.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial anion carrier superfamily involved in the control of body temperature and energy balance regulation. They are currently proposed as therapeutic targets for treating  and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We studied the gene expression regulation of UCP1, -2, and -3 in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) from control and MetS rats treated with two doses of a commercial mixture of resveratrol (RSV) and quercetin (QRC). We found that UCP2 was the predominantly expressed isoform, UCP3 was present at very low levels, and UCP1 was undetectable. The treatment with RSV + QRC did not modify UCP3 levels; however, it significantly increased UCP2 mRNA in control and MetS rats in association with an increase in  and linoleic fatty acids. WAT from MetS rats showed a significantly increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ when compared to the control group. Furthermore, PPAR-α protein levels were increased by the highest dose of RSV + QRC in the control and MetS groups. PPAR-γ expression was only increased in the control group. We conclude that the RSV + QRC treatment leads to overexpression of UCP2, which is associated with an increase in MUFA and PUFA, which might increase PPAR-α expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344992>A panel of free fatty  ratios to predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy obese individuals.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences support that metabolically healthy obese (MHO) is a transient state. However, little is known about the early markers associated with the development of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals. Serum free fatty acids (FFAs) profile is highlighted in its association with -related insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). To examine the association of endogenous fatty  metabolism with future development of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals, we retrospectively analyzed 24 [product FFA]/[precursor FFA] ratios in fasting sera and clinical data from 481 individuals who participated in three independent studies, including 131 metabolic healthy subjects who completed the 10-year longitudinal Shanghai Diabetes Study (SHDS), 312 subjects cross-sectionally sampled from the Shanghai  Study (SHOS), and 38 subjects who completed an 8-week very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) intervention study. Results showed that higher baseline level of /stearic  (OA/SA), and lower levels of stearic /palmitic  (SA/PA) and arachidonic /dihomo-γ-linolenic  (AA/DGLA) ratios were associated with higher rate of MHO to MUO conversion in the longitudinal SHDS.

As the most abundant FFA in the bloodstream,  (OA) has the ability to induce adipogenic differentiation in human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs). Recently, p62, an autophagy mediator, has been shown to play a role in  and adipose tissue metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial function at different stages of OA (in combination with insulin and dexamethasone)-induced adipogenesis in hADSCs.The hADSCs were incubated with OA, insulin, and dexamethasone after pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors or knockdown of p62 with shRNA. The adiposeness level was then analyzed by oil red O staining in the cells. The related proteins or mRNA levels were detected by western blot analysis or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Treatment with 80 μM OA (substituted for isobutylmethylxantine; IBMX) for 10 days successfully induced hADSCs to adipocytes. During OA-induced adipogenesis, autophagy was induced, with an increased LC3II/I ratio on day 3 and a decreased protein level of p62 on and after day 3. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3MA) at the early stage (day 0 to day 3) of differentiation, but not at the middle or late stage, significantly decreased OA-induced adipogenesis; while knockdown of p62 with shRNA significantly promoted adipogenesis in hADSCs. Moreover, the copy number of mtDNA (the ND1 gene) and the protein level of TOM20, a mitochondrial membrane protein, were increased following OA treatment, which was related to the stability of mitochondria. Interestingly, knockdown of p62 increased the mito-LC3II/I and cyto-LC3II/I ratios by 110.1% and 73.3%, respectively. The increase in the ratio of mito-LC3II/I was higher than that of cyto-LC3II/I. Furthermore, p62 knockdown-enhanced adipogenesis in hADSCs was abolished by inhibiting mitophagy with cyclosporine A.These results suggested that p62 plays a protective role in adipogenesis of hADSCs through regulating mitophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781592>Antihyperlipidemic Effect, Identification and Isolation of the Lipophilic Components from Artemisia integrifolia.</a></h2><p> L (Compositae) is a medicinal and edible plant. To investigate its antihyperlipidemic effect, a crude lipophilic extract and the composing compounds were isolated and fractioned from the petroleum ether extract of aerial parts of  using column chromatography on silica gel. The anti-hyperlipidemia effect was studied in a rat model of acute hyperlipidemia, which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic  (),  (), linoleic  (), linolenic  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute hyperlipidemia model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and linolenic  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively). These compounds (i.e., chamazulene, acetylenes (E)-2, and linolenic ) were considered to be responsible for the bioactive antihyperlipidemic effect. In conclusion, the crude lipid extract of Artemisia integrifolia L could be used as a potential treatment to avert hyperlipidemia. Further studies to confirm these results in other models of hyperlipidemia (e.g., diet-induced ) are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29655677>An in vitro and in vivo study of a 4-herb formula on the management of diet-induced metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is the cluster of risk factors that leads to increased episodes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These risk factors include but are not limited to , non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti- properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for  and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol).

Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

The aim of this study was to investigate the sub-acute and long term effects of neonatal oral administration of oleanolic  and metformin on lipids (free fatty acids, FFAs) and genes associated with lipid metabolism and glucose transport using a neonatal rat experimental model. In the first study, seven days old pups were randomly grouped into control-distilled water (DW); oleanolic  (60 mg/kg), metformin (500 mg/kg), high fructose diet (20% /, HF), oleanolic  (OA) + high fructose diet (OA + HF), and Metformin + high fructose diet (MET + HF) groups.

However, the role of CD38 in HFD-induced heart injury remains unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the effects and mechanisms of CD38 deficiency on HFD-induced heart injury.The metabolites in heart from wild type (WT) and CD38 knockout (CD38-/-) mice were examined using metabolomics analysis. Cell viability, lactate hydrogenase (LDH) release, super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, triglyceride concentration and gene expression were examined by biochemical analysis and QPCR.Our results revealed that CD38 deficiency significantly elevated the intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration and GSH/GSSG ratio, decreased the contents of free fatty acids and increased intracellular NAD+ level in heart from CD38-/- mice fed with HFD. In addition, in vitro knockdown of CD38 significantly attenuated OA-induced cellular injury, ROS production and lipid synthesis. Furthermore, the expression of mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 as well as its target genes FOXO3 and SOD2 were markedly upregulated in the H9C2 cell lines after OA stimulation. In contrast, the expressions of NOX2 and NOX4 were significantly decreased in the cells after OA stimulation.Our results demonstrated that CD38 deficiency protected heart from HFD-induced oxidative stress via activating Sirt3/FOXO3-mediated anti-oxidative stress pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

This research aimed to perform a phytochemical study guided by a bioassay from  to identify compounds with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  agonist activity, supported by messenger ribonucleic  expression, molecular docking, lipid accumulation, and an antihyperglycemic effect. An oral glucose tolerance test in mice with the aqueous extract of  and the dichloromethane extract of  was performed. The dichloromethane extract of  exhibited an antihyperglycemic effect. The dichloromethane extract of  was fractioned, and four fractions were evaluated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , fatty  transporter protein, and glucose transporter type 4 messenger ribonucleic  expression. Fraction F3 exhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor / dual agonist activity, and a further fractionation yielded two subfractions, F3-1 and F3-2, which also increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  expression. Subfractions were analyzed by GC/MS. The main compounds identified in F3-1 were linoleic , , and palmitic , while in F3-2, the main compounds identified were -amyrin and lupeol. These molecules were subjected to molecular docking analysis. -Amyrin and lupeol showed the highest affinity. Moreover, both produced an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , fatty  transporter protein, and glucose transporter type 4 expression. Additionally, -amyrin and lupeol decreased lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and blood glucose in mice. Until now, -amyrin and lupeol have not been reported with activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. This study provides evidence that -amyrin and lupeol possess antidiabetic effects through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor / dual agonist action.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119530>Decreased lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis are coupled with changes in liver microRNAs in obese subjects with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Many controversies regarding the association of liver miRNAs with  and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) call for additional validations. This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with palmitic  (PA), a combination of palmitate and , or high glucose, and insulin (HG) mimicking insulin resistance in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased lipogenesis and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461456>Elovl6 Deficiency Improves Glycemic Control in Diabetic / Mice by Expanding β-Cell Mass and Increasing Insulin Secretory Capacity.</a></h2><p>Dysfunctional fatty  (FA) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of β-cell dysfunction and loss of β-cell mass in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Elovl6 is a microsomal enzyme that is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated FAs into C18 species. We previously showed that Elovl6 played a critical role in the development of -induced insulin resistance by modifying FA composition. To further define its role in T2D development, we assessed the effects of  deletion in leptin receptor-deficient C57BL/KsJ / mice, a model of T2D. The /; mice had a markedly increased β-cell mass with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis, an adaptive increase in insulin, and improved glycemic control. / islets were characterized by a prominent elevation of oleate (C18:1n-9), cell stress, and inflammation, which was completely suppressed by Elovl6 deletion. As a mechanistic ex vivo experiment, isolated islets from  mice exhibited reduced susceptibility to palmitate-induced inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and β-cell apoptosis. In contrast, oleate-treated islets resulted in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with suppressed related genes irrespective of the Elovl6 gene. Taken together, Elovl6 is a fundamental factor linking dysregulated lipid metabolism to β-cell dysfunction, islet inflammation, and β-cell apoptosis in T2D, highlighting oleate as the potential culprit of β-cell lipotoxicity.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097424>The free fatty  receptor 1 promotes airway smooth muscle cell proliferation through MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.</a></h2><p> is a risk factor for asthma and influences airway hyperresponsiveness, which is in part modulated by airway smooth muscle proliferative remodeling. Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) levels are elevated in obese individuals, and long-chain FFAs act as endogenous ligands for the free fatty  receptor 1 (FFAR1), which couples to both G and G proteins. We examined whether stimulation of FFAR1 induces airway smooth muscle cell proliferation through classical MEK/ERK and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways.

The fatty  ethanolamide, anandamide (AEA), and the monoacylglycerol, 2-arachidonoyl- sn-glycerol (2-AG), are two primary endocannabinoids (ECs) that play a role in regulating food intake, increasing adipose storage, and regulating lipid metabolism.

Two-week exposure to either HFCS- or Asp-sweetened beverages resulted in significant differences in the changes in fasting levels of OEA and DHEA between groups after the testing period. Subjects who consumed Asp, but not HFCS, displayed a reduction in AEA, OEA, and DHEA after the testing period. In contrast, there were significant positive relationships between AEA, OEA, and DHEA vs. ppTG, ppApoCIII, and ppApoE in those consuming HFCS, but not in those consuming Asp.

We verified the effect of differences in culture conditions on  OLL2712 functionality; this strain exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and preventive effects against metabolic disorders. We measured interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 production in murine immune cells treated with OLL2712 cells prepared under various culture conditions. The results showed that the IL-10-inducing activities of OLL2712 cells on murine immune cells differed dramatically between OLL2712 groups at different culture phases and using different culture medium components, temperatures, and neutralizing pHs. In particular, exponential-phase cells had much more IL-10-inducing activity than stationary-phase cells. We confirmed that the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation activity of OLL2712 cells depended on culture conditions in conjunction with IL-10-inducing activity. We also demonstrated functional differences by culture phases ; OLL2712 cells at exponential phase had more anti-inflammatory activity and anti-metabolic-disorder effects on obese and diabetic mice than those by their stationary-phase counterparts. These results suggest that culture conditions affect the functionality of anti-inflammatory LAB. While previous studies demonstrated that culture conditions affected the immunomodulatory properties of lactic  bacteria (LAB), few have comprehensively investigated the relationship between culture conditions and LAB functionality. In this study, we demonstrated several culture conditions of  OLL2712 for higher anti-inflammatory activity. We also showed that culture conditions concretely influenced the health-promoting functions of OLL2712 , particularly against metabolic disorders. Further, we characterized a novel mechanism by which changing LAB culture conditions affected immunomodulatory properties. Our results suggest that culture condition optimization is important for the production of LAB with anti-inflammatory activity.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606629>Trans-Fats Inhibit Autophagy Induced by Saturated Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>Depending on the length of their carbon backbone and their saturation status, natural fatty acids have rather distinct biological effects. Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty , , but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty , palmitic . Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic  (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic , trans-vaccenic  and palmitelaidic , were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by . Elaidic  also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic  in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

VOO is rich in , displaying health-promoting properties, but also contains minor bioactive components, especially phenolic compounds. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), the main polyphenol of olive oil, has been reported to be the most bioactive component. This review aims to compile the results of clinical, animal and cell culture studies evaluating the effects of HT on the features of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) (body weight/adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia/insulin resistance) and associated complications (oxidative stress and inflammation). HT was able to improve the lipid profile, glycaemia, and insulin sensitivity, and counteract oxidative and inflammatory processes. Experimental studies identified multiple molecular targets for HT conferring its beneficial effect on health in spite of its low bioavailability. However, rodent experiments and clinical trials with pure HT at biologically relevant concentrations are still lacking.

Data is lacking about the effect of BSO on GSH precursors, cysteine and glutamate. Plasma total cysteine (tCys) is positively associated with stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity and adiposity in humans and animal models.To explore the phenotype, amino  and fatty  profiles in BSO-treated mice.Male C3H/HeH mice aged 11 weeks were fed a high-fat diet with or without BSO in drinking water (30 mmol/L) for 8 weeks. Amino  and fatty  changes were assessed, as well as food consumption, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, body composition and liver vacuolation (steatosis).Despite higher food intake, BSO decreased particularly fat mass but also lean mass (both P<0.001), and prevented fatty liver vacuolation. Physical activity increased during the dark phase. BSO decreased plasma free fatty acids and enhanced insulin sensitivity. BSO did not alter liver rGSH, but decreased plasma total GSH (tGSH) and rGSH (by ~70%), and liver tGSH (by 82%). Glutamate accumulated in plasma and liver. Urine excretion of cysteine and its precursors was increased by BSO. tCys, rCys and cystine decreased in plasma (by 23-45%, P<0.001 for all), but were maintained in liver, at the expense of decreased taurine. Free and total plasma concentrations of the SCD products,  and palmitoleic acids were decreased (by 27-38%, P <0.001 for all).Counterintuitively, block of GSH synthesis decreases circulating tCys, raising the question of whether the BSO-induced -resistance is linked to cysteine depletion. Cysteine-supplementation of BSO-treated mice is warranted to dissect the effects of cysteine and GSH depletion on energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315213>Nutraceutical Potential of  in Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p> L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs in tropical and subtropical regions.

THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with AA or OA and analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) and Human Exon 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix). Data were corroborated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Comparisons with publicly available data were conducted by standard bioinformatics. AA and OA elicited a complex response marked by a general DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation in the 1-200 μM range, respectively, with a maximal differential response at the 100 μM dose. The divergent response to AA and OA was prominent within the gene body of target genes, where it correlated positively with transcription. AA-induced DNA methylation profiles were similar to the corresponding profiles described for palmitic , atherosclerosis, diabetes, , and autism, but relatively dissimilar from OA-induced profiles. Furthermore, human atherosclerosis grade-associated DNA methylation profiles were significantly enriched in AA-induced profiles. Biochemical evidence pointed to β-oxidation, PPAR-α, and sirtuin 1 as important mediators of AA-induced DNA methylation changes. In conclusion, AA and OA exert distinct effects on the DNA methylome. The observation that AA may contribute to shape the epigenome of important metabolic diseases, supports and expands current diet-based therapeutic and preventive efforts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183494>Hypolipidemic, Antioxidant, and Antiapoptotic Effects of Polysaccharides Extracted from Reishi Mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum (Leysser: Fr) Karst, in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underlying the effect of Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi mushroom) polysaccharides (GLP) on  are not clear.

An in vitro experiment was conducted in which linoleic  (LA), DHA or  (OA) were added to represent the major fatty  in the SBO-, DHA- or BT- diets, respectively. Adipocytes size and lipid metabolism related genes were analyzed.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) was lower in DHA- than in BT-fed pigs, and the product of lipolysis, glycerol was highest in BT-fed pigs. In addition, expression of the lipolytic genes, adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase was higher in BT-fed pigs and with OA treatment in vitro. DHA promoted protein kinase A activity in pigs without affecting lipolytic genes. Adipocyte cell sizes, TAG content and expression of lipogenic-related genes including, adipose differentiated related protein (ADRP) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) were elevated by DHA in vivo and in vitro, indicating DHA promoted adipogenesis to trap TAG in adipose tissue. Fatty  β-oxidation genes were increased in the DHA-fed pigs.This effect was partly explained by the effect of DHA to promote adipogenesis to trap TAG in adipocytes and also increase expression of genes involved in adipocyte fatty  oxidation. Therefore, our results suggest a direct effect of DHA on adipocyte metabolism, resulting in TAG turnover and fatty  dissipation to facilitate plasma lipid uptake from the circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519364> is a novel hypothalamic gene upregulated by a high-fat diet and leptin in mice.</a></h2><p>Energy homeostasis is regulated by the hypothalamus but fails when animals are fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and leptin insensitivity and  develops.

While its main fatty , , is considered important to these effects, EVOO has other biological properties that depend on, or are potentiated by other minor components of this oil. Initially, the mechanisms considered as possible causes of this cardioprotective effect of EVOO were based on the incidence on the so-called traditional risk factors (especially lipids and blood pressure). However, the high relative reduction in the prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were not proportional to the limited findings about regulation of those traditional risk factors.

Here we investigated the role of hepatic lipogenesis, which is elevated in the livers of obese and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, in stimulating the AR pathway for the male preference of  induced HCC.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a fructose-rich high carbohydrate diet (HCD) to induce hepatic lipogenesis. The effect of hepatic lipogenesis on AR was examined by the expression of hydrodynamically injected AR reporter and the endogenous AR target gene; the mechanism was delineated in hepatoma cell lines and validated in male mice.The hepatic lipogenesis induced by a fructose-rich HCD enhanced the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR in male mice, which did not happen when fed a high fat diet. This AR activation was blocked by sh-RNAs or inhibitors targeting key enzymes in lipogenesis, either acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (ACCα), or fatty  synthase (FASN), in vivo and in vitro.

Avocados have an additional LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect beyond that observed when their MUFAs are substituted for SFAs, especially on small, dense LDL (sdLDL) particles, which are susceptible to in vivo oxidation and associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).We investigated whether a healthy diet with 1 avocado daily decreased the following secondary outcomes: circulating oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and related oxidative stress markers.A randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 men and women, aged 21-70 y, with overweight or  and elevated LDL-C (25th-90th percentile). Three cholesterol-lowering diets were provided (5 wk each) in random sequences: a lower-fat (LF) diet (24% calories from fat-7% SFAs, 11% MUFAs, 6% PUFAs) and 2 moderate-fat (MF) diets (34% calories from fat-6% SFAs, 17% MUFAs, 9% PUFAs): the avocado (AV) diet included 1 Hass avocado (∼136 g) per day, and the MF diet used high  oils to match the fatty  profile of 1 avocado. A general linear mixed model was used to analyze the treatment effects.Compared with baseline, the AV diet significantly decreased circulating oxLDL (-7.0 U/L, -8.8%, P = 0.0004) and increased plasma lutein concentration (19.6 nmol/L, 68.7%, P < 0.0001), and both changes differed significantly from that after the MF and LF diets (P ≤ 0.05). The change in oxLDL caused by the AV diet was significantly correlated with the changes in the number of sdLDL particles (r = 0.32, P = 0.0002) but not large, buoyant LDL particles.One avocado a day in a heart-healthy diet decreased oxLDL in adults with overweight and , and the effect was associated with the reduction in sdLDL.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid metabolism are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated adipogenesis by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty  oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic  damages gut epithelium integrity and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during  are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

(Betulaceae), and the fermented traditional Korean medicine Massa Medicata Fermentata, regulates hepatic steatosis and inflammation.The effects of GGH(4) on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats and HepG2 cells were examined using Oil red O, hematoxylin and eosin, and toluidine blue staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) transactivation assay.Administration of GGH(4) to OLETF rats improved hepatic steatosis and lowered serum levels of alanine transaminase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids. GGH(4) increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation enzymes (ACOX, HD, CPT-1, and MCAD) and decreased mRNA levels of lipogenesis genes (FAS, ACC1, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c) in the liver of OLETF rats. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory cytokines (CD68, TNFα, and MCP-1) in liver tissue were reduced by GGH(4). Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, but GGH(4) inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of hepatic fatty  oxidation and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also increased PPARα reporter gene expression. These effects of GGH(4) were similar to those of the PPARα activator fenofibrate, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reversed the inhibitory effects of GGH(4) on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.These results suggest that GGH(4) inhibits -induced hepatic steatosis and that this process may be mediated by regulation of the expression of PPARα target genes and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also suppressed -related hepatic inflammation. Thus, GGH(4) may be a promising drug for the treatment of -related liver diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Polyphenols may almost in part be responsible for the protective effects against cardiovascular diseases associated with olive oil.To review and discuss the available literature on hydroxytyrosol effects as a cardioprotective agent. Moreover, we also discuss the chemistry, nutritional aspects and bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol.Hydroxytyrosol is one of the major phenolic compounds in olive oil and has demonstrated strong radical-scavenging properties. Several studies have been performed in order to look further into the effects of the polyphenol hydroxytyrosol in relation to cardiovascular events and illnesses in animal trials and in vitro. However, no clinical trials have focused on the specific action of hydroxytyrosol and cardiovascular diseases, although some are being undertaken to look at olive oil or olive leaf extract properties.Hydroxytyrosol from olive oil exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation and ati-atherogenic activities in in vitro and animal models.

The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on hyperlipidemia induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated fatty acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately  (54.30%), and saturated fatty acids (palmitic  31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and liver and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO.

On two occasions, participants were given isocaloric (2,660 kJ) and isovolemic (80 ml) loads of either  (long-chain FA) or olive oil (TG) containing radiolabeled lipid and water markers. Postload scintigraphy, blood sampling, and assessment of appetite were performed for 10 h, after which an ad libitum meal was served. Compared with olive oil,  slowed gastric mean emptying time (GMET) for lipids ( P < 0.001), accelerated orocoecal transit time (OCTT; P = 0.005), increased postload cholecystokinin section ( P < 0.001), and suppressed ad libitum energy intake ( P = 0.028) in men with severe , and similar effects were seen in the nonobese group (no group × lipid interactions). However, independent of lipid loads, GMET and OCTT were slower (GMET P = 0.046; GMET P = 0.003; OCTT P = 0.001), and basal and postload secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was attenuated ( P = 0.045 and P = 0.048, respectively) in men with severe  compared with men without . We conclude that the more potent appetite-regulating effects of  versus olive oil are unimpaired in men with severe . However, regardless of lipid formulations, severe  is associated with slowed gastrointestinal transit and attenuated GLP-1 secretion.

We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo-weight and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar metabolism (stearic :  C-SA; palmitic :  C-PA; :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a body mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a body mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

This suggests that the degree of fatty  oxidation (FAO) in these hearts is insufficient to handle the elevated lipid uptake. We previously showed that palmitate impaired the rate of FAO in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here we were interested in characterizing the site of FAO impairment induced by palmitate since it may shed light on the metabolic dysfunction that leads to lipid accumulation in diabetic hearts.We measured fatty  oxidation, acetyl-CoA oxidation, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (Cpt1b) activity. We measured both forward and reverse aconitase activity, as well as NAD+ dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. We also measured reactive oxygen species using the 2', 7'-Dichlorofluorescin Diacetate (DCFDA) assay. Finally we used thin layer chromatography to assess diacylglycerol (DAG) levels.We found that palmitate significantly impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation as well as citric  cycle flux, but not Cpt1b activity. Palmitate negatively affected net aconitase activity and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The impaired enzyme activities were not due to oxidative stress but may be due to DAG mediated PKC activation.This work demonstrates that palmitate, a highly abundant fatty  in human diets, causes impaired β-oxidation and citric  cycle flux in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. This metabolic defect occurs prior to cell death suggesting that it is a cause, rather than a consequence of palmitate mediated lipotoxicity.

LDs accumulation was induced and inhibited by  (OA) and C75, respectively. The expression changes of LDs-related markers were confirmed by semiquantitative real time-PCR (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining.GEN and DAI effectively reduced the LDs accumulation and downregulated the expression of Perilipin-1, ADRP and Tip-47 family proteins and vimentin levels. GEN and DAI significantly induced the mRNA expression of PPAR-γ, Fas, FABP, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT3), and microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP), and reduced the mRNA expression of UCP2. Furthermore, the results showed a decrease of PI3K expression by GEN and DAI when compared with OA treatment, and both GEN and DAI can increase the expression of FOXO3a and caspase-8 significantly when these proteins were decreased by OA treatment. GEN is more effective than DAI in inducing cell apoptosis.Our results demonstrated that GEN and DAI inhibit the accumulation of LDs by regulating LDs-related factors and lead to a final apoptosis of colon cancer cells.

It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Fatty acids, such as  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by fatty acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different fatty acids, including linoleic  (LNA), , palmitic , and stearic . The intracellular lipid accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated fatty acids significantly induced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated fatty -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated fatty -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26729277>Differential Acute Impacts of Sleeve Gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery and Matched Caloric Restriction Diet on Insulin Secretion, Insulin Effectiveness and Non-Esterified Fatty  Levels Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is an increasingly common option for control of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and .

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal , overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to -related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on vascular calcification by the modulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the aortic roots of LepLDLR mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and a greater atheroma plaque size, calcification, and RANKL/CATHK expression in the aortic root than mice on MUFA-enriched diets, with an increasing OPG expression in the aortic roots of the latter. Our study demonstrates that compared to dietary SFAs, MUFAs from olive oil protect against atherosclerosis by interfering with vascular calcification via the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the setting of MetS. These findings open opportunities for developing novel nutritional strategies with olive oil as the most important dietary source of MUFAs (notably ) to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28652194>Adipose tissue conditioned media support macrophage lipid-droplet biogenesis by interfering with autophagic flux.</a></h2><p> promotes the biogenesis of adipose tissue (AT) foam cells (FC), which contribute to AT insulin resistance. Autophagy, an evolutionarily-conserved house-keeping process, was implicated in cellular lipid handling by either feeding and/or degrading lipid-droplets (LDs). We hypothesized that beyond phagocytosis of dead adipocytes, AT-FC biogenesis is supported by the AT microenvironment by regulating autophagy. Non-polarized ("M0") RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to AT conditioned media (AT-CM) exhibited a markedly enhanced LDs biogenesis rate compared to control cells (8.3 Vs 0.3 LDs/cells/h, p<0.005). Autophagic flux was decreased by AT-CM, and fluorescently following autophagosomes over time revealed ~20% decline in new autophagic vesicles' formation rate, and 60-70% decrease in autophagosomal growth rate, without marked alternations in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Suppressing autophagy by either targeting autophagosome formation (pharmacologically, with 3-methyladenine or genetically, with Atg12±Atg7-siRNA), decreased the rate of LD formation induced by . Conversely, interfering with late autophago-lysosomal function, either pharmacologically with bafilomycin-A1, chloroquine or leupeptin, enhanced LD formation in macrophages without affecting LD degradation rate. Similarly enhanced LD biogenesis rate was induced by siRNA targeting Lamp-1 or the V-ATPase. Collectively, we propose that secreted products from AT interrupt late autophagosome maturation in macrophages, supporting enhanced LDs biogenesis and AT-FC formation, thereby contributing to AT dysfunction in .Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Disrupted immune response may contribute to the development of cardiac diseases, while the roles of MD-1 remain elusive. Our studies aimed to explore the functions and molecular mechanisms of MD-1 in -induced cardiomyopathy. H9C2 myocardial cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) containing palmitic  and  to challenge high-fat stimulation and adenoviruses harbouring human MD-1 coding sequences or shRNA for MD-1 overexpression or knockdown in vitro. MD-1 overexpression or knockdown transgenic mice were generated to assess the effects of MD-1 on high-fat diet (HD) induced cardiomyopathy in vivo. Our results showed that MD-1 was down-regulated in H9C2 cells exposed to FFA stimulation for 48 hours and in  mice induced by HD for 20 weeks. Both in vivo and in vitro, silencing of MD-1 accelerated myocardial function injury induced by HD stimulation through increased cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, while overexpression of MD-1 alleviated the effects of HD by inhibiting the process of cardiac remodelling. Moreover, the MAPK and NF-κB pathways were overactivated in MD-1 deficient mice and H9C2 cells after high-fat treatment. Inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB pathways played a cardioprotective role against the adverse effects of MD-1 silencing on high-fat stimulation induced pathological remodelling. In conclusion, MD-1 protected myocardial function against high-fat stimulation induced cardiac pathological remodelling through negative regulation for MAPK/NF-κB signalling pathways, providing feasible strategies for  cardiomyopathy.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this work was to assess the hypothesis that antioxidant-rich extra virgin olive oil (AR-EVOO) counteracts iron-rich diet (IRD)-induced oxidative stress hindering hepatic steatosis. Male Wistar rats were fed and IRD (200 mg iron/kg diet) versus a control diet (CD; 50 mg iron/kg diet) with alternate AR-EVOO supplementation (100 mg/day) for 21 days. IRD induced liver steatosis and oxidative stress (higher levels of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation with glutathione depletion), mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased citrate synthase and complex I and II activities) and loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with a drastic enhancement in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) ratio upregulating the expression of lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  (FA) synthase and stearoyl desaturase 2) and downregulating those involved in FA oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase and acyl-CoA oxidase) over values in the CD group. IRD also upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes. AR-EVOO supplementation alone did not modify the studied parameters, however, IRD combined with AR-EVOO administration returned IRD-induced changes to baseline levels of the CD group. It is concluded that IRD-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevented by AR-EVOO supplementation, which might be related to the protective effects of its components such as hydroxytyrosol, , tocopherols and/or PUFAs, thus representing a suitable anti-steatotic strategy to avoid progression into more severe stages of the disease, underlying NAFLD associated with iron overloading pathologies or .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced  and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti- potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ],  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various -associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited adipogenesis of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied -associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of . This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the -linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with adipogenesis, inflammation, satiety, energy intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules).

Mart.</a></h2><p>Brazil has the greatest vegetal biodiversity in the world, but products derived from native species are not optimally utilized. Oxalis cordata and Xylopia aromatica are two underutilized species whose leaves and fruits, respectively, have been used as food in the 19th century. In this study, we used chemical and in vitro assays to evaluate the potential of these species as functional foods. The inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase and DPP-IV were evaluated using the crude extracts and fractions ethyl acetate, butanol and water of these two species. For polyphenols determination, samples were prepared with different solvents and these were analysed by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Finally, fatty acids profile was determinated by gas chromatography. The crude extract (IC=0.84mg/ml), ethyl acetate extract (IC=0.88mg/ml) an aqueous fraction (IC=0.63mg/ml) of C. cordata were inhibitory on pancreatic lipase but inactive against dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Extracts from X. aromatica were inactive against the lipase pancreatic enzyme, but a butanolic fraction inhibited DPP-IV (IC=0.71±0.05mg/ml). The phenolic acids orientin/isorientin, chlorogenic  (0.32g/100g) and the flavonoid derivatives rutin (0.27g/100g), quercetin and luteolin were observed in all products. Additionally, fatty  quantification showed that  (7.5g/100g) and linoleic  (6.5g/100g) were predominant in X. aromatica fruit.

Nutritional priming of central inflammation and its role in ghrelin sensitivity during fed and fasted states have not been analyzed. The current study aims to identify the effect of maternal programming on microglia activation and ghrelin-induced activation of hypothalamic neurons leading to food intake response. We employed a nutritional programming model exposing female Wistar rats to a cafeteria diet (CAF) from pre-pregnancy to weaning. Food intake in male offspring was determined daily after fasting and subcutaneous injection of ghrelin. Hypothalamic ghrelin sensitivity and microglia activation was evaluated using immunodetection for Iba-1 and c-Fos markers, and Western blot for TBK1 signaling. Release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β after stimulation with palmitic, , linoleic , or C6 ceramide in primary microglia culture were quantified using ELISA. We found that programmed offspring by CAF diet exhibits overfeeding after fasting and peripheral ghrelin administration, which correlates with an increase in the hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos cell activation. Additionally, in contrast to , linoleic, or C6 ceramide stimulation in primary microglia culture, stimulation with palmitic  for 24 h promotes TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β release and TBK1 activation.

Glucolipotoxicity causes cardiomyocyte injury by increasing energy insufficiency, impairing proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and inducing apoptosis. Proteasome-evading proteins are degraded by autophagy in the lysosome, whose metabolism and function are regulated by master regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Limited studies have examined the impact of glucolipotoxicity on intra-lysosomal signaling proteins and their regulators. By utilizing a mouse model of diet-induced , type-1 diabetes (Akita) and ex-vivo model of glucolipotoxicity (H9C2 cells and NRCM, neonatal rat cardiomyocyte), we examined whether glucolipotoxicity negatively targets TFEB and lysosomal proteins to dysregulate autophagy and cause cardiac injury. Despite differential effects of  and diabetes on LC3B-II, expression of proteins facilitating autophagosomal clearance such as TFEB, LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were decreased in the obese and diabetic heart. In-vivo data was recapitulated in H9C2 and NRCM cells, which exhibited impaired autophagic flux and reduced TFEB content when exposed to a glucolipotoxic milieu. Notably, overloading myocytes with a saturated fatty  (palmitate) but not an unsaturated fatty  (oleate) depleted cellular TFEB and suppressed autophagy, suggesting a fatty  specific regulation of TFEB and autophagy in the cardiomyocyte. The effect of glucolipotoxicity to reduce TFEB content was also confirmed in heart tissue from patients with Class-I . Therefore, during glucolipotoxicity, suppression of lysosomal autophagy was associated with reduced lysosomal content, decreased cathepsin-B activity and diminished cellular TFEB content likely rendering myocytes susceptible to cardiac injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the specific mechanism underlying ROS production and OA progression has never been elucidated. Osteoarthritic cartilage was obtained from patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, and chondrocytes were isolated from these tissues. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (10,100,500 μM, and 5 mM) of /palmitate (O/P) mixture at different times, that is at 6, 24, and 48 h. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. ROS production was detected using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The protein levels of NOX4 and cleaved-caspase3 were detected using Western blot assay. O/P significantly decreased cell viability at 10, 100, 500 μM, and 5 mM in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the cell viability was reduced by 500 μM O/P mixture at 6, 24, and 48 h in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with 500 μM O/P significantly enhanced ROS production and cell apoptosis in chondrocytes. Furthermore, treatment with O/P mixture significantly enhanced the expression of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in a dose- and time- dependent manner. More importantly, inhibition of NOX4 could partially eliminate O/P-induced chondrocytes apoptosis by reducing ROS production.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, linoleic  negatively contributed to the variance in glucose (β = -0.321 ± 0.09; P = 0.001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β = -1.05 ± 1.01; P = 0.000).There were no differences in the plasma TG fatty  profile between people with and without abdominal . Likewise, fatty acids in plasma TGs associated with many of the MetS variables independently of abdominal . These results suggest that the plasma TG fatty  profile may help to explain part of the heterogeneity between abdominal  and the MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28072480>Free Fatty Acids Induce Autophagy and LOX-1 Upregulation in Cultured Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.</a></h2><p>Elevation of free fatty acids (FFAs) is known to affect microvascular function and contribute to -associated insulin resistance, hypertension, and microangiopathy. Proliferative and synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) increase intimal thickness and destabilize atheromatous plaques. This study aimed to investigate whether saturated palmitic  (PA) and monounsaturated  (OA) modulate autophagy activity, cell proliferation, and vascular tissue remodeling in an aortic VSMC cell line. Exposure to PA and OA suppressed growth of VSMCs without apoptotic induction, but enhanced autophagy flux with elevation of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3I/II. Cotreatment with autophagy inhibitors potentiated the FFA-suppressed VSMC growth and showed differential actions of PA and OA in autophagy flux retardation. Both FFAs upregulated lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) but only OA increased LDL uptake by VSMCs. Mechanistically, FFAs induced hyperphosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK. All pathways, except OA-activated PI3K/Akt cascade, were involved in the LOX-1 upregulation, whereas blockade of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK cascades ameliorated the FFA-induced growth suppression on VSMCs. Moreover, both FFAs exhibited tissue remodeling effect through increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and their gelatinolytic activities, whereas high-dose OA significantly suppressed collagen type I expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated LOX-1 knockdown significantly attenuated the OA-induced tissue remodeling effects in VSMCs. In conclusion, OA and PA enhance autophagy flux, suppress aortic VSMC proliferation, and exhibit vascular remodeling effect, thereby leading to the loss of VSMCs and interstitial ECM in vascular walls and eventually the instability of atheromatous plaques.

Evidence is growing for the link between , immune dysfunction and oxidative stress, but it is still not known how the properties and functions of the spleen and splenic leucocytes are affected. What is the main finding and its importance?  led to premature immunosenescence, manifested as oxidative stress and changes in leucocyte functions in mouse spleen. The  derivative 2-hydroxyoleate and, to a lesser extent, a combination of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids could reverse most of the observed alterations, suggesting a potential therapeutic tool for -related immune dysfunction and redox imbalance. We aimed to investigate the effects of  on oxidative stress and leucocyte function in the mouse spleen and to assess whether supplementation with 2-hydroxyoleic  (2-OHOA) or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could reverse those effects. Female ICR/CD1 mice (8 weeks old, n = 24) received an obesogenic diet (22% fat for 4 weeks and 60% fat for 14 weeks). After 6 weeks, mice were divided into the following three groups (n = 8 per group): no supplementation; 2-OHOA supplementation (1500 mg kg of diet); and n-3 PUFA supplementation (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , 1500 + 1500 mg kg of diet). Eight mice were fed the standard diet for the whole duration of the study (control group). At the end of the experiment, the following variables were assessed in spleens: levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG, xanthine oxidase activity, lipid peroxidation, lymphocyte chemotaxis, natural killer activity and mitogen (concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide)-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Obese animals presented higher GSSG levels (P = 0.003), GSSG/GSH ratio (P = 0.013), lipid peroxidation (P = 0.004), xanthine oxidase activity (P = 0.015) and lymphocyte chemotaxis (P < 0.001), and lower natural killer activity (P = 0.003) and proliferation in response to concanavalin A (P < 0.001) than control mice. 2-Hydroxyoleic  totally or partly reversed most of the changes (body weight, fat content, GSSG levels, GSH/GSSG, lipid peroxidation, chemotaxis and proliferation, all P < 0.05), whereas n-3 PUFAs reversed the increase in xanthine oxidase activity (P = 0.032). In conclusion, 2-OHOA or, to a lesser extent, n-3 PUFAs could ameliorate the oxidative stress and alteration of leucocyte function in the spleens of obese mice. Our findings support a link between  and immunosenescence and suggest a potential therapeutic tool for -related immune dysfunction.© 2017 The Authors.

In rodents, intragastric infusion of the fatty  amide oleoylethanolamide increases striatal extracellular dopamine levels via vagal afferent signaling. Here we tested whether supplementation with PhosphoLean™, a dietary supplement that contains the precursor of the fatty  amide oleoylethanolamide (N-oleyl-phosphatidylethanolamine), would reduce impulsive responding and alcohol use in heavy drinking young adults. Twenty-two individuals were assigned to a three-week supplementation regimen with PhosphoLean™ or placebo. Impulsivity was assessed with self-report questionnaires and behavioral tasks pre- and post-supplementation. Although self-report measures of impulsivity did not change, supplementation with PhosphoLean™, but not placebo, significantly reduced false alarm rate on a Go/No-Go task. In addition, an association was found between improved sensitivity on the Go/No-Go task and reduced alcohol intake. These findings provide preliminary evidence that promoting fatty  derived gut-brain dopamine communication may have therapeutic potential for reducing impulsivity in heavy drinkers.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Hyperlipidemic rats treated with APNO showed a reduction in the total serum cholesterol similar to those treated with simvastatin, an increased body temperature by 1 °C, and a reduction in the body weight gain and mesenteric depot of white adipose tissue compared to the hyperlipidemic controls rats. There was an increase in the relative liver weight of rats treated with APNO, without, however, any change in the serum markers of hepatic toxicity. In addition, there was an increase in the moisture and lipid content of the feces of the rats treated with APNO compared to the controls.

This work studied the increase in total FFA shown in NAFLD subjects to possibly characterize which fatty acids significantly accounted for the whole increase.21 patients with NAFLD were selected according to specified criteria. The control group consisted of nine healthy subjects. All subjects underwent an oral standard fat load. Triglycerides; cholesterol; FFA; glucose and insulin were measured every 2 h with the determination of fatty  composition of FFA.higher serum FFA levels in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of , palmitic and linoleic acids at different times. Significant increases were shown for docosahexaenoic , linolenic , eicosatrienoic , and arachidonic , although this was just on one occasion. In the postprandial phase, homeostatic model assessment HOMA index positively correlated with the ω3/ω6 ratio in NAFLD patients.the higher serum levels of FFA in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of  and palmitic acids which are the most abundant circulating free fatty acids. This is almost exactly corresponded with significant increases in linoleic . An imbalance in the n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio could modulate postprandial responses with more pronounced effects in insulin-resistant subjects, such as NAFLD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101357>MicroRNA-27a regulates hepatic lipid metabolism and alleviates NAFLD via repressing FAS and SCD1.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs are implicated as crucial mediators in metabolic diseases including , diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Here, we show miR-27a attenuated hepatic de novo lipogenesis and alleviated -initiated NAFLD through inhibiting Fasn and Scd1 in liver. Hepatic levels of miR-27a were significantly augmented in HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Further studies demonstrated that miR-27a directly interacted with 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of hepatic Fasn and Scd1 mRNAs and reduced their expression levels in mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-27a robustly blocked sodium oleate-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes and reduced liver TG contents in mice via repressing hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of hepatic miR-27a impaired lipid contents of livers and attenuated NAFLD development through suppressing lipogenesis in HCD-fed and ob/ob mice. Together, our results reveal a critical role of miR-27a in lipid homeostasis of liver and pathogenesis of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208901>Increased serum concentration of ceramides in obese children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Hepatic lipid accumulation is closely related to the development of insulin resistance, which is regarded as one of the most significant risk factors of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, , behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced liver steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with insulin resistance parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in insulin signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320914>Protein translation associated to PERK arm is a new target for regulation of metainflammation: A connection with hepatocyte cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a cellular phenomenon that has been associated with metabolic disorders, contributing to the development of , fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemias. Under metabolic overload conditions, in cells with a high protein-secretory activity, such as hepatocytes and Langerhans β cells, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is critical in to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis). UPR integrated by a tripartite signaling system, through activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1, regulates gene transcription and translation to resolve stress and conserve proteostasis. In the current study, we demonstrated in hepatocytes under metabolic overload by saturated palmitic and stearic fatty acids, through activation of PERK signaling and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor, an association with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2. More important, isolated exosomes from supernatants of macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharides can also induce a metainflammation phenomenon, and when treated on hepatocytes, induced a rearrangement in cholesterol metabolism through sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein A-I, and ABCA1. Moreover, we demonstrate the cellular effect of terpene-derived molecules, such as cryptotanshinone, isolated of plant Salvia brandegeei, regulating metainflammatory conditions through PERK pathway in both hepatocytes and β cells. Our data suggest the presence of a modulatory mechanism on specific protein translation process. This effect could be mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor-4A, evaluating salubrinal as a control molecule. Likewise, the protective mechanisms of unsaturated fatty acids, such as  and palmitoleic  were confirmed. Therefore, modulation of metainflammation suggests a new target through PERK signaling in cells with a high secretory activity, and possibly the regulation of cholesterol in hepatocytes is promoted via exosomes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029479>Altered materno-fetal transfer of 13C-polyunsaturated fatty acids in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal  at conception is considered a major predictor of offspring . This could by driven at least in part by an altered placental fat transfer. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We investigated the in vivo materno-fetal transfer of fatty acids (FAs) in obese pregnant women using stable isotopes.Ten obese and ten normo-weight pregnant women (control) received orally a bolus of C-labeled FAs 12 h before elective caesarean section:  (C-OA), linoleic  (C-LA) and docosahexaenoic  (C-DHA). Maternal blood samples were collected at -12 (basal), -8, -4, -2, 0 h relative to the time of cesarean section. At the time of birth, arterial and venous cord bloods as well as placental tissue were collected. FAs composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.Maternal plasma insulin and placental weight tended to higher values in obese pregnant women although they did not present serum hyperlipidemia. Higher concentrations of C-LA and C-DHA were found in non-esterified FAs fraction in maternal plasma of obese mothers. The ratio of placental uptake for C-LA and C-DHA was lower in obese women compared to normal weight pointing toward a limited capacity of FA placental transfer, especially of essential FAs. Maternal insulin was associated to this lower placenta/maternal plasma ratio for both C-LA (R = -0.563, P = 0.012) and C-DHA (R = -0.478, P = 0.033). In addition, the ratio cord/maternal plasma of C-LA was significantly lower in obese women compared to controls.In conclusion, obese mothers without hyperlipidemia showed a reduced materno-fetal transfer of polyunsaturated FAs which could affect fetal development.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet. Here, we evaluated the relationship among hepatic mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-AKT2-insulin-induced gene 2 (Insig2) signaling, lipogenic transcription factors and lipid synthesis enzymes in obese mice with or without RYGB operation. Hepatic mTOR activity and Insig2a were stimulated, while AKT2, sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were decreased by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in both DMSO and rapamycin treated diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Increment of hepatic lipogenesis and decline of mTOR signaling induced by rapamycin were significantly reversed by RYGB in DIO mice. RYGB significantly improved high-fat diet- and rapamycin- induced hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo lipogenesis. Administration of adenovirus-mediated p70 ribosomal protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (Ad-S6K1) from tail vein improved hepatic steatosis. Infusion of Ad-S6K1 suppressed AKT2, SREBP1c, PPARγ, and lipogenesis-related genes while stimulating Insig2a in DIO mice. Ad-S6K1 decreased -induced lipid deposition in primary mouse hepatocytes. Our results suggest that mTOR-AKT2-Insig2 signaling pathway contributes to the improvement effect of RYGB on hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat diet.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In such association studies, fatty acids have typically been expressed as the percentage of a particular fatty  relative to the total fatty acids in a sample. Using two human cohorts, this study examined relationships between blood lipids (TAG, and LDL, HDL or total cholesterol) and circulating fatty acids expressed either as a percentage of total or as concentration in serum. The direction of the correlation between stearic , linoleic , dihomo-γ-linolenic , arachidonic  and DHA and circulating TAG reversed when fatty acids were expressed as concentrations v. a percentage of total. Similar reversals were observed for these fatty acids when examining their associations with the ratio of total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol. This reversal pattern was replicated in serum samples from both human cohorts. The correlations between blood lipids and fatty acids expressed as a percentage of total could be mathematically modelled from the concentration data. These data reveal that the different methods of expressing fatty acids lead to dissimilar correlations between blood lipids and certain fatty acids. This study raises important questions about how such reversals in association patterns impact the interpretation of numerous association studies evaluating fatty acids and their relationships with disease biomarkers or risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518550>Oleate disrupts cAMP signaling, contributing to potent stimulation of pancreatic β-cell autophagy.</a></h2><p>Autophagy is critical for maintaining cellular function via clearance of excess nutrients and damaged organelles. In pancreatic β-cells, it helps counter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that impairs insulin secretory capacity during Type 2 diabetes. Chronic exposure of β-cells to saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitate stimulates ER stress and modulates autophagy, but the effects of unsaturated FAs such as oleate, which are also elevated during , are less well understood. We therefore treated MIN6 cells and mouse islets for 8-48 h with either palmitate or oleate, and then monitored autophagic flux, signaling pathways, lysosomal biology, and phospholipid profiles. Compared with palmitate, oleate more effectively stimulated both autophagic flux and clearance of autophagosomes. The flux stimulation occurred independently of ER stress, nutrient-sensing (mTOR) and signaling pathways (protein kinases A, C, and D). Instead the mechanism involved the exchange factor directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2). Oleate reduced cellular cAMP, and its effects on autophagic flux were reproduced or inhibited, respectively, by  knockdown or activation. Oleate also increased lysosomal acidity and increased phospholipid saturation, consistent with improved autophagosomal fusion with lysosomes. We conclude that a potent stimulation of autophagy might help explain the known benefits of unsaturated FAs in countering the toxicity of saturated FAs in β-cells during  and lipid loading.© 2019 Chu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27726181>Tanycytes and a differential fatty  metabolism in the hypothalamus.</a></h2><p>Although the brain controls all main metabolic pathways in the whole organism, its lipid metabolism is partially separated from the rest of the body. Circulating lipids and other metabolites are taken up into brain areas like the hypothalamus and are locally metabolized and sensed involving several hypothalamic cell types. In this study we show that saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are differentially processed in the murine hypothalamus. The observed differences involve both lipid distribution and metabolism. Key findings were: (i) hypothalamic astrocytes are targeted by unsaturated, but not saturated lipids in lean mice; (ii) in obese mice labeling of these astrocytes by unsaturated  cannot be detected unless β-oxidation or ketogenesis is inhibited; (iii) the hypothalamus of obese animals increases ketone body and neutral lipid synthesis while tanycytes, hypothalamic cells facing the ventricle, increase their lipid droplet content; and (iv) tanycytes show different labeling for saturated or unsaturated lipids.

Dietary fat is a fundamental contributor to  and is a risk factor for cancer. Thus far, the impact of dietary olive oil on cancer development remains inconclusive, and little is known about its underlying mechanisms.Nude mouse xenograft models were used to examine the effects of high olive oil diet feeding on cervical cancer (CC) development and progression. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were observed by the methods of EdU incorporation, Wound healing and Transwell assay, separately. RNA-sequencing technology and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were used to elucidate the molecular processes regulated by dietary fat. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and were functionally analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Enrichment of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-PPI network analyses were conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape software.A high olive oil diet aggravated tumourigenesis in an experimental xenograft model of CC. , the main ingredient of olive oil, promoted cell growth and migration in vitro. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of xenograft tumour tissues was then performed to elucidate the regulation of molecular events regulated by dietary fat. Dietary olive oil induced 648 DEGs, comprising 155 up-regulated DEGs and 493 down-regulated DEGs. GO and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that some of the DEGs including EGR1 and FOXN2 were involved in the transcription regulation and others, including TGFB2 and COL4A3 in cell proliferation. The 15 most strongly associated DEGs were selected from the PPI network and hub genes including JUN, TIMP3, OAS1, OASL and EGR1 were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR analysis.Our study suggests that a high olive oil diet aggravates CC progression in vivo and in vitro.

This study investigated the effects of high-fat diets containing different amounts of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on adiposity and adipokine production in mice. Mice were fed a low-fat or a high-fat diet with 16 or 45 % of energy from corn oil (low n3 PUFA) in comparison with a high-fat diet containing soybean or high- sunflower oil (adequate n3 PUFA) or flaxseed or fish oil (high n3 PUFA) for 11 weeks. High-fat diets, regardless of types of oils, significantly increased body fat mass and body weights compared to the low-fat diet. Adipose fatty  composition and contents reflected dietary fatty  profiles. The high-fat fish oil diet significantly increased adiponectin and reduced leptin concentrations in both plasma and adipose tissue; it did not elevate plasma insulin concentration compared to the high-fat corn oil diet. All high-fat diets elevated concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but lowered resistin concentrations in both plasma and adipose tissue. In conclusion, fish oil may be beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity by upregulation of adiponectin and downregulation of leptin production; n3 and n6 PUFA do not play a role at the dietary levels tested in reducing adiposity and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (leptin, PAI-1, MCP-1 and resistin) and anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531121>Diabetic Risk Factors Promote Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Misfolding by a Common, Membrane-mediated Mechanism.</a></h2><p>The current diabetes epidemic is associated with a diverse set of risk factors including  and exposure to plastics.

It remains unclear whether these factors share pathogenic mechanisms and whether links exist with islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) misfolding, a process central to β-cell dysfunction and death. Using a combination of fluorescence, circular dichroism and electron microscopy, we show that phosphatidic , , and the phthalate metabolite MBzP partition into neutral membranes and enhance IAPP misfolding. The elevation of negative charge density caused by the presence of the risk factor molecules stabilizes a common membrane-bound α-helical intermediate that, in turn, facilitates IAPP misfolding.

Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty  (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29432786> induces the novel apolipoprotein O and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in chicken and human hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is marked by hepatic fat accumulation and reflects a spectrum of chronic liver diseases associated with , impaired insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia. Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the plasma apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and electron transport activity of the mitochondrium. However, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Based on our previous data in a non-mammalian experimental system [1], we hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones and oxidative stress. To gain insight into a mammalian experimental system, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells with those in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Incubation of the cells with BSA-complexed  (OA-Alb) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with in-house produced rabbit anti-ApoO antisera demonstrated significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. ROS formation due to OA-Alb treatment was only slightly altered in LMH cells, indicating an intact antioxidant defense system of the cells. Oxidative stress applied by addition of HO revealed induction of ApoO transcript and protein level in the same or even higher extent as monitored in the presence of OA-Alb. Upon treatment with estrogen for 24 h quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein revealed increases of ApoO expression supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism at various points. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA-Alb. Therefore, we assume that our findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Dietary fat triggers the synthesis of oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a regulatory fatty  that signals satiety to reduce food intake mainly by enhancing neural PPARα activity, in enterocytes. We explored OEA's roles in the assembly of lipoproteins in WT and   mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes, Caco-2 cells, and human liver-derived cells. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, OEA increased synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion in chylomicrons, and MTP expression in a dose-dependent manner. OEA also increased MTP activity and triacylglycerol secretion in WT and knockout primary enterocytes. In contrast to its intestinal cell effects, OEA reduced synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion, and MTP expression and activity in human hepatoma Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Also, OEA reduced MTP expression and triacylglycerol secretion in WT, but not knockout, primary hepatocytes. These studies indicate differential effects of OEA on lipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly: in enterocytes, OEA augments glycerolipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly independent of PPARα. Conversely, in hepatocytes, OEA reduces MTP expression, glycerolipid synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion through PPARα-dependent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28145413>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, a novel target of omega-3 fatty acids for reducing breast cancer risk in obese postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Conversion of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids by the enzyme stearoyl-Co-A-desaturase (SCD-1) is emerging as a major factor in promoting carcinogenesis including breast cancer. The aim of our study was to explore the regulation of SCD-1 by Raloxifene and omega-3 fatty acids in women at increased risk of breast cancer based on high breast density.As a reflection of SCD-1 activity, we measured the ratios of palmitoleic  (C16:1n7) to palmitic  (C16:0) (SCD-16) and  (C18:1n9) to steric  (C18:0) (SCD-18) in plasma samples of postmenopausal women enrolled in our clinical trial () designed to test the effects of the antiestrogen, Raloxifene and/or the omega-3 preparation Lovaza, on breast density, a validated biomarker of breast cancer risk.We report that Lovaza but not Raloxifene-reduced SCD-16 and SCD-18 for the 2-year duration of the trial. Importantly, decreasing levels of SCD-16 and SCD-18 were associated with a progressive reduction in breast density but only in obese women (body mass index ⩾30).Body mass index-related factors play an important role in the reduction of breast density and hence breast cancer risk by omega-3 fatty acids. SCD-1 may be a useful biomarker in future clinical trials testing the benefit of nutritional interventions in reducing -associated breast cancer risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934807>Nifedipine Modulates Renal Lipogenesis via the AMPK-SREBP Transcriptional Pathway.</a></h2><p>Lipid accumulation in renal cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of -related kidney disease, and lipotoxicity in the kidney can be a surrogate marker for renal failure or renal fibrosis. Fatty  oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to  was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating nifedipine-induced lipid accumulation in the kidney.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241988>Sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 reverses  but not age-induced anabolic resistance to muscle contraction.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is coupled with declines in physical functioning leading to subsequent higher rates of disability, frailty, morbidity, and mortality. Aging and  independently contribute to muscle atrophy that is assumed to be a result of the activation of mutual physiological pathways. Understanding mechanisms contributing to the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy with aging and  is important for determining targets that may have pivotal roles in muscle loss in these conditions. We find that aging and  equally induce an anabolic resistance to acute skeletal muscle contraction as observed with decreases in anabolic signaling activation after contraction. Furthermore, treatment with the sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 for 4 wk increased lean mass and strength, and the anabolic signaling response to contraction was improved in obese but not older animals. To determine the role of chronic inflammation and different fatty acids on anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle cells, we overexpressed IKKβ with and without exposure to saturated fatty  (SFA; palmitic ), polyunsaturated fatty  (eicosapentaenoic ), and monounsaturated fatty  (). We found that IKKβ overexpression increased inflammation markers in muscle cells, and this chronic inflammation exacerbated anabolic resistance in response to SFA. Pretreatment with FTY720 reversed the inflammatory effects of palmitic  in the muscle cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate chronic inflammation can induce anabolic resistance, SFA aggravates these effects, and FTY720 can reverse this by decreasing ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031723>Inhibition of cholinergic potentiation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets by chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids: Protection by casein kinase 2 inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Chronic hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are characteristic features of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are thought to cause or contribute to β-cell dysfunction by "glucolipotoxicity." Previously we have shown that acute treatment of pancreatic islets with fatty acids (FA) decreases acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion. This acetylcholine response is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, which play a key role in regulating β-cell function. Here we examine whether chronic FA exposure also inhibits acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion using mouse and human islets.Islets were cultured for 3 or 4 days at different glucose concentration with 0.5 mM palmitic  (PA) or a 2:1 mixture of PA and  (OA) at 1% albumin (PA/BSA molar ratio 3.3). Afterwards, the response to glucose and acetylcholine were studied in perifusion experiments.FA-induced impairment of insulin secretion and Ca signaling depended strongly on the glucose concentrations of the culture medium. PA and OA in combination reduced acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion more than PA alone, both in mouse and human islets, with no evidence of a protective role of OA. In contrast, lipotoxicity was not observed with islets cultured for 3 days in medium containing less than 1 mM glucose and a mixture of glutamine and leucine (7 mM each). High glucose and FAs reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca storage capacity; however, preserving ER Ca by blocking the IP3 receptor with xestospongin C did not protect islets from glucolipotoxic effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, an inhibitor of casein kinase 2 (CK2) protected the glucose dependent acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion in mouse and human islets against glucolipotoxicity.These results show that chronic FA treatment decreases acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion and that this effect is strictly glucose dependent and might involve CK2 phosphorylation of β-cell M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The likely protection provided by grape seed extract (GSSE) was also investigated.In order to assess HFD effect on lung and GSSE protection we used a rat model. We analyzed the lipid plasma profile, lung peroxidation and antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT and POD). We also analyzed transition metals (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and iron) and lung free fatty acids using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS).HFD induced lipid profile imbalance increasing cholesterol and VLDL-C. HFD also induced an oxidative stress assessed by elevated MDA level and the drop of antioxidant activities such as SOD, CAT and POD. Moreover, HFD induced mineral disturbances by decreasing magnesium level and increasing Calcium and iron levels. HFD induced also disturbances in lung fatty  composition by increasing , stearic and arachidonic acids. Interestingly, GSSE alleviated all these deleterious effects of HFD treatment.As a whole, GSSE had a significant preventive effect against HFD-induced , and hence may be used as an anti- agent, and a benefic agent with potential applications against damages in lung tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28982243>Solanum nigrum Polyphenol Extracts Inhibit Hepatic Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Lipogenesis in High-Fat-Diet-Treated Mice.</a></h2><p>Patients with diabetes, , and hyperlipidemia are all high-risk groups for fatty liver; however, the mechanism of fatty liver formation is not completely understood. Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29663374> promotes prostate cancer malignant phenotype via the G protein-coupled receptor FFA1/GPR40.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in industrialized countries. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that  promotes aggressive PCa. Recently, a family of Free Fatty  (FFA) receptors (FFARs) has been identified and reported to affect several crucial biological functions of tumor cells such as proliferation, invasiveness, and apoptosis. Here we report that  (OA), one of the most prevalent FFA in human plasma, increases proliferation of highly malignant PC3 and DU-145 PCa cells. Furthermore, docetaxel cytotoxic action, the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of androgen-independent PCa, was significantly reduced in the presence of OA, when measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, suggesting that this FFA plays also a role in chemoresistance. OA induced intracellular calcium increase, in part due to the store operated calcium entry (SOCE), measured by a calcium imaging technique. Moreover, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was enhanced, as revealed by increased Akt phosphorylation levels. Intriguingly, attenuating the expression of FFA1/GPR40, a receptor for long chain FFA including OA, prevented the OA-induced effects. Of relevance, we found that FFA1/GPR40 is significantly overexpressed in tissue specimens of PCa, compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, at both mRNA and protein expression level, analyzed by Real Time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments, respectively. Our data suggest that OA promotes an aggressive phenotype in PCa cells via FFA1/GPR40, calcium and PI3K/Akt signaling. Thus, FFA1/GPR40, might represent a potential useful prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced PCa.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668424>Lycopus lucidus Turcz. ex Benth.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce  and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related  and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

It is well established in terms of the plasma concentrations of free fatty  (FFA) that are up-regulated in cases associating with .  (OA) is known as the most abundant monounsaturated fatty  in the human circulatory system. Several pro-atherosclerotic responses of OA have been established. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) acts as a key role in regulating the normal physical function in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SIRT1 activation is developed as a novel approach to delay the progression of atherosclerotic injuries. However, the mechanism is still unclear as to whether OA affects SIRT1 expression and its activity in SMCs. We confirmed that OA treatment represses SIRT1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ levels in SMCs. Moreover, OA enhances by transforming the growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) release via activation of NF-κB. OA causes NO production by inducing the inducible nitric oxide synthase overexpression, thereby promoting the secretions of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-3. Overall, we suggested that OA enhances MMPs activation through SIRT1 down-regulation. Therefore, our findings might provide a novel route for developing new therapeutic treatments for FFAs-related CADs.© The Authors 2016.

We previously showed that saturated dietary fat induces pancreatic acinar lipotoxicity and cellular stress. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of exocrine pancreas cells is highly developed and thus predisposed to stress. We studied the combination of saturated and unsaturated FAs in metabolic and pancreatitis like cerulein (CER)-induced stress states on cellular ER stress.Exocrine pancreas AR42J and rat primary exocrine acinar cells underwent acute (24 h) challenge with different FAs (saturated, monounsaturated) at different concentrations (250 and 500 µM) and in combination with acute CER-induced stress, and were analyzed for fat accumulation, ER stress unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune and enzyme markers. Acute exposure of AR42J and pancreatic acinar cells to different FAs and their combinations increased triglyceride accumulation. Palmitic  significantly dose-dependently enhanced the UPR, immune factors and pancreatic lipase (PL) levels, as demonstrated by XBP1 splicing and elevation in UPR transcripts and protein levels ( and ). Exposure to high palmitic levels in a CER-induced stress state synergistically increased ER stress and inflammation marker levels. Exposure to  did not induce ER stress and PL levels and significantly decreased immune factors in an acute CER-induced stress state. Combination of  and palmitic acids significantly reduced the palmitic-induced ER stress, but did not affect the immune factor response. We show that combination of monounsaturated and saturated FAs protects from exocrine pancreatic cellular ER stress in both metabolic and CER-induced stress.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378038>Cashew Nut Consumption Increases HDL Cholesterol and Reduces Systolic Blood Pressure in Asian Indians with Type 2 Diabetes: A 12-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>There is increasing evidence that nut consumption decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there are few data on the health effects of cashew nuts among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).The study aimed to investigate the effects of cashew nut supplementation on glycemia, body weight, blood pressure, and lipid profile in Asian Indians with T2DM.In a parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial, 300 adults with T2DM [mean ± SD age: 51 ± 9.3 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 26.0 ± 3.4; 55% male] were randomly assigned to receive advice to follow a standard diabetic diet (control) or similar advice plus 30 g cashew nuts/d (intervention) for 12 wk. The macronutrient composition of the prescribed diabetic diet was 60-65% energy from carbohydrates, 15-25% from fat, and the rest from protein. Differences between groups in changes in anthropometric and biochemical variables were analyzed using linear models with robust variance estimation under an assumed independence working correlation.Participants in the intervention group had a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 wk than did controls (-4.9 ± 13.7 compared with -1.7 ± 11.6 mm Hg; P = 0.04) and a greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol compared with controls (+1.7 ± 5.6 compared with +0.1 ± 4.6 mg/dL; P = 0.01).

The fatty acids profiles can be altered by fatty  desaturase; the activity of which is highly associated with  and other metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that fatty  composition, desaturase activity, and accumulation of visceral fat are interrelated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects with different amounts of visceral fat.Healthy overweight subjects (25.0 kg/m ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m, n=232) were classified into lower (T1), middle (T2), and upper tertiles (T3) according to L4 visceral fat area (T1: <71.8 cm, T2: 71.8 cm-99.6 cm, T3: >99.6 cm).The T3 group showed higher amounts of cis-10-heptadecenoic  and activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase and lower activity of Δ5-desaturase than the T1 group. Additionally, the T3 group showed higher amounts of saturated fatty acids, myristic , palmitic , stearic , monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , , n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic , dihomo-γ-linolenic , arachidonic , n-3 PUFAs, and docosapentaenoic  than the T1 and T2 groups.This study indicates that greater than a certain area (>99.6 cm) of visceral fat is needed to observe altered levels of individual fatty  species and desaturase activities.

The increase of intracellular Ca triggers insulin granule release, therefore several mechanisms regulate Ca efflux within the β-cells, among others, the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA). In this work, we describe that lipotoxicity mediated mainly by the saturated palmitic  (PA) (16C) is associated with loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and potentially cell viability, a phenomenon that was induced to a lesser extent by stearic (18C), myristic (14C) and lauric (12C) acids. PA was localized on endoplasmic reticulum, activating arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as also promoted by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxins. In particular, our findings demonstrate an alteration in PMCA1/4 expression caused by PA and LPS which trigger the UPR, affecting not only insulin release and contributing to β-cell mass reduction, but also increasing reactive nitrogen species. Nonetheless, stearic  (SA) did not show these effects. Remarkably, the proteolytic degradation of PMCA1/4 prompted by PA and LPS was avoided by the action of monounsaturated fatty acids such as  and palmitoleic .  recovered cell viability after treatment with PA/LPS and, more interestingly, relieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. While palmitoleic  improved the insulin release, this fatty  seems to have more relevant effects upon the expression of regulatory pumps of intracellular Ca. Therefore, chain length and unsaturation of fatty acids are determinant cues in proteostasis of β-cells and, consequently, on the regulation of calcium and insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845147>Dietary fatty  composition impacts plasma fatty  ethanolamide levels and body composition in golden Syrian hamsters.</a></h2><p>Fatty  ethanolamides (FAEs) are a class of lipid amides that regulate numerous pathophysiological functions. To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall body composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high  canola oil:docosahexaenoic ; H+EPA, 85:15 high  canola oil:eicosapentaenoic ; HOCO, high  canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on energy expenditure and overall body composition to determine if dietary fatty  (DFA) composition affects diet-induced  (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of body composition, energy expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy body weight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710138>Disruption of Lipid Uptake in Astroglia Exacerbates Diet-Induced .</a></h2><p>Neuronal circuits in the brain help to control feeding behavior and systemic metabolism in response to afferent nutrient and hormonal signals. Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate energy homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by , whereas it is decreased in response to palmitic  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated body weight gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic insulin resistance. We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution, body weight regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922115>Perilipin 5 fine-tunes lipid oxidation to metabolic demand and protects against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LD) play a central role in lipid homeostasis by controlling transient fatty  (FA) storage and release from triacylglycerols stores, while preventing high levels of cellular toxic lipids. This crucial function in oxidative tissues is altered in  and type 2 diabetes. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is a LD protein whose mechanistic and causal link with lipotoxicity and insulin resistance has raised controversies. We investigated here the physiological role of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle upon various metabolic challenges. We show that PLIN5 protein is elevated in endurance-trained (ET) subjects and correlates with muscle oxidative capacity and whole-body insulin sensitivity. When overexpressed in human skeletal muscle cells to recapitulate the ET phenotype, PLIN5 diminishes lipolysis and FA oxidation under basal condition, but paradoxically enhances FA oxidation during forskolin- and contraction- mediated lipolysis. Moreover, PLIN5 partly protects muscle cells against lipid-induced lipotoxicity. In addition, we demonstrate that down-regulation of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle inhibits insulin-mediated glucose uptake under normal chow feeding condition, while paradoxically improving insulin sensitivity upon high-fat feeding. These data highlight a key role of PLIN5 in LD function, first by finely adjusting LD FA supply to mitochondrial oxidation, and second acting as a protective factor against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124885>Oleoylethanolamide: The role of a bioactive lipid amide in modulating eating behaviour.</a></h2><p>Fatty  ethanolamides are lipid mediators that regulate a plethora of physiological functions. One such bioactive lipid mediator, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a potent agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), which modulates increased expression of the fatty  translocase CD36 that enables the regulation of feeding behaviour. Consumption of dietary fat rich in  activates taste receptors in the gut activating specific enzymes that lead to the formation of OEA. OEA further combines with PPAR-α to enable fat oxidation in the liver, resulting in enhanced energy production. Evidence suggests that sustained ingestion of a high-fat diet abolishes the anorexic signal of OEA. Additionally, malfunction of the enterocyte that transforms  produced during fat digestion into OEA might be responsible for reduced satiety and hyperphagia, resulting in overweight and . Thus, OEA anorectic signalling may be an essential element of the physiology and metabolic system regulating dietary fat intake and . The evidence reviewed in this article indicates that intake of , and thereby the resulting OEA imparting anorexic properties, is dependent on CD36, PPAR-α, enterocyte fat sensory receptors, histamine, oxytocin and dopamine; leading to increased fat oxidation and enhanced energy expenditure to induce satiety and increase feeding latency; and that a disruption in any of these systems will cease/curb fat-induced satiety.© 2017 World  Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290354>Palmitate and oleate co-treatment increases myocellular protein content via impaired protein degradation.</a></h2><p>Protein balance is a crucial determinant of myocellular size and function. The effects of fatty acids on myocellular protein balance remain controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the direct effects of a mixed-species fatty  environment on myocellular protein synthesis and degradation.C2C12 myotubes were cultured in media containing equimolar (250 μM) palmitic  and oleate (PO) or bovine serum albumin control for ≤72 h. Myocellular protein balance was determined via incorporation (synthesis) or release (degradation) of H-tyrosine after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. Expression of major proteolytic genes was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.PO significantly increased myocellular protein content at 24, 48, and 72 h. Basal myocellular protein synthesis was unchanged by PO. However, PO significantly decreased basal rate of protein degradation at 24 h and this effect persisted throughout 72 h of treatment. Expression of the proteolytic genes Atrogin-1 (MAFbx), MuRF-1, LC3, and ATG4 B, was reduced during the 72 h PO.A mixed-species fatty  environment increases myocellular protein content by decreasing the rate of protein degradation, which may be regulated at the level of gene transcription.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are involved in this pathogenesis as they jeopardize oocyte and embryo development. Growing evidence indicates that maternal metabolic disorders can disturb epigenetic programming, such as DNA methylation, in the offspring. Oocyte maturation and early embryo development coincide with methylation changes and both are sensitive to adverse environments. Therefore, we investigated whether elevated NEFA concentrations affect establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in oocytes and embryos, subsequently altering transcriptomic profiles and developmental competence of resultant blastocysts.Bovine oocytes and embryos were exposed to different NEFA concentrations in separate experiments. In the first experiment, oocytes were matured in vitro for 24 h in medium containing: 1) physiological ("BASAL") concentrations of  (OA), palmitic (PA) and stearic (SA)  or 2) pathophysiological ("HIGH COMBI") concentrations of OA, PA and SA. In the second experiment, zygotes were cultivated in vitro for 6.5 days under BASAL or HIGH COMBI conditions. Developmental competence was evaluated by assessing cleavage and blastocyst rate. Overall gene expression and DNA methylation of resultant blastocysts were analyzed using microarray. DNA methylation data were re-evaluated by pyrosequencing. HIGH COMBI-exposed oocytes and embryos displayed a lower competence to develop into blastocysts compared to BASAL-exposed counterparts (19.3% compared to 23.2% and 18.2% compared to 25.3%, respectively) (P < 0.05). HIGH COMBI-exposed oocytes and embryos resulted in blastocysts with altered DNA methylation and transcriptomic fingerprints, compared to BASAL-exposed counterparts. Differences in gene expression and methylation were more pronounced after exposure during culture compared to maturation suggesting that zygotes are more susceptible to adverse environments. Main gene networks affected were related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cell death, immune response and metabolic disorders.Overall, high variation in methylation between blastocysts made it difficult to draw conclusions concerning methylation of individual genes, although a clear overview of affected pathways was obtained. This may offer clues regarding the high rate of embryonic loss and metabolic diseases during later life observed in offspring from mothers displaying lipolytic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282405>Deletion of Gab2 in mice protects against hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis: a novel therapeutic target for fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Fatty liver disease is a serious health problem worldwide and is the most common cause for chronic liver disease and metabolic disorders. The major challenge in the prevention and intervention of this disease is the incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanism and thus lack of potent therapeutic targets due to multifaceted and interdependent disease factors. In this study, we investigated the role of a signaling adaptor protein, GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (Gab2), in fatty liver using an animal disease model. Gab2 expression in hepatocytes responded to various disease factor stimulations, and Gab2 knockout mice exhibited resistance to fat-induced , fat- or alcohol-stimulated hepatic steatosis, as well as methionine and choline deficiency-induced steatohepatitis. Concordantly, the forced expression or knockdown of Gab2 enhanced or diminished  (OA)- or ethanol-induced lipid production in hepatocytes in vitro, respectively. During lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, both fat and alcohol induced the recruitment of PI3K or Socs3 by Gab2 and the activation of their downstream signaling proteins AKT, ERK, and Stat3. Therefore, Gab2 may be a disease-associated protein that is induced by pathogenic factors to amplify and coordinate multifactor-induced signals to govern disease development in the liver. Our research provides a novel potential target for the prevention and intervention of fatty liver disease.© The Author (2016).

Also, the effects of these FAs were tested when the GPR120 gene was silenced.In adipocytes from non-obese subjects, palmitic and linoleic acids increased TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression (p < 0.05), and decreased IL-10 and adiponectin expression (p < 0.05). However,  and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) produced the opposite effect (p < 0.05). In adipocytes from MO subjects, all FAs used increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression (p < 0.05). Palmitic and linoleic acids decreased IL-10 and adiponectin expression (p < 0.05), but  and DHA did not have significant effects. Only  increased adiponectin expression (p < 0.05). The effects of FAs on TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and adiponectin expression in non-obese and MO subjects were significantly annulled when the GPR120 gene was silenced in visceral adipocytes differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells.FAs are capable of directly acting on visceral adipocytes to modulate differently TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and adiponectin expression, with a different and greater effect in MO subjects. These effects are largely annulled when GPR120 expression was silenced, which suggests that they could be mediated by GPR120.</p></html>
