To assess the metabolic status of patients and to detect any possible associations between LCN2 and MetS. To evaluate the effect of narrow-band ultraviolet  (NBUVB) on tissue LCN2 in .This case-control study was conducted on 25 psoriatic patients and 25 healthy controls. Dyslipidemia and MetS have been evaluated. Tissue LCN2 was estimated using ELISA technique before and after treatment with NBUVB.Tissue LCN2 was significantly higher in , with no significant difference as regards dyslipidemia or metabolic disturbance in these patients. Both lesional and non-lesional LCN2 and PASI score dropped significantly after NBUVB. No significant correlations have been detected between tissue LCN2 and disease extent or PASI score. Significant positive correlations were detected regarding tissue LCN2 levels between lesional and non-lesional samples before and after treatment.Psoriatic patients were at higher risk of metabolic disorders. LCN2 was not related to metabolic disturbances in our patients. NBUVB might exert its therapeutic effect in  through reduction of tissue LCN2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745974>The Decline of PUVA Therapy in Vietnam: Effective Treatment of Narrow Band UVB in Vietnamese Vitiligo Patients.</a></h2><p>To examine the efficacy and safety of Narrowband ultraviolet  (NB-UVB) in Vietnamese vitiligo patients.We recruited thirty-one patients (14 males, 17 females), aged from 7 to 67 years, with both segmental vitiligo (SV) and non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), treated three times weekly with NB-UVB. The starting dose for adults from 15 years old and children less than 15 years old was 200 mJ/cm and 150 mJ/cm, respectively, with 50 mJ/cm and 20 mJ/cm dose increments at each subsequent visit, respectively, until mild erythema lasting less than 24 hrs reported by patient, given for a period of 6 months. Response to therapy was assessed based on VASI score changes.Based upon our results, 38.7% (12/31) of patients achieved a very good response of more than 50% VASI changes, 41.9% (13/31) obtained a good response (VASI changed from 25 to 50%). Total good and very good response to therapy significantly increased with prolonged treatment, increasing from 19.4% to 64.5% and 80.6% after 2, 4 and 6 months, respectively. Localised NSV patients obtained good and very good response significantly more frequently than generalised NSV (55.6% versus 18.2%). Adverse effects were minimal, of which one case developed herpes simplex, and 4 cases reported mild photo burn reaction which completely disappeared after adjusting the dose.NB-UVB therapy is an effective and safe tool in the management of Vietnamese vitiligo patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485194>Implication of IL-17 in Bone Loss and Structural Damage in Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the systemic and focal bone loss associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. Targeting these cytokines with biologics and small molecules has led to a major improvement of the bone health of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Cytokines from the IL-17 family have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or . IL-17A has been the first described and the most studied. The recent development of targeted therapies against IL-17A or its receptor and their efficacy has confirmed the importance of this cytokine in the development of inflammatory diseases. The aim of this review was to describe the effects of the IL-17 family and more particularly of IL-17A on bone and cartilage tissues. At the cellular level, IL-17A is proosteoclastogenic whereas its effects on osteoblasts depend on the stage of differentiation of these cells. , IL-17A is not required for normal bone homeostasis but plays an important role in bone loss notably in an ovariectomized mouse model of osteoporosis. Preliminary data from clinical trials showed a stabilisation of bone density in patients treated with anti-IL-17A antibodies. IL-17A plays a central role in the cartilage damage through the induction of collagenases and by decreasing the expression of their inhibitors in synergy with the other proinflammatory cytokines. The prevention of structural damage by anti-IL-17A therapies has been demonstrated in several pivotal clinical trials. Overall, blocking the IL-17A pathway seems to have a positive effect on the bone and cartilage damage observed in inflammatory arthritis. Differences and specificity of these effects compared to those already described with other biologics such as anti-TNF therapies remain to be explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212138>Nanostructured supramolecular hydrogels: Towards the topical treatment of  and other skin diseases.</a></h2><p>Supramolecular hydrogels were synthesized using a bis-imidazolium based amphiphile, and incorporating chemically diverse drugs, such as the cytostatics gemcitabine hydrochloride and methotrexate sodium salt, the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus, as well as the corticoid drugs betamethasone 17-valerate and triamcinolone acetonide, and their potential as drug delivery agents in the dermal treatment of  was evaluated. The rheological behavior of gels was studied, showing in all cases suitable viscoelastic properties for topical drug delivery. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the drugs included have a great influence on the gel morphology at the microscopic level, as the incorporation of gemcitabine hydrochloride leads to slightly thicker fibers, the incorporation of tacrolimus induces flocculation and spherical precipitates, and the incorporation of methotrexate forms curled fibers. H NMR spectroscopy experiments show that these drugs not only remain dissolved at the interstitial space, but up to 72% of either gemcitabine or methotrexate, and up to 38% of tacrolimus, is retained within the gel fibers in gels formed with a 1:1 gelator:drug molar ratio. This unique fiber incorporation not only protects the drug from degradation, but also importantly induces a Two Phase Exponential drug release, where the first phase corresponds to the drug dissolved in the interstitial space, while the second phase corresponds to the drug exiting from the gel fibers, and where the speed in each phase is in accordance with the physicochemical properties of the drugs, opening perspectives for controlled delivery. Skin permeation ex vivo tests show how these gels successfully promote the drug permeation and retention inside the skin for reaching their therapeutic target, while in vivo experiments demonstrate that they decrease the hyperplasia and reduce the macroscopic tissue damage typically observed in psoriatic skin, significantly more than the drugs in solution. All these characteristics, beside the spontaneous and easy preparation (room temperature and soft stirring), make these gels a good alternative to other routes of administration for  treatment, increasing the drug concentration at the target tissue, and minimizing side effects.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier .V.

Nevertheless, the incidence of skin cancers continues to increase in most light-skinned populations, probably due mainly to risky sun exposure behaviour. In locations with strong sun protection programs of long duration, incidence is now reducing in younger age groups. Changes in the epidemiology of UV-induced eye diseases are less clear, due to a lack of data. Exposure to UV radiation plays a role in the development of cataracts, pterygium and possibly age-related macular degeneration; these are major causes of visual impairment world-wide. Photodermatoses and phototoxic reactions to drugs are not uncommon; management of the latter includes recognition of the risks by the prescribing physician. Exposure to UV radiation has benefits for health through the production of vitamin D in the skin and modulation of immune function. The latter has benefits for skin diseases such as  and possibly for systemic autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The health risks of sun exposure can be mitigated through appropriate sun protection, such as clothing with both good UV-blocking characteristics and adequate skin coverage, sunglasses, shade, and sunscreen. New sunscreen preparations provide protection against a broader spectrum of solar radiation, but it is not clear that this has benefits for health. Gaps in knowledge make it difficult to derive evidence-based sun protection advice that balances the risks and benefits of sun exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977931>Increased incidence of ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in  patients with depression: a nationwide retrospective cohort study.</a></h2><p> is known to confer a higher risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, very few studies have investigated whether the development of depression in  patients may further increase this vascular risk.We investigated the risk of ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in Taiwanese  patients with and without depression.A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study was performed using the National Health Insurance Research Database. We included 604  patients with depression, who were matched to 2416  patients without depression (1Â :Â 4 ratio). Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, with adjustment for demographic characteristics and comorbidities.Compared with  patients without depression,  patients with depression had greater risk of developing incident ischaemic heart disease (19.5% vs. 8.3%, adjusted RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.57-2.49), cerebrovascular disease (15.6% vs. 5.9%, adjusted RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.76-2.98), and either ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease (28.3% vs. 12.5%, adjusted RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.60-2.35). Subgroup analysis showed that in  patients with depression, a higher risk of incident ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease was present in age groups 30-100Â years, in both males and females, and in both lower and higher income categories.Depression is an independent risk factor for incident ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in patients with . Therefore, clinicians need to be vigilant for the increased vascular risk in  patients with depression.Â© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789012>Practical Guidelines for Managing Patients With  on Biologics: An Update.</a></h2><p>The paradigm for treating inflammatory diseases has shifted dramatically in the past 10 to 20 years with the discovery of targeted therapeutics or "biologic" agents. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, and , among others, are reaping the benefits of decades of bench to bedside research, allowing them to live more productive lives with less side effects than traditional systemic therapies. Despite these advances, many physicians unfamiliar with biologics are left to care for the basic needs of these patients and may be unaware of the multisystem comorbidities associated with  and the screening, monitoring, and other special considerations required of biologics patients.

The pathogenesis of  is complicated, and typical therapeutic strategies for  mainly focus on anti-inflammation. Considering the side effects, withdrawal rebound, high cost, and many other disadvantages of existing treatments, we developed a new topical therapeutic formulation consisting of niosomes loaded with celastrol, a triterpenoid extracted from Tripterygium. Celastrol niosomes were prepared by the thin film hydration method and probe sonication. The niosomes were composed of Span 20, Span 60, and cholesterol at a weight ratio of 3:1:1. The particle size of the niosomes was approximately 147ânm, with yield of up to 90%. Celastrol niosomes showed improved in vitro permeation ability compared to the raw drug. In our in vivo study, celastrol niosomes effectively alleviated erythema and scaling on the dorsal skin of  mouse models. Spleen weight and the levels of cytokines, including IL-22, IL-23, and IL-17, decreased after the treatment, indicating the high therapeutic potential of this formulation for . In conclusion, encapsulation of celastrol by niosomes increased the water-solubility and permeation of celastrol into the skin, significantly improving its anti- activity in mice.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier .V.

Regulatory  cells (Breg cells) producing IL-10 (B10 cells), a critical anti-inflammatory -cell subset, were found to be decreased in both PsA and . Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4(PDE4) inhibitor, increases IL-10 and therefore, we examined the effect of apremilast on Breg cells.Fifty patients, including 20 with PsA and 30 with , were included in the study. The effect of apremilast on Breg cells at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment, was examined by flow cytometry in ODN2006 (TLR9)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and magnetically-isolated cells. Th1 cells, Th17 cells and NKT were also measured.Ex vivo stimulated cell analysis identified that post-apremilast (IL-10+CD19+) B10 cells were increased in all PsA and  patients and correlated with psoriatic skin and joint clinical improvement. Apremilast decreased IFNÎ³(+) T and NKT cells and IL-17(+)NKT cells. B10 cells also inversely correlated with Th1 cells, and IFNÎ³(+)NKT cells.These results suggest that Breg cells are a major target of apremilast in PsA and  and that apremilast-induced increase of Breg cells is associated with a decrease of Th1 cells, IFNÎ³-producing NKT cells and IL-17-producing NKT cells.Â© The Author(s) 2019.

Binding abilities between water-soluble V-shaped or star-shaped copolymers and MTX were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry spectroscopic (UV-vis, NMR) and microscopic (scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) techniques. The efficiency of the amidation reaction has depended on the amount of pendant amino alcohol groups and zeta potential (ZP) values of polymeric carries. The sizes of aggregates formed by polymer-drug conjugates in water increased with the number of copolymer arms (202-774ânm at 37Â°C). Moreover, the conjugates with the high amount of bounded MTX molecules (n â>â78) exhibited negative ZP values. The drug release experiments revealed that the amount of the released MTX depends on pH and can be controlled via shape, topology, and composition of polymeric carrier. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies of V-shaped-MTX conjugate on human immortalized nontumorigenic keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells indicated cytocompatibility of the compound in a wide range of concentrations. The results of our studies have shown that physicochemical and drug release properties of obtained polymer-MTX prodrugs can be tailored via the structure and the topology of the polymeric carrier. Thus conjugates might find the application in a different type of treatment (cancer or  therapy) and administration (intravenous, dermal, or pulmonary).Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, different new concerns, such as efficacy, optimum dose, safety issues, prediction of response to RTX, and pregnancy outcomes have attracted a lot of attention. The PubMed database was systematically reviewed for the last published articles, new findings, and controversial issues regarding RTX therapy in RA using "Rheumatoid arthritis" AND "rituximab" keywords, last updated on June 18, 2019. From 1812 initial recorders, 162 studies met the criteria. Regarding the optimum dose, low-dose RTX therapy (2âÃâ500Â mg) seems as effective as standard dose (2âÃâ1000 mg), safer, and more cost-effective. The most common reported safety challenges included de novo infections, false negative serologic tests of viral infections, reactivation of chronic infections, interfering with vaccination outcome, and development of de novo . Other less reported side effects are infusion reactions, nervous system disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. Lower exposure to other biologics, presence of some serological markers (e.g., anti-RF, anti-CCP, IL-33, ESR), specific variations in FCGR3A, FCGR2A, TGFÎ²1, IL6, IRF5, BAFF genes, and also EBV-positivity could be used to predict response to RTX. Although there is no evidence of the teratogenic effect of RTX, it is recommended that women do not expose themselves to RTX at least 6Â months before the conception. Only a reversible reduction of  cell-count in the offspring may be the pregnancy-related outcome. Although RTX is an effective therapeutic option for RA, more studies on optimum doses, prevention of RTX-related side effects, prediction of RTX response, and safety during the pregnancy are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796858>Influence of autoleukocyte vaccination on activity level of tumor necrosis factor alpha in patients with chronic hepatitis .</a></h2><p>Introduction: data about influence of intradermal vaccination with native autoleukocytes on activity level of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha in patients with chronic hepatitis  have been presented in the article. The aim: Based on positive results, obtained from autoleukocyte immunization in patients with  [14], the aim of our research was to use and study such therapy for reducing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± in patients with chronic hepatitis  (chronic hepatitis ).Materials and methods: Patients with chronic hepatitis  with high level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (â¥30pg/ml) were vaccinated with native autoleukocytes (23); simultaneously, the same procedure was performed to patients (11) with low level of this cytokine (5pg/ml). Leukocytes were isolated from heparinized peripheral venous blood of a patient with hepatitis  by centrifuging plasma, obtained after blood precipitation for 140-160 minutes at temperature 370 Ð¡. The suspension was resuspended in 1-1.5 ml of a patient's blood serum and injected into the skin of the back in the dose 0.1 ml.Results: in 30 days after immunization, reduction of tumor necrosis factor alpha was observed in all patients with its high level (100%), in 65.25% of individuals - to 5 pg/ml; in some patients, who had low or average level of pro-inflammatory cytokine, the level individually increased (41.67%).Conclusions: The elaborated method of influence on activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha in patients with chronic hepatitis  is effective and worth implementing into clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825251>Integrated analysis of gene expression profiles identifies transcription factors potentially involved in  pathogenesis.</a></h2><p> is a common inflammatory skin disease mediated by cells and molecules in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Recently, gene expression profile analysis revealed a large set of immune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in . However, the associations between these DEGs and their transcriptional regulation mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. In this study, several  Gene Expression Omnibus data sets were systematically analyzed using bioinformatics tools to uncover important transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the expression of immune-related DEGs and further enhance our understanding of  pathogenesis. Common DEGs encoding chemokines, cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and keratins were identified in , and extensive correlations existed among these DEGs. Several common TFs that bind the promoters of the DEGs, including the well-known signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, and nuclear factor Îº-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-Îº) as well as ETS homologous factor (EHF), Fos-like antigen 1 (FOSL1), and Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1), which are rarely studied in , were also identified. STAT1, EHF, FOSL1, STAT3, and NFKB1 were positively correlated with these DEGs in  lesions, whereas FOXC1 was negatively correlated with most DEGs. The decreased expression of the DEGs was accompanied by the downregulation of STAT1, EHF, FOSL1, STAT3, and NFKB1 and the upregulation of FOXC1 upon blocking interleukin 17 (IL-17) or tumor necrosis factor Î± signaling in . Additionally, the downregulation of IL37 in  was negatively correlated with STAT1 and CXCL10, which are associated with Th1 responses.

Macrophages are important in the pathogenesis of psoriasiform skin inflammation and express various S1P receptors. How they respond to S1P in skin inflammation remains unknown. We show that myeloid specific S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) deletion enhances early inflammation in a mouse model of imiquimod-induced , without altering the immune cell infiltrate. Mechanistically, myeloid S1PR1 deletion altered the formation of IL-1Î², VEGF-A, and VEGF-C, and their receptors' expression in psoriatic skin, which subsequently lead to reciprocal regulation of neoangiogenesis and neolymphangiogenesis. Experimental findings were corroborated in human clinical datasets and in knockout macrophages in vitro. Increased blood vessel but reduced lymph vessel density may explain the exacerbated inflammatory phenotype in conditional knockout mice. These findings assign a novel role to macrophage S1PR1 and provide a rationale for therapeutically targeting local S1P during skin inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995800>Systemic Sclerosis is Linked to  and May Impact on Patients' Survival: A Large Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Although skin manifestations are quite common in systemic sclerosis (SSc), a link between SSc and  (PsO) has been poorly investigated.

The cysteine protease cathepsin S (CatS) is crucially involved in MHCII processing and T cell stimulation, and elevated levels have been found in patients with RA,  and pSS. However, little is known about the functional characteristics and mechanisms of SS-A- and SS--specific T cells in pSS patients. We herein investigated the inhibition of CatS activity in different biocompartments of pSS patients including antigen-specific T cell responses.Ex vivo CatS activity was assessed in tears, plasma and saliva of 15 pSS patients and 13 healthy controls (HC) and in the presence or absence of the specific CatS inhibitor RO5459072. In addition, antigen (SS-A (60kD), SS-, influenza HN, tetanus toxoid and SEB)-specific T cell responses were examined using ex vivo IFN-Î³/IL-17 Dual ELISPOT and Bromdesoxyuridin (BrdU) proliferation assays in the presence or absence of RO5459072. Supernatants were analysed for IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Î±, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-23, using conventional ELISA.CatS activity was significantly elevated in tear fluid, but not other biocompartments, was inversely associated with exocrinic function in pSS patients and could significantly be suppressed by RO5459072. Moreover, CatS inhibition by RO5459072 led to strong and dose-dependent suppression of SS-A/SS--specific T cell effector functions and cytokine secretion by CD14 monocytes. However, RO5459072 was incapable of suppressing SS-A/SS--induced secretion of cytokines in CD14 monocytes when T cells were absent, confirming a CatS/MHCII-mediated mechanism of suppression.CatS activity in tear fluid seems to be a relevant biomarker for pSS disease activity. Conversely, CatS inhibition diminishes T cell and associated monokine responses towards relevant autoantigens in pSS. Thus, CatS inhibition may represent a promising novel treatment strategy in pSS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670376>Homocysteine and .</a></h2><p> is caused by a complex interplay among the immune system, genetic background, autoantigens, and environmental factors.

In this study, we analyzed the content of indigo and indirubin in leaf and root tissues of . cusia with high-performance liquid chromatography and measured photosynthetic characteristics of leaves treated by MeJA using FluorCam6 Fluorometer and chlorophyll fluorescence using the portable photosynthesis system CIRAS-2. We performed de novo RNA-seq of . cusia leaf and root transcriptional profiles to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to exogenous MeJA application. The amount of indigo in MeJA-treated leaves were higher than that in controled leaves (p = 0.004), and the amounts of indigo in treated roots was higher than that in controlled roots (p = 0.048); Chlorophyll fluorescence of leaves treated with MeJA were significantly decreased. Leaves treated with MeJA showed lower photosynthetic rate compared to the control in the absence of MeJA. Functional annotation of DEGs showed the DEGs related to growth and development processes were down-regulated in the treated leaves, while most of the unigenes involved in the defense response were up-regulated in treated roots. This coincided with the effects of MeJA on photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence. The qRT-PCR results showed that MeJA appears to down-regulate the gene expression of tryptophan synthase Î²-subunits (trpA-Î²) in leaves but increased the gene expression of anthranilate synthase (trp 3) in roots responsible for increased indigo content.

Dysfunction of immune cells, such as T cells, mast cells, and basophils, is involved. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin polysaccharide nucleic acid (BCG-PSN), an immunomodulator partially extracted from BCG, can be used in the combined treatment of CSU with an unknown mechanism.To study the therapeutic effect and mechanism of BCG-PSN on CSU, we initially assessed the clinical efficacy in 110 enrolled CSU patients of 4-week antihistamine monotherapy vs. antihistamine plus BCG-PSN combined therapy. Subsequently, to explore the further mechanism of BCG-PSN, the mast cell line RBL-2H3 pretreated with BCG-PSN was used to evaluate the transcriptional expression profiles via lncRNA sequencing. Real time PCR was conducted to validate the candidate gene expression.We found no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the BCG-PSN group (71.7%) and the monotherapy group (71.9%). However, the average time of complete relief in the BCG-PSN group was significantly shorter than that in the monotherapy group (36.77Â Â±Â 17.33 vs. 51.27Â Â±Â 16.80, Â =Â 0.026).  experiments showed that BCG-PSN inhibited Î²-hexosaminidase release rates in IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells (Â <Â 0.001).

There is growing evidence that the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) are highly upregulated in . The SFK are the key components of the signaling pathways triggering cell growth and differentiation in addition to the immune cascades. In the current work, the interactions between SFK and selective phyto-compounds were studied using molecular docking approach. Based on the results of docking and binding energy calculations quercetin was identified as potential lead compound. To get a deeper insight into the binding of quercetin with the SFK, a combined molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations were performed. The binding of quercetin disrupted the intra-molecular contacts making the SFK compact except Src kinase. The MM/PBSA free energy decomposition analysis highlighted the significance of hydrophobic and polar residues which are involved in the binding of quercetin. An experimental validation was carried out against the activated forms of Fyn, Lyn and Src kinases, the top three proteins which showed high preference for quercetin. The flow cytometry analysis showed that the expression levels of Fyn, Lyn and Src kinases were dramatically increased in HaCaT cells.

Inhibition of TNF can decrease the inflammatory response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), , psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune diseases marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered âdisease modifying anti-rheumatic drugsâ (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis . Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis  have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis . However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

The  Area Severity Index (PASI) is one of the most commonly used  rating scales in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to develop a utility scoring algorithm for the PASI.  Forty health states were developed based on PASI scores of 40 clinical trial patients. Health states were valued in time trade-off interviews with UK general population participants. Regression models were conducted to crosswalk from PASI scores to utilities (e.g. OLS linear, random effects, mean, robust, spline, quadratic).  A total of 245 participants completed utility interviews (51.4% female; mean ageâ=â45.3âyears). Models predicting utility based on the four PASI location scores (head, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs) had better fit/accuracy (e.g. , mean absolute error [MAE]) than models using the PASI total score. Head/upper limb scores were more strongly associated with utility than trunk/lower limb. The recommended model is the OLS linear model based on the four PASI location scores (â=â0.13; MAEâ=â0.03). An alternative is recommended for situations when it is necessary to estimate utility based on the PASI total score.  The derived scoring algorithm may be used to estimate utilities based on PASI scores of any treatment group with . Because the PASI is commonly used in  clinical trials, this scoring algorithm greatly expands options for quantifying treatment outcomes in cost-effectiveness analyses of  therapies. Results indicate that  of the head/upper limbs could be more important than trunk/lower limbs, suggesting reconsideration of the standard PASI scoring approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287332>Characterization of responder groups to secukinumab treatment in moderate to severe plaque .</a></h2><p> Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a key cytokine involved in the development of .

Some isozymes of APOBEC3 are induced upon human papillomavirus infection or development of  skin lesions. However, the involvement of APOBEC3 in keratinocyte differentiation has not been addressed. We herein sought to evaluate the roles of APOBECs in mouse primary keratinocyte differentiation. We found that expression levels of APOBEC1 and APOBEC3 were increased during calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Unexpectedly, however, the expression levels of keratinocyte differentiation markers keratin 1/10, involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin were higher in keratinocytes treated with APOBEC3 siRNAs than in those treated with control RNAs. In addition, the treatment of keratinocytes with APOBEC3 siRNAs increased the gene expression levels of Notch3, a master regulator of keratinocyte differentiation. Moreover, calcium-induced increase in Notch3 expression and keratinocyte differentiation were impaired by transfection with an APOBEC3 expression plasmid. Furthermore, co-treatment with Notch3 siRNAs reduced the APOBEC3 siRNA-mediated upregulation of Notch3 expression and in part attenuated the increased expression levels of keratinocyte differentiation markers. These results suggest that APOBEC3 is induced upon keratinocyte differentiation and negatively regulates the keratinocyte differentiation in part by its inhibitory role for Notch3 expression.Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Not only was IL-19 increased in  and correlated to PASI, but ixekizumab administration led to rapid, sustained IL-19 decreases to normal levels, with decreases at 2-weeks correlating with PASI improvement at 16-weeks. IL-19 increased upon ixekizumab withdraw, prior to relapse, and decreased following re-treatment. In baricitinib- and etanercept-treated  patients, IL-19 decreases also correlated with improvement. Many patients with limited skin disease, including genital  and psoriatic arthritis patients, also had increased IL-19, which was reduced to normal levels upon ixekizumab treatment, correlating with PASI improvement. We also measured IL-19 in baricitinib-treated atopic dermatitis patients. In atopic dermatitis, IL-19 was significantly elevated, correlated with EASI scores, and decreased with skin improvement.

This condition is infrequently reported, difficult to treat, and often misdiagnosed. Various anti-psoriatic therapies have been used, but literature is limited to case studies with equivocal results. Biological therapy is revolutionizing the management of many dermatologic conditions and is believed to be a promising option for acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau patients who have failed conventional therapy. We report the 4-year treatment course of a 70-year-old woman with acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau that was initially unsuccessful with conventional treatments but successfully treated with the tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor adalimumab, in combination with alitretinoin and clobetasol propionate. This case adds to the current understanding of acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and the potential of biological therapy, in our case, adalimumab, for acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau management.

Its efficacy and safety have been thoroughly established in adults and some publications indicate that it is also an effective and safe treatment in pediatric patients with refractory skin diseases.Retrospective study that included all patients under 17 years of age and 122 randomly selected adults who received phototherapy in our department between 2002 and 2017.Ninety-eight pediatric patients (61% girls and 39% boys) with a mean age of 10.5 years received phototherapy. The 3 most frequently treated diseases were  (48% of patients), vitiligo (17%), and atopic dermatitis (16%). Eighty-six percent of the patients received phototherapy with narrowband UV-, whereas 7% received phototherapy with psoralen and UV-A (PUVA). No statistically significant differences were found in terms of dosage, duration, or number of sessions compared to the adult population treated with narrowband UV- therapy or PUVA. A complete response was achieved in 35% of the pediatric patients and no differences were found with respect to the adults. Only 16% of the children showed adverse effects, mostly in the form of mild erythema. We found greater adherence to treatment in the pediatric patients than in the adult patients (P<.05).Narrowband UV- therapy and PUVA appear to be safe and effective in children and can be administered using the same treatment protocols as those used in adults. Adherence to treatment is greater in children than in adult patients.Copyright Â© 2019 AEDV. Publicado por Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

The architecture of the epidermis is largely regulated by the action of lysosomes, possibly activating signaling pathways in the cellular crosstalk of keratinocytes-epidermal cells-with infiltrating immune cells. Thus, in the present study, lysosome alterations were examined in vitro and in situ using a two-dimensional (2D) keratinocyte model of HaCaT cells with "-like" inflammation and skin specimens, respectively. Specific fluorescence and immunohistochemical staining showed an augmented level of acidic organelles in response to keratinocyte activation (mimicking a psoriatic condition while maintaining the membrane integrity of these structures) as compared with the control, similar to that seen in skin samples taken from patients. Interestingly, patients with the most pronounced PASI ( Area and Severity Index), BSA (Body Surface Area), and DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) scores suffered a high incidence of positive lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) expression. Moreover, it was found that the gene deregulation pattern was comparable in lesioned (PP) and non-lesioned (PN) patient-derived skin tissue, which may indicate that these alterations occur prior to the onset of the characteristic phenotype of the disease. Changes in the activity of genes encoding the microphthalmia family (MiT family) of transcription factors and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 () were also observed in the in vitro  model, indicating that the biogenesis pathway of this arm is inhibited. Interestingly, in contrast to the keratinocytes of HaCaT with "-like" inflammation,  was up-regulated in both PP and PN skin, which can be a potential sign of an alternative mechanism of lysosome formation.

It induces protein succination leading to inactivation of cysteine-rich proteins. It was first shown to possess cytoprotective and antioxidant effects in noncancer models, which appeared related to the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. DMF also displays antitumor activity in several cellular and mice models. Recently, we showed that the anticancer mechanism of DMF is dose-dependent and is paradoxically related to the decrease in the nuclear translocation of NRF2. Some other studies performed indicate also the potential role of DMF in cancers, which are dependent on the NRF2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program, such as KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. It, however, seems that DMF has multiple biological effects as it has been shown to also inhibit the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-Îº), thus blocking downstream targets that may be involved in the development and progression of inflammatory cascades leading to various disease processes, including tumors, lymphomas, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, and .

Underlying molecular mechanisms include chronic inflammation and abnormal proliferation. However, the cell types contributing to these molecular mechanisms are much less understood. Recently, deconvolution methodologies have allowed the digital quantification of cell types in bulk tissue based on mRNA expression data from biopsies. Using these methods to study the cellular composition of the skin enables the rapid enumeration of multiple cell types, providing insight into the numerical changes of cell types associated with chronic inflammatory skin conditions. Here, we use deconvolution to enumerate the cellular composition of the skin and estimate changes related to onset, progress, and treatment of these skin diseases.A novel signature matrix, i.e. DerM22, containing expression data from 22 reference cell types, is used, in combination with the CIBERSORT algorithm, to identify and quantify the cellular subsets within whole skin biopsy samples. We apply the approach to public microarray mRNA expression data from the skin layers and 648 samples from healthy subjects and patients with  or atopic dermatitis. The methodology is validated by comparison to experimental results from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry studies, and the deconvolution of independent data from isolated cell types.We derived the relative abundance of cell types from healthy, lesional, and non-lesional skin and observed a marked increase in the abundance of keratinocytes and leukocytes in the lesions of both inflammatory dermatological conditions. The relative fraction of these cells varied from healthy to diseased skin and from non-lesional to lesional skin. We show that changes in the relative abundance of skin-related cell types can be used to distinguish between mild and severe cases of  and atopic dermatitis, and trace the effect of treatment.Our analysis demonstrates the value of this new resource in interpreting skin-derived transcriptomics data by enabling the direct quantification of cell types in a skin sample and the characterization of pathological changes in tissue composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845666>Cannabinoid Signaling in the Skin: Therapeutic Potential of the "C(ut)annabinoid" System.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has lately been proven to be an important, multifaceted homeostatic regulator, which influences a wide-variety of physiological processes all over the body.

Erianin, a bibenzyl compound extracted from , has displayed antitumor and anti-angiogenesis effects. However, the effects of erianin on a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) are not fully understood. In the present study, we explored the effect of erianin on proliferation and apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Our results indicated that treatment with erianin ranging from 12.5 nM to 50 nM inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HaCaT cells. In addition, erianin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger -acetyl-cysteine (NAC) attenuated this elevation. Moreover, treatment with erianin induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling pathway and suppressed the protein kinase  (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, while pretreatment with NAC also reversed these effects. Collectively, these data demonstrated that erianin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HaCaT cells through ROS-mediated JNK/c-Jun and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.

This transporter uses energy of ATP hydrolysis to efflux from cells a variety of structurally dissimilar hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds, including anticancer drugs. In this regard, understanding the interaction with P-gp of drug entities in development is important and highly recommended in current US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Here we tested the P-gp interaction of some A adenosine receptor agonists that are being developed for the treatment of chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, , chronic pain, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Biochemical assays of the ATPase activity of P-gp and by photolabeling P-gp with its transport substrate [I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin led to the identification of rigidified (N)-methanocarba nucleosides (i.e., compound  as a stimulator and compound  as a partial inhibitor of P-gp ATPase activity). Compound  significantly inhibited boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-verapamil transport mediated by human P-gp (IC 2.4 Â± 0.6 M); however, the BODIPY-conjugated derivative of  (compound ) was not transported by P-gp. In silico docking of compounds  and  was performed using the recently solved atomic structure of paclitaxel (Taxol)-bound human P-gp. Molecular modeling studies revealed that both compounds  and  bind in the same region of the drug-binding pocket as Taxol. Thus, this study indicates that nucleoside derivatives can exhibit varied modulatory effects on P-gp activity, depending on structural functionalization. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Certain A adenosine receptor agonists are being developed for the treatment of chronic diseases. The goal of this study was to test the interaction of these agonists with the human multidrug resistance-linked transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). ATPase and photolabeling assays demonstrated that compounds with rigidified (N)-methanocarba nucleosides inhibit the activity of P-gp; however, a fluorescent derivative of one of the compounds was not transported by P-gp. Furthermore, molecular docking studies revealed that the binding site for these compounds overlaps with the site for paclitaxel in the drug-binding pocket. These results suggest that nucleoside derivatives, depending on structural functionalization, can modulate the function of P-gp.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887876>Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, administered with a novel patient-controlled injector (One-Press), for moderate-to-severe : results from the phase 3 ORION study.</a></h2><p>Guselkumab, an interleukin-23 antagonist, is approved for self-administration with the UltraSafe Plusâ¢ syringe to treat moderate-to-severe plaque-type .

Recent accumulated data revealed the dysregulation of various microRNAs (miRNAs) in several diseases including .We explored the functional role and regulation of hsa-miR-155-5p (miR-155) in an immortalized keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), in relation to the pathogenesis and treatment of .miR-155 expression in normal skin and psoriatic skin lesion before and after treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and narrow-band ultraviolet  phototherapy (NB-UVB) were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Apoptotic activity, cell cycle and viable cells of miR-155 transfected HaCaT were measured using flow cytometry and MTS assay. Since, caspase-3 (CASP3) gene was predicted as a target gene of miR-155, the expression of CASP3 was detected in transfected HaCaT using western blot.We discovered that both MTX and NB-UVB significantly down-regulated miR-155 expression in psoriatic skin lesions. We also found that overexpression of miR-155 in HaCaT led to suppression of cell apoptosis and induced cell arrest at G0/G1 phase. Moreover, CASP3 expression was down-regulated in miR-155 transfected HaCaT.This study demonstrates down-regulation of miR155 after treatment with MTX and NB-UVB in psoriatic skin lesion. miR155 plays significant role in apoptosis on HaCaT via CASP3.

To characterize treatment patterns in adult AD patients prescribed immunosuppressants (IMMs) in the primary care setting.  Six hundred and fifty-six patients with AD (6.6%) were prescribed IMM in the analysis (mean age 52.1Â years; 59.1% female; age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index 1.4). Most prevalent (>5%) conditions at baseline were depression (10.8%), contact dermatitis (10.7%), rheumatological disease (7.9%), skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders (6.4%), upper respiratory disease (5.8%), and  (5.2%). At baseline, up to 50% of patients were prescribed â¥1 IMM. During follow-up, 42.7% of patients were prescribed oral corticosteroids (OCSs), increasing in line with IMM exposure. The most commonly prescribed IMM was methotrexate (43.3%). Ciclosporin, the only approved IMM for AD, was prescribed to 16.9% of patients.  The prevalence of comorbidities and high rate of IMM prescriptions demonstrate the impact of AD on quality of life. The frequency of OCS prescribing in AD patients treated with IMMs suggests a lack of disease control with existing therapies, and an unmet need for safe and effective targeted agents for long-term disease control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413544>Infliximab and biosimilar infliximab in : efficacy, loss of efficacy, and adverse events.</a></h2><p> is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease affecting multiple systems, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of the disease process.  has a high prevalence rate in the Western world, especially in the USA and Australia; in China, although the prevalence rate is much lower, there is still a large number of patients suffering from  and its comorbidities. As TNF-Î± is thought to be crucial in the pathogenesis of , specific therapy blocking TNF-Î± may be beneficial in the treatment of this disease. Infliximab, a murine-human monoclonal antibody, is highly efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe , with better skin clearance and faster onset of action than topical medications such as methotrexate, narrow-band ultraviolet , and calcipotriol. Lack of adherence to infliximab therapy is mainly due to loss of response (LOR) over time and adverse events, particularly because infusion reactions are usually encountered. Anti-infliximab antibody is thought to be responsible for the LOR and infusion reactions. However, the mechanism underlying the formation of anti-infliximab antibody and its side effects remains unclear. Further studies identifying patients at risk for LOR will probably help clinicians to select the right patients for anti-TNF-Î± therapy and to increase the durability of the treatment. This review discusses the efficacy of infliximab as demonstrated by various clinical trials, LOR to infliximab, combatting LOR, as well as the adverse events usually faced during the use of infliximab therapy and the infliximab biosimilar Remsima.

It is generally believed that drug-induced photosensitivity is an UVA phenomenon, caused by UV wavelengths between 315 and 400Â nm. Here, we present a case of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-induced photosensitivity following exposure to 308-nm narrow-band (nb) UVB light emitted from an excimer laser in a patient undergoing treatment for plaque . This patient had received biweekly treatments with the excimer laser for years prior without any history of adverse reactions. We believe that our patient suffered an acute photosensitivity to UVB due to new-onset HCTZ.

Despite differing etiologies, these diseases share common inflammatory pathways, which lead to damage in primary target organs and frequently to a plethora of systemic effects as well. The purinergic signaling complex comprising extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides and their receptors, the P2 and P1 purinergic receptors, respectively, as well as catabolic enzymes and nucleoside transporters is a major regulatory system in the body. The purinergic signaling complex can regulate the development and course of IMIDs. Here we provide a comprehensive review on the role of purinergic signaling in controlling immunity, inflammation, and organ function in IMIDs.

SERPINB2 has been shown to be upregulated in the inflammation and infections. Here we aimed to study the relationship between miR-146a/ and SERPINB2 and to delineate the role of SERPINB2 in association of plaque . We report increased SERPINB2 expression in the skin of  patients, which was in a positive relationship with  severity and in a negative relationship with miR-146a/ in psoriatic lesions. In cultured keratinocytes, both cellular and secreted SERPINB2 levels were strongly induced in response to IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±. Interestingly, SERPINB2 mRNA was down-regulated by IL-17A and the combination of TNF-Î± and IL-17A at timepoints when miR-146a was increased. The predicted binding site for miR-146a/ in 3' untranslated region of SERPINB2 revealed no activity in luciferase assay, while siRNA silencing of miR-146a/ direct targets IRAK1 and CARD10 resulted in reduced expression of SERPINB2, suggesting that miR-146a/ indirectly control SERPINB2 expression in the skin. The siRNA silencing of SERPINB2 increased the expression of IL-8, CXCL5 and CCL5 and migration of neutrophils revealing its anti-inflammatory role in keratinocytes.

Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is incomplete. This review aims to identify available treatment options in HS and discuss the pharmacological mechanisms through which such agents function. Identifying common pathways may inform our understanding of the pathogenesis of HS as well as identify future therapeutic targets. The pharmacological mechanisms implicated in topical therapies, antibiotic, hormonal, systemic immunomodulatory and biologic therapies for HS are discussed. Significant differences exist between agents and implicated pathways in therapy for mild and severe disease. This is an expression of the possible dichotomy in inflammatory pathways (and treatment responses) in HS. Studies involving monoclonal antibodies provide the greatest insight into what these specific mechanisms may be. Their variable levels of clinical efficacy compared with placebo bolsters the suggestion that differential inflammatory pathways may be involved in different presentations and severity of disease. Nuclear factor kappa  (NF-Îº), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and other innate immune mechanisms are strongly represented in treatments which are effective in mild to moderate disease in the absence of scarring or draining fistulae, however complex feed-forward mechanisms in severe disease respond to interleukin (IL)-1 inhibition but are less likely to respond to innate immune inhibition (through NF-Îº or TNF-Î±) alone. It is unclear whether IL-17 inhibition will parallel TNF-Î± or IL-1 inhibition in effect, however it is plausible that small molecule targets (Janus kinase1 and phosphodiesterase 4) may provide effective new strategies for treatment of HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154403>Best-practice Indicators in Psoriatic Disease Care.</a></h2><p>In 2016, members of the Group for Research and Assessment of  and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), in collaboration with KPMG LLP (UK), conducted a study to measure care in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Although LS usually occurs alone, its coexistence in morphea patients has been reported in 5.7% and 38.0% (genital LS) of cases, in two series (1). A 74-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of multiple asymptomatic, shiny , indurated, brownish large flat plaques located on the abdomen (Figure 1, a-) and back, intermingled with slightly atrophic, white-colored, guttate, and patchy areas (Figure 1, d-e). Both punch biopsies of the sclerotic plaques on the back and abdomen showed findings consistent with morphea (Figure 1, c, f). Furthermore, the punch biopsy of a well-demarcated white plaque on the back revealed findings compatible with LS (Figure 1, f). Remarkably, there were also multiple white-colored lesions on the sites of pregnancy-induced striae distensae (SD) (Figure 2, a-) on the lower abdomen and an old appendectomy scar (Figure 2, c). There was no anogenital involvement. A diagnosis of morphea-LS overlap was established and white lesions located on the surgical scar and SD were clinically evaluated as LS. Methotrexate (15 mg/week) achieved a partial regression of morphea plaques in three months. However, white LS lesions remained unchanged. Our patient presented with coexistence of LS and morphea on different sites of the trunk and on the same lesion. Additionally, one of the isolated LS lesions was located on a surgical scar. Occurrence of LS on skin grafts, irradiated areas, injection sites, or burn/surgical scars has been attributed to the Koebner phenomenon, also called isomorphic response, defined as "the formation of the skin lesions in the same morphology of the existing disease on the areas of various cutaneous injuries" (2). LS is classified under the Koebner category-III (occasional lesions) (2). However, in a case of morphea with features of LS that developed in 1 month following a herpes zoster infection has been suggested to represent "Wolf's isotopic response" (3), which was originally defined as "the occurrence of a new skin disease at the site of another, unrelated and already healed skin disorder" with a time interval between the first and second diseases ranging from months to several years (4). Remarkably, typical morphea plaques in our patient did not involve the surgical scar, in contrast to a cohort in which 16% of 329 patients developed initial morphea lesions at sites of prior (surgery) or ongoing/repetitive (chronic friction) skin trauma (5). SD appear on skin as atrophic linear bands mostly due to rapid weight changes, pregnancy, Cushing syndrome, or prolonged use of corticosteroids (6). The mechanism underlying the occurrence of several diseases on striae is still elusive. Blunt trauma occurring during the development of striae has been suggested to cause the Koebner phenomenon in patients with vitiligo, , and lichen planus (7), but it has been suggested that the occurrence of leukemia cutis on SD in a patient reflects Wolf's isotopic response (8). Although chronic graft-versus-host disease, urticarial vasculitis, keloid, lupus erythematosus, diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma, and drug-induced cutaneous eruptions have been reported to occur on striae (6,9), such an association with LS as in our patient has not been previously documented in the literature. Concomitant occurrence of LS patches on different previous lesions such as a surgical scar and SD in our patient raises the possibility of a common underlying mechanism. As mentioned above, the terms "Koebner phenomenon" or "Wolf's isotopic response" have been used to designate the development of some diseases in injured areas. However, Happle and Kluger (10) claimed in a recent statement that "there is no clear-cut criterion to distinguish isotopic response from Koebner phenomenon and all reactions of this kind represent examples of Koebner phenomenon", which seems to be the best way to describe the site-specific occurrence of LS lesions in our patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116619>Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone for treatment of plaque : a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p> A growing number of studies have shown that thiazolidinediones (TZD) can be antipsoriatic.

This  analysis aimed to assess the impact of obesity, metabolic syndrome,  severity and treatment with secukinumab/etanercept on adiponectin.  Three phase III trials in moderate to severe plaque  were included. Correlations of  Area and Severity Index (PASI), body mass index (BMI), and associated comorbidity with adiponectin levels as well as the impact of secukinumab, etanercept, and placebo were analyzed.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for establishing and maintaining immune tolerance. In this study, we found that patients with  and healthy controls had comparable percentages of circulating CD4CD25FOXP3 Tregs, but psoriatic Tregs had reduced suppressive function. Thereafter, mRNA arrays were performed to study the gene expression profile of psoriatic Tregs. Psoriatic Tregs expressed high levels of a T helper type 1-like transcription factor and cytokines such as T-bet and IFN-Î³. Furthermore, we found that FOXO1 can bind to the promoter of TBX21 to inhibit its expression, thus keeping the suppressive function of Tregs. However, an increase in protein kinase -mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 was observed in psoriatic Tregs, which subsequently caused FOXO1 inactivation by nuclear exclusion. In addition, incubation of healthy Tregs with psoriatic serum led to the activation of protein kinase , nuclear exclusion of FOXO1, and the loss of FOXO1 transcription activity. The role of FOXO1 in regulating the function of Tregs was corroborated using a -like mouse model in which Foxo1-deficient Tregs failed to protect mice from developing . In conclusion, our findings reveal that the dysregulation of the protein kinase -FOXO1 pathway may be a critical cause of Treg dysfunction in .Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

Experimental data accumulated in recent years highlighted the important role played by the immune system in the pathogenesis of this disease. Non-human  models are an important research tool that attempts to reproduce the clinical features of the disease in order to explain the pathogenesis of  and to identify possible therapeutic targets. Imiquimod-based murine model of psoriatic dermatitis is an alternative to traditional models of experimental  in mice and the induced dermatitis closely mimics the pathologic changes in human . In order to emphasize changes in immune cell populations involved in lesion pathogenesis, we performed a murine model of psoriasiform dermatitis model by topical IMQ application. The progress and the severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation were clinically (PASI score) and histopathologically evaluated. The immunological changes induced by IMQ treatment in lymphocyte populations from peripheral blood and spleen were evaluated by flow cytometry. The main changes observed in peripheral blood were the significantly increased T-CD8a lymphocyte and NK1.1 cell percentages and the decreased T-CD4 and  lymphocyte percentages in IMQ-treated mice. In spleen samples, lymphocytes showed the same tendency of variation as in peripheral blood, but without statistical significance. A significant decrease of  cells percentages was observed in spleen suspensions. Data obtained in skin samples may suggest the involvement of CD3Îµ, CD4 and CD8a cells in the lesional process. This murine model was analyzed by performing a basic cellular profile at three levels: peripheral blood, spleen and skin. The evaluation aimed to establish the immune framework of this experimental model that could further be used for etipathogenic mechanism identification and/or for studies regarding targeted therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909326>Low Dose Naltrexone in Dermatology</a></h2><p>Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been successfully studied as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapy in a wide range of conditions including Crohnâs disease, fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, cancer, chronic regional pain syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, and multiple sclerosis.1-5 Recently, off label LDN has been shown to improve dermatologic conditions such as systemic sclerosis, Hailey-Hailey Disease, lichen planopilaris, and guttate .6-9 In this article, we examine the existing evidence for use of LDN in skin disease and discuss its potential application in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).

Treatment for  mainly includes conventional immunosuppressive drugs. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppressive agents may cause a variety of side effects, including nephrotoxicity and infections. Kaempferol, a natural flavonol present in various plants, is known to possess potent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancerous properties. However, it is unknown whether kaempferol is also anti-psoriatic. Here we established an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic mouse model to explore the potential therapeutic effects of kaempferol on psoriatic skin lesions and inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with kaempferol protected mice from developing -like skin lesions induced by topical administration of IMQ. Kaempferol reduced CD3 T cell infiltration and gene expression of major proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, in the psoriatic skin lesion. It also down-regulated proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa  (NF-Îº) signaling in the skin. The therapeutic effects were associated with a significant increase in CD4 forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) regulatory T cell (T ) frequency in the spleen and lymph nodes as well as FoxP3-positive staining in the skin lesion. Conversely, depletion of CD4 CD25 T reversed the therapeutic effects of kaempferol on the skin lesion. Kaempferol also lowered the percentage of IL-17A CD4 T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes of IMQ-induced psoriatic mice. Finally, kaempferol suppressed the proliferation of T cells in vitro and their mTOR signaling. Thus, our findings suggest that kaempferol may be a therapeutic drug for treating human  in the near future.Â© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480263>Altered Lipid Metabolism in Blood Mononuclear Cells of Psoriatic Patients Indicates Differential Changes in  Vulgaris and Psoriatic Arthritis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate possible stress-associated disturbances in lipid metabolism in mononuclear cells, mainly lymphocytes of patients with  vulgaris (Ps, n = 32) or with psoriatic arthritis (PsA, n = 16) in respect to the healthy volunteers (n = 16). The results showed disturbances in lipid metabolism of psoriatic patients reflected by different phospholipid profiles. The levels of non-enzymatic lipid metabolites associated with oxidative stress 8-isoprostaglandin F2Î± (8-isoPGF2Î±) and free 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were higher in PsA, although levels of 4-HNE-His adducts were higher in Ps. In the case of the enzymatic metabolism of lipids, enhanced levels of endocannabinoids were observed in both forms of , while higher expression of their receptors and activities of phospholipases were detected only in Ps. Moreover, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) activity was enhanced only in Ps, but cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was enhanced both in Ps and PsA, generating higher levels of eicosanoids: prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13HODE), thromboxane B2 (TXB2).

The reduction of these factors is currently the most effective strategy to inhibit the symptoms of pathology. Antioxidants from natural sources are increasingly used to improve skin conditions. Dried red leaves from grapevine ( L., cv Teinturiers) showed anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activities, but their possible effects on keratinocytes have not been previously investigated. In this study we tested the ability of a water extract from grapevine leaves (VVWE) to inhibit inflammatory conditions in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), challenged with proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) or prooxidant (ultraviolet  radiation (UVB) or HO) mediators. VVWE inhibited interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion induced by proinflammatory stimuli, acting on the IL-8 promoter activity, but the effect was lower when prooxidant mediators were used. The effect was partly explained by the reduction of nuclear factor-Îº (NF-Îº)-driven transcription and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, a regulator of angiogenesis, was inhibited by VVWE, but not matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a protease involved in matrix remodeling.

Here, we uncovered the role of cysteine-type cathepsins in the effector phase of T cell-driven cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (DTHR) and the implication of this role on therapeutic cathepsin -specific inhibition. : Wild-type, cathepsin -deficient (Ctsb) and cathepsin Z-deficient (Ctsz) mice were sensitized with 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) on the abdomen and challenged with TNCB on the right ear to induce acute and chronic cutaneous DTHR. The severity of cutaneous DTHR was assessed by evaluating ear swelling responses and histopathology. We performed fluorescence microscopy on tissue from inflamed ears and lymph nodes of wild-type mice, as well as on biopsies from  patients, focusing on cathepsin  expression by T cells,  cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells. Cathepsin activity was determined noninvasively by optical imaging employing protease-activated substrate-like probes. Cathepsin expression and activity were validated  by covalent active site labeling of proteases and Western blotting. : Noninvasive  optical imaging revealed strong cysteine-type cathepsin activity in inflamed ears and draining lymph nodes in acute and chronic cutaneous DTHR. In inflamed ears and draining lymph nodes, cathepsin  was expressed by neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages, , T and natural killer (NK) cells. Similar expression patterns were found in psoriatic plaques of patients. The biochemical methods confirmed active cathepsin  in tissues of mice with cutaneous DTHR. Topically applied cathepsin  inhibitors significantly reduced ear swelling in acute but not chronic DTHR. Compared with wild-type mice, Ctsb mice exhibited an enhanced ear swelling response during acute DTHR despite a lack of cathepsin  expression. Cathepsin Z, a protease closely related to cathepsin , revealed compensatory expression in inflamed ears of Ctsb mice, while cathepsin  expression was reciprocally elevated in Ctsz mice. : Cathepsin  is actively involved in the effector phase of acute cutaneous DTHR. Thus, topically applied cathepsin  inhibitors might effectively limit DTHR such as contact dermatitis or .

This study directly investigated vascular endothelial health and systemically altered pathways in  and matched controls. Approach and Results- Twenty patients (mean age, 40 years; 50% male) with active  and 10 age-, sex-matched controls were recruited. To investigate systemically alerted pathways, a deep sequencing omics approach was applied, including unbiased blood transcriptomic and targeted proteomic analysis. Vascular endothelial health was assessed by transcriptomic profiling of endothelial cells obtained from the brachial veins of recruited participants. Blood transcriptomic profiling identified inflammasome signaling as the highest differentially expressed canonical pathway ( Z score 1.6; P=1Ã10) including upregulation of CASP5 and interleukin ( IL) -1Î². Proteomic panels revealed IL-6 as a top differentially expressed cytokine in  with pathway analysis highlighting IL-1Î² ( Z score 3.7; P=1.02Ã10) as an upstream activator of the observed upregulated proteins. Direct profiling of harvested brachial vein endothelial cells demonstrated inflammatory transcript (eg, IL-1Î², CXCL10, VCAM-1, IL-8, CXCL1, Lymphotoxin beta, ICAM-1, COX-2, and CCL3) upregulation between  versus controls. A linear relationship was seen between differentially expressed endothelial inflammatory transcripts and  disease severity. IL-6 levels correlated with inflammatory endothelial cell transcripts and whole blood inflammasome-associated transcripts, including CASP5 and IL-1Î². Conclusions- An unbiased sequencing approach demonstrated the inflammasome as the most differentially altered pathway in  versus controls.

Vitamin D promotes calcium and phosphorus absorption; however, the actions of vitamin D are not confined to bone. Indeed, there is now overwhelming and compelling scientific data that Vitamin D plays a crucial role in a plethora of cellular function and in extra-skeletal health. Except for fatty fish livers, very few foods naturally contain vitamin D; and the major source of vitamin D comes from skin exposure to sunlight via Ultraviolet . Keratinocytes are unique in the body as not only do they provide the primary source of vitamin D for the body, but they also possess both the enzymatic machinery to metabolize the vitamin D produced to active metabolites. This has been referred to as the photoendocrine vitamin D system. Vitamin D regulates keratinocytes proliferation and differentiation; and plays a role in the defense against opportunistic infections. Multiple factors are linked to vitamin D status; and a growing number of dermatologic diseases has been linked to vitamin D status such as atopic dermatitis, , vitiligo, and cutaneous cancers. In this article, we reviewed the potential determinants of vitamin D status, as its implications in dermatologic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180729>Therapeutic drug monitoring with biologic agents in immune mediated inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>: Biologic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and .

Clinically, reactive TDM rationalizes the management of PNR and SLR to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and is emerging as the new standard of care in IBD as it is also more cost-effective than empiric dose escalation. Preliminary data suggest that proactive TDM with the goal to achieve a threshold drug concentration is associated with better therapeutic outcomes when compared to empiric drug optimization and/or reactive TDM of infliximab and adalimumab in IBD. However, more data from well-designed prospective studies are needed to prove the benefit of TDM-based algorithms in real life clinical practice in IMID.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915067>Effector Functions of CD4+ T Cells at the Site of Local Autoimmune Inflammation-Lessons From Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Infiltration of memory CD4+ T cells in synovial joints of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients has been reported since decades. Moreover, several genome wide association studies (GWAS) pinpointing a key genetic association between the HLA-DR locus and RA have led to the generally agreed hypothesis that CD4+ T cells are directly implicated in the disease. Still, RA is a heterogeneous disease and much effort has been made to understand its different facets. T cell differentiation is driven by mechanisms including antigen stimulation, co-stimulatory signals and cytokine milieu, all of which are abundant in the rheumatic joint, implying that any T cells migrating into the joint may be further affected locally. In parallel to the characterization and classification of T-cell subsets, the contribution of different effector T cells to RA has been investigated in numerous studies though sometimes with contradictory results. In particular, the frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells has been assessed in the synovial joints with various results that could, at least partly, be explained by the stage of the disease. For regulatory T cells, it is largely accepted that they accumulate in RA synovial fluid and that the equilibrium between regulatory T cells and effector cells is a key factor in controlling inflammation processes involved in RA. Recent phenotypic studies describe the possible implication of a novel subset of peripheral T helper cells (Tph) important for T- cell cross talk and plasma cell differentiation in the RA joint of ACPA+ (autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins) RA patients. Finally, cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, historically described as increased in the peripheral blood of RA patients have attracted new attention in the last years. In view of the recently identified peripheral T-cell subsets, we will integrate immunological data as well as information on genetic variants and therapeutic strategy outcomes into our current understanding of the width of effector T cells. We will also integrate tissue-resident memory T cell aspects, and discuss similarities and differences with inflammatory conditions in skin () and mucosal organs (Crohn's disease).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396497>Evans Syndrome in Childhood: Long Term Follow-Up and the Evolution in Primary Immunodeficiency or Rheumatological Disease.</a></h2><p>Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare but challenging condition, characterized by recurrent and refractory cytopenia episodes. Recent discoveries highlighted that an appropriate diagnostic workup is fundamental to identify an underlying immune dysregulation such as primary immunodeficiencies or a rheumatological disease. We hereby describe clinical features and laboratory results of 12 pediatric patients affected by ES referred to the Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit of Bologna. Patients experienced a median of four acute episodes of cytopenia with 9 years as median age at the onset of symptoms. In 8/12 (67%) patients an underlying etiology, primary immunodeficiencies, or rheumatological disease was identified. In 4/12 children, other immune manifestations were associated (Thyroiditis, Celiac disease, , Vitiligo, Myositis, Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis). ES remained the primary diagnosis in four patients (33%). At a median follow-up time of 4 years, 5/12 (42%) patients revealed a chronic ITP, partially responsive to second line therapy. Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy (IRT) was effective with a good hematological values control in three patients with a secondary ES (ALPS, CVID, and a patient with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome and a progressive severe  cell deficiency with hypogammaglobulinemia). Our experience highlights that, in pediatric patients, ES is often only the first manifestation of an immunological or rheumatological disease, especially when cytopenias are persistent or resistant to therapy, with an early-onset or when are associated with lymphadenopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881571>Halobetasol 0.01%/Tazarotene 0.045% Fixed-combination Lotion in the Treatment of Plaque : Sensitization and Irritation Potential.</a></h2><p>  is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder often managed with topical therapy. However, the most widely used treatments, including topical corticosteroids and tazarotene, can cause limiting skin irritation, contact sensitization, and/or present long-term safety concerns. Recently, clinical data on a new fixed combination of halobetasol 0.01%/tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion were published.  We evaluated the results from two studies that assessed the potential for skin irritation (Study A) and contact sensitization (Study ) of HP/TAZ lotion.  HP/TAZ lotion and vehicle were studied in 244 healthy volunteers for the potential to induce contact skin sensitization. An additional 21-day cumulative irritation study was performed in 40 healthy volunteers to compare HP/TAZ lotion, vehicle, tazarotene 0.05% (Tazorac; Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) cream, and positive/negative controls. Cutaneous reactions at the application sites were evaluated in both studies clinically.  There was no evidence of contact sensitization, while the HP/TAZ lotion exhibited a low level of irritation in the induction phase. Mean cumulative irritation scores were 0.21 (HP/TAZ), 0.07 (vehicle), and 0.04 (saline). In the separate 21-day irritation study, mean cumulative irritation scores were 0.36 (HP/TAZ), 0.56 (tazarotene), 0.03 (vehicle), 0.23 (sodium lauryl sulfate), and 0.04 (saline), while mean total irritation scores were 7.55 (HP/TAZ), 11.60 (tazarotene, =0.0013 versus HP/TAZ), 0.63 (vehicle), 4.73 (sodium lauryl sulfate), and 0.88 (saline). HP/TAZ was "slightly irritating" but significantly less so than tazarotene (=0.0009).  HP/TAZ lotion caused only minimal skin irritation. It was significantly less irritating than tazarotene cream.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191553>Autoreactive T-Lymphocytes in Inflammatory Skin Diseases.</a></h2><p>The presence of one or several autoantigen(s) and a response by the adaptive immune system are the key criteria to classify a pathology as an autoimmune disease. The list of entities fulfilling this criterion is currently growing in the light of recent advancements in the pathogenetic understanding of a number of important dermatoses. The role of autoreactive T-lymphocytes differs amongst these pathologies. While they are directly involved as effector cells attacking and sometimes killing their respective target in some diseases (e.g., vitiligo), they provide help to -lymphocytes, which in turn produce the pathogenic autoreactive antibodies in others (pemphigus and pemphigoid). Atopic dermatits is a chimera in this regard, as there is evidence for both functions.  is an example for an entity where autoantigens were finally identified, suggesting that at least a subgroup of patients should be classified as suffering from a true autoimmune rather than autoinflammatory condition. Identification of resident memory T-lymphocytes (T) helped to understand why certain diseases relapse at the same site after seemingly effective therapy. Therefore, the in-depth characterization of autoreactive T-lyphocytes goes way beyond an academic exercise and opens the door toward improved therapies yielding durable responses. T are particularly suitable targets in this regard, and the clinical efficacy of some established and emerging therapeutic strategies such as the inhibition of Janus Kinase 3 or interleukin 15 may rely on their capacity to prevent T differentiation and maintenance. Research in this field brings us closer to the ultimate goal in the management of autoimmunity at large, namely resetting the immune system in order to restore the state of tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049925>Associations of cutaneous and extracutaneous infections with hidradenitis suppurativa in U.S. children and adults.</a></h2><p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is associated with bacterial colonization, skin-barrier disruption, immune dysregulation and treatments that can increase infection risk.To determine whether HS is associated with cutaneous and extracutaneous infections and related outcomes.Data from the 2002-2012 National Inpatient Sample were analysed, including a 20% sample of U.S. hospitalizations (n = 87Â 053Â 155).The prevalence (with 95% confidence interval) of infections was higher in adults (34Â·0%, 33Â·2-34Â·7% vs. 23Â·4%, 23Â·2-23Â·6%) and children (31Â·8%, 28Â·7-34Â·9% vs. 12Â·6% (12Â·1-13Â·1%) with vs. without HS.

Serum concentrations of the glucose and the following lipid metabolism parameters were measured: triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and apolipoproteins A and  (ApoA, ApoB). Oxidative status was determined as serum concentrations of ox-LDL/MDA Adduct. The  Area and Severity Index (PASI) was used to determine disease severity.Among the three studied groups, controls had the highest HDL concentration ( < 0.001), patients with PSA had the highest ApoB concentration ( < 0.05), ApoA : ApoB ratio ( < 0.05), ox-LDL/MDA adduct concentration ( < 0.001), and TC: HDL and LDL : HDL ratios (accordingly  < 0.05,  < 0.01). In patients with  or PSA, oxidative status correlated positively with TC and ApoB concentrations.In line with previous research, among patients with  and PSA, we found lipid metabolism abnormalities and an oxidative imbalance, which might be due to chronic inflammation in these conditions.

Gene mutations are found in some cases, but its immune pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we observed that the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in patients with GPP was higher than that in healthy controls and decreased after effective treatment. Neutrophils isolated from patients with GPP induced higher expressions of inflammatory genes including , , , , and C-X-C motif chemokine ligands in keratinocytes than normal neutrophils did. Moreover, neutrophils from patients with GPP secreted more exosomes than controls, which were then rapidly internalized by keratinocytes, increasing the expression of these inflammatory molecules  activating NF-Îº and MAPK signaling pathways. The proteomic profiles in neutrophil exosomes further characterized functional proteins and identified olfactomedin 4 as the critical differentially expressed protein that mediates the autoimmune inflammatory responses of GPP.

Such fasting has a positive impact on , but no data exist on its role in psoriatic arthritis (PsA)-a disease that is clearly linked to body mass index. We enrolled 37 patients (23 females and 14 males) with a mean age 43.32 Â± 7.81 and they fasted for 17 h for one month in 2016. The baseline PsA characteristics were collected and 12 (32.4%) patients had peripheral arthritis, 13 (35.1%) had axial involvement, 24 (64.9%) had enthesitis, and 13 (35.1%) had dactylitis. Three patients (8.1%) were treated with methotrexate, 28 (75.7%) with TNF-Î± blockers, and 6 (16.2%) with IL-17 blockers. After a month of intermittent fasting, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased from 14.08 Â± 4.65 to 12.16 Â± 4.46 ( < 0.0001), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) decreased from 2.83 Â± 1.03 to 2.08 Â± 0.67 ( = 0.0078),  Area Severity Index (PASI) decreased from 7.46 Â± 2.43 to 5.86 Â± 2.37 ( < 0.0001), and Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) decreased from 28.11 Â± 4.51 to 25.76 Â± 4.48 ( < 0.0001). Similarly, enthesitis improved after fasting, with Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) decreasing from 2.25 Â± 1.11 to 1.71 Â± 0.86 ( < 0.0001) and dactylitis severity score (DSS) decreasing from 9.92 Â± 2.93 to 8.54 Â± 2.79 ( = 0.0001). Fasting was found to be a predictor of a decrease in PsA disease activity scores (DAPSA, BASDAI, LEI, DSS) even after adjustment for weight loss.

Thus, early diagnosis of nail involvement may be essential for better management of PsO and PsA. Ultrasonography is considered a highly promising method to visualize nail disease. The main aim of this review was to evaluate the use of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of nail disease in patients with PsO and PsA by reviewing ultrasound parameters with the best diagnostic accuracy. Main body of the abstract: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE via the PubMed and LILACS databases. Conference proceedings of relevant rheumatology scientific meetings were also screened.After applying eligibility criteria, only 13 articles and 5 abstracts were included in this review. The selected studies showed a huge variability in evaluation methods (and therefore in the results) and were mainly focused on the assessment of nails ultrasound parameters that may differ among patients and healthy controls, especially the morphological aspects in -mode ultrasonography and vascularization of the nail bed by Doppler ultrasonography. Our research indicated that the evaluation of nail disease in PsO and PsA is still underrepresented in the literature, probably reflecting a restricted use in clinical practice, despite the widespread use of ultrasonography in the management of chronic arthritis.Despite the potential relevance of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of nail disease, additional studies are needed to determine which features are more reliable and clinically pertinent to ensure accuracy in the evaluation of nail involvement in PsO and PsA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011386>[Acute medullary infarct: a still little know diagnosis with a poor prognosis].</a></h2><p>Medullary infarct is still little known influencing the short-term vital and functional prognosis of patients.

The flavonoid genistein has a clear anti-inflammatory effect. However, the anti-psoriatic effects of genistein and their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of genistein on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced -like skin lesions in vivo and explored the mechanisms underlying those effects in vitro. It was found that genistein can significantly improve IMQ-induced pathological scores of cutaneous skin lesions in mice, reduce epidermal thickness, and inhibit the expression of inflammatory factorsï¼including interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), IL-17 and IL-23. In vitro studies, genistein inhibited the proliferation of human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors in a dose-dependent manner which induced by TNFÎ±. Further researches showed that genistein could also significantly inhibit phosphorylated STAT3 (pSAT3) expression in IMQ mice dorsal skin and in TNF-Î±-induced HaCaT cells. The inhibitory effect of genistein on the expression of IL-6, IL-23 and TNF-Î± was weakened after Stat3 siRNA in HaCaT cells. Genistein could also significantly inhibit TNF-Î± induced the nuclear translocation of NF-Îº, and inhibit the phosphorylation of I-kBÎ± (pI-kBÎ±). After combining with NF-Îº blocker BAY 11-7082, the effect of genistein down-regulate the expression of TNF-Î± and VEGFA was attenuated in HaCaT cells.

Numbers of studies point out that immune cells, including mast cells and T cells, play pathogenic roles in allergic skin diseases, and share similarities in the activation and secretion of cytokines. Calcium Release-Activated Calcium Modulator 1(CRACM1/ORAI1) is a subtype of Ca membrane channel, causing Ca influx into the cells. As a second messenger, Ca is an essential element that regulates immune responses, especially in the development and function of T and  cells. Thus, ORAI1 is considered to participate in allergic diseases. However, the specific mechanism of ORAI1 in skin disorders is still unclear. In order to investigate the roles of ORAI1 in allergic skin disorders, we reviewed the related articles and concluded that ORAI1 could be a potential therapeutic target for allergic skin diseases.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, besides type 1 cytokines that were formerly known, it was recently found that these cells secrete type 17 and type 22 cytokines. The majority of IL-17A+CD8+ T-cells in the blood belong to a subset of innate T-cells named mucosa-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT).

In contrast to Th17 cells that secrete only IL-17, Tc17 cells secrete IFN-Ï, TNF-Î±, CCL20, IL-22, and granzyme  as well. The key cytokine is IL-17A, which promotes keratinocyte hyperproliferation and stimulates them to produce other proinflammatory cytokines. These activities initiate and propagate the inflammation and architectural changes in the skin that clinically manifest as psoriatic lesions. However, a relatively novel cell subtype named Tc22 has been discovered in  that could secrete IL-22 in the absence of IL-17 and IFN-gamma.

The therapeutic management of a patient with  and infection with the HBV is a challenge as the classical systemic treatment (methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine) shows a high risk of immunosuppression and/or hepatic toxicity and the biological therapy is endangered by the possibility of HBV reactivation.

After 3 months of therapy with etanercept the patient was given a dose of etanercept of 50 mg/week combined with entecavir 0.5 mg/day which he continued until week 36 when psoriatic lesions had cleared (PASI=0.6; DLQI=0). No adverse effects were registered and there was no evidence of HBV viral replication or changes in viral markers. We wish to emphasize that the use of etanercept in a patient with  and hepatitis  is a successful therapeutic alternative which may be safely used concomitantly with entecavir, with regular monitoring of viral load and hepatic function tests.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374004>Obesity and dyslipidemia in patients with : A case-control study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the association between  and abnormal lipid metabolism.The case-control study included 222 psoriatic patients and 445 non-psoriatic control patients matched for age and gender. Clinical parameters included age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Serum lipid levels were recorded and included cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), phospholipids (PLIP), free fatty acids (FFA), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and apolipoproteins (apoA1, apoB, and apoE). Statistical analysis was carried out through the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Studies version 23.0.Compared with controls, levels of BMI and the prevalence of obesity were significantly higher in psoriatic patients. The results revealed that when compared to controls, significant elevation of serum TG (Pâ<.001) and Lp(a) (Pâ=â.022) was observed. Levels of HDL (Pâ<.001) and apoA1 (Pâ<.001) were significantly lower in psoriatic patients.

Here we review the metabolic effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), focusing on the effects of phototherapies (that administer UVR), and advice to increase sun exposure in individuals enrolled in clinical trials and intervention studies. We identified 25 studies in which the effects of UVR on metabolic outcomes were examined, including: narrowband ultraviolet  phototherapy (nbUVB, n = 12); psoralen ultraviolet A phototherapy (n = 4); other types of UVR phototherapy (n = 5); and sun exposure advice (n = 5). Most studies recruited a small number of participants (â¤100), who were middle-aged individuals undergoing treatment for  flare, with phototherapy or sun exposure advice administered for â¤12 weeks. Data obtained at baseline were usually compared with an endpoint following treatment with UVR, for a limited number of outcomes. There were few studies in which markers of glucose metabolism were assessed, with some beneficial effects of sun exposure (but not phototherapy) reported. LDL-cholesterol levels were lower in individuals receiving sun exposure advice, while treatment with nbUVB reduced blood concentrations of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). Future studies should focus on determining whether the effects of these interventions change with time, and if they are dependent on the source of UVR (i.e. phototherapy or sun exposure) and wavelength(s) of light administered. Furthermore, studies need to measure a variety of (clinical) markers of glucose metabolism, adiposity and inflammation, control for factors such as skin type and sex, and stratify participants for metabolic disease diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309173>Impact of prophylactic TNF blockade in the dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 immunotherapy efficacy and toxicity.</a></h2><p>The TNF blockade therapy is currently a well-established treatment option for a variety of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  or Crohn's disease, given the proinflammatory role of TNF in the course of these diseases. Importantly, TNF neutralization is also used for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by the combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. The manifestation of these toxicities is an important limiting factor for the successful implementation of the inhibitory checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB), restraining its anti-tumor efficacy. In our recent study (Perez-Ruiz , Nature 569(7756): 428-432.), we analyzed the potential impact of prophylactic TNF neutralization therapy in the anti-PD1/CTLA-4 efficacy. Through several mouse models, we demonstrated that TNF neutralization ameliorated ICB-exacerbated colitis in addition to improving ICB-dependent anti-tumor efficacy. Similar results were obtained after prophylactic TNF blockade in graft vs host xenografted mouse models with human immune cells, which showed a reduction in colitis and hepatitis. Importantly, there was a preservation of the immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumors after ICB treatment. Moreover, TNF and TNF-dependent gene expression is upregulated in the colon mucosa from patients affected by colitis as a side effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Our results, thus, provide evidence of the successful combination of prophylactic TNF neutralization with ICB therapy strategy to ameliorate toxicities, while keeping or even ameliorating anti-tumor efficacy. The prophylactic TNF blockade strategy is clinically feasible since excellent TNF inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of autoimmunity and are used for the immune-related serious adverse events in immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128893>Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in ankylosing spondylitis identifies HLA-*27 dependent and independent DNA methylation changes in whole blood.</a></h2><p>Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation of the sacroiliac joints and the spine that can lead to significant pain, immobility, and disability. The etiology and pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis are incompletely understood, though most patients carry the HLA-*27 allele. The objective of this study was to evaluate DNA methylation changes in ankylosing spondylitis with the goal of revealing novel mechanistic insights into this disease.Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed in whole blood DNA samples using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array in patients with ankylosing spondylitis compared to age, sex, and race matched patients with osteoarthritis as a non-inflammatory disease control. We studied 24 patients with ankylosing spondylitis, including 12 patients who carry HLA-*27 and 12 patients who are HLA-*27 negative. DNA methylation analysis was performed with adjustment for blood cell composition in each sample.We identified a total of 67 differentially methylated sites between ankylosing spondylitis patients and osteoarthritis controls. Hypermethylated genes found included GTPase-related genes, while hypomethylated genes included HCP5, which encodes a lncRNA within the MHC region, previously associated with genetic risk for  and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Carrying HLA-*27 was associated with robust hypomethylation of HCP5, tubulin folding cofactor A (TBCA) and phospholipase D Family Member 6 (PLD6) in ankylosing spondylitis patients. Hypomethylation within HCP5 involves a CpG site that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-*27 and that controls DNA methylation at this locus in an allele-specific manner.A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in ankylosing spondylitis identified DNA methylation patterns that could provide potential novel insights into this disease. Our findings suggest that HLA-*27 might play a role in ankylosing spondylitis in part through inducing epigenetic dysregulation.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Golimumab is effective in the management of patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and survival of golimumab monotherapy versus co-administration with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with PsA in the clinical practice. This retrospective observational trial included patients with PsA. Efficacy was assessed by disease activity scores - DAS28, BASDAI, physician global assessment of disease (PGA) and CRP. Golimumab survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Forty-one patients with PsA were recruited; 26 patients were treated with golimumab, whereas 15 patients received combination therapy with MTX. The treatment resulted in significantly improved clinical measures of disease activity in comparison with baseline, including DAS28 CRP (4.1 vs 2.6, pÂ â¤Â 0.0001) and BASDAI (5.6 vs 3.8, pÂ â¤Â 0.001). Overall, 29 (71%) patients continued golimumab treatment (18 patients on monotherapy and 11 on combination therapy). The difference in the duration of golimumab survival between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was not statistically significant (12.5 vs 12 months, pÂ =Â 0.2).

This study aimed to evaluate persistence of the immune response to the serogroup  meningococcal (MenB) vaccine MenB-FHbp (Trumenba, Bivalent rLP2086) under two- and three-dose primary vaccination schedules, both of which are approved in the United States and the European Union, and to assess safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose.This was an open-label extension study of a phase 2 randomized MenB-FHbp study (primary study). This interim analysis includes data through 1â¯month after booster vaccination. In the primary study, adolescents 11-18â¯years of age were randomized using an interactive voice or web-based response system to receive 120â¯Î¼g MenB-FHbp under 0-, 1-, 6-month; 0-, 2-, 6-month; 0-, 6-month; 0-, 2-month; or 0-, 4-month schedules (termed study groups for the current analysis). For the primary study, participants were blinded to their vaccine study group allocation, but investigators and the study sponsor were unblinded. Immune responses in subjects from the primary study were evaluated through 48â¯months after primary vaccination (persistence stage; 17 sites in Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden). Safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose given at 48â¯months after primary vaccination (booster stage; 14 sites in Czech Republic, Denmark, and Sweden) were also assessed. Immune responses were evaluated in serum bactericidal assays with human complement (hSBAs) using four MenB test strains representative of disease-causing MenB strains in the United States and Europe and expressing factor H binding proteins (FHbps) heterologous to the vaccine antigens. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the proportions of subjects with hSBA titers greater than or equal to the assays' lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; 1:8 or 1:16 depending on strain) at 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48â¯months after primary vaccination (persistence stage) and 1 and 48â¯months after the primary vaccination series and 1â¯month after receipt of the booster dose (booster stage). Safety evaluations during the booster stage included local reactions and systemic events by severity, antipyretic use, adverse events (AEs), immediate AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), medically attended AEs (MAEs), newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs), and missed days of school and work because of AEs. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was used for immunogenicity evaluations in the persistence stage. The booster stage immunogenicity evaluations used the evaluable immunogenicity population; analyses were also performed in the mITT population. For the persistence stage, safety evaluations included subjects with at least one blood draw, whereas for the booster stage, they included subjects who received the booster dose and had available safety data. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov number .A total of 465 subjects were enrolled in the persistence stage, and 271 subjects were enrolled in the booster stage. Sera for the extension phase of this interim analysis were collected from September 7, 2012 to December 7, 2015. One month after primary vaccination, 73.8-100.0% of subjects depending on study group responded with hSBA titers â¥LLOQ. Response rates declined during the 12â¯months after last primary vaccination and then remained stable through 48â¯months, with 18.0-61.3% of subjects depending on study group having hSBA titers â¥LLOQ at this time point. One month after receipt of the booster dose, 91.9-100.0% of subjects depending on study group had hSBA titers â¥LLOQ against the four primary strains individually and 91.8-98.2% had hSBA titers â¥LLOQ against all four strains combined (composite response). Geometric mean titers were higher after booster vaccination than at 1â¯month after primary vaccination. Immune responses were generally similar across study groups, regardless of whether a two- or three-dose primary series was received. None of the AEs (2.2-6.9% of subjects depending on study group) or NDCMCs (1.8-5.0%) that were reported during the persistence stage were considered related to the investigational product. Local reactions and systemic events were reported by 84.4-93.8% and 68.8-76.6% of subjects depending on study group, respectively, in the booster stage; these were generally similar across study groups, transient, and less frequent than after any primary vaccination. Additionally, there was no general progressive worsening in severity of reactogenicity events (ie, potentiation; â¤3 subjects per group), and reactogenicity events did not lead to any study withdrawals. No NDCMCs or immediate AEs were reported during the booster stage. AEs were reported by 3.7-12.5% of subjects depending on study group during the booster stage. The two possibly related AEs included a mild worsening of  and a severe influenza-like illness that resolved in 10â¯days.Immune responses declined after the primary vaccination series; however, a substantially greater number of subjects retained protective responses at 48â¯months after primary vaccination compared with subjects having protective responses before vaccination. Persistence trends were similar across all 5 study groups regardless of whether a two- or three-dose primary schedule was received. Furthermore, a booster dose given 48â¯months after primary vaccination was safe, well-tolerated, and elicited robust immune responses indicative of immunologic memory; these responses were similar between two- and three-dose primary schedule study groups. Use of a booster dose may help further extend protection against MenB disease in adolescents.Pfizer Inc.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Much remains to be elucidated about the biological effects of FAEs on lymphocytes.To evaluate the influence of long-term FAE (Fumaderm ) treatment on peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, CD19  cells and CD56 natural killer (NK) cells in .In this single-centre retrospective observational subcohort study, we obtained leucocyte and lymphocyte subset counts before initiating FAE therapy in 371  patients (mean age, 47.8Â years; 63.3% males) and monitored them during treatment (mean treatment duration, 2.9Â years). Multiparametric flow cytometry was used for immunophenotyping.FAEs significantly reduced the numbers of CD4 T, CD8 T, CD19  and CD56 NK cells. Among lymphocyte subsets, the mean percentage reduction from baseline was always highest for CD8 T cells, with a peak of 55.7% after 2Â years of therapy. The risk of T-cell lymphopenia increased significantly with the age of the  patients at the time that FAE therapy was initiated. It was significantly decreased for the combination therapy with methotrexate and folic acid (vitamin B9) supplementation. Supporting evidence was found suggesting that T-cell lymphopenia enhances the effectiveness of FAE therapy.Monitoring distinct T-cell subsets rather than just absolute lymphocyte counts may provide more meaningful insights into both the FAE treatment safety and efficacy. We therefore suggest optimizing pharmacovigilance by additionally monitoring CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts at regular intervals, especially in patients of middle to older age. Thus, further prospective studies are needed to establish evidence-based recommendations to guide dermatologists in the management of  patients who are taking FAEs and who develop low absolute T-cell counts.Â© 2019 The Authors.

No correlation between PASI and serum S100A8/A9 protein levels was found. These results implicate a role of S100A8/A9 in the anti-inflammatory effect of narrowband-UVB. Serum S100A8/A9 levels do not respond to treatment suggesting that serum S100A8/A9 does not originate from  skin keratinocytes. Serum S100A8/A9 levels do not correlate with PASI questioning serum S100A8/A9 as a biomarker for  skin activity.

A cross-sectional analysis of YouTube videos was conducted using the search terms  phototherapy and  laser. Of the 200 videos screened, 124 met inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight (54.8%) were generated by device manufacturers advertising their product, 35 (28.2%) by healthcare professionals, and 8 (6.5%) by patients delivering testimonials from experiences receiving therapy. Fourteen (11.2%) contained high-quality patient education content, 28 (22.5%) were fair quality, and 82 (66.1%) were low quality. Compared to videos generated by advertisers, those created by healthcare providers were of higher educational quality and more likely to be patient-directed. Neither the number of views nor interaction differed significantly among videos of varying educational quality, between videos presenting evidence-based versus non-evidence-based claims about , and between videos conveying positive versus negative messages regarding medical consultation. Overall, the majority of YouTube videos about phototherapy and excimer laser advertise devices are of fair-to-low educational quality and are not patient-centric.

We determined the effectiveness (PASI 75 or PASI < 5), and drug-survival using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and analyzed reasons for treatment interruption, drug substitution patterns, and costs.Etanercept was less effective (45%) than ustekinumab (85%) and adalimumab (71%). In 15% of patients, optimal responses were maintained despite dose intervals lengthening. Drug-survival was significantly lower for etanercept than for the other biologics (pâ<â.005). Most adalimumab and etanercept discontinuations were due to adverse events or lack of effectiveness; for ustekinumab the causes were unrelated to drug effects. Ustekinumab was 100% effective as a secondary biologic.Ustekinumab was the safest and most efficient treatment. Etanercept showed the highest treatment failure rate, incurring higher costs.

We aimed to investigate the dynamics of gut microbiome in response to secukinumab [an interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitor] and ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor) therapy and its association with treatment response in .This observational, longitudinal study collected a total of 114 fecal samples from 12 healthy controls and 34 patients with  at baseline and 3 and 6Â months after secukinumab (nâ=â24) or ustekinumab treatment (nâ=â10) and gut microbiomes were investigated using next-generation sequencing targeting 16S ribosomal RNA.Secukinumab treatment causes more profound alterations in gut microbiome, including increases in the relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria and decreases in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, than ustekinumab treatment. The relative abundance of family Pseudomonadaceae, family Enterobacteriaceae and order Pseudomonadales also increased significantly following secukinumab therapy. In contrast, there was no significant change in gut microbiome composition following ustekinumab treatment, and only genus Coprococcus significantly increased after 6Â months of ustekinumab therapy. Moreover, we observed significant differences in baseline gut microbiome between responders and non-responders to secukinumab treatment.These results indicate that gut microbiome is altered differently after anti-IL17 and anti-IL12/23 treatment.

Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) was found to represent the largest category in a Taiwanese cohort study. The aim in this study was to compare the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of ERA in a single tertiary center in Taiwan, as compared to those of other categories of JIA. Furthermore, we determined patients' characteristics and risk factors that can help assess the outcomes in ERA.A retrospective chart review of all patients with JIA referred to a pediatric rheumatology clinic in the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1993 and 2018 were identified according to ILAR criteria. Outcomes were assessed based on the Wallace criteria to categorize patients into active and non-active, including inactive, remission on medication, and remission off medication, groups. A subset of samples was further tested by DNA sequencing to identify HLA-B27 subtypes.One-hundred and eighty-three patients were included in the study, with a mean of 8âyears' follow-up. ERA was the single largest category of JIA (39.9%);  and undifferentiated JIA were both the least common type (0.5%). ERA was male predominant (86%), had a late age of onset (11.0âÂ±â3.2âyears), and the majority of ERA patients was HLA-B27-positive (97%). Of 25 HLA-B27-positive ERA patients checked by HLA-B27 sequencing, 23 were *27:04 and 2 were *27:05. ERA patients were significantly less likely to achieve non-active status compared to patients with persistent oligoarthritis (Pâ=â0.036). In terms of treatment response to TNF-Î± inhibitors in methotrexate-refractory ERA, 26 patients remained active and only 11 patients (30%) achieved a non-active status. Sacroiliitis was a risk factor contributing to poorer treatment response in ERA (Pâ=â0.006).ERA represented the most common category of JIA in Taiwan.

Pentoxifylline (PTX) has a profound anti-inflammatory activity and is clinically indicated in the management of . PTX is highly hydrophilic and thus is permeation-limited to exert its action on the psoriatic lesions. Colloidal nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) is a boon for dermal drug delivery, but incorporation of hydrophilic medicaments is not only difficult to be achieved but is accompanied by suboptimal loading, erratic drug release and time-consuming. The present study was designed to develop NLCs incorporating PTX using the recently explored thin lipid film based microwave assisted rapid technique. Prior to the formulation, the crystal structure of PTX was analyzed by molecular modeling. NLCs formed within 4â¯min having a size of <200â¯nm, PDI of <0.250 and a surface charge <-28â¯mV. PTX was loaded and encapsulated to an extent of 10% and 90% in the NLCs. The drug flux was 4.848â¯Î¼g/cm/h at the end of 24â¯h with a detection of 14% in the receptor fluid indicating a higher retention of PTX within the skin (>84%). In addition, the PTX loaded NLCs were tested against imiquimod-induced  in mouse model. Histological examinations clearly showed a higher levels of remodeling of the skin layers compared to disease control. These results justify NLCs to be a promising topical delivery system for PTX during  and can be rapidly produced without the requirement of complex equipment and conditions.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier .V.

The contribution of NETs to  pathogenesis has been unclear, but here we demonstrate that NETs drive inflammatory responses in skin through activation of epidermal TLR4/IL-36R crosstalk. This activation is dependent upon NETs formation and integrity, as targeting NETs with DNase I or CI-amidine  improves disease in the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced -like mouse model, decreasing IL-17A, lipocalin2 (LCN2), and IL-36G expression. Proinflammatory activity of NETs, and LCN2 induction, is dependent upon activation of TLR4/IL-36R crosstalk and MyD88/nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-Îº) down-stream signaling, but independent of TLR7 or TLR9. Notably, both TLR4 inhibition and LCN2 neutralization alleviate -like inflammation and NETs formation in both the IMQ model and K14-VEGF transgenic mice.

However, no approved therapies directly target this activated subset of macrophages.First, we undertook to examine whether the folate receptor beta (FR-Î²) positive subpopulation of macrophages, which marks the inflammatory subset in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, might constitute the prominent population of macrophages in inflamed lesions in humans. Next, we utilized anti-FR-Î² monoclonal antibodies capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) to treat animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis.Human tissue samples of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, , and scleroderma are all characterized by dramatic accumulation of macrophages that express FR-Î², a protein not expressed on resting macrophages or any other healthy tissues. A monoclonal antibody to FR-Î² accumulates specifically in inflamed lesions of murine inflammatory disease models and successfully treats such models of rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis. More importantly, elimination of FR-Î²-positive macrophages upon treatment with an anti-FR-Î² monoclonal antibody promotes the departure of other immune cells, including T cells,  cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells from the inflamed lesions.These data suggest that specific elimination of FR-Î²-expressing macrophages may constitute a highly specific therapy for multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and that a recently developed human anti-human FR-Î² monoclonal antibody (m909) might contribute to suppression of this subpopulation of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644151>Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further âhumanizingâ them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and , among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363057>A large case-control study on vaccination as risk factor for multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the hypothesis that vaccination is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) by use of German ambulatory claims data in a case-control study.Using the ambulatory claims data of the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians covering 2005-2017, logistic regression models were used to assess the relation between MS (n = 12,262) and vaccinations in the 5 years before first diagnosis. Participants newly diagnosed with Crohn disease (n = 19,296) or  (n = 112,292) and participants with no history of these autoimmune diseases (n = 79,185) served as controls.The odds of MS were lower in participants with a recorded vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 0.870,  < 0.001 vs participants without autoimmune disease; OR 0.919,  < 0.001 vs participants with Crohn disease; OR 0.973,  = 0.177 vs participants with ). Lower odds were most pronounced for vaccinations against influenza and tick-borne encephalitis. These effects were consistently observed for different time frames, control cohorts, and definitions of the MS cohort. Effect sizes increased toward the time of first diagnosis.Results of the present study do not reveal vaccination to be a risk factor for MS. On the contrary, they consistently suggest that vaccination is associated with a lower likelihood of being diagnosed with MS within the next 5 years.

Recently, an autoimmune footprint of PsA pathogenesis has been demonstrated with the presence of autoantigens and related autoantibodies in PsA patients' sera. In this context, histological features of PsA synovitis supports the relevance of an autoimmune pathogenesis of the disease. Since there is no currently validated test for PsA, the analysis of PsA synovial tissue revealed pathognomonic characteristics of PsA that may support the clinician in the clinical practice. PsA synovitis is characterized by a sublining infiltrate with T and  cells, vascular proliferation and a relative thin lining layer of proliferating intimal synoviocytes. PsA synovial histopathology shows that ectopic lymphoid-neogenesis with an increase of IL-23 expression. These new pathogenetics features and the systemic nature of the disease raised the concept of a Systemic Psoriatic Disease (SysPsD), characterized by multiple extra-cutaneous and -articular manifestations, highlightening the great heterogeneity of this condition. SyPsD represents a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory condition with a wide spectrum of phenotypical manifestations. The purpose of this review is to describe the new pathogenetic mechanisms and the different clinical pictures of SysPsD, with the ultimate goal of improving the knowledge of this heterogeneous chronic inflammatory condition.Copyright Â© 2019.

Recently, there has been a proliferation of new targeted treatment options, including anti-interleukin-17, anti-interleukin-12/23, as well as small-molecule drugs such as apremilast. There are nevertheless some concerns regarding their use, especially in patients with chronic infections such as hepatitis  virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). It has been estimated that two billion individuals are infected with HBV worldwide and approximately 240 million have chronic HBV infection. Moreover, there are approximately 71 million individuals with chronic HCV infection worldwide, with a high percentage of them unaware of being infected. As patients with HBV and HCV infections are excluded from controlled clinical trials investigating new drugs, data regarding their safety in patients with  are based almost exclusively on case reports and small retrospective cohort studies and need to be constantly updated. The risk of HBV reactivation can be defined as: high risk (â¥â10%), moderate risk (1-10%), and low risk (<â1%) depending on the type of immunosuppressive therapy stratified by the presence or absence of hepatitis  surface antigen but positivity to anti-hepatitis  core antigen. Hepatitis  surface antigen-positive patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-Î± inhibitors, ustekinumab, or cyclosporine carry a high or moderate risk of HBV reactivation and should be considered candidates for prophylactic anti-HBV therapy. Once therapy is commenced, it is important to check HBV DNA levels every 3Â months. Hepatitis  virus reactivation typically occurs with immune reconstitution and therefore antiviral therapy should continue for 6-12Â months after stopping immunosuppression. Hepatitis  surface antigen-positive patients who are prescribed methotrexate, acitretin, or apremilast have a low risk and need to be monitored for viral reactivation by determining alanine aminotransferase and HBV DNA levels every 3Â months. No conclusive data are available for interleukin-17 and interleukin-23 inhibitors. Anti-hepatitis  core antigen-positive patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-Î± inhibitors, ustekinumab, and cyclosporine are linked to a moderate risk of reactivation, and they should preferably undergo HBV DNA or hepatitis  surface antigen and alanine aminotransferase testing rather than be subjected to routine pre-emptive therapy. Anti-hepatitis  core antigen-positive patients receiving methotrexate, acitretin, or apremilast have a low risk of reactivation and do not require anti-HBV therapy, nor should monitoring be considered mandatory.

Lesional skin of AD contains elevated levels of Th2, Th17, Th22 and Th1-citokines. With a growing movement toward use of targeted therapies, parallel to , JAK inhibitors are an important focus of therapeutic research for AD.We review current evidence on the efficacy and safety of oral and topical JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AD.Several JAK inhibitors are in phase II and III clinical trials as oral therapies for moderate-to-severe AD or as topical treatments for mild-to-moderate AD. Results thus far are encouraging, with the majority of the patients achieving the primary outcome of their trial as well as a favorable safety profile.JAK inhibitors will most certainly be the first oral targeted option when topical therapy fails. With good oral bioavailability and lack of immunogenicity, they address some of the limitations of biologics. Yet to be defined is whether selective JAK 1 inhibitors or nonselective JAK inhibitors will provide the best equilibrium of efficacy versus side effects. Less clear is the position in the therapeutic ladder for topical JAK inhibitors; although, an unmeet need exists in the topical treatment of AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773373>Clinical significance and immunobiology of IL-21 in autoimmunity.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-21 (IL-21), an autocrine cytokine predominantly produced by follicular helper T (Tfh) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells, has been proven to play an important role in the immune system, for example, by promoting proliferation and the development of Tfh and Th17â¯cells, balancing helper T cell subsets, inducing  cell generation and differentiation into plasma cells, and enhancing the production of immunoglobulin. These effects are mainly mediated by activation of the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI3K pathways. Some IL-21 target genes, such as  lymphocyte induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), CXCR5 and Bcl-6, play important roles in the immune response. Therefore, IL-21 has been linked to autoimmune diseases. Indeed, IL-21 levels are increased in the peripheral blood and tissues of patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and . This increased IL-21 even positively associates with Tfh cells, plasma cells, autoantibodies and disease activity in SLE and RA. Additionally, IL-21 has been utilized as a therapeutic target in SLE, RA, T1D and psoriatic mouse models. Profoundly, clinical trials have shown safety and improvement in RA patients. However, tolerance and long-term pharmacodynamics effects with low bioavailability have been found in SLE patients. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the latest progress on IL-21 function and its signaling pathway and discuss the role of IL-21 in the pathogenesis of and therapy for autoimmune diseases, with the hope of providing potential therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for clinical use.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with activation of T helper (Th)Â 2 and Th17 immunity and a compromised epidermal barrier.The objectives of this study were to examine the expression of PDE4 isoforms in skin from healthy subjects and AD patients, and to determine the effects of apremilast on AD-related inflammatory markers in vitro and in murine models of AD.The expression of PDE4 isoforms (A, , C, and D) in skin biopsies from healthy subjects and AD patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated the effects of apremilast on gene expression in adult human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKa) stimulated by Th2 and Th17 cytokines, and in two mouse models of antigen-induced AD.Expression of PDE4 isoforms increased up to three-fold in the epidermis of AD patients versus healthy skin. In interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17-stimulated HEKa cells, apremilast significantly changed the expression of ILs, including IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-31, and alarmins S100A7, S100A8, and S100A12. In mouse models of AD, apremilast significantly reduced ear swelling and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression.PDE4 is overexpressed in AD skin compared with normal skin, and inflammatory gene expression by human keratinocytes and mouse dermatitis can be modulated by apremilast.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017383>Successful Treatment of Refractory Plaque-Type  and Psoriatic Arthritis With Guselkumab and Adalimumab Combination Therapy: A Case Report</a></h2><p>Copy: A number of biologics have been approved for use in plaque-type . They act by either blocking the action of a specific type of cell or protein in the immune system. Case presentation: Herein, we report a case of a 46-year-old woman with a 12-year history of severe plaque  and psoriatic arthritis who was treated successfully with guselkumab and adalimumab after failure of prior topical corticosteroids, cyclosporine and narrow-band ultraviolet  (NBUVB) phototherapy. Conclusion: There is limited data supporting the combination of biological agents in the management of  and psoriatic arthritis. This is the first case report of plaque  with arthritis, successfully treated with guselkumab and adalimumab combination therapy, without concurrent use of other systemic agents during the treatment. However, further studies need to be carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this biologic combination therapy. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(4):394-396.</p></html>
