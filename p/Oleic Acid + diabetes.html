The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of N-Oleoyl glycine (OLGly), a lipoamino , on 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and to explore the likely mechanisms underlying this process. Lipid accumulation were evaluated using Oil Red O staining and triglyceride content assay. The mRNA expressions of cannabinoid receptors and the protein expressions of adipogenic genes and intracellular signaling pathway were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. The results indicated that OLGly itself, but not its degradation products, stimulated lipid accumulation and significantly increased adipogenic genes (PPARγ and aP2), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, OLGly markedly increased the mRNA expression of CB1 receptor (CB1R) and the inhibition of CB1R by its antagonist SR141716 abolished the promotive effects of OLGly on lipid accumulation and the protein expression of PPARγ and aP2. Furthermore, OLGly increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and p-FoxO1/FoxO1, which could be reversed by SR141716. Moreover, OLGly-induced enhancement of adipogenesis, activation of insulin-mediated Akt signaling pathway and inactivation of FoxO1 were effectively blocked by Wortmannin, a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor, indicating the essential role of Akt signaling pathway in the process of OLGly-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. In conclusion, OLGly, a lipoamino , was able to promote 3T3-L1 adipogenesis through the activation of CB1 receptor and the enhancement of insulin-mediated Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggested the potential role of OLGly in increasing insulin sensitivity and suppressing obesity and .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) plays a key role in conveying to the spinal cord pain modulatory influences triggered in higher brain centres, with co-existence of inhibitory (antinociceptive) and facilitatory (pronociceptive) effects. In spite of some reports of TRPV1 expression in the RVM, it remains unknown if endovanilloid signalling plays a direct role in local pain modulation. Here we used a model of diabetic neuropathy, the streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rat, to study the role of endovanilloid signalling in RVM-mediated pain modulation during chronic pain. Four weeks after  induction, the levels of TRPV1 mRNA and fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), a crucial enzyme for endovanilloid catabolism, in the RVM of STZ-diabetic rats were higher than control. The RVM of STZ-diabetic rats presented decreased levels of several TRPV1 endogenous ligands, namely anandamide (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA). Administration of capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) into the RVM decreased nociceptive behavioural responses in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test (phase 2). These findings suggest that diabetic neuropathy induces plastic changes of RVM endovanilloid signalling, indicating that TRPV1 may be a putative target for pain modulation in this chronic pain condition.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28625206>Organic food consumption during pregnancy and its association with health-related characteristics: the KOALA Birth Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>To investigate the associations of organic food consumption with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, hypertension and  in pregnancy, and several blood biomarkers of pregnant women.Prospective cohort study.Pregnant women were recruited at midwives' practices and through channels related to consumption of food from organic origin.Pregnant women who filled in FFQ and donated a blood sample (n 1339). Participant groups were defined based on the share of consumed organic products; to discriminate between effects of food origin and food patterns, healthy diet indicators were considered in some statistical models.Consumption of organic food was associated with a more favourable pre-pregnancy BMI and lower prevalence of gestational . Compared with participants consuming no organic food (reference group), a marker of dairy products intake (pentadecanoic ) and trans-fatty acids from natural origin (vaccenic and rumenic acids) were higher among participants consuming organic food (organic groups), whereas elaidic , a marker of the intake of trans-fatty acids found in industrially hydrogenated fats, was lower. Plasma levels of homocysteine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in the organic groups than in the reference group. Differences in pentadecanoic , vaccenic  and vitamin D retained statistical significance when correcting for indicators of the healthy diet pattern associated with the consumption of organic food.Consumption of organic food during pregnancy is associated with several health-related characteristics and blood biomarkers.

Biomarkers of dietary intake are unconfounded by recall and reporting bias, and using multiple dietary biomarkers could help strengthen the link between a healthy diet and the prevention of T2D. The objective of this study was to explore how diet is related to glucose tolerance status (GTS) and to future development of T2D irrespective of common T2D and cardiovascular disease risk factors by using multiple dietary biomarkers. Dietary biomarkers were measured in plasma from 64-y-old Swedish women with different GTS [normal glucose tolerance (NGT;  = 190), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT;  = 209), and  ( = 230)]. The same subjects were followed up after 5 y to determine changes in glucose tolerance ( = 167 for NGT,  = 174 for IGT, and  = 159 for ). ANCOVA and logistic regression were used to explore baseline data for associations between dietary biomarkers, GTS, and new T2D cases at follow-up ( = 69). Of the 10 dietary biomarkers analyzed, β-alanine (beef) (-raw < 0.001), alkylresorcinols C17 and C19 (whole-grain wheat and rye) (-raw = 0.003 and 0.011), eicosapentaenoic  (fish) (-raw = 0.041), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic  (CMPF) (fish) (-raw = 0.002), linoleic  (-raw < 0.001),  (-raw = 0.003), and α-tocopherol (margarine and vegetable oil) (-raw < 0.001) were associated with GTS, and CMPF (fish) (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.93; -raw = 0.013) and α-tocopherol (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.98; -raw = 0.041) were inversely associated with future T2D development.

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of glycine remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that glycine regulates adipocyte differentiation, adipogenesis, and lipolysis, therefore, contributing to white-fat reduction. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were induced to differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of glycine (0, 0.25, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L) or resveratrol (50 or 100 μmol/L, served as a positive control) during the differentiation process. Hela and HepG2 cells cultured with  to induce lipid accumulation in the presence of glycine (0, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L) or 10 μmol/L isoproterenol (served as a positive control) for 24 h. Intracellular lipid accumulation, intracellular triglycerides, lipid droplets' diameters of mature adipocytes, mRNA, and protein levels of genes involved in the adipogenesis and lipolysis were analyzed. Isobutylxanthine-dexamethasone-insulin (MDI)-induced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells were blocked by resveratrol, but not by glycine, as shown by decreased lipid contents, reduced diameters of lipid droplets, decreased protein abundances for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), as well as increased protein abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), critical transcriptional factors that regulates adipogenesis. However, the mRNA levels of adiponectin and interleukin-10 (IL-10), two adipose-derived adipocytokines with anti-inflammatory effects, were greatly enhanced (P < 0.05) by 2 mmol/L glycine. Compared with non-treated controls, 10 μmol/L isoproterenol significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the intracellular lipid and triglyceride contents induced by  in Hela and HepG2 cells. mRNA level of fatty  synthase (FASN), a gene involved in fatty  synthesis, was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), while that for ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), genes involved in lipolysis were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) by isoproterenol. However,  induced the accumulation of intracellular triglyceride and lipid contents were not affected by glycine. In conclusion, glycine exposure enhanced the mRNA levels of adipose-derived adiponectin and IL-10 without affecting adipogenesis and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings provide a possible explanation for the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of glycine that were previously reported in animal models. More studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for this regulatory effect of glycine on anti-inflammatory adipocytokines expression in both in vitro and in vivo models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26831066>Role of growth hormone-releasing hormone in dyslipidemia associated with experimental type 1 .</a></h2><p>Dyslipidemia associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) represents an important residual risk factor for cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease in patients with type 1  (T1D). Levels of growth hormone (GH) are elevated in T1D, which aggravates both hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) regulates the release of GH by the pituitary but also exerts separate actions on peripheral GHRH receptors, the functional role of which remains elusive in T1D. In a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D, GHRH receptor expression was found to be up-regulated in the distal small intestine, a tissue involved in chylomicron synthesis. Treatment of T1D rats with a GHRH antagonist, MIA-602, at a dose that did not affect plasma GH levels, significantly reduced TRL, as well as markers of renal injury, and improved endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) reduces hyperglucagonemia and postprandial TRL, the latter in part through a decreased synthesis of apolipoprotein B-48 (ApoB-48) by intestinal cells. Although plasma GLP-1 levels were elevated in diabetic animals, this was accompanied by increased rather than reduced glucagon levels, suggesting impaired GLP-1 signaling. Treatment with MIA-602 normalized GLP-1 and glucagon to control levels in T1D rats. MIA-602 also decreased secretion of ApoB-48 from rat intestinal epithelial cells in response to  stimulation in vitro, in part through a GLP-1-dependent mechanism. Our findings support the hypothesis that antagonizing the signaling of GHRH in T1D may improve GLP-1 function in the small intestine, which, in turn, diminishes TRL and reduces renal and vascular complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330461>Comparing olive oil and C4-dietary oil, a prodrug for the GPR119 agonist, 2-oleoyl glycerol, less energy intake of the latter is needed to stimulate incretin hormone secretion in overweight subjects with type 2 .</a></h2><p>After digestion, dietary triacylglycerol stimulates incretin release in humans, mainly through generation of 2-monoacylglycerol, an agonist for the intestinal G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119). Enhanced incretin release may have beneficial metabolic effects. However, dietary fat may promote weight gain and should therefore be restricted in obesity. We designed C4-dietary oil (1,3-di-butyryl-2-oleoyl glycerol) as a 2-oleoyl glycerol (2-OG)-generating fat type, which would stimulate incretin release to the same extent while providing less calories than equimolar amounts of common triglycerides, e.g., olive oil.We studied the effect over 180 min of (a) 19 g olive oil plus 200 g carrot, (b) 10.7 g C4 dietary oil plus 200 g carrot and (c) 200 g carrot, respectively, on plasma responses of gut and pancreatic hormones in 13 overweight patients with type 2  (T2D). Theoretically, both oil meals result in formation of 7.7 g 2-OG during digestion.Both olive oil and C4-dietary oil resulted in greater postprandial (P ≤ 0.01) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses (incremental area under curve (iAUC)): iAUC: 645 ± 194 and 702 ± 97 pM × min; iAUC: 4,338 ± 764 and 2,894 ± 601 pM × min) compared to the carrot meal (iAUC: 7 ± 103 pM × min; iAUC: 266 ± 234 pM × min). iAUC for GLP-1 and GIP were similar for C4-dietary oil and olive oil, although olive oil resulted in a higher peak value for GIP than C4-dietary oil.C4-dietary oil enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP to almost the same extent as olive oil, in spite of liberation of both 2-OG and , which also may stimulate incretin secretion, from olive oil. Thus, C4-dietary oil is more effective as incretin releaser than olive oil per unit of energy and may be useful for dietary intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152354>Non-polar lipids characterization of Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) seed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with flame ionization/mass spectrometry detection and non-aqueous reversed-phase liquid chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry detection.</a></h2><p>A chemical characterization of major lipid components, namely, triacylglycerols, fatty acids and the unsaponifiable fraction, in a Quinoa seed lipids sample is reported. To tackle such a task, non-aqueous reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection was employed. The latter was interfaced with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization for the analysis of triacylglycerols. The main triacylglycerols (>10%) were represented by OLP, OOL and OLL (P = palmitoyl, O = oleoyl, L = linoleoyl); the latter was present in the oil sample at the highest percentage (18.1%). Furthermore, fatty  methyl esters were evaluated by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. 89% of the total fatty acids was represented by unsaturated fatty  methyl esters with the greatest percentage represented by linoleic and  acids accounting for approximately 48 and 28%, respectively. An extensive characterization of the unsaponifiable fraction of Quinoa seed lipids was performed for the first time, by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with dual mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in FFAs accumulation and its modulation could drive the development of potential therapies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of picroside II, a phytoactive found in , on fatty  accumulation vis-à-vis silibinin, a known hepatoprotective phytoactive from .HepG2 cells were loaded with FFAs (:palmitic /2:1) for 20 hours to mimic hepatic steatosis. The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of fatty  transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated fatty  accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis. Picroside II also decreased the expression of gluconeogenic genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008091>The Association between Dietary Fat Pattern and the Risk of Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Despite several studies examining single dietary fats on type 2  (T2D) incidence, little is known about the effects of multiple fatty acids on the risk of T2D. We aimed to address this question in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) population. Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, , linoleic , linolenic , and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary total fat intake hazard ratio [HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77~2.23 and HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.27~1.76, in the second and third tertile, respectively] was not related to the development of T2D. Animal- and plant-based dietary fat intakes were additionally not related to the risk of T2D. After adjustment for confounding variables, there was no significant association between dietary fat pattern score and T2D incidence. Whereas, the third pattern had a borderline negative association with  development (HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.29~1.07).

We identify an age-dependent lipid homeostasis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the mobilization of lipids from the soma to the germline, which supports fecundity but at the cost of survival in nutrient-poor and oxidative stress environments. This trade-off is responsive to the levels of dietary carbohydrates and organismal  and is coupled to activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1 in both laboratory-derived and natural isolates of C. elegans. The homeostatic balance of lipid stores between the somatic and germ cells is mediated by arachidonic  (omega-6) and eicosapentaenoic  (omega-3) precursors of eicosanoid signaling molecules.

Although ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of , it is indispensable for cellular activity. Therefore, when assessing the pathological significance of ER stress, it is important to monitor and quantify ER stress levels. Here, we have established a novel system to monitor ER stress levels quickly and sensitively, and using this method, we have clarified the effect of differences in glucose concentration and various fatty acids on the ER of pancreatic β cells. First, we developed a cell system that secretes Gaussia luciferase in culture medium depending on the activation of the GRP78 promoter. This system could sensitively monitor ER stress levels that could not be detected with real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. This system revealed that hyperglycemia does not induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in a short period of time in MIN6 cells, a mouse pancreatic β cell line. Physiological concentrations of palmitic , a saturated fatty , induced ER stress quickly, while physiological concentrations of , an unsaturated fatty , did not. Docosahexaenoic , an n-3 unsaturated fatty , inhibited palmitic -induced ER stress.

This system can be used to monitor the state of the ER in living cells and lead to the investigation of the significance of physiological or pathological ER stress levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292465>Structural characterization of life-extending Caenorhabditis elegans Lipid Binding Protein 8.</a></h2><p>The lysosome plays a crucial role in the regulation of longevity. Lysosomal degradation is tightly coupled with autophagy that is induced by many longevity paradigms and required for lifespan extension.

A Caco-2 cell assay determined the content of free glucose.The ALH extract of P canariensis showed potent inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 2.13 and 1.25 mg/mL as compared with α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively, and produced inhibition in rat intestinal sucrose. Further, the ALM extract showed significantly inhibitory effects against PL, LPL, and lipolysis of 3T3-LI adipocytes.The results provide evidence for the effects of the seeds of P canariensis for a retarded absorption of carbohydrates and lipids through the inhibition of enzymes that are related to obesity and  type 2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419197>Inhibition of sarcolemmal FAT/CD36 by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate rapidly corrects metabolism and restores function in the diabetic heart following hypoxia/reoxygenation.</a></h2><p>The type 2 diabetic heart oxidizes more fat and less glucose, which can impair metabolic flexibility and function.

Unlike other metabolic modulators that target mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, we proposed that pharmacologically inhibiting fatty  uptake, as the primary step in the pathway, would provide an alternative mechanism to rebalance metabolism and prevent lipid accumulation following hypoxic stress.Hearts from type 2 diabetic and control male Wistar rats were perfused in normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation, with the FAT/CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) infused 4 min before hypoxia. SSO infusion into diabetic hearts decreased the fatty  oxidation rate by 29% and myocardial triglyceride concentration by 48% compared with untreated diabetic hearts, restoring fatty  metabolism to control levels following hypoxia-reoxygenation. SSO infusion increased the glycolytic rate by 46% in diabetic hearts during hypoxia, increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by 53% and decreased lactate efflux rate by 56% compared with untreated diabetic hearts during reoxygenation. In addition, SSO treatment of diabetic hearts increased intermediates within the second span of the Krebs cycle, namely fumarate, oxaloacetate, and the FAD total pool. The cardiac dysfunction in diabetic hearts following decreased oxygen availability was prevented by SSO-infusion prior to the hypoxic stress. Infusing SSO into diabetic hearts increased rate pressure product by 60% during hypoxia and by 32% following reoxygenation, restoring function to control levels.Diabetic hearts have limited metabolic flexibility and cardiac dysfunction when stressed, which can be rapidly rectified by reducing fatty  uptake with the FAT/CD36 inhibitor, SSO. This novel therapeutic approach not only reduces fat oxidation but also lipotoxicity, by targeting the primary step in the fatty  metabolism pathway.© The Author 2017.

(HDT) was known to have anti-fatigue, anti-, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective effects. In the present study, the anti-fatty liver mechanism of HDT was elucidated in  (OA)-treated Hep G2 cells and acute hyperlipidemia mouse model using Triton WR-1339. Here, HDT activated p-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), proliferator activated receptor-α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase and also inhibited the expression of lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis proteins, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, SREBP-2, and fatty  synthase in OA-treated Hep G2 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C blocked the anti-fatty liver effect of HDT to induce AMPK phosphorylation and decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and lipid accumulation by oil red O staining in OA-treated Hep G2 cells. Additionally, HDT pretreatment protected against the increase of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in an acute hyperlipidemia mouse model with enhancement of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities. Taken together, HDT inhibits OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation via activation of AMPK and proliferator activated receptor-α/carnitine palmitoyltransferase signaling and enhancement of antioxidant activity as a potent candidate for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599279>Predictive metabolic signatures for the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy and the intervention of Ginkgo biloba leaves extract based on gas or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the leading causes of death in  (DM). Early warning and therapy has significant clinical value for DN. This research sought to find biomarkers to predict the occurrence and development of DN and the intervention of Ginkgo biloba leaves extract (GBE) by quantifying fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleosides and nucleobases in rat plasma. Samples were respectively collected at the weekend of 5-10 weeks after diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin were defined. Plasma fasting blood-glucose, kidney index, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urine albumin excretion and ultrastructural morphology of kidney were measured or observed. Fatty acids, amino acids and nucleosides and nucleobases in rat plasma were analyzed by gas chromatography or liquid phase chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively. From the biochemical index and morphological change of kidney, the rats from the 5th to 7th week were in the stage of DM while from the begin of 8th week the rats were suggested in the early stage of DN. The results of quantitative metabolomics showed that 16 differential metabolites were related to the progression of DN, and , glutamate and guanosine might be the potential biomarkers of kidney injury. 14 differential metabolites were related to GBE against the progression of DN, while  and glutamate might be the potential biomarkers of GBE against kidney injury. Those findings potentially promote the understanding of the pathogenic progression of DN and reveal the therapeutic mechanism of GBE against DN.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is necessary to detect physiological changes in T2DM rapidly and stratify diabetic stage using other biomarkers. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to contribute to the development of objective and sensitive diagnostic indicators by integrating metabolite biomarkers derived from large-scale cohort studies.We searched for metabolomics studies of T2DM cohort in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published within the last 10 years from January 2008 to February 2017. The concentrations of metabolites and odds ratios (ORs) were integrated and risk ratio (RR) values were estimated to distinguish subjects with T2DM and normal participants.Fourteen cohort studies were investigated in this meta-analysis. There were 4592 patients in the case group and 11,492 participants in the control group. We noted a 1.89-, 1.63-, and 1.87-fold higher risk of T2DM associated with leucine (RR 1.89 [95% CI 1.57-2.29]), alanine (RR 1.63 [95% CI 1.48-1.79]), and  (RR 1.87 [95% CI 1.62-2.17]), respectively. Lysophosphatidylcholine C18:0 (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.72-0.90]) and creatinine (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.53-0.74]) were associated with 20% and 37% decreased T2DM risks, respectively.Most amino acids in patients were positively related to , while creatinine and some lysophosphatidylcholines showed a negative relationship.

In this study we found that ginsenoside Rb2, one of the major ginsenosides in Panax ginseng, was able to prevent hepatic lipid accumulation through autophagy induction both in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of male db/db mice with Rb2 significantly improved glucose tolerance, decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, and restored hepatic autophagy. In vitro, Rb2 (50 µmol/L) obviously increased autophagic flux in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes, and consequently reduced the lipid accumulation induced by  in combination with high glucose. Western blotting analysis showed that Rb2 partly reversed the high fatty  in combination with high glucose (OA)-induced repression of autophagic pathways including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and silent information regulator 1 (sirt1). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the sirt1 or AMPK pathways attenuated these beneficial effects of Rb2 on hepatic autophagy and lipid accumulation. Taken together, these results suggested that Rb2 alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation by restoring autophagy via the induction of sirt1 and activation of AMPK, and resulted in improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and glucose tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484112>Association between Serum Elaidic  Concentration and Insulin Resistance in Two Japanese Cohorts with Different Lifestyles.</a></h2><p>Many cohort studies have shown that increased trans fatty  (TFA) intake increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease.

Serum elaidic  concentration was measured and compared, and its association with insulin resistance was assessed.Serum elaidic  concentrations were significantly higher in the Japanese-Americans (median, 18.2 µmol/L) than in the native Japanese (median, 11.0 µmol/L). The serum elaidic  concentrations in the native Japanese DM group (16.0 µmol/L) were significantly higher compared with those in the normal glucose tolerance (10.8 µmol/L) and impaired glucose tolerance (11.7 µmol/L) groups. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that serum elaidic  concentrations were significantly positively associated with homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values after adjusting for various factors.These results suggest that excessive TFA intake worsens insulin resistance and increases the risk of developing DM even in the native Japanese, whose intakes of animal fat and simple carbohydrates were presumed to be lower than those of the Japanese-Americans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380951>Effects of short-term sex steroid suppression on dietary fat storage patterns in healthy males.</a></h2><p>Hypogonadism in males is associated with increased body fat and altered postprandial metabolism, but mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a cross-over study design, we investigated the effects of short-term sex hormone suppression with or without testosterone add-back on postprandial metabolism and the fate of dietary fat. Eleven healthy males (age: 29 ± 4.5 year; BMI: 26.3 ± 2.1 kg/m ) completed two 7-day study phases during which hormone levels were altered pharmacologically to produce a low sex hormone condition (gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist, aromatase inhibitor, and placebo gel) or a testosterone add-back condition (testosterone gel). Following 7 days of therapy, subjects were administered an inpatient test meal containing 50 μCi of [1- C] . Plasma samples were collected hourly for 5 h to assess postprandial responses. Energy metabolism (indirect calorimetry) and dietary fat oxidation ( CO in breath) were assessed at 1, 3, 5, 13.5, and 24 h following the test meal. Abdominal and femoral adipose biopsies were taken 24 h after the test meal to determine uptake of the labeled lipid. Postprandial glucose, insulin, free-fatty , and triglyceride responses were not different between conditions (P > 0.05). Whole-body energy metabolism was also not different between conditions at any time point (P > 0.05). Dietary fat oxidation trended lower (P = 0.12) and the relative uptake of  C labeled lipid into femoral adipose tissue was greater (P = 0.03) in the low hormone condition. Short-term hormone suppression did not affect energy expenditure or postprandial metabolism, but contributed to greater relative storage of dietary fat in the femoral depot.

It is well known that, in beef, the main FAs associated with these biological processes are  (C18:1 cis9, OA) and conjugated linoleic  (CLA-c9t11), which may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases such as type 2  and obesity. Here, we performed differential expression and co-expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and partial correlation with information theory (PCIT), to uncover the complex interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle associated with FA content. miRNA and mRNA expression data were obtained from skeletal muscle of Nelore cattle that had extreme genomic breeding values for OA and CLA. Insulin and MAPK signaling pathways were identified by WGCNA as central pathways associated with both of these fatty acids.

The uniformity of biologic effect of exogenous nicotinic  and endogenous insulin permits to become aware that a) the hypo-lipidemic activity of insulin, inhibition of lipolysis in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent adipocytes and decreasing of content of unesterified fatty acids in blood plasma are considered as a basis of hypoglycemic effect of insulin; b) nicotinic  similar to insulin blocks lipolysis too but in hormoneindependent visceral fatty cells. The counter-insular effect is manifested in vivo by exogenous and endogenous palmitic saturated fatty  by force of physical chemical characteristics. The biological role of insulin consists in regulation of metabolism of fatty acids mainly unesterified fatty acids and in absorption of glucose by all insulin-dependent cells. It is supposed that contractile cells (myocytes and cardiomyocytes) cumulate glycogen for implementing glucose as a substrate in synthesis in situ de novo of ῲ-9  mono-saturated fatty . The insulin initiates synthesis because mitochondria process this mono-saturated fatty to β-oxidation with the highest constant of reaction velocity. This is conditioned by physical chemical characteristics of  mono-saturated fatty , positioning of double bond in the chain of fatty ; this ensures maximal efficiency of ATP gaining. In phylogenesis, the low efficient palmitic alternative of metabolism of fatty acids is formed the earliest. At the later stages of phylogenesis the cells, under becoming of motion function, worked out more efficient alternative of ATP synthesis from exogenous ῲ-9  monosaturated fatty . At the late stages of phylogenesis, under becoming of biological function of locomotion (motion at the expense of contraction of cross-striated skeletal myocytes) insulin began to activate absorption of glucose by cells with subsequent synthesis of endogenous ῲ-9  mono-saturated fatty  out of it. The aphysiological effect of environment factors in the form of derangement of biological function of trophology (feeding), surplus of palmitic unesterified fatty acids in food serve as a main cause of such a high rate of functional derangement - insulin resistance syndrome in populations.

The results showed that peony seed oil showed weak anti-α-amylase activity; however, strong anti-α-glucosidase activity was noted. The GC-MS analysis of the oil showed 9 constituents of which α-linolenic  was found to be the major component (38.66%), followed by linoleic  (26.34%) and  (23.65%). The anti-diabetic potential of peony seed oil was tested in STZ induced diabetic mice. Administration of peony seed oil and glibenclamide reduced the blood glucose level and the area under curve (AUC) in STZ induced diabetic mice. There were significant increases in body weight, liver glycogen content, serum insulin level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreases in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total serum cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) in test groups as compared to the untreated diabetic groups. In vivo antioxidant studies on STZ induced diabetic mice revealed the reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increase of glutathione peroxides (GSH-px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH).

The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on polarisation and inflammatory potential in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from niacin (NA)-treated Lep(ob/ob)LDLR(-/-) mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and serum triglycerides, and their BMDMs accumulated triglycerides over the animals fed with HFLCD-MUFAs or -PUFAs. Furthermore, BMDMs from animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs were polarised towards the M1 phenotype with functional competence to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas BMDMs from animals fed with HFLCD-MUFAs or -PUFAs were skewed to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. These findings open opportunities for developing novel nutritional strategies with olive oil as the most important dietary source of MUFAs (notably ) to prevent development and progression of metabolic complications in the NA-treated MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26702071>Renal iron overload in rats with diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains incurable and is the main cause of end-stage renal disease. We approached the pathophysiology of DN with systems biology, and a comprehensive profile of renal transcripts was obtained with RNA-Seq in ZS (F1 hybrids of Zucker and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure) rats, a model of diabetic nephropathy. We included sham-operated lean control rats (LS), sham-operated diabetic (DS), and diabetic rats with induced renal ischemia (DI). Diabetic nephropathy in DI was accelerated by the single episode of renal ischemia. This progressive renal decline was associated with renal iron accumulation, although serum and urinary iron levels were far lower in DI than in LS. Furthermore, obese/diabetic ZS rats have severe dyslipidemia, a condition that has been linked to hepatic iron overload. Hence, we tested and found that the fatty acids  and palmitate stimulated iron accumulation in renal tubular cells in vitro. Renal mRNAs encoding several key proteins that promote iron accumulation were increased in DI. Moreover, renal mRNAs encoding the antioxidant proteins superoxide dismutase, catalase, and most of the glutathione synthetic system were suppressed, which would magnify the prooxidant effects of renal iron loads. Substantial renal iron loads occur in obese/diabetic rats. We propose that in , specific renal gene activation is partly responsible for iron accumulation. This state might be further aggravated by lipid-stimulated iron uptake. We suggest that progressive renal iron overload may further advance renal injury in obese/diabetic ZS rats.© 2015 The Authors.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient  variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient palmitic variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance ,  and obesity.

Ultimately, obesity combined with insulin resistance increases the dysfunctional demand of β-cells and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) is a potent transcriptional regulator of pancreatic β-cell function and tolerance to lipid stress. The present study examined the effects of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)-metabolized precursors and products, notably , on the compensatory capacity of β-cells and their relationship with regulation of the FoxO1 and Wnt pathways. The trioleate-induced compromise of insulin sensitivity blunted the compensatory response of pancreatic β-cells in primary rat islets. These events were associated with increases in the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of FoxO1. Such effects were also observed in INS-1E cells that were subjected to oleate treatment. The overexpression of human SCD1 that was accompanied by endogenously generated  also led to an increase in the nuclear abundance of FoxO1. The mechanism of the oleate-mediated subcellular localization of FoxO1 was independent of the fatty  receptor GPR40. Instead, the mechanism involved diversion of the active β-catenin pool from an interaction with transcription factor 7-like 2 toward FoxO1-mediated transcription in β-cells. Our findings identify a unique role for  in the compensatory response of pancreatic β-cells and emphasize the importance of FoxO1 in β-cell failure in obesity-induced insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The testicular feminised mouse (non-functional androgen receptor and low testosterone) develops fatty liver and aortic lipid streaks on a high-fat diet, whereas androgen-replete XY littermate controls do not. Testosterone treatment ameliorates these effects, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We compared the influence of testosterone on the expression of regulatory targets of glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism in muscle, liver, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Testicular feminised mice displayed significantly reduced GLUT4 in muscle and glycolytic enzymes in muscle, liver and abdominal subcutaneous but not visceral adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase required for fatty  uptake was only reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue; enzymes of fatty  synthesis were increased in liver and subcutaneous tissue. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 that catalyses  synthesis and is associated with insulin resistance was increased in visceral adipose tissue and cholesterol efflux components (ABCA1, apoE) were decreased in subcutaneous and liver tissue. Master regulator nuclear receptors involved in metabolism-Liver X receptor expression was suppressed in all tissues except visceral adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ was lower in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue and PPARα only in abdominal subcutaneous. Testosterone treatment improved the expression (androgen receptor independent) of some targets but not all. These exploratory data suggest that androgen deficiency may reduce the buffering capability for glucose uptake and utilisation in abdominal subcutaneous and muscle and fatty acids in abdominal subcutaneous.

To determine whether any shifts in fuel use were due solely to increases in energy expenditure, we also studied a condition consisting of a single isoenergetic 45-min bout of moderate-intensity exercise (ONE). Twenty sedentary overweight or obese adults (10 men/10 women; 32.4 ± 6.3 yr; BMI, 30.6 ± 2.9 kg/m) completed all three conditions (MICRO, SED, and ONE) in a randomized order. Each condition consisted of a 3-day free-living run-in followed by a 24-h stay in a whole-room calorimeter to measure total energy expenditure (TEE) and substrate utilization. Dietary fat oxidation was also assessed during the chamber stay by administering a [1-C]  tracer at breakfast. Energy intake was matched across conditions. Both MICRO and ONE increased TEE relative to SED, resulting in a negative energy balance. HOMA-IR improved in both activity conditions. MICRO increased 24-h carbohydrate oxidation compared with both ONE and SED ( P < 0.01 for both). ONE was associated with higher 24-h total fat oxidation compared with SED, and higher 24-h dietary fat oxidation compared with both SED and MICRO. Differences in substrate oxidation remained significant after adjusting for energy balance. In overweight and obese men and women, breaking up sitting time increased reliance upon carbohydrate as fuel over 24 h, while a single energy-matched continuous bout of exercise preferentially relies upon fat over 24 h. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Insulin sensitivity, as assessed by HOMA-IR, was improved after 4 days of physical activity, independent of frequency and duration of activity bouts. Temporal patterns of activity across the day differentially affect substrate oxidation. Frequent interruptions of sedentary time with short bouts of walking primarily increase 24-h carbohydrate oxidation, whereas an energy-matched single continuous bout of moderate intensity walking primarily increased 24-h fat oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27749006>An extra virgin olive oil rich diet intervention ameliorates the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis induced by a high-fat "Western-type" diet in mice.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the protective effect of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in high-fat diets (HFDs) on the inflammatory response and liver damage in a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mouse model.C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard diet or a lard-based HFD (HFD-L) for 12 wk to develop NAFLD. HFD-fed mice were then divided into four groups and fed for 24 wk with the following: HFD-L, HFD-EVOO, HFD based on phenolics-rich EVOO, and reversion (standard diet). HFD-L-induced metabolic disorders were alleviated by replacement of lard with EVOO. EVOO diets improved plasma lipid profile and reduced body weight, plasma and epididymal fat INF-γ, IL-6 and leptin levels, and macrophage infiltration. Moreover, NAFLD activity scores were reduced. The liver lipid composition showed an increase in MUFAs, especially , and a decrease in saturated fatty acids. Hepatic adiponutrin and Cd36 gene expression was upregulated in the EVOO groups. Liver ingenuity pathway analysis revealed in EVOO groups regulation of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, gastrointestinal disease, and liver regeneration.Dietary EVOO could repair HFD-induced hepatic damage, possibly via an anti-inflammatory effect in adipose tissue and modifications in the liver lipid composition and signaling pathways.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Obese women exhibit elevated levels of the two most common dietary fatty acids, palmitate and oleate, and the maternal blood containing these nutrients bathes the surface of trophoblasts of placental villi in vivo We test the hypothesis that the composition and concentration of free fatty acids modulate viability and function of primary human villous trophoblasts in culture. We found that palmitate increases syncytiotrophoblast death, specifically by caspase-mediated apoptosis, whereas oleate does not cause enhanced cell death. Importantly, exposure to both fatty acids in equimolar amounts yielded no increase in death or apoptosis, suggesting that oleate can protect syncytiotrophoblasts from palmitate-induced death. We further found that palmitate, but not oleate or oleate with palmitate, increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, signaling through the unfolded protein response, and yielding CHOP-mediated induction of apoptosis. Finally, we show that oleate or oleate plus palmitate both lead to increased lipid droplets in syncytiotrophoblasts, whereas palmitate does not. The data show palmitate is toxic to human syncytiotrophoblasts, through the induction of ER stress and apoptosis mediated by CHOP, whereas oleate is not toxic, abrogates palmitate toxicity and induces fat accumulation. We speculate that our in vitro results offer pathways by which the metabolic milieu of the obese pregnant woman can yield villous trophoblast dysfunction and sub-optimal placental function.© 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28857071> in the Ventral Tegmental Area Inhibits Feeding, Food Reward, and Dopamine Tone.</a></h2><p>Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) act centrally to decrease food intake and hepatic glucose production and alter hypothalamic neuronal activity in a manner that depends on FA type and cellular transport proteins. However, it is not known whether FAs are sensed by ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons to control food-motivated behavior and DA neurotransmission. We investigated the impact of the monounsaturated FA oleate in the VTA on feeding, locomotion, food reward, and DA neuronal activity and DA neuron expression of FA-handling proteins and FA uptake. A single intra-VTA injection of oleate, but not of the saturated FA palmitate, decreased food intake and increased locomotor activity. Furthermore, intra-VTA oleate blunted the rewarding effects of high-fat/sugar food in an operant task and inhibited DA neuronal firing. Using sorted DA neuron preparations from TH-eGFP mice we found that DA neurons express FA transporter and binding proteins, and are capable of intracellular transport of long-chain FA. Finally, we demonstrate that a transporter blocker attenuates FA uptake into DA neurons and blocks the effects of intra-VTA oleate to decrease food-seeking and DA neuronal activity. Together, these results suggest that DA neurons detect FA and that oleate has actions in the VTA to suppress DA neuronal activity and food seeking following cellular incorporation. These findings highlight the capacity of DA neurons to act as metabolic sensors by responding not only to hormones but also to FA nutrient signals to modulate food-directed behavior.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27073470>Low simvastatin concentrations reduce -induced steatosis in HepG cells: An  model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an inflammatory condition caused by hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with insulin resistance,  and metabolic syndrome. Although statins should be used with caution in liver diseases, they are increasingly investigated as a possible treatment for NAFLD. The present study recreated an  model of NAFLD using HepG cells exposed to  (OA), which was used to quantify OA-induced lipid accumulation in HepG cells treated with various concentrations of simvastatin. In addition, the effect of simvastatin on HepG cell morphology and microparticle generation as a marker of cell apoptosis was assessed. OA-induced lipid accumulation was quantified by Oil Red O staining and extraction for optical density determination. Stained lipid droplets were visualized using phase contrast microscopy. Furthermore, HepG cell-derived microparticles were counted by flow cytometry subsequent to staining for Annexin V. HepG cells treated with 0-1 mM OA showed dose-dependent lipid accumulation. Treatment of HepG cells with increasing concentrations of simvastatin followed by treatment with 1 mM OA showed that low simvastatin concentrations (4-10 µM) were able to reduce lipid accumulation by ~40%, whereas high simvastatin concentrations (20 and 30 µM) induced apoptotic changes in cell morphology and increased the production of Annexin V microparticles. This suggests that low simvastatin doses may have a role in preventing NAFLD. However, further investigations are required to confirm this action  and to determine the underlying mechanism by which simvastatin reduces hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993434>Fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous biomarker of oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in excess of normal physiological level results in oxidative stress. This can lead to a range of pathological conditions including inflammation, , cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Biomarkers of oxidative stress play an important role in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases. A number of fluorescent biomarkers exist. However, a non-invasive and label-free identification technique would be advantageous for in vivo measurements. In this work we establish a spectroscopic method to identify oxidative stress in cells and tissues by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). We identified an autofluorescent, endogenous species with a characteristic fluorescent lifetime distribution as a probe for oxidative stress. To corroborate our hypothesis that these species are products of lipid oxidation by ROS, we correlate the spectroscopic signals arising from lipid droplets by combining FLIM with THG and CARS microscopy which are established techniques for selective lipid body imaging. Further, we performed spontaneous Raman spectral analysis at single points of the sample which provided molecular vibration information characteristics of lipid droplets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27320682>The histone deacetylase inhibiting drug Entinostat induces lipid accumulation in differentiated HepaRG cells.</a></h2><p>Dietary overload of toxic, free metabolic intermediates leads to disrupted insulin signalling and fatty liver disease. However, it was recently reported that this pathway might not be universal: depletion of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enhances insulin sensitivity alongside hepatic lipid accumulation in mice, but the mechanistic role of microscopic lipid structure in this effect remains unclear. Here we study the effect of Entinostat, a synthetic HDAC inhibitor undergoing clinical trials, on hepatic lipid metabolism in the paradigmatic HepaRG liver cell line. Specifically, we statistically quantify lipid droplet morphology at single cell level utilizing label-free microscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, supported by gene expression. We observe Entinostat efficiently rerouting carbohydrates and free-fatty acids into lipid droplets, upregulating lipid coat protein gene Plin4, and relocating droplets nearer to the nucleus. Our results demonstrate the power of Entinostat to promote lipid synthesis and storage, allowing reduced systemic sugar levels and sequestration of toxic metabolites within protected protein-coated droplets, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases such as  and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27274760>Association of low  intake with diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to describe the intake of macronutrient, especially fatty acids, and explore their possible effect on diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 .In this case-control study, we included a total of 146 patients with DR and 148 without DR. The intake of macronutrient was evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used logistic regression adjusted for sex, age,  duration, energy intake, educational level, physical activity, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and  treatment, to estimate odds ratio (ORs) of DR.Patients with DR had significantly lower intake of fibre, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and palmitic and . Inverse associations were observed between MUFA and  intake in DR. Subjects with intermediate and high MUFA intake were less likely to have DR than those with lower MUFA intake, with ORs of 0.46 (95 % CI: 0.22-0.93) and 0.42 (95 % CI: 0.18-0.97), respectively. Similarly, intermediate and high  intake were associated with reduced DR frequency compared with low  intake, with OR values of 0.48 (95 % CI: 0.23-0.97) and 0.37 (95 % CI: 0.16-0.85), respectively. These associations were stronger in patients with a longer  duration.In type 2 , MUFA and  intake were inversely associated with DR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993495>Saturated fatty  stimulates production of extracellular vesicles by renal tubular epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Lipotoxicity, an accumulation of intracellular lipid metabolites, has been proposed as an important pathogenic mechanism contributing to kidney dysfunction in the context of metabolic disease. Palmitic , a predominant lipid derivative, can cause lipoapoptosis and the release of inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) in hepatocytes, but the effect of lipids on EV production in chronic kidney disease remains vaguely explored. This study was aimed to investigate whether palmitic  would stimulate EV release from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Human and rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2 and NRK-52E, were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA-conjugated palmitic  (PA), and BSA-conjugated  (OA) for 24-48 h. The EVs released into conditioned media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA). According to NTA, the size distribution of EVs was 30-150 nm with similar mode sizes in all experimental groups. Moreover, BSA-induced EV release was significantly enhanced in the presence of PA, whereas EV release was not altered by the addition of OA. In NRK-52E cells, PA-enhanced EV release was associated with an induction of cell apoptosis reflected by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein by Western blot and Annexin V positive cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of lipid-induced EVs by recipient renal proximal tubular cells. Collectively, our results indicate that PA stimulates EV release from cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, extended characterization of lipid-induced EVs may constitute new signaling paradigms contributing to chronic kidney disease pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27296445>Enzyme coated beta-cyclodextrin for effective adsorption and glucose-responsive closed-loop insulin delivery.</a></h2><p>Inconsistent dosage of insulin (INS) for type 2  patients lead to severe adverse effects like limb amputation, blindness and fatal hypo or hyper glycaemia. Hence, a drug delivery system (DDS) capable of consistent INS release by sensing changes in blood glucose level is essential. Herein, we report a glucose responsive DDS comprised of -grafted-aminated beta cyclodextrin (OA-g-ACD) copolymer, coated with a dispersion of glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT). The prepared DDS was characterised using FTIR, Optical Microscopy, H(1) NMR, DLS and SEM. Hydrophobicity and drug loading capacity was ascertained using contact angle measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) respectively. Extent of swelling was observed to be a function of glucose concentration. INS release profile showed a cumulative release of 78.0 % after 240min. Flow cytometry studies revealed greater population of INS on HeLa cells indicating application of DDS as potential candidate for the intravenous administration of INS.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to regulating glucose metabolism, they also alter lipid metabolism. Due to the clear association between  and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)- and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA. This was associated with a lack of influence on the expression of FADS1 and FADS2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26044490>Antagonism Between Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids in ROS Mediated Lipotoxicity in Rat Insulin-Producing Cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are under suspicion to mediate β-cell dysfunction and β-cell loss in type 2 , a phenomenon known as lipotoxicity. Whereas saturated fatty acids show a strong cytotoxic effect upon insulin-producing cells, unsaturated fatty acids are not toxic and can even prevent toxicity. Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress mediates lipotoxicity and there is evidence that the subcellular site of ROS formation is the peroxisome. However, the interaction between unsaturated and saturated NEFAs in this process is unclear.Toxicity of rat insulin-producing cells after NEFA incubation was measured by MTT and caspase assays. NEFA induced H2O2 formation was quantified by organelle specific expression of the H2O2 specific fluorescence sensor protein HyPer.The saturated NEFA palmitic  had a significant toxic effect on the viability of rat insulin-producing cells. Unsaturated NEFAs with carbon chain lengths >14 showed, irrespective of the number of double bonds, a pronounced protection against palmitic  induced toxicity. Palmitic  induced H2O2 formation in the peroxisomes of insulin-producing cells.  incubation led to lipid droplet formation, but in contrast to palmitic  induced neither an ER stress response nor peroxisomal H2O2 generation. Furthermore,  prevented palmitic  induced H2O2 production in the peroxisomes.Thus unsaturated NEFAs prevent deleterious hydrogen peroxide generation during peroxisomal β-oxidation of long-chain saturated NEFAs in rat insulin-producing cells.© 2015 S.

Delile is used as a traditional anti-diabetic remedy in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and is mentioned in Ayurveda as well.The objective of the study was to evaluate the ethnomedicinal claim of A. nilotica leaf (ANL) extract for its efficiency in ameliorating diabetic complications.ANL was orally administrated (50 and 200mg/kg) to alloxanized mice (blood glucose > 200mg/dL) for 20d. Parameters of glucose metabolism, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia and nephrotoxicity were measured with emphasis on elevated oxidative stress. ANL was chemically characterized using GC-MS. Further, docking studies were employed to predict molecular interactions.ANL lowered (65%, P< 0.001) systemic glucose load in diabetic mice, which was otherwise 398% higher than control. ANL lowered (35%) insulin resistance, without any significant effect on insulin sensitivity (P> 0.05). Anti-hyperglycemic properties of ANL was further supported by lowering of HbA1c (34%; P< 0.001) and improved glucose utilization (OGTT). Overall diabetic complications were mitigated as reflected by lowered hepatic (ALT, AST) and renal (creatinine, BUN) injury markers and normalization of dyslipidemia. Elevated systemic oxidative stress was lowered by increased catalase and peroxidase activities in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, resulting in 32% decrease of serum MDA levels. Apart from high phenolic and flavonoid content, tocopherol, catechol and β-sitosterol, identified in ANL, demonstrated substantial binding affinity with Nrf2 protein (5FNQ) reflecting possible crosstalk with intracellular antioxidant defense pathways.The present study revealed the potentials of A. nilotica to alleviate -related systemic complications by limiting oxidative stress which justified the ethnopharmacological antidiabetic claim.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Study participants were categorized in diabetogenic groups: Group 1 (HbA1c ≥6.5% or FPG ≥126 mg/dL), Group 2 (HbA1c 5.7% to <6.5% or FPG 100 to <126 mg/dL), and Group 3 (HbA1c <5.7% and FPG <100 mg/dL). We assessed associations between diabetogenic groups and plasma FAs in multivariate multinomial regressions (with Group 3 as the reference).Overall, 7.0% of study participants were in Group 1; 33.3% were in Group 2. Plasma concentrations of several individual FAs, including even-chain saturated FAs (SFAs; myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs; cis-vaccenic,  acids), were respectively associated with greater odds of Groups 1 and 2 status, adjusting for covariates. Higher concentrations of SFA and MUFA subgroups (highest compared with lowest quartile) were associated with increased odds of Group 2 status [SFAs adjusted OR (aOR): 1.51 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.18); MUFAs aOR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.85)]. Higher eicosapentaenoic  plasma concentration was associated with decreased odds of Group 1 status [quartile 4 aOR: 0.41 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.95)].Higher plasma concentrations of SFAs and MUFAs, primary de novo lipogenesis products, were associated with elevated FPG and HbA1c in a nationally representative study population in the United States.

The metabolic interactions between tissues and the heart illustrate a critical cross-talk we know little about.To better understand the metabolic changes induced by exercise, we investigated skeletal muscle (plantaris, soleus), liver, serum, and heart from exercise trained (or sedentary control) animals in an established rat model of exercise-induced aerobic training via non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics.Exercise-induced alterations in metabolites varied across tissues, with the soleus and serum affected the least. The alterations in the plantaris muscle and liver were most alike, with two metabolites increased in each (citric /isocitric  and linoleic ). Exercise training additionally altered nine other metabolites in the plantaris (C13 hydrocarbon, inosine/adenosine, fructose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, 2-aminoadipic , heptadecanoic , stearic , alpha-tocopherol, and ). In the serum, we identified significantly decreased alpha-tocopherol levels, paralleling the increases identified in plantaris muscle. Eleven unique metabolites were increased in the heart, which were not affected in the other compartments (malic , serine, aspartic , myoinositol, glutamine, gluconic -6-phosphate, glutamic , pyrophosphate, campesterol, phosphoric , creatinine). These findings complement prior studies using targeted metabolomics approaches to determine the metabolic changes in exercise-trained human skeletal muscle. Specifically, exercise trained vastus lateralus biopsies had significantly increased linoleic , , and stearic  compared to the inactive groups, which were significantly increased in plantaris muscle in the present study.While increases in alpha-tocopherol have not been identified in muscle after exercise to our knowledge, the benefits of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) supplementation in attenuating exercise-induced muscle damage has been studied extensively. Skeletal muscle, liver, and the heart have primarily different metabolic changes, with few similar alterations and rare complementary alterations (alpha-tocopherol), which may illustrate the complexity of understanding exercise at the organismal level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290500>Palmitic and : The Yin and Yang of Fatty Acids in Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) link obesity with insulin resistance and type 2  (T2DM).

Acne vulgaris is primarily a disease of wealthy countries and exhibits higher prevalence rates in developed compared with developing countries. No acne has been found in non-Westernized populations still living under Paleolithic dietary conditions constraining hyperglycemic carbohydrates, milk, and dairy products. The high prevalence rates of adolescent acne cannot be explained by the predominance of genetic factors but by the influence of a Western diet that overstimulates the key conductor of metabolism, the nutrient- and growth factor-sensitive kinase mTORC1. Increased mTORC1 activity has been detected in lesional skin and sebaceous glands of acne patients compared with acne-free controls. Increased mTORC1 signaling is a characteristic feature of insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 , cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Both digestive and oxidative inflammatory conditions lead to the endogenous formation of nitrated derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) upon generation of the proximal nitrating species nitrogen dioxide (·NO) by nitric oxide (·NO) and nitrite-dependent reactions. Nitro-FAs (NO-FAs) such as nitro- (NO-OA) and nitro-linoleic  (NO-LA) potently inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress, regulate cellular functions, and maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. Recently, conjugated linoleic  (CLA) was identified as the preferential FA substrate of nitration in vivo. However, the functions of nitro-CLA (NO-CLA) in ECs remain to be explored. In the present study, a distinct transcriptome regulated by NO-CLA was revealed in primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) through RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analysis identified numerous regulatory networks including those related to the modulation of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell cycle, and hypoxic responses by NO-CLA, suggesting a diverse impact of NO-CLA and other electrophilic nitrated FAs on cellular processes. These findings extend the understanding of the protective actions of NO-CLA in cardiovascular diseases and provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms that mediate the pleiotropic cellular responses to NO-CLA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28456145>Autophagy plays beneficial effect on diabetic encephalopathy in type 2 : studies in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>The hypothalamus regulates metabolism and feeding behavior by perceiving the levels of peripheral insulin.

In vitro, PC12 cells were treated with  to mimic lipotoxicity.Results showed that the cholesterol level in the hypothalamus of the diabetic mice was higher than that of the normal mice. The expression of insulin receptors and insulin receptor substrate-1 were downregulated and the number of Fluoro-Jade C positive cells significantly increased in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of the diabetic mice. Furthermore, Upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and downregulation of LC 3II were obvious in the hypothalamus of the diabetic mice. In vitro, results showed that high-lipid caused PC12 cell damage and upregulated LC3 II expression. Pretreatment of cells with 3-methyladenine evidently downregulated LC3 II expression and aggravated PC12 cell death under high lipid conditions. By contrast, pretreatment of cells with rapamycin upregulated LC3 II expression and ameliorated PC12 cell death caused by lipotoxicity.These results demonstrate that autophagy activation confers protection to neurons under aberrant metabolism and that autophagy dysfunction in the hypothalamus occurs in the chronic metabolic disorder such as T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208342>α-Hydroxybutyric  Is a Selective Metabolite Biomarker of Impaired Glucose Tolerance.</a></h2><p>Plasma metabolites that distinguish isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT) from isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG) may be useful biomarkers to predict IGT, a high-risk state for the development of type 2 .Targeted metabolomics with 23 metabolites previously associated with dysglycemia was performed with fasting plasma samples from subjects without  at time 0 of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in two observational cohorts: RISC (Relationship Between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease) and DMVhi ( and Vascular Health Initiative).

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat , obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

We studied primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells cultured for 90h to determine the fatty  and lipid composition of cytotrophoblast (18h culture) and syncytiotrophoblast (90h culture) cells. In cultured PHT total lipid fatty acids were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced at 90h compared to 18h in culture including lower levels of palmitic  (PA, 16:0, -37%), palmitoleic  (POA, 16:1n-7, -30%),  (OA, 18:1n-9, -31%), LCPUFA arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6, -28%) and α-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3, -55%). In major lipid classes, OA and most of the n-3 and n-6 LCPUFA were markedly lower at 90h in TG (-57 to -76%; p < 0.05). In the cellular NEFA, n-6 LCPUFA, dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and AA were both reduced by -51% and DHA was -55% lower (p < 0.05) at 90h. In contrast, phospholipid FA content did not change between cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast except for OA, which decreased by -62% (p < 0.05). Decreasing PHT TG and NEFA lipid content at 90h in culture is likely due to processes related to differentiation such as alterations in lipase activity that occur as cytotrophoblast cells differentiate. We speculate that syncytiotrophoblast prioritizes PL containing AA and DHA for transfer to the fetus by mobilizing FA from storage lipids.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496314>Increased triacylglycerol - Fatty  substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells exposed to eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>It has previously been shown that pretreatment of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) promoted increased uptake of fatty acids and increased triacylglycerol accumulation, compared to pretreatment with  (OA) and palmitic  (PA). The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty  metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030149>Additive regulation of adiponectin expression by the mediterranean diet olive oil components  and hydroxytyrosol in human adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory hormone, is suppressed in obesity through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Olive oil consumption is associated with beneficial cardiometabolic actions, with possible contributions from the antioxidant phenol hydroxytyrosol (HT) and the monounsaturated fatty   (OA, 18:1n-9 cis), both possessing anti-inflammatory and vasculo-protective properties. We determined the effects of HT and OA, alone and in combination, on adiponectin expression in human and murine adipocytes under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α. We used human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes and murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes as cell model systems, and pretreated them with 1-100 μmol/L OA, 0.1-20 μmol/L HT or OA plus HT combination before stimulation with 10 ng/mL TNF-α. OA or HT significantly (P<0.05) prevented TNF-α-induced suppression of total adiponectin secretion (by 42% compared with TNF-α alone) as well as mRNA levels (by 30% compared with TNF-α alone). HT and OA also prevented-by 35%-TNF-α-induced downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ. Co-treatment with HT and OA restored adiponectin and PPARγ expression in an additive manner compared with single treatments. Exploring the activation of JNK, which is crucial for both adiponectin and PPARγ suppression by TNF-α, we found that HT and OA additively attenuated TNF-α-stimulated JNK phosphorylation (up to 55% inhibition). In conclusion, the virgin olive oil components OA and HT, at nutritionally relevant concentrations, have additive effects in preventing adiponectin downregulation in inflamed adipocytes through an attenuation of JNK-mediated PPARγ suppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[Insulin resistance is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h2><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) , the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type metabolism of FA. The IR  can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all  pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) , 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance , 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major  disorders in diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is a pathology associated primarily with FA and secondarily with glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206239>Type 1  alters lipid handling and metabolism in human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</a></h2><p>Triggers of the autoimmune response that leads to type 1  (T1D) remain poorly understood. A possibility is that parallel changes in both T cells and target cells provoke autoimmune attack. We previously documented greater Ca2+ transients in fibroblasts from T1D subjects than non-T1D after exposure to fatty acids (FA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These data indicate that metabolic and signal transduction defects present in T1D can be elicited ex vivo in isolated cells. Changes that precede T1D, including inflammation, may activate atypical responses in people that are genetically predisposed to T1D. To identify such cellular differences in T1D, we quantified a panel of metabolic responses in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) from age-matched T1D and non-T1D subjects, as models for non-immune and immune cells, respectively. Fibroblasts from T1D subjects accumulated more lipid, had higher LC-CoA levels and converted more FA to CO2, with less mitochondrial proton leak in response to oleate alone or with TNFα, using the latter as a model of inflammation. T1D-PBMCs contained and also accumulated more lipid following FA exposure. In addition, they formed more peroxidized lipid than controls following FA exposure. We conclude that both immune and non-immune cells in T1D subjects differ from controls in terms of responses to FA and TNFα. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity to inflammatory insults and FA that may precede and contribute to T1D by priming both immune cells and their targets for autoimmune reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490779>Swertiamarin ameliorates  induced lipid accumulation and oxidative stress by attenuating gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Swertiamarin, a bitter secoiridoid glycoside, is an antidiabetic drug with lipid lowering activity meliorates insulin resistance in Type 2  condition. Therefore, the study was designed to explore the antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity of swertiamarin in ameliorating NAFLD caused due to hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells by supplementing 1mM  (OA) for 24h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipid droplets. This was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining and triglyceride accumulation. Swertiamarin (25μg/ml) decreased triglyceride content by 2 folds and effectively reduced LDH release (50%) activity by protecting membrane integrity thus, preventing apoptosis evidenced by reduced cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1. We observed that swertiamarin significantly increased the expressions of major insulin signaling proteins like Insulin receptor (IR), PI(3)K, pAkt with concomitant reduction in p307 IRS-1. AMPK was activated by swertiamarin action, thus restoring insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes. In addition, qPCR results confirmed OA up-regulated Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)-1c and fatty  synthase (FAS), resulting in increased fatty  synthesis. Swertiamarin effectively modulated PPAR-α, a major potential regulator of carbohydrate metabolism which, in turn, decreased the levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK, further restricting hepatic glucose production and fatty  synthesis. Cumulatively, swertiamarin targets potential metabolic regulators AMPK and PPAR-α, through which it regulates hepatic glycemic burden, fat accumulation, insulin resistance and ROS in hepatic steatosis which emphasizes clinical significance of swertiamarin in regulating metabolism and as a suitable candidate for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

One fenugreek TG was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation and administrated to surviving diabetic rats. The free fatty acids percentage as well as, the peroxide, the saponification and the iodine values were 2%, 12 mequiv. O/kg of oil, 189 (mg KOH/g) and 110 (g/100 g of oil), respectively. Linolenic  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and  (C 17.07%) were the dominant fatty acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased insulin sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in liver and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected liver-kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29409806>Vitamin A deficiency induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in pancreatic islet cells: Implications of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1-mediated  synthesis.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that vitamin A deficiency resulted in the reduction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) levels, which corroborated with attenuation of high fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. Here, we aimed at assessing the effect of vitamin A deficiency on SCD1, MUFA levels and their impact on pancreas' structure and functions. Male weanling Wistar rats fed one of the four diets, namely control (Con), vitamin A-deficient (VAD), highfructose (HFr) and vitamin A-deficient diet with highfructose (VADHFr) for 16 weeks period. Compared to the control, feeding of VAD diet (alone or with HFr) resulted in pancreatic intra-islet vessel dilation and reduced plasma insulin, glucagon and C-peptide levels, however, glucose levels decreased only in VADHFr group. In line with plasma levels, VAD diet-fed animals displayed lower immunostaining for insulin and glucagon, which corroborated with increased apoptotic staining observed in the islet regions, possibly due to increased cellular stress, as indicated by high immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP). On the other hand, it significantly decreased the SCD1 protein, which corroborated with reduced MUFA levels, particularly,  (C18:1), when compared to the control and HFr groups. In conclusion, chronic vitamin A deficiency altered the structure and functions of pancreas by diminishing the islet cells, possibly by inducing cellular stress-mediated apoptosis and decreasing SCD1-mediated  (C18:1) synthesis. Thus, the data suggest that unlike liver, the reduction in SCD1 and MUFA levels in the pancreas exerts deleterious effects on its functions and perturb the overall cellular metabolism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

After an additional 8 (early intervention) or 20 (late intervention) weeks, the different groups of rats were fed diets with 1/2 of the kcal of fat derived from lard replaced by the different dietary oils. In addition, a control group fed a standard diet (4.25% kcal as fat) and a diabetic group maintained on the high-fat diet were maintained. The treatment period was approximately 16 weeks. The endpoints evaluated included vascular reactivity of epineurial arterioles, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, thermal and corneal sensitivity, and innervation of sensory nerves in the cornea and skin.Our findings show that menhaden and flaxseed oil provided the greatest benefit for correcting peripheral nerve damage caused by , whereas enriching the high-fat diet with menhaden oil provided the most benefit to acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation of epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve. Enriching the diets with fatty acids derived from the other oils provided none to partial improvements.These studies imply that long-chain n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be an effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from fish oil being the most effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28067838>Effect of Phenolic Compounds from Elderflowers on Glucose- and Fatty  Uptake in Human Myotubes and HepG2-Cells.</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2D) is manifested by progressive metabolic impairments in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and these tissues become less responsive to insulin, leading to hyperglycemia.

FFA act as endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of PPARδ, the most common PPAR subtype in skeletal muscle, plays a role in mediating the protective effect of unsaturated FFA on saturated FFA-induced damage in skeletal muscle cells and to examine an impact on mitochondrial respiration. Mouse C2C12 myotubes were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of saturated FFA (palmitic ), unsaturated FFA (, linoleic and α-linolenic ), and their combinations. PPARδ agonist GW501516 and antagonist GSK0660 were also used. Both mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, but not GW501516, prevented palmitic -induced cell death. Mono- and polyunsaturated FFA proved to be effective activators of PPARδ compared to saturated palmitic ; however, in combination with palmitic  their effect on PPARδ activation was blocked and stayed at the levels observed for palmitic  alone. Unsaturated FFA at moderate physiological concentrations as well as GW501516, but not palmitic , mildly uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Our results indicate that although unsaturated FFA are effective activators of PPARδ, their protective effect on palmitic -induced toxicity is not mediated by PPARδ activation and subsequent induction of lipid regulatory genes in skeletal muscle cells. Other mechanisms, such as mitochondrial uncoupling, may underlie their effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29894834>Fatty  and quaternary ammonium modified chitosan nanoparticles for insulin delivery.</a></h2><p>Liver is the major organ where insulin performs its physiological function.

However, the molecular mechanisms that support the protective role of oleate in cardiovascular cells are poorly known. For these reasons, we studied the protective role of oleate in the insulin resistance and in the atherosclerotic process at cellular level such as in cardiomyocytes (CMs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs).The effect of oleate in the cardiovascular insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs were analyzed by Western blot, qRT-PCR, BrdU incorporation and cell cycle analysis.Palmitate induced insulin resistance. However, oleate not only did not induce cardiovascular insulin resistance but also had a protective effect against insulin resistance induced by palmitate or TNFα. One mechanism involved might be the prevention by oleate of JNK-1/2 or NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α or palmitate. Oleate reduced MCP-1 and ICAM-1 and increased eNOS expression induced by proinflammatory cytokines in ECs. Furthermore, oleate impaired the proliferation induced by TNF-α, angiotensin II or palmitate and the apoptosis induced by TNF-α or thapsigargin in VSMCs.Our data suggest a differential role between oleate and palmitate and support the concept of the cardioprotector role of oleate as the main lipid component of virgin olive oil. Thus, oleate protects against cardiovascular insulin resistance, improves endothelial dysfunction in response to proinflammatory signals and finally, reduces proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs that may contribute to an ameliorated atherosclerotic process and plaque stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26640369>Influence of glucosamine on the bioactivity of insulin delivered subcutaneously and in an oral nanodelivery system.</a></h2><p>The aim of the work reported herein was to study the effect of glucosamine HCl (GlcN·HCl) on the bioactivity (BA) of insulin, administered via subcutaneous (SC) and oral routes, in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The oral insulin delivery system (insulin-chitosan reverse micelle [IC-RM]) was prepared by solubilizing insulin-chitosan (13 kDa) polyelectrolyte complex in a RM system consisting of , PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides, and polyglycerol-6-dioleate. The BA of insulin in vivo was evaluated by measuring blood glucose level using a blood glucose meter; the results revealed that the extent of hypoglycemic activity of SC insulin was GlcN·HCl dose dependent when they were administered simultaneously. A significant reduction in blood glucose levels (P<0.05) was found for the insulin:GlcN·HCl at mass ratios of 1:10 and 1:20, whereas lower ratios (eg, 1:1 and 1:4) showed no significant reduction. Furthermore, enhancement of the action of SC insulin was achieved by oral administration of GlcN·HCl for 5 consecutive days prior to insulin injection (P<0.05). For oral insulin administration via the IC-RM system, the presence of GlcN·HCl increased the hypoglycemic activity of insulin (P<0.05). The relative BA were 6.7% and 5.4% in the presence and absence of GlcN·HCl (ie, the increase in the relative BA was approximately 23% due to incorporating GlcN·HCl in the IC-RM system), respectively.

However, the dietary concentration of FFAs is generally very low and fat is mainly consumed as triacylglycerol (TAG). The aim of this study was to examine the perception of different fatty stimuli and possible associations between them. Therefore, detection thresholds for 4 fatty stimuli ( [FFA], paraffin oil [mixture of hydrocarbon molecules], canola oil [TAG-rich], and canola oil spiked with  [rich in TAGs and FFAs]) were determined in 30 healthy participants. Additionally, inter-individual differences in fat perception were examined. It was observed that  was perceivable at significantly lower concentrations than all other stimuli (P < 0.001). Similarly, canola oil with  was detectable at lower concentrations than canola oil alone (P < 0.001). Moreover, canola oil detection thresholds were significantly lower than paraffin oil detection thresholds (P = 0.017). Participants who were sensitive for low concentrations for  showed lower detection thresholds for canola oil with and without , compared with participants that were less sensitive for . The results of this study demonstrate that the higher the concentrations of FFAs in the stimuli, the lower the individual fat detection threshold. Moreover, participants being sensitive for lower concentrations of FFAs are also more likely to detect low concentrations of TAG-rich fats as it is found in the human diet.© The Author 2017.

Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated with obesity and type 2  (T2DM). As knowledge about FcγRIIb in the literature is mostly generated from studies on skeletal muscle tissue, the expression and function of FcγRIIb in the liver and hepatocytes are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to  (OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of , , , , and  in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower liver weight and liver to body weight ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers.

Because of this, there is a high interest in healthy natural products that could prevent the appearance of such diseases. This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl acetate and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty  (USFA) (palmitoleic, linolenic, linoleic, , araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty  content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty  ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI). The lower (best) index values are for ethanol extract, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.74 (AI) and 1.05 (TI), followed of ethyl acetate, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.87 (AI) and 1.24 (TI). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of PLE alga extracts in terms of total phenol content (TPC) was analyzed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method.

Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational  (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, , linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, , and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response. Modifying the composition of FFAs may help in reducing the risk of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158448>Type 1 Diabetic Subjects with Diabetic Retinopathy Show an Unfavorable Pattern of Fat Intake.</a></h2><p>Medical nutrition therapy is an important part of the management of type 1  (T1DM). Proper adherence to a healthy diet may have a favorable impact on  management and its diabetic complications. Our aim was to assess differences in food and nutrient intake of type 1 diabetic patients with and without diabetic retinopathy (DR). This was a two-center, cross-sectional study in patients with T1DM, with and without DR. Subjects were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the two participating centers. A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered. A total of 103 T1DM patients with DR and 140 T1DM patient without DR were recruited. Subjects with DR showed a lower intake of total fat ( = 0.036) than that of their non-DR counterparts. DR was associated with increasing age ( = 0.004), hypertension ( < 0.001), and  duration ( < 0.001), however there was a negative association with high educational level ( = 0.018). The multivariate-adjusted analysis showed that the intake of complex carbohydrates was positively related to the presence of DR ( = 0.031). In contrast, the intakes of total fat ( = 0.009), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) ( = 0.012),  ( = 0.012), and vitamin E ( = 0.006) were associated with the absence of DR. As conclusions, the intake of total MUFAs, , and vitamin E is associated with a lower frequency of DR in patients with T1DM. These results suggest a potential protective effect of these lipid components for DR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593651>Distinct Shift in Beta-Cell Glutaredoxin 5 Expression Is Mediated by Hypoxia and Lipotoxicity Both  and .</a></h2><p>Histomorphological and functional alterations in pancreatic islet composition directly correlate with hyperglycemia severity. Progressive deterioration of metabolic control in subjects suffering from type 2  is predominantly caused by impaired beta-cell functionality. The glutaredoxin system is supposed to wield protective properties for beta-cells. Therefore, we sought to identify a correlation between the structural changes observed in diabetic pancreatic islets with altered glutaredoxin 5 expression, in order to determine an underlying mechanism of beta-cell impairment. Islets of db/db mice presenting with uncontrolled  were assessed in terms of morphological structure and insulin, glucagon, and glutaredoxin 5 expression. MIN6 cell function and glutaredoxin 5 expression were analyzed after exposure to  and hypoxia. Islets of diabese mice were marked by typical remodeling and distinct reduction of, and shifts, in localization of glutaredoxin 5-positive cells. These islets featured decreased glutaredoxin 5 as well as insulin and glucagon content. In beta-cell culture, glutaredoxin 5 protein and mRNA expression were decreased by hypoxia and  but not by leptin treatment. Our study demonstrates that glutaredoxin 5 expression patterns are distinctively altered in islets of rodents presenting with uncontrolled diabesity. , reduction of islet-cell glutaredoxin 5 expression was mediated by hypoxia and . Thus, glutaredoxin 5-deficiency in islets during  may be caused by lipotoxicity and hypoxia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28404638>Kidney triglyceride accumulation in the fasted mouse is dependent upon serum free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Lipid accumulation is a pathological feature of every type of kidney injury. Despite this striking histological feature, physiological accumulation of lipids in the kidney is poorly understood. We studied whether the accumulation of lipids in the fasted kidney are derived from lipoproteins or NEFAs. With overnight fasting, kidneys accumulated triglyceride, but had reduced levels of ceramide and glycosphingolipid species. Fasting led to a nearly 5-fold increase in kidney uptake of plasma [C]. Increasing circulating NEFAs using a β adrenergic receptor agonist caused a 15-fold greater accumulation of lipid in the kidney, while mice with reduced NEFAs due to adipose tissue deficiency of adipose triglyceride lipase had reduced triglycerides. Cluster of differentiation () mRNA increased 2-fold, and angiopoietin-like 4 (), an LPL inhibitor, increased 10-fold. Fasting-induced kidney lipid accumulation was not affected by inhibition of LPL with poloxamer 407 or by use of mice with induced genetic LPL deletion. Despite the increase in CD36 expression with fasting, genetic loss of CD36 did not alter fatty  uptake or triglyceride accumulation. Our data demonstrate that fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation in the kidney correlates with the plasma concentrations of NEFAs, but is not due to uptake of lipoprotein lipids and does not involve the fatty  transporter, CD36.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917246>[Laurine fatty acids, medium fatty acids and triglycerides, hyperlipidemia, resistance to insulin, prevention of atherosclerosis and ateromatosis.]</a></h2><p>Although the biochemistry of the positive effects of medium-chain fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TG) of the same name in vivo is not fully understood, food enriched with medium-chain LC and the same TG is effective in patients with type I diabetes, insulin resistance  and in neurodegenerative pathology. Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the  transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of palmitic , an increase in , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967167>Ablation of PM20D1 reveals -acyl amino  control of metabolism and nociception.</a></h2><p>-acyl amino acids (NAAs) are a structurally diverse class of bioactive signaling lipids whose endogenous functions have largely remained uncharacterized. To clarify the physiologic roles of NAAs, we generated mice deficient in the circulating enzyme peptidase M20 domain-containing 1 (PM20D1). Global PM20D1-KO mice have dramatically reduced NAA hydrolase/synthase activities in tissues and blood with concomitant bidirectional dysregulation of endogenous NAAs. Compared with control animals, PM20D1-KO mice exhibit a variety of metabolic and pain phenotypes, including insulin resistance, altered body temperature in cold, and antinociceptive behaviors. Guided by these phenotypes, we identify -oleoyl-glutamine (C18:1-Gln) as a key PM20D1-regulated NAA. In addition to its mitochondrial uncoupling bioactivity, C18:1-Gln also antagonizes certain members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channels including TRPV1. Direct administration of C18:1-Gln to mice is sufficient to recapitulate a subset of phenotypes observed in PM20D1-KO animals. These data demonstrate that PM20D1 is a dominant enzymatic regulator of NAA levels in vivo and elucidate physiologic functions for NAA signaling in metabolism and nociception.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

This is of some concern because of the importance of DHA for fetal neuro-visual development. We have investigated whether this abnormality could be rectified by supplementation with DHA-enriched formula.Women with GDM (n = 138) recruited from Newham University Hospital, London received two capsules of DHA-enriched formula (active-group) or high  sunflower seed oil (placebo-group) from diagnosis until delivery. Maternal (baseline and delivery) and fetal (cord blood) red blood cell and plasma phospholipid fatty  composition, and neonatal anthropometry were assessed.One hundred and fourteen women (58 active, 56 placebo) completed the trial. The active-group compared with the placebo-group had significantly enhanced level of DHA in plasma phosphatidylcholine (4.5% vs 3.8%, P = 0.011), red blood cell phosphatidylcholine (2.7% vs 2.2%, P = 0.022) and phosphatidylethoanolamine (9.5% vs 7.6%, P = 0.002). There was no difference in cord plasma and red blood cell phospholipid DHA between the two groups. The neonates of the two groups of women had comparable anthropometric measurements at birth.Daily supplementation of 600 mg DHA enhances maternal but not fetal DHA status in pregnancy complicated by GDM. The inefficacy of the supplement to improve fetal status suggests that the transfer of DHA across the placenta maybe impaired in women with the condition. Regardless of the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of the transfer, the finding has implications for the management of neonates of women with GDM because they are born with a reduced level of DHA and the condition is thought to be associated with a risk of neuro-developmental deficits. We suggest that babies of women with GDM, particularly those not suckling, similar to the babies born prematurely require formula milk fortified with a higher level of DHA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

This study aims to optimize the component proportion of the six-herb preparation and explore the serum metabolic signatures of type II  rats after treatment with Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet and its optimal combination. The component proportion of the preparation was optimized using uniform experimental design and machine learning techniques. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomic experiments were carried out with serum samples from model group and treatment groups. Data were normalized, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis performed and metabolites of interest putatively identified. 23 metabolites were significantly changed by Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet treatment and the majority of these were decreased, including various carbohydrates (glucose, mannose, fructose, allose and gluconic ), unsaturated fatty acids (palmitic , 9-octadecenoic , , arachidonic ), alanine, valine, propanoic , 3-hydroxybutyrate, along with pyrimidine and cholesterol. Increased concentrations of oxalic , leucine, glycine, serine, threonine, proline, lysine and citrate were observed. In the optimal combination-fed group, 21 metabolites were significantly affected and strikingly, the magnitudes of changes here were generally much greater than that of Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet treated rats. 18 metabolites affected in both groups included various carbohydrates (mannose, glucose, allose, fructose and gluconic ), unsaturated fatty acids (palmitic , 9-octadecenoic ,  and arachidonic ), short-chain fatty acids (oxalic , 3-hydroxybutyrate), and amino acids (alanine, valine, leucine, glycine, proline and lysine), as well as pyrimidine. Metabolites exclusively affected in optimal combination treated rat included succinic , cysteine and phenylalanine, whilst four metabolites (propanoic , citrate, serine and threonine) were only altered in Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet treated rat. Our investigation demonstrated Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet and its optimal combination treatments were able to ameliorate impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, down- regulate the high level of glucose to a lower level and reverse abnormal levels of metabolites in serum of type II  rats. However, the optimal combination treatment was able to maximize the magnitudes of changes in some metabolites.

GPR119 was identified on pancreatic β cells and its ligands have the ability to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was shown to potentiate GSIS and our present studies indicate that 2-methoxy-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-OMe-LPC) analogues, unable to undergo 1→2 acyl migration, stimulate GSIS from murine βTC-3 pancreatic cells even more efficiently. Moreover, biological assays in engineered Tango™ GPR119-bla U2OS cells were carried out to ascertain the agonist activity of 2-OMe-LPC at GPR119. 2-OMe-LPC possessing in sn-1 position the residues of myristic, palmitic, stearic and  were also evaluated as factors regulating [Ca] mobilization and cAMP levels. Extension of these studies to R- and S-enantiomers of 14:0 2-OMe-LPC revealed that the overall impact on GSIS does not depend on chirality, however, the intracellular calcium mobilization data show that the R enantiomer is significantly more active than S one.

PAD was diagnosed by ankle brachial index assessment. Plasma concentrations of vitamins were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Vitamin D levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Analysis of covariance, principal components analysis (PCA) and adjusted logistic regression were applied, accounting for the survey design and sample weights.Of the 4864 eligible participants, 2482 (51.0%) were men and 269 (5.5%) had prevalent PAD. PCA uncovered three DPs which accounted for 56.8% of the variance in dietary nutrients consumption including DP1 (fatty acids and cholesterol), DP2 (minerals, vitamins and fiber), and DP3 (polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]). PAD patients had a significantly higher serum concentrations of trans 9-octadecenoic  and trans 9, trans 12-octadienoic  as well as lower plasma levels of vitamin D, retinol, retinyl stearate and retinyl palmitate (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).

Biomarkers may objectively estimate the consumption of specific dietary items or help assess compliance in dietary intervention studies. Our aim was to use a panel of plasma and urine biomarkers to assess the validity of self-reported dietary intake using a modified Mediterranean Diet Scale (mMDS) among firefighters participating in Feeding America's Bravest (FAB), an MD cluster-randomized controlled trial. In our nested biomarker pilot study, participants were randomly selected from both the MD intervention group ( = 24) and the control group ( = 24) after 12-months of dietary intervention. At baseline data collection for the pilot study (t = 12-months of FAB), participants in the control group crossed-over to receive the MD intervention (active intervention) for 6-months. Participants in the intervention group continued in a self-sustained continuation phase (SSP) of the intervention. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), 13-item-mMDS questionnaires, 40 plasma fatty acids, inflammatory biomarkers and urinary hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol were analyzed at both time points. Spearman's correlation, -tests and linear regression coefficients were calculated using SAS software. Overall, the mMDS derived from the FFQ was highly correlated with the specific 13-domain-mMDS (r = 0.74). The concordance between the two questionnaires for low and high adherence to MD was high for all the participants in the parent trial (κ = 0.76). After 6 months of intervention in the pilot study, plasma saturated fatty  decreased in both groups (active intervention: -1.3 ± 1.7;  = 0.002; SSP: -1.12 ± 1.90;  = 0.014) and  improved in the SSP ( = 0.013). Intake of olive oil was positively associated with plasma omega-3 ( = 0.004) and negatively with TNF-α ( < 0.001) at baseline. Choosing olive oil as a type of fat was also associated with higher levels of plasma omega-3 ( = 0.019) at baseline and lower TNF-α ( = 0.023) at follow up. Intake of red and processed meats were associated with lower serum omega-3 ( = 0.04) and fish consumption was associated with lower IL-6 at baseline ( = 0.022). The overall mMDS was associated with an increase in plasma omega-3 ( = 0.021). Good correlation was found between nutrient intake from the FFQ and the corresponding plasma biomarkers (omega-3, EPA and DHA).

We here first find that upper small intestinal infusion of Intralipid, , or linoleic  pre-absorptively increases glucose tolerance and lowers glucose production in rodents. High-fat feeding impairs pre-absorptive fatty  sensing and reduces upper small intestinal Lactobacillus gasseri levels and ACSL3 expression. Transplantation of healthy upper small intestinal microbiota to high-fat-fed rodents restores L. gasseri levels and fatty  sensing via increased ACSL3 expression, while L. gasseri probiotic administration to non-transplanted high-fat-fed rodents is sufficient to restore upper small intestinal ACSL3 expression and fatty  sensing. In summary, we unveil a glucoregulatory role of upper small intestinal L. gasseri that impacts an ACSL3-dependent glucoregulatory fatty -sensing pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously shown that the combination of adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM) and  (OA) increases proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in a synergistic way. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a component within CM that is responsible for most of the observed effects. In this study, we investigate novel mechanisms that underlie the combined effects of adipokine and -induced proliferation of VSMC.  leads to significant lipid accumulation in VSMC that is further enhanced by the combined treatment with CM. Accordingly CM stimulates CD36 expression in VSMC while OA is not affecting CD36. Silencing of CD36 was established and prevents lipid accumulation in all tested conditions. CD36 silencing also abrogates CM- and OA-induced proliferation and considerably reduces proliferation induced by the combination of CM and OA. At the same time, VEGF secretion and VEGF-receptor 1 (VEGF-R1) by VSMC was not affected by CD36 silencing. However, VEGF was not able to induce any proliferation in VSMC after CD36 silencing that also blunted VEGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Finally, combined silencing of CD36 together with a blocking antibody against VEGF prevented most of CMOA-induced proliferation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CD36 is mediating CM-induced proliferation of VSMC. Induction of CD36 by adipokines enhances the response of VSMC towards VEGF and OA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552674>Measurement of Long-Chain Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity.</a></h2><p>Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS) are a family of essential enzymes of lipid metabolism, activating fatty acids by thioesterification with coenzyme A. Fatty acyl-CoA molecules are then readily utilized for the biosynthesis of storage and membrane lipids, or for the generation of energy by ß-oxidation. Acyl-CoAs also function as transcriptional activators, allosteric inhibitors, or precursors for inflammatory mediators. Recent work suggests that ACS enzymes may drive cellular fatty  uptake by metabolic trapping, and may also regulate the channeling of fatty acids towards specific metabolic pathways. The implication of ACS enzymes in widespread lipid associated diseases like type 2  has rekindled interest in this protein family. Here, we describe in detail how to measure long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activity by a straightforward radiometric assay. Cell lysates are incubated with ATP, coenzyme A, Mg(2+), and radiolabeled fatty  bound to BSA. Differential phase partitioning of fatty acids and acyl-CoAs is exploited to quantify the amount of generated acyl-CoA by scintillation counting.

We combined untargeted plasma metabolomics by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in three non-diabetic cohorts with Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to obtain new insights into early metabolic alterations in IR and impaired insulin secretion. In up to 910 elderly men we found associations of 52 metabolites with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp-measured IR and/or β-cell responsiveness (disposition index) during an oral glucose tolerance test. These implicated bile , glycerophospholipid and caffeine metabolism for IR and fatty  biosynthesis for impaired insulin secretion. In MR analysis in two separate cohorts (n = 2,613) followed by replication in three independent studies profiled on different metabolomics platforms (n = 7,824 / 8,961 / 8,330), we discovered and replicated causal effects of IR on lower levels of palmitoleic  and . A trend for a causal effect of IR on higher levels of tyrosine reached significance only in meta-analysis. In one of the largest studies combining "gold standard" measures for insulin responsiveness with non-targeted metabolomics, we found distinct metabolic profiles related to IR or impaired insulin secretion.

Dietary fatty acids also include transform of unsaturated fatty acids and intake of transform of oleate (elaidate) is associated with cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about the roles of elaidate in insulin responsiveness. We show here that elaidate impairs insulin-dependent glucose uptake in adipocytes. Differentiation with 10 μM elaidate, which is close to physiological plasma concentration, reduces insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Furthermore, insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation is disturbed in adipocytes differentiated with elaidate. In addition, analysis of lipolysis and gene expression shows that deteriorative effects of elaidate on insulin responsiveness are limited but not general. Thus, our findings reveal that differentiation with elaidate tends to affect insulin-dependent glucose uptake through alternation of GLUT4 translocation from cytosol to the plasma membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25958041>Fatty -Binding Protein 4 mediates apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum stress in mesangial cells of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Type 2  is characterized by hyperglycemia and deregulated lipid metabolism with increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA).

Here we aimed to investigate the link between FABP4 and apoptosis in diabetic glomerulosclerosis. We first evaluated the presence of FABP4 and ER stress markers as well as apoptosis-related proteins in renal biopsies of patients with DN. Then we used FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 or siRNA to further investigate the role of FABP4 in ER stress and apoptosis induced by NEFA or high glucose in cultured human mesangial cells (HMCs). We found FABP4 was expressed mainly in glomerular mesangial cells of the human renal biopsies and the glomerular FABP4 was increased in renal biopsies of DN. The up-regulation of FABP4 was accompanied with increased glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and Caspase-12 as well as down-regulated B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in glomeruli. Along with the induction of FABP4 and apoptosis, GRP78 and its three sensors as well as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and Caspase-12 were induced in HMCs treated with NEFA or high glucose and these responses were attenuated or even abrogated by treating with FABP4 inhibitor or FABP4 siRNA. Ultrastructure observation confirmed the lipotoxicity of  by showing the morphological damage in HMCs. Our data suggest that FABP4 in glomerular mesangial cells is up-regulated in DN and FABP4 mediates apoptosis via the ER stress in HMCs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of  in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

ER stress can be elicited by lipotoxicity and an increased demand for insulin in . We previously reported that the lipid droplet protein perilipin 2 (PLIN2) modulates lipid homeostasis in the liver. Here, we show that PLIN2 modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress in pancreatic β cells. PLIN2 expression goes up when β cells are exposed to a lipid load or to chemical ER stress inducers. Downregulation of PLIN2 ameliorates the effects of fatty - and chemical-induced ER stress, whereas PLIN2 overexpression exacerbates them. Diabetic Akita mice, which carry a heterozygous C96Y Ins2 mutation, exhibit elevated PLIN2 expression and ER stress in their β cells. Genetic ablation of Plin2 in Akita mice leads to mitigation of ER stress, forestalling β cell apoptosis, partially restoring β cell mass, and ameliorating . Mechanistic experiments showed that PLIN2 downregulation is associated with enhanced autophagic flux and accelerated ER stress resolution. In sum, we have identified a crucial role for PLIN2 in modulating autophagy, ER stress resolution, and β cell apoptosis and survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26431876>Hepatic scavenger receptor BI is associated with type 2  but unrelated to human and murine non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Scavenger receptor, class B type I (SR-BI) is a physiologically relevant regulator of high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Low HDL is a common feature of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, hepatic SR-BI expression was analyzed in human and murine NAFLD. In primary human hepatocytes NAFLD relevant factors like inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide and TGF-β did not affect SR-BI protein. Similarly, oleate and palmitate had no effect. The adipokines chemerin, adiponectin, leptin and omentin did not regulate SR-BI expression. Accordingly, hepatic SR-BI was not changed in human and murine fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatits. SR-BI was higher in type 2  patients but not in those with hypercholesterolemia.

OC including dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), a metabolite of the insecticide DDT, have an epidemiological association with type 2  (T2D) and may play a role in risk factors that contribute to T2D such as dyslipidemia. The liver, a potential target for DDE, plays a role in dyslipidemia. The in vitro effect of DDE on hepatocyte lipid metabolism and secretion was investigated using McArdle-RH7777 (McA) rodent hepatoma liver cells. When stimulated by the free fatty   (OA), DDE increased the secretion of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) suggesting a role for DDE in increasing lipid secretion. Intracellular protein levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) were increased while sortilin-1 (Sort-1) levels were decreased suggesting a role for DDE in increasing lipid transport and decreasing lipid degradation. Neutral lipids such as intracellular triglycerides (TG) were decreased suggesting that DDE may alter lipid accumulation in liver cells. DDE may play a role in dyslipidemia by affecting mechanisms that regulate lipid metabolism and secretion. These in vitro results on biochemical markers of liver cell dyslipidemia support the concept that DDE exposure may play a role in the dyslipidemia frequently observed in T2D.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we suggest that PLIN2 mediates Wnt signaling because PLIN2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppresses activation of Wnt/coreceptor pathways. The mediation in the Wnt/Frizzled pathway seems to occur from Dishevelleds to axin/glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK3)/β-catenin complexes (AGβC) as Wnt decreases Dishevelled/PLIN2 but increases AGβC/PLIN2 associations. Augmenting cellular LSDs that affect PLIN2 associations with these proteins,  (OA) treatment inhibits Wnt-increased AGβC/PLIN2 associations and β-catenin T-cell factor signaling (β-CTS). Revealing that PLIN2 is a GSK3-associated protein, the study explored PLIN2-mediated effects on GSK3/GSK3 substrates. PLIN2 siRNA reduces inhibitory GSK3 levels and lithium chloride (LiCl)-upregulated β-catenin or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (c/EBPα) expression. OA treatment decreases LiCl-increased c/EBPα via PLIN2-c/EBPα dissociation. In addition to PLIN2 overexpression increasing β-CTS, PLIN2 depletion or overexpression drops or adds expression of GSK3 substrates, such as β-catenin, c/EBPα,c-Myc, cyclin D1, and insulin receptor substrate 1, and cell growth/survival. PLIN2 N or C terminus overexpression that is associated with higher levels of the substrates suggests that those substrates bind to specific regions of PLIN2. Mimicking the possible high lipid concentrations in cells in the human body under conditions of hyperlipidemia/obesity, OA-treated cells gain or reduce GSK3 substrate expression in parallel with a decrease (a Wnt-like effect) or increase in GSK3 activity, likely regulated by GSK3/PLIN2/GSK3 substrate associations.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

We verified whether this pattern is influenced by an abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT). In 10 patients with DCM, 5 with normal glucose tolerance (DCM-NGT) and 5 with AGT (DCM-AGT), and 5 non-DCM subjects with AGT (N-AGT), we measured coronary blood flow and arteriovenous differences of oxygen and metabolites during Rest, Pacing (at 130 b/min), and Recovery. Myocardial lactate exchange and oleate oxidation were also measured. At Rest, DCM patients showed a reduced nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) myocardial uptake, while glucose utilization increased only in DCM-AGT. In response to Pacing, glucose uptake promptly rose in N-AGT (from 72 ± 21 to 234 ± 73 nmol/min/g, p < 0.05), did not change in DCM-AGT, and slowly increased in DCM-NGT. DCM-AGT sustained the extra workload by increasing NEFA oxidation (from 1.3 ± 0.2 to 2.9 ± 0.1 μmol/min/gO2 equivalents, p < 0.05), while DCM-NGT showed a delayed increase in glucose uptake. Substrate oxidation rates paralleled the metabolites data. The presence of AGT in patients with DCM exacerbates both the shift from fat to carbohydrates in resting myocardial metabolism and the reduced myocardial metabolic flexibility in response to an increased workload.

Dietary habits are of special interest to prevent and counteract the obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including lipid steatosis. Capsaicin, a pungent compound of chili peppers, has been found to ameliorate diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of capsaicin on hepatic lipogenesis and to delineate the underlying signaling pathways involved, using HepG2 cells as an experimental model. Cellular neutral lipids, stained with BODIPY493/503, were quantified by flow cytometry, and the protein expression and activity were determined by immunoblotting. Capsaicin reduced basal neutral lipid content in HepG2 cells, as well that induced by troglitazone or by . This effect of capsaicin was prevented by dorsomorphin and GW9662, pharmacological inhibitors of AMPK and PPARγ, respectively. In addition, capsaicin activated AMPK and inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway, major regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, capsaicin blocked autophagy and increased PGC-1α protein.

In contrast, monounsaturated free fatty acids (e.g. oleate) prevent the toxic effect of SFFAs in various types of cells. The mechanism is poorly understood and involvement of the mTOR complex is untested. In the present study, we demonstrate that oleate preconditioning, as well as coincubation, completely prevented palmitate-induced markers of inflammatory signaling, insulin resistance and cytotoxicity in C2C12 myotubes. We then examined the effect of palmitate and/or oleate on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal path and whether their link is mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Palmitate decreased the phosphorylation of raptor and 4E-BP1 while increasing the phosphorylation of p70S6K. Palmitate also inhibited phosphorylation of AMPK, but did not change the phosphorylated levels of mTOR or rictor. Oleate completely prevented the palmitate-induced dysregulation of mTOR components and restored pAMPK whereas alone it produced no signaling changes. To understand this more, we show activation of AMPK by metformin also prevented palmitate-induced changes in the phosphorylations of raptor and p70S6K, confirming that the mTORC1/p70S6K signaling pathway is responsive to AMPK activity. By contrast, inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by Compound C worsened palmitate-induced changes and correspondingly blocked the protective effect of oleate. Finally, metformin modestly attenuated palmitate-induced insulin resistance and cytotoxicity, as did oleate. Our findings indicate that palmitate activates mTORC1/p70S6K signaling by AMPK inhibition and phosphorylation of raptor. Oleate reverses these effects through a metformin-like facilitation of AMPK.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The origins of disease can be traced back to early developmental stages of life. This has increased mortalities and continues to reduce life expectancies of individuals across the globe. The aim of this study was to investigate the sub-acute and long term effects of neonatal oral administration of oleanolic  and metformin on lipids (free fatty acids, FFAs) and genes associated with lipid metabolism and glucose transport using a neonatal rat experimental model. In the first study, seven days old pups were randomly grouped into control-distilled water (DW); oleanolic  (60 mg/kg), metformin (500 mg/kg), high fructose diet (20% /, HF), oleanolic  (OA) + high fructose diet (OA + HF), and Metformin + high fructose diet (MET + HF) groups. The pups were treated for 7 days, and then terminated on postnatal day (PD) 14. In the second study, rat pups were initially treated similarly to study 1 and weaned onto normal rat chow and plain drinking water on PD 21 till they reached adulthood (PD112). Tissue and blood samples were collected for further analyses. Measurement of the levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the gene expression of , , , ,  and  in the skeletal muscle.

Moreover, both produced an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , fatty  transporter protein, and glucose transporter type 4 expression. Additionally, -amyrin and lupeol decreased lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and blood glucose in mice.

The function of miR-291b-3p is unknown. The potential role of miR-291b-3p in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism was explored in this study. High-fat diet (HFD)- and chow-fed mice were injected with an adenovirus expressing a miR-291b-3p inhibitor and a miR-291b-3p mimic through the tail vein. Hepatic lipids and lipogenic gene expression were analyzed. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed in vitro to identify direct targets of miR-291b-3p. MiR-291b-3p expression and the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were increased in the steatotic liver of db/db mice and HFD-fed mice versus their respective controls. Inhibition of hepatic miR-291b-3p expression prevented increases in hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis in HFD-fed mice. The opposite was observed when miR-291b-3p was overexpressed in the livers of chow-fed C57BL/6J wild-type mice. In vitro studies revealed that silencing of miR-291b-3p in NCTC1469 hepatic cells ameliorated /palmitic  mixture-induced elevation of cellular triglycerides. Importantly, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-291b-3p. Using metformin, an activator of AMPK, we showed that AMPK activation-induced inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by reduced expression of miR-291b-3p in the liver. Liver miR-291b-3p promoted hepatic lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in mice. AMPKα1 is a direct target of miR-291b-3p. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-291b-3p promotes hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and activity, indicating the therapeutic potential of miR-291b-3p inhibitors in fatty liver disease.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119530>Decreased lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis are coupled with changes in liver microRNAs in obese subjects with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Many controversies regarding the association of liver miRNAs with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) call for additional validations. This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with palmitic  (PA), a combination of palmitate and , or high glucose, and insulin (HG) mimicking insulin resistance in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders.

The fatty  ethanolamide, anandamide (AEA), and the monoacylglycerol, 2-arachidonoyl- sn-glycerol (2-AG), are two primary endocannabinoids (ECs) that play a role in regulating food intake, increasing adipose storage, and regulating lipid metabolism.

Two-week exposure to either HFCS- or Asp-sweetened beverages resulted in significant differences in the changes in fasting levels of OEA and DHEA between groups after the testing period. Subjects who consumed Asp, but not HFCS, displayed a reduction in AEA, OEA, and DHEA after the testing period.

Our findings reveal previously unknown associations between circulating ECs and EC-related molecules with markers of lipid metabolism and CVD risk after HFCS consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29749466>Upregulated 14‑3‑3β aggravates restenosis by promoting cell migration following vascular injury in diabetic rats with elevated levels of free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Mono‑unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) can serve as a predictive indicator of vascular restenosis following interventional therapy, particularly in individuals with high‑fat diet‑induced type 2 . However, the pathogenic mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the levels of tyrosine 3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‑monooxygenase activation protein β (YWHAB; also known as 14‑3‑3β), in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) treated with different concentrations of  (OA) were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The migration of VSMCs was examined using wound‑healing and Transwell migration assays. The protein distribution of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‑2)‑associated death promoter (BAD) in VSMCs treated with OA was examined by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. In in vivo experiments, the carotid artery morphology of rats in different groups was assessed at 14 days post‑injury by non-invasive ultrasonographic imaging and confirmed by histological staining. The expression of YWHAB was upregulated by OA in a concentration‑dependent manner in VSMCs. In the in vivo experiments, carotid stenosis was more serious among high‑FFA diabetic rats. However, silencing of YWHAB significantly alleviated carotid neointimal hyperplasia among the diabetic rats with elevated FFA levels. In addition, YWHAB silencing alleviated the migration of OA‑treated VSMCs and increased translocation of the BAD protein from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. In conclusion, the results showed that FFA‑induced upregulation of YWHAB was involved in neointimal hyperplasia by enhancing the migration of VSMCs following carotid artery injury. The inhibition of YWHAB may serve as a novel potential pharmacological target for preventing vascular restenosis following interventional therapy in diabetic individuals with high FFA levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087537>Effects of Lactobacillus plantarum Strain OLL2712 Culture Conditions on the Anti-inflammatory Activities for Murine Immune Cells and Obese and Type 2 Diabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Studies on the health-promoting effects of lactic  bacteria (LAB) are numerous, but few provide examples of the relationship between LAB function and culture conditions. We verified the effect of differences in culture conditions on  OLL2712 functionality; this strain exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and preventive effects against metabolic disorders. We measured interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 production in murine immune cells treated with OLL2712 cells prepared under various culture conditions. The results showed that the IL-10-inducing activities of OLL2712 cells on murine immune cells differed dramatically between OLL2712 groups at different culture phases and using different culture medium components, temperatures, and neutralizing pHs. In particular, exponential-phase cells had much more IL-10-inducing activity than stationary-phase cells. We confirmed that the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation activity of OLL2712 cells depended on culture conditions in conjunction with IL-10-inducing activity. We also demonstrated functional differences by culture phases ; OLL2712 cells at exponential phase had more anti-inflammatory activity and anti-metabolic-disorder effects on obese and diabetic mice than those by their stationary-phase counterparts. These results suggest that culture conditions affect the functionality of anti-inflammatory LAB. While previous studies demonstrated that culture conditions affected the immunomodulatory properties of lactic  bacteria (LAB), few have comprehensively investigated the relationship between culture conditions and LAB functionality. In this study, we demonstrated several culture conditions of  OLL2712 for higher anti-inflammatory activity. We also showed that culture conditions concretely influenced the health-promoting functions of OLL2712 , particularly against metabolic disorders. Further, we characterized a novel mechanism by which changing LAB culture conditions affected immunomodulatory properties. Our results suggest that culture condition optimization is important for the production of LAB with anti-inflammatory activity.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891736>Vaccenic  suppresses intestinal inflammation by increasing anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines in the JCR:LA-cp rat.</a></h2><p>Vaccenic  (VA), the predominant ruminant-derivedtransfat in the food chain, ameliorates hyperlipidemia, yet mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic  (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27061233>Trans-11 vaccenic  improves insulin secretion in models of type 2  in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>Trans-11 vaccenic  (VA) is a fatty  produced by ruminants entering the human food supply through meat and dairy products, which appears not to have the health risks associated with industrially produced trans-fatty acids. In this study, we investigated the effect of VA on insulin secretion in vivo in rats and in vitro in human and rat islets after diabetogenic insult.Hyperglycemic clamp showed that VA dietary supplementation for 8 weeks significantly increased glucose turnover in rats with type 2  (T2D), accompanied by an elevated plasma C-peptide concentration, indicating improved insulin secretion. The β-cell area and proliferation rate were higher in T2D+VA than T2D group. Isolated islets from T2D+VA rats had higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) than T2D group. In vitro, VA treatment for 24 and 48 h significantly enhanced GSIS in rat and human islets after diabetogenic challenges. The mRNA expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and regenerating islet-derived 1α (REG-1α) were consistently increased by VA in both rat and human islets.These results indicate that VA may improve insulin secretion and growth of islets in T2D, at least partly by altering GPR40 and REG-1α mRNA expression.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We hypothesized that removal of femoral SAT would increase postprandial TG through a reduction in dietary fatty  (FA) storage. Normal-weight (means ± SD; BMI 23.9 ± 2.6 kg/m(2)) women (n = 29; age 45 ± 6 yr) were randomized to femoral lipectomy (LIPO) or control (CON) and followed for 1 yr. Regional adiposity was measured by DEXA and CT. A liquid meal labeled with [(14)C] was used to trace the appearance of dietary FA in plasma (6-h postprandial TG), breath (24-h oxidation), and SAT (24-h [(14)C]TG storage). Fasting LPL activity was measured in abdominal and femoral SAT. DEXA leg fat mass was reduced after LIPO vs. CON (Δ-1.4 ± 0.7 vs. 0.1 ± 0.5 kg, P < 0.001) and remained reduced at 1 yr (-1.1 ± 1.4 vs. -0.2 ± 0.5 kg, P < 0.05), as did CT thigh subcutaneous fat area (-39.6 ± 36.6 vs. 4.7 ± 14.6 cm(2), P < 0.05); DEXA trunk fat mass and CT visceral fat area were unchanged. Postprandial TG increased (5.9 ± 7.7 vs. -0.6 ± 5.3 × 10(3) mg/dl, P < 0.05) and femoral SAT LPL activity decreased (-21.9 ± 22.3 vs. 10.5 ± 26.5 nmol·min(-1)·g(-1), P < 0.05) 1 yr following LIPO vs. CON. There were no group differences in (14)C-labeled TG appearing in abdominal and femoral SAT or elsewhere. In conclusion, femoral fat remained reduced 1 yr following lipectomy and was accompanied by increased postprandial TG and reduced femoral SAT LPL activity. There were no changes in storage of meal-derived FA or visceral fat. Our data support a protective role for femoral adiposity on circulating TG independent of dietary FA storage and visceral adiposity.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315213>Nutraceutical Potential of  in .</a></h2><p> L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs in tropical and subtropical regions.

To understand the role of fatty acids in disease epigenetics, we sought DNA methylation profiles specifically induced by arachidonic (AA) or  (OA) in cultured cells and compared those with published profiles of normal and diseased tissues. THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with AA or OA and analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) and Human Exon 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix). Data were corroborated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Comparisons with publicly available data were conducted by standard bioinformatics. AA and OA elicited a complex response marked by a general DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation in the 1-200 μM range, respectively, with a maximal differential response at the 100 μM dose. The divergent response to AA and OA was prominent within the gene body of target genes, where it correlated positively with transcription. AA-induced DNA methylation profiles were similar to the corresponding profiles described for palmitic , atherosclerosis, , obesity, and autism, but relatively dissimilar from OA-induced profiles. Furthermore, human atherosclerosis grade-associated DNA methylation profiles were significantly enriched in AA-induced profiles. Biochemical evidence pointed to β-oxidation, PPAR-α, and sirtuin 1 as important mediators of AA-induced DNA methylation changes. In conclusion, AA and OA exert distinct effects on the DNA methylome. The observation that AA may contribute to shape the epigenome of important metabolic diseases, supports and expands current diet-based therapeutic and preventive efforts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26937254>DPP-4 inhibition improves early mortality, β cell function, and adipose tissue inflammation in db/db mice fed a diet containing sucrose and linoleic .</a></h2><p> therapy that not only lowers glucose levels but also lengthens life spans is required. We previously demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorated β cell apoptosis and adipose tissue inflammation in β cell-specific glucokinase haploinsufficient mice fed a diet containing a combination of sucrose and linoleic  (SL).In this study, we investigated the effects of DPP-4 inhibition in obese diabetic db/db mice fed an SL diet or a control diet containing sucrose and  (SO). We also examined the effects of DPP-4 inhibition in IRS-1-deficient mice fed an SL or SO diet as a model of insulin resistance.DPP-4 inhibition efficiently increases the active GLP-1 levels in db/db mice. Unexpectedly, the SL diet, but not the SO diet, markedly increases mortality in the db/db mice. DPP-4 inhibition reduces the early lethality in SL-fed db/db mice. DPP-4 inhibition improves glucose tolerance, β cell function, and adipose tissue inflammation in db/db mice fed either diet. No significant changes in glycemic control or β cell mass were observed in any of the IRS-1-deficient mouse groups.A diet containing a combination of sucrose and linoleic  causes early lethality in obese diabetic db/db mice, but not in lean and insulin resistant IRS-1 knockout mice.

Here, we address whether the proinflammatory kinase inhibitor of (nuclear factor) κB kinase β (IKKβ), which is activated by oxidative stress, is also implicated.Fat (oleate or olive oil) was infused intravenously in Wistar rats for 48 h with or without the IKKβ inhibitor salicylate. Thereafter, beta cell function was evaluated in vivo using hyperglycaemic clamps or ex vivo in islets isolated from fat-treated rats. We also exposed rat islets to oleate in culture, with or without salicylate and 4(2'-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline; BMS-345541 (BMS, another inhibitor of IKKβ) and evaluated beta cell function in vitro.

These expression profiles will be compared to those obtained by treatment of the same cell types with elevated D-glucose, a -relevant stimulus often used in retinal cell culture experiments.Primary cultures of human retinal Müller cells, astrocytes, and microvascular endothelial cells (RMEC) and a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) were treated with , linoleic , elevated D-glucose, or L-glucose as an osmotic control. VEGF, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations in conditioned media were determined by colorimetric ELISA and normalized to total cellular protein.In the conditioned medium of human Müller cells, linoleic and  increased VEGF production by 6.4-fold and 9.9-fold, respectively. Linoleic  also significantly increased IL-6 by 2.9-fold and IL-8 by 5.7-fold. L-glucose and D-glucose both increased VEGF by 3.1-fold in Müller cell conditioned medium.

Moreover, unsaturated FAs are capable of inhibiting the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated FAs. Hypoxia is also known to have deleterious effects on β-cells function and viability. In the present study, we have tested the modulatory effect of hypoxia on the effect of FAs on the growth and viability of the human pancreatic NES2Y β-cells. This study represents the first study testing hypoxia effect on effects of FAs in pancreatic β-cells as well as in other cell types. We showed that hypoxia increased the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated stearic  (SA). Endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling seemed to be involved while redistribution of FA transporters fatty  translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36) and fatty -binding protein (FABP) do not seem to be involved in this effect. Hypoxia also strongly decreased the protective effect of unsaturated  (OA) against the pro-apoptotic effect of SA. Thus, in the presence of hypoxia, OA was unable to save SA-treated β-cells from apoptosis induction. Hypoxia itself had only a weak detrimental effect on NES2Y cells.

Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients.

Palmitic  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA. PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O  ) generation in cultured podocytes. To elucidate the role of PA in antioxidant defense systems in diabetic nephropathy (DN), cultured podocytes were exposed to 250 μM PA for 1-24 hr, and protein expressions of catalase, peroxiredoxins (Prxs), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were examined by western blot analysis. PA induced an early transient increase in the Prx1, Prx2, and GPx1 levels in podocytes, but not catalase. Long-term exposure of PA to podocytes significantly decreased the protein levels of Prx1, Prx2, GPx1, and catalase. Coincubation of PA-treated cells with , however, restored the expression of these proteins. In advanced human diabetic glomeruli, H O generation was elevated as shown by increased fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein. Strong immunostaining for Prx1, Prx2, GPx1, and catalase was observed in the podocytes of advanced human DN, wherein transforming growth factor-β1 staining was also positive. These results suggest that podocytes are susceptible to PA-induced oxidative damage with impaired peroxidase activity and that peroxidases have futile antioxidant effects in the podocytes in the late stages of DN. Given this, PA-induced podocyte injury via inadequate peroxidase response to H O appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487558>Extra virgin olive oil: More than a healthy fat.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of a Mediterranean diet on human health and, in particular, on lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, has been mainly attributed to its high content to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). While its main fatty , , is considered important to these effects, EVOO has other biological properties that depend on, or are potentiated by other minor components of this oil. Initially, the mechanisms considered as possible causes of this cardioprotective effect of EVOO were based on the incidence on the so-called traditional risk factors (especially lipids and blood pressure). However, the high relative reduction in the prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were not proportional to the limited findings about regulation of those traditional risk factors. In addition to several studies confirming the above effects, current research on beneficial effect of EVOO, and in particular in conjunction with Mediterranean style diets, is being focused on defining its effects on newer cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis, endothelial function or lipids or on the modulation of the conditions which predispose people to cardiovascular events, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome or type 2 .

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9.Participants with depressive symptoms had a higher plasma concentration of total TFA compared with those without depressive symptoms (6.6 vs 6.0 μmol/g lipids, P = 0.046). After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratio (OR) of depressive symptoms comparing the highest with lowest tertile of TFAs was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.86-2.39) for total TFAs (P for trend 0.15). For each individual type of TFA, the corresponding OR was 1.78 (1.03-3.07) for elaidic  (P for trend 0.049), 1.23 (0.76-2.00) for linoelaidic  (P for trend 0.37), 1.19 (0.75-1.87) for palmitelaidic  (P for trend 0.46), and 1.20 (0.75-1.94) for vaccenic  (P for trend 0.43).The cross-sectional study design limited causal inferences of the findings.In a nationally representative population, plasma elaidic , a major trans fatty , was positively associated with depressive symptoms in adults.

It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty  profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational  (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty  methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic  significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the  and vaccenic  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic  levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis-vaccenic  concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty  profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707994>Methylation patterns of Vegfb promoter are associated with gene and protein expression levels: the effects of dietary fatty acids.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the epigenetic regulation by dietary fatty acids of Vegfb levels in rats' white adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 cells.A group of rats were assigned to three diets, each one with a different composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Samples of white adipose tissues were taken for the methylation and expression studies. Additionally, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with palmitic, , and linoleic fatty acids. After treatment, cells were harvested and genetic material was extracted for the analysis of Vegfb levels.We report evidence of changes in the methylation levels of the CpG island at the Vegfb promoter and in the Vegfb expression levels in vivo and in vitro by dietary fatty , with the main contribution of the linoleic fatty . Vegfb promoter methylation levels were closely related to the Vegfb gene expression.According to our results, the regulation of Vegfb gene expression by dietary fatty acids may be mediated, at least in part, by epigenetic modifications on Vegfb promoter methylation. Considering the deep association between angiogenesis and tissue growth, we suggest the nutriepigenetic regulation of Vegfb as a key target in the control of the adipose tissue expansion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26324406>Lipidomic evidence that lowering the typical dietary palmitate to oleate ratio in humans decreases the leukocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines and muscle expression of redox-sensitive genes.</a></h2><p>We recently reported that lowering the high, habitual palmitic  (PA) intake in ovulating women improved insulin sensitivity and both inflammatory and oxidative stress. In vitro studies indicate that PA can activate both cell membrane toll-like receptor-4 and the intracellular nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein (NLRP3). To gain further insight into the relevance to human metabolic disease of dietary PA, we studied healthy, lean and obese adults enrolled in a randomized, crossover trial comparing 3-week, high-PA (HPA) and low-PA/high- (HOA) diets. After each diet, both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivities were measured, and we assessed cytokine concentrations in plasma and in supernatants derived from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as proinflammatory gene expression in skeletal muscle. Insulin sensitivity was unaffected by diet. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α was higher during the HPA diet. Lowering the habitually high PA intake by feeding the HOA diet resulted in lower secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α by PBMCs, as well as lower relative mRNA expression of cJun and NLRP3 in muscle. Principal components analysis of 156 total variables coupled to analysis of covariance indicated that the mechanistic pathway for the differential dietary effects on PBMCs involved changes in the PA/OA ratio of tissue lipids. Our results indicate that lowering the dietary and tissue lipid PA/OA ratio resulted in lower leukocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines and muscle expression of redox-sensitive genes, but the relevance to  risk is uncertain.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on hyperlipidemia induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated fatty acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately  (54.30%), and saturated fatty acids (palmitic  31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and liver and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO. OFEO treatment inhibited the formation of atheromatous plaques in the vascular endothelium of the treated rats, as well as those who were treated with simvastatin.

The objective of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between circulating concentrations of individual FAs and T2D incidence among Japanese adults. We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 4754 employees, aged 34-69 y, who attended a comprehensive health checkup in 2008-2009 and donated blood samples for the Hitachi Health Study. During 5 y of follow-up,  was identified on the basis of plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and self-report. Two controls matched to each case by sex, age, and date of checkup were randomly chosen by using density sampling, resulting in 336 cases and 678 controls with FA measurements. GC was used to measure the FA composition in serum phospholipids. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs after adjusting for potential confounders. We examined the association of T2D risk with 25 different individual and combinations of FAs. T2D risk was positively associated with serum dihomo-γ-linoleic  concentration (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.11; trend = 0.02) and inversely associated with Δ5-desaturase activity (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.99; trend = 0.02), independent of body mass index (BMI). There were also inverse associations between T2D risk with serum total n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic , and -vaccenic , but these were attenuated and became nonsignificant after adjustment for BMI. Serum n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were not associated with T2D risk.

Palmitic  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA, yet its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear. Recently, one study suggested that mitochondrial superoxide production is related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in diabetic mice kidneys. To elucidate the link between PA and oxidative stress and AMPK activity in DN, we compared the cultured murine podocytes exposed to PA and  (OA). Incubation of cells with 250 μM PA or OA induced a translocation of CD36, a fatty  transport protein, with intracellular lipid accumulation. PA, but not OA, induced mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O ) generation in podocytes, as shown by enhanced fluorescence of MitoSOX Red and dichlorofluorescein (DCF), respectively. Costimulation of PA-treated cells with the H O scavenger catalase abolished the PA-induced DCF fluorescence. Only PA induced mitochondrial damage as shown by electron microscopy. The AMPK activity was determined by immunoblotting, measuring the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) to total AMPK. Only PA significantly increased the p-AMPK levels compared with controls. Addition of catalase to PA-treated cells did not affect the PA-stimulated p-AMPK levels. Collectively, our results indicate that PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and H O generation in cultured podocytes, which may not be directly linked to AMPK activation. Given that, PA seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN through lipotoxicity initiated by mitochondrial superoxide overproduction.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941349>Lipotoxic Palmitate Impairs the Rate of β-Oxidation and Citric  Cycle Flux in Rat Neonatal Cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Diabetic hearts exhibit intracellular lipid accumulation. This suggests that the degree of fatty  oxidation (FAO) in these hearts is insufficient to handle the elevated lipid uptake. We previously showed that palmitate impaired the rate of FAO in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here we were interested in characterizing the site of FAO impairment induced by palmitate since it may shed light on the metabolic dysfunction that leads to lipid accumulation in diabetic hearts.We measured fatty  oxidation, acetyl-CoA oxidation, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (Cpt1b) activity. We measured both forward and reverse aconitase activity, as well as NAD+ dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. We also measured reactive oxygen species using the 2', 7'-Dichlorofluorescin Diacetate (DCFDA) assay. Finally we used thin layer chromatography to assess diacylglycerol (DAG) levels.We found that palmitate significantly impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation as well as citric  cycle flux, but not Cpt1b activity. Palmitate negatively affected net aconitase activity and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The impaired enzyme activities were not due to oxidative stress but may be due to DAG mediated PKC activation.This work demonstrates that palmitate, a highly abundant fatty  in human diets, causes impaired β-oxidation and citric  cycle flux in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. This metabolic defect occurs prior to cell death suggesting that it is a cause, rather than a consequence of palmitate mediated lipotoxicity. This impaired mitochondrial metabolism can have important implications for metabolic diseases such as  and obesity.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Among the most studied nitro derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids are nitro- (OA-NO) and nitro-linoleic  (LNO). These products exhibit novel protective actions in a variety of rodent disease models. Diverse signaling events are responsible for effects of nitrated fatty , including activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-dependent gene expression, suppressing NF-κB-induced inflammation, inhibiting oxidative stress, and increasing both endothelial nitric oxide synthase- and Nrf2-dependent gene regulation. Nitrated fatty acids have been emerging not only as a unique class of signaling molecules produced endogenously and but also as multipotent modulators of cell signaling pathways in cardiovascular and renal diseases. In this review, we discuss biochemical properties of nitrated fatty  and its signaling pathways in the modulation of cellular events. A major focus is to review recent knowledge of nitrated fatty  on the treatment of kidney diseases and its therapeutic potential for inflammation and metabolic disorders, with special emphasis on acute kidney injury and diabetic kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26729277>Differential Acute Impacts of Sleeve Gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery and Matched Caloric Restriction Diet on Insulin Secretion, Insulin Effectiveness and Non-Esterified Fatty  Levels Among Patients with Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is an increasingly common option for control of type 2  (T2D) and obesity.

This study examines how sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) or matched hypocaloric diet (DT) achieves improvements in T2D by characterising components of the glucose metabolism and NEFA levels before and 3 days after each intervention.Plasma samples at five time points during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from subjects with T2D undergoing GBP (N = 11) or SG (N = 12) were analysed for C-peptide, insulin and glucose before surgery and 3-day post-intervention or after DT (N = 5). Fasting palmitic, linoleic,  and stearic  were measured. C-peptide measurements were used to model insulin secretion rate (ISR) using deconvolution.Subjects who underwent GBP surgery experienced the greatest improvement in glycaemia (median reduction in blood glucose (BG) from basal by 29 % [IQR -57, -18]) and the greatest reduction in all NEFA measured. SG achieved improvement in glycaemia with lower ISR and reduction in all but palmitoleic .

However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty  metabolism and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on vascular calcification by the modulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the aortic roots of LepLDLR mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and a greater atheroma plaque size, calcification, and RANKL/CATHK expression in the aortic root than mice on MUFA-enriched diets, with an increasing OPG expression in the aortic roots of the latter. Our study demonstrates that compared to dietary SFAs, MUFAs from olive oil protect against atherosclerosis by interfering with vascular calcification via the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the setting of MetS.

Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of lipid intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important metabolic characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

The p53 ortholog p63 modulates cellular adaptations to stress and has a major role in cell maintenance and proliferation. Here we show that p63 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism. Mice with liver-specific p53 deletion develop steatosis and show increased levels of p63. Down-regulation of p63 attenuates liver steatosis in p53 knockout mice and in diet-induced obese mice, whereas the activation of p63 induces lipid accumulation. Hepatic overexpression of N-terminal transactivation domain TAp63 induces liver steatosis through IKKβ activation and the induction of ER stress, the inhibition of which rescues the liver functions. Expression of TAp63, IKKβ and XBP1s is also increased in livers of obese patients with NAFLD. In cultured human hepatocytes, TAp63 inhibition protects against -induced lipid accumulation, whereas TAp63 overexpression promotes lipid storage, an effect reversible by IKKβ silencing.

A Mass Spectrometry And Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - based metabolomics study.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a group of abnormalities that enhances the risk for cardiovascular disease,  and stroke. The Mediterranean diet seems to be an important dietary pattern, which reduces the incidence of MetS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) - a simple phenol found in olive oil - has received increased attention for its antioxidant activity. Recently, the European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that dietary consumption of HT exhibits a protective role against cardiovascular disease. In this study, an experimental protocol has been setup, including isolated HT administration in a diet induced model of MetS in young Wistar rats, in order to find out whether HT has a protective effect against MetS. Rats were randomly divided into two groups nurtured by high-carbohydrate high-fat (H) (MetS inducing diet) and high-carbohydrate high-fat + HT (HHT). HT (20mg/kg/d oral gavage, water vehicle) was administered for 8 weeks on the basal diet. Previous pharmacological evaluation of HT showed that hepatic steatosis was reduced and the inflammatory cells into the liver were infiltrated. These indicate that HT shows bioactivity against metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the metabolomics evaluation of liver extracts would indicate the putative biochemical mechanisms of HT activity. Thus, the extracts of liver tissues were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS, Orbitrap Discovery) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III 600MHz). Multivariate analysis was performed in order to gain insight on the metabolic effects of HT administration on the liver metabolome. Normalization employing multiple internal standards and Quality Control-based Robust LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) Signal Correction algorithm (QC-RLSC) was added in the processing pipeline to enhance the reliability of metabolomic analysis by reducing unwanted information. Experimentally, HHT rats were clearly distinguished from H in PLS-DA, showing differences in the liver metabolome between the groups and specific biomarkers were determined supporting the pharmacological findings. More specifically, HT has shown to be effective towards the mobilization of lipids as various lipid classes being differentially regulated between the H and HHT groups. Interestingly branched fatty  esters of hydroxy  acids (OAHSA) lipids have been shown to be up regulated to the HHT group, denoting the alleviation of the MetS to the animals administered with HT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ],  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited adipogenesis of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts.

We can measure FAHFAs in 30 min with this new protocol versus 90 min using the older protocol with comparable performance in regioisomer detection and quantitation. We also discovered through this optimization that  esters of hydroxystearic acids (OAHSAs), another family of FAHFAs, have a much lower background signal than PAHSAs, which makes them easier to measure.

This has encouraged the search for strategies decreasing glucose levels and long-term improvement of redox status of glutathione, the main antioxidant counteracting mitochondrial damage. Previously, we have shown that avocado oil improves redox status of glutathione in liver and brain mitochondria from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; however, the long-term effects of avocado oil and its hypoglycemic effect cannot be evaluated because this model displays low survival and insulin depletion.

We investigated the effect of myo-inositol on fatty- processing in human placental-explants from uncomplicated pregnancies. Explants were incubated with 13C-labeled palmitic-, 13C- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- across a range of myo-inositol concentrations for 24 h and 48 h. The incorporation of labeled-fatty-acids into individual lipids was quantified by liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. At 24 h, myo-inositol increased the amount of 13C-palmitic- and 13C- labeled lipids (median fold-change relative to control=1). Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol (physiological) for 13C-palmitic--lysophosphatidylcholines (1.26) and 13C-palmitic--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.17). At 48 h, myo-inositol addition increased 13C--lipids but decreased 13C-palmitic- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- lipids. Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol for 13C--phosphatidylcholines (1.25), 13C--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.37) and 13C--triacylglycerols (1.32) and with 100 µM myo-inositol for 13C-docosahexaenoic--triacylglycerols (0.78). Lipids labeled with the same 13C-fatty- showed similar responses when tested at the same time-point, suggesting myo-inositol alters upstream processes such as fatty- uptake or activation.

Postprandial changes in gut hormones, glucose homeostasis, satiety, lipid and inflammatory parameters after meals were analysed. Some of the solid fractions of the IPO were removed and thus the fatty  composition of the PO and IPO was not entirely equal (PO vs IPO: palmitate 39.8 vs 38.7; oleate 43.6 vs 45.1). PO, IPO and HOS contained 9.7, 38.9 and 0.2 g/100 g total fatty acids of palmitic  at the sn-2 position, respectively. At 37 °C, IPO contained 4.2% SFC whereas PO and HOS were completely melted.Our novel observation shows that the incremental area under curve (iAUC) 0-6 h of plasma GIP concentration was on average 16% lower following IPO meal compared with PO and HOS (P < 0.05) meals. Serum C-peptide concentrations exhibited a significant meal × gender interaction (P = 0.009).

Glucolipotoxicity causes cardiomyocyte injury by increasing energy insufficiency, impairing proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and inducing apoptosis. Proteasome-evading proteins are degraded by autophagy in the lysosome, whose metabolism and function are regulated by master regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Limited studies have examined the impact of glucolipotoxicity on intra-lysosomal signaling proteins and their regulators. By utilizing a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, type-1  (Akita) and ex-vivo model of glucolipotoxicity (H9C2 cells and NRCM, neonatal rat cardiomyocyte), we examined whether glucolipotoxicity negatively targets TFEB and lysosomal proteins to dysregulate autophagy and cause cardiac injury. Despite differential effects of obesity and  on LC3B-II, expression of proteins facilitating autophagosomal clearance such as TFEB, LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were decreased in the obese and diabetic heart. In-vivo data was recapitulated in H9C2 and NRCM cells, which exhibited impaired autophagic flux and reduced TFEB content when exposed to a glucolipotoxic milieu. Notably, overloading myocytes with a saturated fatty  (palmitate) but not an unsaturated fatty  (oleate) depleted cellular TFEB and suppressed autophagy, suggesting a fatty  specific regulation of TFEB and autophagy in the cardiomyocyte. The effect of glucolipotoxicity to reduce TFEB content was also confirmed in heart tissue from patients with Class-I obesity. Therefore, during glucolipotoxicity, suppression of lysosomal autophagy was associated with reduced lysosomal content, decreased cathepsin-B activity and diminished cellular TFEB content likely rendering myocytes susceptible to cardiac injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

DHA and EPA are omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that are plentiful in fish oil, and  is an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty , rich in olive oil. Dietary intake of these unsaturated long-chain fatty acids have been associated with insulin sensitivity and weight loss, which contrasts with the impairment of insulin sensitivity and weight gain associated with high intakes of saturated long-chain fatty acids. The recent discovery that free fatty  receptor 4 (FFA4, also known as GPR120) acts as a sensor for unsaturated long-chain fatty acids started to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial functions played by these unsaturated long-chain fatty acids in various physiological processes, which include the secretions of gastrointestinal peptide hormones and glucose homeostasis. In this review, the physiological roles and therapeutic significance of FFA4 in appetite control, insulin sensitization, and inflammation reduction are discussed in relation to obesity and type 2  from pharmacological viewpoints.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Pharmacological activation of GPR40 is a strategy under consideration to increase insulin secretion in type 2 . GPR40 is known to signal predominantly via the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq/11. However, 7TMRs can also activate functionally distinct G protein-independent signaling via β-arrestins. Further, G protein- and β-arrestin-based signaling can be differentially modulated by different ligands, thus eliciting ligand-specific responses ("biased agonism"). Whether GPR40 engages β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms and is subject to biased agonism is unknown. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors for real-time monitoring of cell signaling in living cells, we detected a ligand-induced GPR40-β-arrestin interaction, with the synthetic GPR40 agonist TAK-875 being more effective than palmitate or oleate in recruiting β-arrestins 1 and 2. Conversely, TAK-875 acted as a partial agonist of Gq/11-dependent GPR40 signaling relative to both FFAs. Pharmacological blockade of Gq activity decreased FFA-induced insulin secretion. In contrast, knockdown or genetic ablation of β-arrestin 2 in an insulin-secreting cell line and mouse pancreatic islets, respectively, uniquely attenuated the insulinotropic activity of TAK-875, thus providing functional validation of the biosensor data. Collectively, these data reveal that in addition to coupling to Gq/11, GPR40 is functionally linked to a β-arrestin 2-mediated insulinotropic signaling axis. These observations expose previously unrecognized complexity for GPR40 signal transduction and may guide the development of biased agonists showing improved clinical profile in type 2 .© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29269872>The monounsaturated fatty  oleate is the major physiological toxic free fatty  for human beta cells.</a></h2><p>Free fatty acids (FFAs) can cause glucose intolerance and . Lipotoxicity to the pancreatic beta cells is considered to be a major underlying cause for this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to analyse the toxicity profile of FFAs in the human EndoC-βH1 beta-cell line and to compare the results with isolated rat and human islets with special reference to the physiologically most prevalent FFAs palmitic  (PA) and  (OA). Toxicity after a 2-day incubation with the different FFAs was analysed by the caspase-3 assay and confirmed by the propidium iodide and annexin V staining tests. The long-chain saturated PA (C16:0) and the monounsaturated OA (C18:1) were both toxic to human EndoC-βH1 beta cells and pseudoislets, as well as to rat islets, and, as confirmed in a pilot experiment, also to human islets. Furthermore, OA provided no protection against the toxicity of PA. Likewise, elaidic  (EA, the trans isomer of OA; trans-OA) was significantly toxic, in contrast to the non-metabolisable analogues methylated PA (MePA) and methylated OA (MeOA). Fatty acids with a chain length  < C16 were not toxic in EndoC-βH1 beta cells. Caspase-3 was also activated by linoleic  (LA)(C18:2) but not by γ-linolenic  (γ-LNA)(C18:3). Overall, only long-chain FFAs with chain lengths  > C14, which generate hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation, were toxic. This conclusion is also supported by the toxicity of the branched-chain FFA pristanic , which is exclusively metabolised in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The lack of a protective effect of the monounsaturated fatty  OA has important consequences for a beta-cell protective lipid composition of a diet. A cardioprotective diet with a high OA content does not fulfil this requirement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27341449>Identification of Novel Genetic Determinants of Erythrocyte Membrane Fatty  Composition among Greenlanders.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are involved in cellular processes important for normal body function, and perturbation of FA balance has been linked to metabolic disturbances, including type 2 . An individual's level of FAs is affected by diet, lifestyle, and genetic variation. We aimed to improve the understanding of the mechanisms and pathways involved in regulation of FA tissue levels, by identifying genetic loci associated with inter-individual differences in erythrocyte membrane FA levels. We assessed the levels of 22 FAs in the phospholipid fraction of erythrocyte membranes from 2,626 Greenlanders in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped on the MetaboChip or imputed. We identified six independent association signals. Novel loci were identified on chromosomes 5 and 11 showing strongest association with  (rs76430747 in ACSL6, beta (SE): -0.386% (0.034), p = 1.8x10-28) and docosahexaenoic  (rs6035106 in DTD1, 0.137% (0.025), p = 6.4x10-8), respectively. For a missense variant (rs80356779) in CPT1A, we identified a number of novel FA associations, the strongest with 11-eicosenoic  (0.473% (0.035), p = 2.6x10-38), and for variants in FADS2 (rs174570), LPCAT3 (rs2110073), and CERS4 (rs11881630) we replicated known FA associations. Moreover, we observed metabolic implications of the ACSL6 (rs76430747) and CPT1A (rs80356779) variants, which both were associated with altered HbA1c (0.051% (0.013), p = 5.6x10-6 and -0.034% (0.016), p = 3.1x10-4, respectively). The latter variant was also associated with reduced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, -0.193 (0.050), p = 3.8x10-6), as well as measures of smaller body size, including weight (-2.676 kg (0.523), p = 2.4x10-7), lean mass (-1.200 kg (0.271), p = 1.7x10-6), height (-0.966 cm (0.230), p = 2.0x10-5), and BMI (-0.638 kg/m2 (0.181), p = 2.8x10-4).

Hepatic levels of miR-27a were significantly augmented in HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Further studies demonstrated that miR-27a directly interacted with 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of hepatic Fasn and Scd1 mRNAs and reduced their expression levels in mice.

When the omega-3 index changes it follows that the relative fractions of other fatty acids in the membrane are also changed. In the present study, increasing doses of a preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids extracted from krill oil were administered orally to non-human primates for 12 weeks and the time course of EPA, DHA and 22 other fatty acids in erythrocytes was determined bi-weekly during treatment and for 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. Plasma concentrations of six endocannabinoid-type mediators being downstream metabolites of some fatty acids analyzed in erythrocytes were also determined.Six diabetic, dyslipidemic non-human primates were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The vehicle control and test items were given daily by gavage and the test item doses were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/kg/day. Each dose level was given for four weeks. Blood was sampled at baseline and thereafter bi-weekly. Fatty acids were determined in erythrocytes by methylation followed by gas-chromatography. Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators were analyzed in plasma by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry.The treatment resulted in a dose-related increase in the fraction of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membranes and a dose-related decrease of other poly-unsaturated fatty acids, in particular omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Erythrocyte concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Plasma concentrations of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators changed accordingly as those being downstream arachidonic  decreased, downstream of the saturated palmitic and  acids remained unchanged while a downstream EPA metabolite increased.Increasing the omega-3 index by administering an omega-3 rich phospholipid extracted from krill oil did not alter the ratio of unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membranes but only the relative concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular unsaturated omega-6 fatty acids.

Lipokines are circulating lipid species that have recently been reported to affect metabolism in response to cold. Here, lipidomics analysis revealed that a bout of moderate-intensity exercise causes a pronounced increase in the circulating lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) in male, female, young, old, sedentary, and active human subjects. In mice, both a single bout of exercise and exercise training increased circulating 12,13-diHOME and surgical removal of brown adipose tissue (BAT) negated the increase in 12,13-diHOME, suggesting that BAT is the tissue source for exercise-stimulated 12,13-diHOME. Acute 12,13-diHOME treatment of mice in vivo increased skeletal muscle fatty  uptake and oxidation, but not glucose uptake.

In pancreatic β-cells, it helps counter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that impairs insulin secretory capacity during Type 2 . Chronic exposure of β-cells to saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitate stimulates ER stress and modulates autophagy, but the effects of unsaturated FAs such as oleate, which are also elevated during obesity, are less well understood. We therefore treated MIN6 cells and mouse islets for 8-48 h with either palmitate or oleate, and then monitored autophagic flux, signaling pathways, lysosomal biology, and phospholipid profiles. Compared with palmitate, oleate more effectively stimulated both autophagic flux and clearance of autophagosomes. The flux stimulation occurred independently of ER stress, nutrient-sensing (mTOR) and signaling pathways (protein kinases A, C, and D). Instead the mechanism involved the exchange factor directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2). Oleate reduced cellular cAMP, and its effects on autophagic flux were reproduced or inhibited, respectively, by  knockdown or activation. Oleate also increased lysosomal acidity and increased phospholipid saturation, consistent with improved autophagosomal fusion with lysosomes. We conclude that a potent stimulation of autophagy might help explain the known benefits of unsaturated FAs in countering the toxicity of saturated FAs in β-cells during obesity and lipid loading.© 2019 Chu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672544>Hydrogen peroxide permeability of cellular membranes in insulin-producing cells.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen peroxide (HO) plays a central role in redox signalling and in oxidative stress-mediated cell death. It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty   did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

In humans, maternal obesity alters placental FA uptake, though the impact of diet remains uncertain. The fatty fetal liver observed in offspring of Japanese macaques fed a high fat diet (HFD) was prevented with resveratrol supplementation during pregnancy. We sought to determine the effect of HFD and resveratrol, a supplement with insulin-sensitizing properties, on placental LCPUFA uptake in this model.J. macaques were fed control chow (15% fat, n = 5), HFD (35% fat, n = 10) or HFD containing 0.37% resveratrol (n = 5) prior to- and throughout pregnancy. At ∼ 130 d gestation (term = 173 d), placentas were collected by caesarean section. Fatty  uptake studies using (14)C-labeled , arachidonic  (AA) and docosahexanoic  (DHA) were performed in placental explants.Resveratrol supplementation increased placental uptake of DHA (P < 0.05), while HFD alone had no measurable effect. Resveratrol increased AMP-activated protein kinase activity and mRNA expression of the fatty  transporters FATP-4, CD36 and FABPpm (P < 0.05). Placental DHA content was decreased in HFD dams; resveratrol had no effect on tissue fatty  profiles.Maternal HFD did not significantly affect placental LCPUFA uptake. Furthermore, resveratrol stimulated placental DHA uptake capacity, AMPK activation and transporter expression. Placental handling of DHA is particularly sensitive to the dramatic alterations in the maternal metabolic phenotype and placental AMPK activity associated with resveratrol supplementation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 281 subjects, aged >19 and <60 years, participated in a cross-sectional, population-based study performed in Brazil. The following SNP spanning the TNF-α gene were genotyped: -238G/A (rs361525), -308G/A (rs1800629), -857C/T (rs1799724) and -1031T/C (rs1799964). In all, eleven plasma inflammatory biomarkers and plasma FA profile were determined. To analyse the interaction between TNF-α SNP and plasma FA, a cluster analysis was performed to stratify individuals based on eleven inflammatory biomarkers into two groups used as outcome: inflammatory (INF) and non-inflammatory clusters. The -238A allele carriers had higher TNF-α (P=0·033), IL-6 (P=0·013), IL-1β (P=0·037), IL-12 (0·048) and IL-10 (P=0·010) than the GG genotype. The -308A allele carriers also had lower levels of plasma palmitoleic  (P=0·009),  (P=0·039), total MUFA (P=0·014), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity index-16 (P=0·007), SCD-18 (P=0·020) and higher levels of PUFA (P=0·046) and DHA (P=0·044). Significant interactions modifying the risk of belonging to the INF cluster were observed with inflammatory cluster as outcome between -857C/T and plasma α-linolenic  (P=0·026), and also between -308G/A and plasma stearic  (P=0·044) and total SFA (P=0·040).

Notably, significant elevations of negatively charged amphiphilic molecules are observed in obesity (e.g. free fatty acids and phosphatidic ) and plastics exposure (monophthalate esters). It remains unclear whether these factors share pathogenic mechanisms and whether links exist with islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) misfolding, a process central to β-cell dysfunction and death. Using a combination of fluorescence, circular dichroism and electron microscopy, we show that phosphatidic , , and the phthalate metabolite MBzP partition into neutral membranes and enhance IAPP misfolding. The elevation of negative charge density caused by the presence of the risk factor molecules stabilizes a common membrane-bound α-helical intermediate that, in turn, facilitates IAPP misfolding. This shared mechanism points to a critical role for the membrane-bound intermediate in disease pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29099080>Effect of Saturated Stearic  on MAP Kinase and ER Stress Signaling Pathways during Apoptosis Induction in Human Pancreatic β-Cells Is Inhibited by Unsaturated .</a></h2><p>It has been shown that saturated fatty acids (FAs) have a detrimental effect on pancreatic β-cells function and survival, leading to apoptosis, whereas unsaturated FAs are well tolerated and are even capable of inhibiting the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated FAs. Molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induction and regulation by FAs in β-cells remain unclear; however, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathways may be involved. In this study, we tested how unsaturated  (OA) affects the effect of saturated stearic  (SA) on the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways as well as the ER stress signaling pathways during apoptosis induction in the human pancreatic β-cells NES2Y. We demonstrated that OA is able to inhibit all effects of SA. OA alone has only minimal or no effects on tested signaling in NES2Y cells. The point of OA inhibitory intervention in SA-induced apoptotic signaling thus seems to be located upstream of the discussed signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28785295>Almonds ameliorate glycemic control in Chinese patients with better controlled type 2 : a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial.</a></h2><p>Almonds can decrease glycemic index of co-consumed foods and are a rich source for  and α-tocopherol.

We hypothesised that skeletal muscle mitochondria of endurance-trained athletes have increased sensitivity for fatty  (FA)-induced uncoupling, which is driven by the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1).Capacity for FA-induced uncoupling was measured in endurance-trained male athletes (T) and sedentary young men (UT) in an observational study and also in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and C2C12 myotubes following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ANT1. Thus, fuelled by glutamate/succinate (fibres) or pyruvate (mitochondria and myotubes) and in the presence of oligomycin to block ATP synthesis, increasing levels of oleate (fibres) or palmitate (mitochondria and myotubes) were automatically titrated while respiration was monitored. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in humans and via insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes.Skeletal muscle from the T group displayed increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.011) compared with muscle from the UT group, and this was associated with elevated insulin sensitivity (p = 0.034). ANT1 expression was increased in T (p = 0.013). Mitochondria from ZDF rats displayed decreased sensitivity for FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008). This difference disappeared in the presence of the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor carboxyatractyloside. Partial knockdown of ANT1 in C2C12 myotubes decreased sensitivity to the FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008) and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0.025) compared with controls.Increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and is affected by ANT1 activity in skeletal muscle.

However, the mechanism of Ufd2p-mediated ubiquitination is largely unclear. Here, we show that Ufd2p catalyses K48-linked multi-monoubiquitination on K29-linked ubiquitin chains assembled by the ubiquitin ligase (Ufd4p), resulting in branched ubiquitin chains. This reaction depends on the interaction of K29-linked ubiquitin chains with two N-terminal loops of Ufd2p. Only following the addition of K48-linked ubiquitin to substrates modified with K29-linked ubiquitin chains, can the substrates be escorted to the proteasome for degradation. We demonstrate that this ubiquitin chain linkage switching reaction is essential for ERAD,  and  pH resistance in yeast. Thus, our results suggest that Ufd2p functions by switching ubiquitin chain linkages to allow the degradation of proteins modified with a ubiquitin linkage, which is normally not targeted to the proteasome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27366756>Serotonin- and Dopamine-Related Gene Expression in db/db Mice Islets and in MIN6 β-Cells Treated with Palmitate and Oleate.</a></h2><p>High circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) concentration, often reported in , leads to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) through not yet well-defined mechanisms. Serotonin and dopamine might contribute to NEFA-dependent β-cell dysfunction, since extracellular signal of these monoamines decreases GSIS. Moreover, palmitate-treated β-cells may enhance the expression of the serotonin receptor Htr2c, affecting insulin secretion. Additionally, the expression of monoamine-oxidase type B (Maob) seems to be lower in islets from humans and mice with  compared to nondiabetic islets, which may lead to increased monoamine concentrations. We assessed the expression of serotonin- and dopamine-related genes in islets from db/db and wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, the effect of palmitate and oleate on the expression of such genes, 5HT content, and GSIS in MIN6 β-cell was determined. Lower Maob expression was found in islets from db/db versus WT mice and in MIN6 β-cells in response to palmitate and oleate treatment compared to vehicle. Reduced 5HT content and impaired GSIS in response to palmitate (-25%; p < 0.0001) and oleate (-43%; p < 0.0001) were detected in MIN6 β-cells. In conclusion, known defects of GSIS in islets from db/db mice and MIN6 β-cells treated with NEFAs are accompanied by reduced Maob expression and reduced 5HT content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26285069>Short-term Regulation of Resistin in vivo by Oral Lipid Ingestion and in vitro by Fatty  Stimulation.</a></h2><p>Dysbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome but their nutrition-dependent regulation in healthy individuals is poorly characterized. We investigated pro-inflammatory resistin and anti-inflammatory adiponectin regulation during oral lipid ingestion (OLI) in healthy adults. Response of resistin upon free fatty  (FFA) stimulation was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.100 healthy volunteers underwent OLI. Venous blood was drawn after 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours (h). Subjects were characterized by anthropometric and standard laboratory parameters. Serum concentrations of adiponectin and resistin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Adipocytes were stimulated with FFA and concentrations of adipokines were measured by ELISA.Irrespective of BMI and gender, OLI led to a significant reduction of resistin serum levels in a stepwise manner whereas adiponectin concentrations remained unchanged. There were positive correlations of resistin with waist/hip ratio and visfatin levels, as was calculated by regression analysis. Resistin concentrations were significantly higher in smokers when compared to non-smokers. Adiponectin concentrations were higher in females and in users of hormonal contraception. Adiponectin levels showed a positive correlation with heart rate and HDL cholesterol and a negative correlation with age, waist/hip-ratio, BMI, diastolic/systolic blood pressure, visfatin levels and LDL/HDL-ratio.

Fatty acids (FAs) have been discussed as exogenous secretagogues of insulin for decades, especially after the FA receptor GPR40 (G-protein-coupled receptor 40) was discovered. However, the role of FAs as endogenous signaling factors has not been investigated until now. In the present work, we demonstrate that lowering endogenous FA levels in β-cell medium by stringent washing or by the application of FA-free (FAF) BSA immediately reduced glucose-induced oscillations of cytosolic Ca ([Ca] oscillations) in MIN6 cells and mouse primary β-cells, as well as insulin secretion. Mass spectrometry confirmed BSA-mediated removal of FAs, with palmitic, stearic, , and elaidic  being the most abundant species. [Ca] oscillations in MIN6 cells recovered when BSA was replaced by buffer or as FA levels in the supernatant were restored. This was achieved by recombinant lipase-mediated FA liberation from membrane lipids, by the addition of FA-preloaded FAF-BSA, or by the photolysis of cell-impermeant caged FAs. Our combined data support the hypothesis of FAs as essential endogenous signaling factors for β-cell activity and insulin secretion.© 2018 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301276>Impact of Blood or Erythrocyte Membrane Fatty Acids for Disease Risk Prediction: Focusing on Cardiovascular Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are essential nutrients and main constituents of cell membranes that are involved in the signaling pathway and associated with health conditions. We investigated if blood or erythrocyte membrane FAs can predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and related complications. Omega-3 (-3) FAs are important predictors for metabolic syndrome, , CVD, and CKD risks, and the -3 index is also a good biomarker for sudden cardiac death in coronary artery disease.

Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty  (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732912>The proportion of total C18:1 trans-fatty acids in red blood cell membranes relates to carotid plaque prevalence.</a></h2><p>Consistent evidence supports the pro-atherogenic properties of dietary trans-fatty acids (TFAs). However, there are no clinical data on TFA intake and atheroma plaque. We cross sectionally investigated whether the proportion of total C18:1 TFA in red blood cells (RBCs), which mirrors dietary TFA intake, independently relates to carotid plaque prevalence in subjects with new-onset type 2  without prior cardiovascular disease (n=101, 56% men, mean age 61 years) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=96). RBC fatty  composition was determined by gas chromatography. Plaque (defined as carotid intima-media thickness ≥1.5 mm) was sonographically assessed at three bilateral carotid segments. In multivariate models adjusting for group ( or control) and classical cardiovascular risk factors, for each 0.1% increase in RBC total C18:1 TFA isomers, plaque prevalence increased by 53% (P=.002). In contrast, for each 0.1% increase in RBC alpha-linolenic , the vegetable omega-3 fatty , plaque prevalence decreased by 43% (P<.001). We conclude that the RBC membrane proportion of total C18:1 TFA, considered a proxy of intake, directly relates to the ultrasound feature that best predicts future cardiovascular events. Our findings support current recommendations to limit TFA intake for cardiovascular health promotion.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary fat triggers the synthesis of oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a regulatory fatty  that signals satiety to reduce food intake mainly by enhancing neural PPARα activity, in enterocytes. We explored OEA's roles in the assembly of lipoproteins in WT and   mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes, Caco-2 cells, and human liver-derived cells. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, OEA increased synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion in chylomicrons, and MTP expression in a dose-dependent manner. OEA also increased MTP activity and triacylglycerol secretion in WT and knockout primary enterocytes. In contrast to its intestinal cell effects, OEA reduced synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion, and MTP expression and activity in human hepatoma Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Also, OEA reduced MTP expression and triacylglycerol secretion in WT, but not knockout, primary hepatocytes. These studies indicate differential effects of OEA on lipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly: in enterocytes, OEA augments glycerolipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly independent of PPARα. Conversely, in hepatocytes, OEA reduces MTP expression, glycerolipid synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion through PPARα-dependent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031723>Inhibition of cholinergic potentiation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets by chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids: Protection by casein kinase 2 inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Chronic hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are characteristic features of type 2  (T2DM) that are thought to cause or contribute to β-cell dysfunction by "glucolipotoxicity." Previously we have shown that acute treatment of pancreatic islets with fatty acids (FA) decreases acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion. This acetylcholine response is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, which play a key role in regulating β-cell function. Here we examine whether chronic FA exposure also inhibits acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion using mouse and human islets.Islets were cultured for 3 or 4 days at different glucose concentration with 0.5 mM palmitic  (PA) or a 2:1 mixture of PA and  (OA) at 1% albumin (PA/BSA molar ratio 3.3). Afterwards, the response to glucose and acetylcholine were studied in perifusion experiments.FA-induced impairment of insulin secretion and Ca signaling depended strongly on the glucose concentrations of the culture medium. PA and OA in combination reduced acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion more than PA alone, both in mouse and human islets, with no evidence of a protective role of OA. In contrast, lipotoxicity was not observed with islets cultured for 3 days in medium containing less than 1 mM glucose and a mixture of glutamine and leucine (7 mM each). High glucose and FAs reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca storage capacity; however, preserving ER Ca by blocking the IP3 receptor with xestospongin C did not protect islets from glucolipotoxic effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, an inhibitor of casein kinase 2 (CK2) protected the glucose dependent acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion in mouse and human islets against glucolipotoxicity.These results show that chronic FA treatment decreases acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion and that this effect is strictly glucose dependent and might involve CK2 phosphorylation of β-cell M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to examine the association between body composition, dietary intake and detection thresholds of four fatty stimuli (, paraffin oil, canola oil, and canola oil spiked with ) that could be perceived via gustatory and/or textural cues. In 30 participants, fat detection thresholds were determined in a repeated measurements design over twelve days. Weight status was examined by measuring the participants' BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. The habitual food intake was assessed via several questionnaires and twelve, non-consecutive 24-hour food diaries. In this study, a negative correlation was found between fat detection thresholds and the intake of food rich in vitamins and fibre. Moreover, a positive correlation was identified between the intake of high-fat food and fat detection thresholds. No differences in fat detection thresholds were observed due to variations in BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. These findings indicate that a regular intake of fatty foods might decrease an individuals' perceptual response to fats which might lead to excess fat intake on the long term.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE.

The hormone transforms all palmitic saturated fatty  endogenously synthesized from glucose into specific for animal cells rn-9 C18:1  mono unsaturated fatty . The endogenous mono unsaturated fatty  is oxidized by mitohondria with the highest constant of reaction velocity gaining for cells optimal quantity of biotransforming energy in the form of ATP. The insulin expresses in hepatocytes synthesis of  triglycerides and formation of  lipoproteins of very low density that only insulin-dependent cells absorb using apoE/B-100-endocytosis.

The insulin substitutes in vivo ineffective palmitic alternative of metabolism of fatty acids for potentially more effective  metabolism of fatty acids. The insulin increases unsaturation of fatty acids and number of double binds in them.

The present study was performed to test whether food intake is regulated by circulating FFAs in an oleate-specific manner. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of olive, safflower, or coconut oil (100mg/h), together with heparin, to raise circulating oleate, linoleate, or palmitate, respectively, and their effects on overnight food intake were evaluated. Compared to other oils, olive oil infusion showed a significantly greater effect to reduce food intake (P<0.01). Total caloric intake, the sum of the calories from the diet and infused oil, was significantly reduced with olive oil (P<0.01) but not with coconut or safflower oil infusion, suggesting an oleate-specific effect on caloric intake. To further test this idea, different groups of rats received an intravenous infusion of oleate, linoleate, or octanoate (0.5mg/h). Oleate infusion decreased overnight food intake by 26% (P<0.001), but no significant effect was seen with linoleate, octanoate, or vehicle infusion (P>0.05). The effects of olive oil or oleate infusion could not be explained by changes in plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, or total FFA levels. The olive oil effect on food intake was not reduced in vagotomized rats, suggesting that oleate sensing may not involve peripheral sensors. In contrast, olive oil's effect was attenuated in high-fat-fed rats, suggesting that this effect is regulated (or impaired) under physiological (or pathological) conditions. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that circulating oleate is sensed by the brain differentially from other FFAs to control feeding in rats.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Conventional methods, however, have limited ability to provide quantitative information on individual LDs and have limited capability for three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of LDs in live cells especially for fast acquisition of 3-D dynamics. Here, we present an optical method based on 3-D quantitative phase imaging to measure the 3-D structural distribution and biochemical parameters (concentration and dry mass) of individual LDs in live cells without using exogenous labelling agents. The biochemical change of LDs under  treatment was quantitatively investigated, and 4-D tracking of the fast dynamics of LDs revealed the intracellular transport of LDs in live cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29042678>Carnosine scavenging of glucolipotoxic free radicals enhances insulin secretion and glucose uptake.</a></h2><p>The worldwide prevalence of  has risen to 8.5% among adults, which represents a staggering rise in prevalence from 4.7% in 1980. Whilst some treatments work by increasing insulin secretion, over time their effectiveness decreases. We aim to increase insulin secretion by developing strategies that work through mechanisms independent of current treatment options. Isolated CD1 mouse islets, INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, or C2C12 mouse myotubes were incubated in standard tissue culture media, or media supplemented with 28 mM glucose, 200 μM palmitic , and 200 μM  as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Intracellular reactive species content was assayed using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate dye, inducible nitric oxide synthase levels determined by Western blot, 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydrpxnonenal both assayed by ELISA, insulin secretion quantified using ELISA or radioimmunoassay, and glucose uptake determined through 2-deoxy glucose 6 phosphate luminescence. Our data indicate that carnosine, a histidine containing dipeptide available through the diet, is an effective scavenger of each of the aforementioned reactive species. This results in doubling of insulin secretion from isolated mouse islets or INS-1 β-cells. Crucially, carnosine also reverses glucolipotoxic inhibition of insulin secretion and enhances glucose uptake into skeletal muscle cells. Thus, carnosine, or non-hydrolysable carnosine analogs, may represent a new class of therapeutic agent to fight type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26742067>High Fat Diet Administration during Specific Periods of Pregnancy Alters Maternal Fatty  Profiles in the Near-Term Rat.</a></h2><p>Excessive fat intake is a global health concern as women of childbearing age increasingly ingest high fat diets (HFDs). We therefore determined the maternal fatty  (FA) profiles in metabolic organs after HFD administration during specific periods of gestation. Rats were fed a HFD for the first (HF1), second (HF2), or third (HF3) week, or for all three weeks (HFG) of gestation. Total maternal plasma non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) concentrations were monitored throughout pregnancy. At day 20 of gestation, maternal plasma, liver, adipose tissue, and placenta FA profiles were determined. In HF3 mothers, plasma myristic and stearic  concentrations were elevated, whereas docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was reduced in both HF3 and HFG mothers. In HF3 and HFG mothers, hepatic stearic and  proportions were elevated; conversely, DHA and linoleic  (LA) proportions were reduced. In adipose tissue, myristic  was elevated, whereas DHA and LA proportions were reduced in all mothers. Further, adipose tissue stearic  proportions were elevated in HF2, HF3, and HFG mothers; with  increased in HF1 and HFG mothers. In HF3 and HFG mothers, placental neutral myristic  proportions were elevated, whereas DHA was reduced. Further, placental phospholipid DHA proportions were reduced in HF3 and HFG mothers. Maintenance on a diet, high in saturated fat, but low in DHA and LA proportions, during late or throughout gestation, perpetuated reduced DHA across metabolic organs that adapt during pregnancy. Therefore a diet, with normal DHA proportions during gestation, may be important for balancing maternal FA status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378038>Cashew Nut Consumption Increases HDL Cholesterol and Reduces Systolic Blood Pressure in Asian Indians with Type 2 : A 12-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>There is increasing evidence that nut consumption decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there are few data on the health effects of cashew nuts among adults with type 2  (T2DM).The study aimed to investigate the effects of cashew nut supplementation on glycemia, body weight, blood pressure, and lipid profile in Asian Indians with T2DM.In a parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial, 300 adults with T2DM [mean ± SD age: 51 ± 9.3 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 26.0 ± 3.4; 55% male] were randomly assigned to receive advice to follow a standard diabetic diet (control) or similar advice plus 30 g cashew nuts/d (intervention) for 12 wk. The macronutrient composition of the prescribed diabetic diet was 60-65% energy from carbohydrates, 15-25% from fat, and the rest from protein. Differences between groups in changes in anthropometric and biochemical variables were analyzed using linear models with robust variance estimation under an assumed independence working correlation.Participants in the intervention group had a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 wk than did controls (-4.9 ± 13.7 compared with -1.7 ± 11.6 mm Hg; P = 0.04) and a greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol compared with controls (+1.7 ± 5.6 compared with +0.1 ± 4.6 mg/dL; P = 0.01). There were no differences between the groups with respect to changes in body weight, BMI, blood lipid, and glycemic variables. Plasma  concentrations and self-reported dietary intake of nuts, , and monounsaturated fatty acids suggested excellent compliance with the nut consumption.Cashew nut supplementation in Asian Indians with T2DM reduced systolic blood pressure and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations with no deleterious effects on body weight, glycemia, or other lipid variables.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

However, lipotoxicity is indicated in GLP-1 secreting cells following long-term exposure to elevated levels of saturated FAs (SFAs) in vivo and in vitro, where in vitro studies indicate that cosupplementation with MUFAs confers lipoprotection. SFAs and MUFAs differentially affect the fate of cells in ways that depend on the cell type, concentration and ratio of the FAs. The present study was designed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of SFAs/MUFAs on GLP-1-producing cells in terms of lipotoxicity/lipoprotection and GLP-1 secretion.Cultured GLP-1 secreting cells were exposed to hyperlipidemia simulated by SFA-albumin complexes where the molar ratio was 2:1. The cellular response to simulated hyperlipidemia was assessed in the presence/absence of MUFA cosupplementation by determining intracellular ceramide, ROS, neutral lipid accumulation, and cellular respiration. The role for cellular respiration in GLP-1 secretion in response to SFAs/MUFAs was assessed.Generation of intracellular ceramide mediate a detrimental increased in ROS production following long term exposure to SFAs in GLP-1-secreting cells. Cosupplementation with MUFAs increases cellular respiration, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of ceramide kinase, while reducing ceramide synthesis and attenuating ROS production, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Further, acute secretory effects of unsaturated FAs are independent of FAO, but mediated by a FFAR1 induced increase in cellular respiration.This study demonstrates novel data supporting effects of MUFAs on the ceramide biosynthetic pathway, triglyceride storage respiration and secretion in GLP-1 secreting cells. These findings may be of value for nutritional interventions, as well as for identification of novel targets, to help preserve L-cell mass and potentiate GLP-1 secretion in diabesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The increase of intracellular Ca triggers insulin granule release, therefore several mechanisms regulate Ca efflux within the β-cells, among others, the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA). In this work, we describe that lipotoxicity mediated mainly by the saturated palmitic  (PA) (16C) is associated with loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and potentially cell viability, a phenomenon that was induced to a lesser extent by stearic (18C), myristic (14C) and lauric (12C) acids. PA was localized on endoplasmic reticulum, activating arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as also promoted by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxins. In particular, our findings demonstrate an alteration in PMCA1/4 expression caused by PA and LPS which trigger the UPR, affecting not only insulin release and contributing to β-cell mass reduction, but also increasing reactive nitrogen species. Nonetheless, stearic  (SA) did not show these effects. Remarkably, the proteolytic degradation of PMCA1/4 prompted by PA and LPS was avoided by the action of monounsaturated fatty acids such as  and palmitoleic .  recovered cell viability after treatment with PA/LPS and, more interestingly, relieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. While palmitoleic  improved the insulin release, this fatty  seems to have more relevant effects upon the expression of regulatory pumps of intracellular Ca. Therefore, chain length and unsaturation of fatty acids are determinant cues in proteostasis of β-cells and, consequently, on the regulation of calcium and insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528831>Activation of AMPK Stimulates Neurotensin Secretion in Neuroendocrine Cells.</a></h2><p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical fuel-sensing enzyme, regulates the metabolic effects of various hormones. Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino  peptide predominantly localized in enteroendocrine cells of the small bowel and released by fat ingestion. Increased fasting plasma levels of pro-NT (a stable NT precursor fragment produced in equimolar amounts relative to NT) are associated with an increased risk of , cardiovascular disease, and mortality; however, the mechanisms regulating NT release are not fully defined. We previously reported that inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) increases NT secretion and gene expression through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Here, we show that activation of AMPK increases NT secretion from endocrine cell lines (BON and QGP-1) and isolated mouse crypt cells enriched for NT-positive cells. In addition, plasma levels of NT increase in mice treated with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside, a pharmacologic AMPK activator. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα decrease, whereas overexpression of the subunit significantly enhances, NT secretion from BON cells treated with AMPK activators or . Similarly, small interfering RNA knockdown of the upstream AMPK kinases, liver kinase B1 and Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, also attenuate NT release and AMPK phosphorylation. Moreover, AMPK activation increases NT secretion through inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Together, our findings show that AMPK activation enhances NT release through inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, thus demonstrating an important cross talk regulation for NT secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710138>Disruption of Lipid Uptake in Astroglia Exacerbates Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>Neuronal circuits in the brain help to control feeding behavior and systemic metabolism in response to afferent nutrient and hormonal signals. Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate energy homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by , whereas it is decreased in response to palmitic  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated body weight gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic insulin resistance. We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution, body weight regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419827>Antihyperglycemic, antioxidant activities of tucumã oil (Astrocaryum vulgare) in alloxan-induced diabetic mice, and identification of fatty  profile by gas chromatograph: New natural source to treat hyperglycemia.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the oral administration of tucumã oil (Astrocaryum vulgare) on glucose and insulin levels, oxidative status, and pancreatic genotoxic parameters of alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The animals were divided into four groups (n = 6 each): control/water; control/tucumã oil; diabetic/water; diabetic/tucumã oil treated for 14 days with 5.0 mL kg via oral gavage. Gas chromatograph characterization demonstrated that /elaidic fatty  is the most abundant component present in this oil, followed by palmitic and stearic fatty acids. Our results demonstrated an increase (p < 0.05) in water and food intake, blood glucose, thiobarbituric  reactive species (TBARS) levels, damage index, and frequency of damage; conversely body weight, insulin levels, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and cell viability were decreased in the diabetic/water group compared to the control/water group. The treatment with tucumã oil prevented these alterations in the diabetic/tucumã oil group compared to the diabetic/water group, and restored these parameters near to the control/water group. In summary, our findings demonstrated that treatment with tucumã oil causes a hypoglycemic effect improving insulin levels and antioxidant/oxidant status, and has a protector effect against pancreatic damage induced by oxidative stress in alloxan-induced diabetic mice.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Plin2 is an abundant LD coating protein in skeletal muscle, but its importance for muscle function is unclear. We show that myotubes established from  mice contain reduced content of LDs and accumulate less  (OA) in triacylglycerol (TAG) due to elevated LD hydrolysis in comparison with  myotubes. The reduced ability to store TAG in LDs in  myotubes is accompanied by a shift in energy metabolism.  myotubes are characterized by increased oxidation of OA, lower glycogen synthesis, and reduced glucose oxidation in comparison with  myotubes, perhaps reflecting competition between FAs and glucose as part of the Randle cycle. In accord with these metabolic changes,  myotubes have elevated expression of  and , transcription factors that stimulate expression of genes important for FA oxidation, whereas genes involved in glucose uptake and oxidation are suppressed. Loss of  had no impact on insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation.

This crucial function in oxidative tissues is altered in obesity and type 2 . Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is a LD protein whose mechanistic and causal link with lipotoxicity and insulin resistance has raised controversies. We investigated here the physiological role of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle upon various metabolic challenges. We show that PLIN5 protein is elevated in endurance-trained (ET) subjects and correlates with muscle oxidative capacity and whole-body insulin sensitivity. When overexpressed in human skeletal muscle cells to recapitulate the ET phenotype, PLIN5 diminishes lipolysis and FA oxidation under basal condition, but paradoxically enhances FA oxidation during forskolin- and contraction- mediated lipolysis. Moreover, PLIN5 partly protects muscle cells against lipid-induced lipotoxicity. In addition, we demonstrate that down-regulation of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle inhibits insulin-mediated glucose uptake under normal chow feeding condition, while paradoxically improving insulin sensitivity upon high-fat feeding. These data highlight a key role of PLIN5 in LD function, first by finely adjusting LD FA supply to mitochondrial oxidation, and second acting as a protective factor against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143381>[The profile of plasma non-esterified fatty acids in children with different terms of type 1 ].</a></h2><p>Composition and quantitative content of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were investigated in plasma samples of healthy children (12) and children with type 1  (DM1) (31) by gas chromatography (GC) after preliminary NEFA solid-phase extraction from plasma lipids.

The effects of fatty acids on myocellular protein balance remain controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the direct effects of a mixed-species fatty  environment on myocellular protein synthesis and degradation.C2C12 myotubes were cultured in media containing equimolar (250 μM) palmitic  and oleate (PO) or bovine serum albumin control for ≤72 h. Myocellular protein balance was determined via incorporation (synthesis) or release (degradation) of H-tyrosine after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. Expression of major proteolytic genes was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.PO significantly increased myocellular protein content at 24, 48, and 72 h. Basal myocellular protein synthesis was unchanged by PO. However, PO significantly decreased basal rate of protein degradation at 24 h and this effect persisted throughout 72 h of treatment. Expression of the proteolytic genes Atrogin-1 (MAFbx), MuRF-1, LC3, and ATG4 B, was reduced during the 72 h PO.A mixed-species fatty  environment increases myocellular protein content by decreasing the rate of protein degradation, which may be regulated at the level of gene transcription.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
