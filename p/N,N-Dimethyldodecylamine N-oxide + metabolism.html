Properties and function of proteins are strongly influenced by the interaction with the ultrasonic waves and their bioactivity can be lost because of alteration of protein structure. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge no study was carried out on Integral Membrane Proteins (IMPs), which are responsible for a variety of fundamental biological functions. In this work, the photosynthetic Reaction Center (RC) of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has been used as a model for the study of the ultrasound-induced IMP denaturation. Purified RCs were suspended in i) detergent micelles, in ii) detergent-free buffer and iii) reconstituted in liposomes, and then treated with ultrasound at 30W and 20kHz at increasing times. The optical absorption spectra showed a progressive and irreversible denaturation in all cases, resulting from the perturbation of the protein scaffold structure, as confirmed by circular dichroism spectra that showed progressive alterations of the RC secondary structure. Charge recombination kinetics were studied to assess the protein photoactivity. The lifetime for the loss of RC photoactivity was 32min in detergent micelles, ranged from 3.8 to 6.5min in the different proteoliposomes formulations, and 5.5min in detergent-free buffer. Atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of large RC aggregates related to the sonication-induced denaturation, in agreement with the scattering increase observed in solution.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Structural and functional characterization of membrane proteins generally requires that they be extracted from the native lipid bilayer and solubilized with a small synthetic amphiphile, for example, a detergent. We describe the development of a small molecule with a distinctive amphiphilic architecture, a "tripod amphiphile," that solubilizes both bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and bovine rhodopsin (Rho). The polar portion of this amphiphile contains an amide and an amine-oxide; small variations in this polar segment are found to have profound effects on protein solubilization properties. The optimal tripod amphiphile extracts both BR and Rho from the native membrane environments and maintains each protein in a monomeric native-like form for several weeks after delipidation. Tripod amphiphiles are designed to display greater conformational rigidity than conventional detergents, with the long-range goal of promoting membrane protein crystallization. The results reported here represent an important step toward that ultimate goal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16707672>Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by thermoalkaliphilic F1Fo-ATP synthase is controlled by the C terminus of the epsilon subunit.</a></h2><p>The F(1)F(o)-ATP synthases of alkaliphilic bacteria exhibit latent ATPase activity, and for the thermoalkaliphile Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1, this activity is intrinsic to the F(1) moiety. To study the mechanism of ATPase inhibition, we developed a heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli to produce TA2F(1) complexes from this thermoalkaliphile. Like the native F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase, the recombinant TA2F(1) was blocked in ATP hydrolysis activity, and this activity was stimulated by the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide. To determine if the C-terminal domain of the epsilon subunit acts as an inhibitor of ATPase activity and if an electrostatic interaction plays a role, a TA2F(1) mutant with either a truncated epsilon subunit [i.e., TA2F(1)(epsilon(DeltaC))] or substitution of basic residues in the second alpha-helix of epsilon with nonpolar alanines [i.e., TA2F(1)(epsilon(6A))] was constructed. Both mutants showed ATP hydrolysis activity at low and high concentrations of ATP. Treatment of the purified F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase and TA2F(1)(epsilon(WT)) complex with proteases revealed that the epsilon subunit was resistant to proteolytic digestion. In contrast, the epsilon subunit of TA2F(1)(epsilon(6A)) was completely degraded by trypsin, indicating that the C-terminal arm was in a conformation where it was no longer protected from proteolytic digestion. In addition, ATPase activity was not further activated by protease treatment when compared to the untreated control, supporting the observation that epsilon was responsible for inhibition of ATPase activity. To study the effect of the alanine substitutions in the epsilon subunit in the entire holoenzyme, we reconstituted recombinant TA2F(1) complexes with F(1)-stripped native membranes of strain TA2.A1. The reconstituted TA2F(o)F(1)(epsilon(WT)) was blocked in ATP hydrolysis and exhibited low levels of ATP-driven proton pumping consistent with the F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase in native membranes. Reconstituted TA2F(o)F(1)(epsilon(6A)) exhibited ATPase activity that correlated with increased ATP-driven proton pumping, confirming that the epsilon subunit also inhibits ATPase activity of TA2F(o)F(1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6407476>A requirement for Ca2+ in the extraction of O2-evolving Photosystem 2 preparations from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans.</a></h2><p>Ca2+ has been shown to be essential for the retention of maximal O2-evolving activity in Photosystem 2 particles extracted by using  from Anacystis nidulans thylakoids. The effect cannot entirely be mimicked by using Mg2+. Ca2+ stimulates electron transport from diphenylcarbazide to 2,6-dichloroindophenol catalysed by lead-inhibited cation-free preparations, showing the presence of two cation-binding sites in these particles. Photosystem 2 preparations extracted in Ca2+-containing buffer show the presence of three polypeptides at mol. wt. 30000, 33000 and 36000, which are absent or much decreased in preparations extracted in Mg2+-containing buffer.

They play essential roles in cell signaling and the regulation of cellular shape, motility, and the cell cycle. Here, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic (TMC) domains of integrin α1 and β1 were over-expressed and purified in detergent micelles. The structure and backbone relaxations of α1-TMC in LDAO micelles were determined and analyzed using solution NMR. A long helix, extending from the transmembrane region to the cytoplasmic tail, was observed in α1-TMC. Structural comparisons of α1-TMC with reported αIIb-TMC domains indicated different conformations in the transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic tails. An NMR titration experiment indicated weak interactions between α1-TMC and β1-TMC through several α1-TMC residues located at its N-terminal juxta-transmembrane region and C-terminal extended helix region.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8852578>A column centrifugation method for the reconstitution in liposomes of the mitochondrial F0F1 ATP synthase/ATPase.</a></h2><p>A method for reconstitution of membrane proteins into unilamellar liposomes is described. The model enzyme was the F0F1 ATP synthase from mitochondria when in complex or free from its inhibitor protein. The enzymes were first solubilized with either of two detergents, i.e., n-dodecyl-beta-D maltoside or lauryldimethylamine oxide. After solubilization, the enzymes were passed through a column of Sepharose-AH using an ADP/sodium cholate selective elution buffer. The enzymes recovered from the column were subsequently passed through a centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 fine. The eluate contained liposomes in which the F0F1 complex (with and without inhibitor protein) had been reconstituted. The reconstituted enzymes were capable of hydrolyzing ATP with formation of electrochemical H+ gradients. They also catalyzed the ATP-Pi exchange reactions. Thus the F0F1 complex which is formed by 18 subunits can be rapidly reconstituted into liposomes in a fully functional state. Moreover the data show that the interactions between the enzyme and its inhibitor protein are not perturbed in the reconstitution procedure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12414800>Resolution of the V1 ATPase from Manduca sexta into subcomplexes and visualization of an ATPase-active A3B3EG complex by electron microscopy.</a></h2><p>The effect of the ATPase activity of Manduca sexta V(1) ATPase by the amphipathic detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) and the relationship of these activities to the subunit composition of V(1) were studied. The V(1) was highly activated in the presence of 0.04-0.06% LDAO combined with release of the subunits H, C, and F from the enzyme. Increase of LDAO concentration to 0.1-0.2% caused the characterized subcomplexes A(3)B(3)HEGF and A(3)B(3)EG with a remaining ATPase activity of 52 and 65%, respectively. The hydrolytic-active A(3)B(3)EG subcomplex has been visualized by electron microscopy showing six major masses of density in a pseudo-hexagonal arrangement surrounding a seventh mass. The compositions of the various subcomplexes and fragments of V(1) provide an organization of the subunits in the enzyme in the framework of the known three-dimensional reconstruction of the V(1) ATPase from M. sexta (Radermacher, M., Ruiz, T., Wieczorek, H., and Grüber, G.

The C12G2 itself does not adsorb significantly on silica at any concentration. DDAO on the other hand readily adsorbs in a bilayer-like structure at concentrations approaching the critical micelle concentration (cmc), but the adsorbed amount at the concentrations it has been applied in these mixtures is small. In contrast, by combination of the two surfactants, significant adsorption is observed at concentrations where the adsorption of the pure DDAO, as well as pure C12G2, is very low. We thus see a strong enhancement of the adsorption from the mixed system. The adsorption is suggested to be a two-step process, where individual DDAO molecules first adsorb to the silica surface through electrostatic interactions, and then C12G2 adsorbs at the hydrophobic sites the DDAO tails constitute through hydrophobic bonding. A minimum concentration of DDAO is required to induce adsorption from a solution with constant C12G2 concentration. This concentration is lower for C12G2 solutions below and equal to cmcC12G2 than above cmcC12G2. In addition, the total adsorbed amount shows a maximum around cmcC12G2 of the mixture for a solution with low DDAO contents. Both these effects are explained by incorporation of DDAO in the mixed micelles above cmc(mix), which leads to a desorption of DDAO from the surface.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10852722>Resolution of the membrane domain of bovine complex I into subcomplexes: implications for the structural organization of the enzyme.</a></h2><p>Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) purified from bovine heart mitochondria was treated with the detergent  (LDAO). The enzyme dissociated into two known subcomplexes, Ialpha and Ibeta, containing mostly hydrophilic and hydrophobic subunits, and a previously undetected fragment referred to as Igamma. Subcomplex Igamma contains the hydrophobic subunits ND1, ND2, ND3, and ND4L which are encoded in the mitochondrial genome, and the nuclear-encoded subunit KFYI. During size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of LDAO, subcomplex Ialpha lost several subunits and formed another characterized subcomplex known as Ilambda. Similarly, subcomplex Ibeta dissociated into two smaller subcomplexes, one of which contains the hydrophobic subunits ND4 and ND5; subcomplex Igamma released a fragment containing ND1 and ND2. These results suggest that in the intact complex subunits ND1 and ND2 are likely to be in a different region of the membrane domain than subunits ND4 and ND5. The compositions of the various subcomplexes and fragments of complex I provide an organization of the subunits of the enzyme in the framework of the known low resolution structure of the enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15502342>Crystallization of a proteolyzed form of the horse pancreatic lipase-related protein 2: structural basis for the specific detergent requirement.</a></h2><p>Horse pancreatic lipase-related proteins PLRP1 and PLRP2 are produced by the pancreas together with pancreatic lipase (PL). Sequence-comparison analyses reveal that the three proteins possess the same two-domain organization: an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain, which in PL is involved in colipase binding. Nevertheless, despite the high level of sequence identity found, they exhibit distinct enzymatic properties. The intrinsic sensitivity of the peptide bond between Ser245 and Thr246 within the flap region of PLRP2 to proteolytic cleavage probably complicates PLRP2 crystallization since, as shown here, this proteolyzed form of PLRP2 is only crystallized after specific detergent stabilization of this region. This has been performed by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 291 K and exclusively in the presence of N,N-dimethyldecylamine-beta-oxide (DDAO). However, most crystals (>95%) are highly twinned and diffract poorly (to approximately 7-5 A resolution). Diffraction-quality trigonal crystals have unit-cell parameters a = b = 128.4, c = 85.8 A and belong to space group P3(2)21. A 2.9 A native data set was collected at ESRF on beamline ID14-2 with an R(merge) of 12.7%.

Of these, the delta subunit has received very little attention in the study of F1 preparations from eukaryotic cells. Although recently shown to associate tightly with the beta subunit [Pedersen, P. L., Hullihen, J., Bianchet, M., Amzel, L. M., and Lebowitz, M. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1775-1784], the delta subunit is not resolved in the X-ray structure of either the rat liver or bovine heart enzyme. For these reasons, the novel studies reported here were designed both to provide a molecular description of the rat liver delta subunit and to gain insight into the nature of its interaction with F1. The rat liver delta subunit was cloned from a lambda gt11 library, sequenced, overexpressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) in fusion with the maltose binding protein, and, after cleavage of the latter protein, purified to homogeneity. The purified delta subunit (MW = 14.7 kDa) was shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy to be highly structured and to exhibit about 25% sequence identity to the chloroplast and E. coli epsilon subunits, frequently regarded as homologues of higher eukaryotic delta subunits. Significantly, and in contrast to the chloroplast and E. coli epsilon subunits, which are readily removed from their parent F1 moieties after treatment respectively with ethanol and lauryldimethylamine oxide, the rat liver delta subunit remained tightly bound to F1 under these relatively mild conditions. For the above reasons, four types of experiments were carried out on rat liver F1 in order to (1) determine the accessibility of the delta subunit to both specific antibodies and to proteases, (2) establish the effect of nucleotides on this subunit's accessibility, (3) identify in cross-linking studies with disuccinimidyl glutarate this subunit's most reactive neighbor, and (4) determine whether this subunit can be dissociated from F1 by using ionic detergents while leaving the remaining complex intact. The data derived from this detailed set of studies (a) supports the view that the rat liver F1-delta subunit is in very close proximity to the gamma subunit near the bottom of the F1 molecule but does not penetrate deeply into the central core, (b) shows that within F1 the delta subunit's N-terminus is exposed while its C-terminus is masked, (c) indicates that access to the delta subunit is shielded in part by the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits and changes during the catalytic cycle of F1, and (d) implicates the delta subunit as important for the structural stability of the F1 unit. These novel findings on a higher eukaryotic F1-delta subunit are discussed in relationship to earlier studies on the related epsilon subunits from both chloroplasts and E. coli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23685111>Mutational control of bioenergetics of bacterial reaction center probed by delayed fluorescence.</a></h2><p>The free energy gap between the metastable charge separated state P(+)QA(-) and the excited bacteriochlorophyll dimer P* was measured by delayed fluorescence of the dimer in mutant reaction center proteins of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The mutations were engineered both at the donor (L131L, M160L, M197F and M202H) and acceptor (M265I and M234E) sides. While the donor side mutations changed systematically the number of H-bonds to P, the acceptor side mutations modified the energetics of QA by altering the van-der-Waals and electronic interactions (M265IT) and H-bond network to the acidic cluster around QB (M234EH, M234EL, M234EA and M234ER). All mutants decreased the free energy gap of the wild type RC (~890meV), i.e. destabilized the P(+)QA(-) charge pair by 60-110meV at pH8. Multiple modifications in the hydrogen bonding pattern to P resulted in systematic changes of the free energy gap. The destabilization showed no pH-dependence (M234 mutants) or slight increase (WT, donor-side mutants and M265IT above pH8) with average slope of 10-15meV/pH unit over the 6-10.5pH range. In wild type and donor-side mutants, the free energy change of the charge separation consisted of mainly enthalpic term but the acceptor side mutants showed increased entropic (even above that of enthalpic) contributions. This could include softening the structure of the iron ligand (M234EH) and the QA binding pocket (M265IT) and/or increase of the multiplicity of the electron transfer of charge separation in the acceptor side upon mutation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In both of the two systems investigated, the complexation process reaches a maximum for a value of the surfactant to DNA phosphate groups molar ratio of about X = 1. Below this critical concentration, the coil and the globule state coexist in the solution, as clearly shown by the bimodal size distribution obtained from the light scattering intensity correlation functions. Some suggestions are given to support a molecular mechanism responsible for the complex formation, both in the case of a cationic surfactant (CTAB) and of a pH-dependent neutral or cationic amphiphile (DDAO), where the hydrophobic interactions play an important role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2872219>Mitochondrial H+-ATPase activation by an amine oxide detergent.</a></h2><p>Lauryl dimethylamine oxide activates ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial H+-ATPase. Activation is observed in systems with a high content of inhibitor protein as described by Pullman and Monroy (Pullman, M.E., and Monroy, G.C. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 3762-3769), i.e. Mg-ATP submitochondrial particles and a Triton X-100-solubilized H+-ATPase from the same particles. Detergent activation of ATP hydrolysis is also present in inhibitor-reconstituted systems, i.e. submitochondrial particles, Triton extracts, and soluble F1-ATPase. In submitochondrial particles depleted of inhibitor protein, lauryl dimethylamine oxide induced a biphasic response which is characterized by a drop-in activity induced by relatively low concentrations of LDAO; at higher concentrations the detergent activates to an extent never greater than the initial activity. In inhibitor protein-depleted oligomycin-sensitive Triton extracts, lauryl dimethylamine oxide stimulates ATP hydrolysis to very high values (30 mumol min-1 mg-1). These findings suggest that in addition to the inhibitor protein ATP hydrolysis is controlled by other subunit interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10995251>Catalytic control and coupling efficiency of the Escherichia coli FoF1 ATP synthase: influence of the Fo sector and epsilon subunit on the catalytic transition state.</a></h2><p>The rate-limiting transition state of steady-state ATP hydrolysis and synthesis reactions in the F(o)F(1) ATP synthase involves the rotation of the gamma, epsilon, and c subunits. To probe the role of the transport and coupling mechanisms in controlling catalysis, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of ATP hydrolysis were determined for enzymes in the presence of the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO), which uncouples active transport and disables the inhibitory effect of the epsilon subunit. At 5 mM LDAO or greater, the inhibitory effects of epsilon subunit are abrogated in both purified F(1) and membranous F(o)F(1). In these conditions, LDAO solubilized F(o)F(1) has a higher k(cat) for ATP hydrolysis than F(1). These results indicate an influence of F(o) on F(1) even though catalysis is uncoupled from transport. The alpha(3)beta(3)gamma complex free of the epsilon subunit is activated at a lower concentration of 0.5 mM LDAO. Significantly, the gammaY205C mutant enzyme is similarly activated at 0.5 mM LDAO, suggesting that the mutant enzyme lacks epsilon inhibition. The gammaY205C F(o)F(1), which has a k(cat) for ATP hydrolysis 2-fold higher than wild type, has an ATP synthesis rate 3-fold lower than wild type, showing that coupling is inefficient. Arrhenius and isokinetic analyses indicate that enzymes that are free of epsilon subunit inhibition have a different transition-state structure from those under the influence of the epsilon subunit. We propose that the epsilon subunit is one of the factors that determines the proper transition-state structure, which is essential for efficient coupling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2140947>Activation of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase by lauryldimethylamine oxide and ethylene glycol: relationship of ATPase activity to the interaction of the epsilon and beta subunits.</a></h2><p>The stimulation of the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase by the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) and the relationship of this activation to removal of the inhibitory epsilon subunit were studied. The detergent caused a dramatic decrease in the affinity of epsilon-depleted enzyme for epsilon subunit, suggesting that release of epsilon is involved in LDAO activation. However, even in the absence of any epsilon subunit, the detergent caused a 140% increase in activity, indicating activation by effects independent of epsilon. In contrast, the addition of 30% ethylene glycol to the reaction buffer caused a modest inhibition of the ATPase activity of epsilon-depleted F1-ATPase but rendered the enzyme insensitive to inhibition by epsilon subunit. This solvent prevented the cross-linking of epsilon to beta by a water-soluble carbodiimide, although epsilon remained linkable to both beta and gamma by dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). Thus, epsilon was not dissociated from F1-ATPase, but its intimate interaction with the beta subunit was altered. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of epsilon is expressed through its interaction with beta. Kinetic analysis revealed that LDAO activated hydrolysis at both the high- and low-affinity promotional sites, with little change in Km values. Ethylene glycol caused a substantial increase in Km at the low-affinity promotional site and made the enzyme resistant to inhibition by aurovertin D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21953468>Transmembrane gate movements in the type II ATP-binding cassette (ABC) importer BtuCD-F during nucleotide cycle.</a></h2><p>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are ubiquitous integral membrane proteins that translocate substrates across cell membranes. The alternating access of their transmembrane domains to opposite sides of the membrane powered by the closure and reopening of the nucleotide binding domains is proposed to drive the translocation events. Despite clear structural similarities, evidence for considerable mechanistic diversity starts to accumulate within the importers subfamily. We present here a detailed study of the gating mechanism of a type II ABC importer, the BtuCD-F vitamin B(12) importer from Escherichia coli, elucidated by EPR spectroscopy. Distance changes at key positions in the translocation gates in the nucleotide-free, ATP- and ADP-bound conformations of the transporter were measured in detergent micelles and liposomes. The translocation gates of the BtuCD-F complex undergo conformational changes in line with a "two-state" alternating access model. We provide the first direct evidence that binding of ATP drives the gates to an inward-facing conformation, in contrast to type I importers specific for maltose, molybdate, or methionine. Following ATP hydrolysis, the translocation gates restore to an apo-like conformation. In the presence of ATP, an excess of vitamin B(12) promotes the reopening of the gates toward the periplasm and the dislodgment of BtuF from the transporter. The EPR data allow a productive translocation cycle of the vitamin B(12) transporter to be modeled.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023360>MALDI mass spectrometry analysis of high molecular weight proteins from whole bacterial cells: pretreatment of samples with surfactants.</a></h2><p>The use of surfactants as additives in conjunction with on-probe whole cell bacterial protein analysis employing MALDI-TOF-MS is described.

Purification involved solubilization by octylthioglucoside, chromatography on DEAE-trisacryl, hydroxyapatite and FPLC ion-exchange on Mono Q. The apparent KM was found to be 18 microM. 2,3-Iminosqualene and N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide are effective inhibitors of the cyclase with I50 values of 50 and 30 nM, respectively. The cyclase has a molecular mass of 72 kDa as judged by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels under denaturating conditions. The optimal enzymatic activity was obtained at pH 7.0 and 30 degrees C. The solubilized enzyme needs the presence of detergent for maintaining activity. The influence of different detergents on cyclase activity was studied. Triton X-100 proved to be a strong inactivator of the enzyme. Solubilization of the cyclase in Tween 80 and digitonin inactivates the enzyme. However, its activity can be recovered by complementation of the assay buffer with octylthioglucoside above its critical micellar concentration.

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and related multiple resonance techniques (ENDOR/Special TRIPLE) show that two distinct conformations of P.+ can be obtained, depending on the detergent properties, the detergent/RC ratio, and the temperature. The two states correspond to different positions of the long-wavelength Qy-band of the neutral state, P (lambda1 = 866 nm and lambda2 = 850 nm at room temperature) and therefore are called P866.+ and P850.+, respectively. P866.+ is found in chromatophores and in RCs solubilized with nonionic detergents and bile salts. P850.+ is induced by zwitterionic and ionic detergents with aliphatic hydrophobic chains. The TRIPLE resonance spectra reveal that both states coexist in the range lambda2 < lambda(max) < lambda1. The main property of the detergent that determines the ability to induce P850.+ is the polarity of the head group. A simple phenomenological model is presented that relates the standard Gibbs free energy difference between the two conformations to the detergent/RC ratio and the temperature. Of special interest is the observation that the widely used detergent LDAO can induce P850.+ upon freezing the RCs without cryoprotectants. The spectroscopic properties of the two states are compared and their possible roles in RC function are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20959079>SANS investigation of the photosynthetic machinery of Chloroflexus aurantiacus.</a></h2><p>Green photosynthetic bacteria harvest light and perform photosynthesis in low-light environments, and contain specialized antenna complexes to adapt to this condition. We performed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies to obtain structural information about the photosynthetic apparatus, including the peripheral light-harvesting chlorosome complex, the integral membrane light-harvesting B808-866 complex, and the reaction center (RC) in the thermophilic green phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus. Using contrast variation in SANS measurements, we found that the B808-866 complex is wrapped around the RC in Cfx. aurantiacus, and the overall size and conformation of the B808-866 complex of Cfx. aurantiacus is roughly comparable to the LH1 antenna complex of the purple bacteria. A similar size of the isolated B808-866 complex was suggested by dynamic light scattering measurements, and a smaller size of the RC of Cfx. aurantiacus compared to the RC of the purple bacteria was observed. Further, our SANS measurements indicate that the chlorosome is a lipid body with a rod-like shape, and that the self-assembly of bacteriochlorophylls, the major component of the chlorosome, is lipid-like. Finally, two populations of chlorosome particles are suggested in our SANS measurements.Copyright © 2010 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Dequalinium inhibits TF1 reversibly in the dark in the presence or absence of LDAO. The apparent affinity of TF1 for dequalinium increases in the presence of LDAO. Dixon plots of the initial rates of the intermediate phase and the final rates against dequalinium concentration at a series of fixed ATP concentrations in the presence and absence of 0.03% LDAO indicate noncompetitive inhibition in each case. Replots of the slopes of the Dixon plots for the initial rate of the intermediate phase and the final rate against 1/[ATP] reveal apparent Km values of 770 microM and 144 microM, respectively, when obtained in the absence of LDAO. The apparent Km values determined from the data obtained in the presence of LDAO for the same phases are 303 microM and 163 microM, respectively. These results suggest that LDAO stimulates ATPase activity either by increasing the affinity of noncatalytic sites for ATP, which promotes release of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site, or by directly promoting release of MgADP from the affected catalytic site. Dequalinium retards this process without affecting the affinity of noncatalytic sites for ATP. When irradiated in the presence of dequalinium, TF1 is rapidly inactivated with an apparent Kd of 12.5 microM in the presence or absence of LDAO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6541624>Induction of tumours in rats by feeding nitrosatable amines together with sodium nitrite.</a></h2><p>Feed containing 0.2% allantoin or diphenhydramine (as the hydrochloride) or 0.1% chlorpheniramine (as the maleate), with or without 0.2% sodium nitrite, was given ad lib. to groups of 20 or 24 male and 20 or 24 female F344 rats for 106 wk. Groups of 24 male and 24 female F344 rats were given drinking-water that contained N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide at a concentration of 0.1%, with or without 0.2% sodium nitrite, for 93 wk. Control rats were given untreated feed or drinking-water and nitrite-treated controls were given sodium nitrite at a concentration of 0.2% in feed or drinking-water. At the end of the treatment period the rats were given untreated feed and water and observed until death. There was little or no life-shortening effect in any treatment group. None of the four amines administered alone induced an increase in the incidence of any tumour in comparison with the untreated control groups. In the male rats given diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine or N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide concurrently with nitrite there was a significant increase in the incidence of liver neoplasms (hepatocellular carcinomas and neoplastic nodules). In the groups given untreated feed or drinking-water there were, respectively, five and three male rats that had liver tumours. In contrast the number of male rats with liver tumours was ten in the group given dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide plus nitrite, 11 in that given diphenhydramine plus nitrite and 14 (eight with carcinomas) in the group given chlorpheniramine plus nitrite. These results suggest that the ingestion of dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide, diphenhydramine hydrochloride or chlorpheniramine under conditions when they could be nitrosated with nitrite in the stomach might present an increased carcinogenic risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848998>The assembly pathway of outer membrane protein PhoE of Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>The assembly of the wild-type and several mutant forms of the trimeric outer membrane porin PhoE of Escherichia coli was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In in vivo pulse-chase experiments, approximately half of the wild-type PhoE molecules assembled within the 30-s pulse in the native conformation in the cell envelope. The other half of the molecules followed slower kinetics, and three intermediates in this multistep assembly process were detected: a soluble trypsin-sensitive monomer, a trypsin-sensitive monomeric form that was loosely associated with the cell envelope and a metastable trimer, which was integrated into the membranes and converted to the stable trimeric configuration within minutes. The metastable trimers disassembled during sample preparation for standard SDS/PAGE into folded monomers. In vitro, the isolated PhoE protein could efficiently be folded in the presence of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (LDAO). A mutant PhoE protein, DeltaF330, which lacks the C-terminal phenylalanine residue, mainly followed the slower kinetic pathway observed in vivo, resulting in increased amounts of the various assembly intermediates. It appears that the DeltaF330 mutant protein is intrinsically able to fold, because it was able to fold in vitro with LDAO with similar efficiencies as the wild-type protein. Therefore, we propose that the conserved C-terminal Phe is (part of) a sorting signal, directing the protein efficiently to the outer membrane. Furthermore, we analysed a mutant protein with a hydrophilic residue introduced at the hydrophobic side of one of the membrane-spanning amphipathic beta strands. The assembly of this mutant protein was not affected in vivo or in vitro in the presence of LDAO. However, it was not able to form folded monomers in a previously established in vitro folding system, which requires the presence of lipopolysaccharides and Triton. Hence, a folded monomer might not be a true assembly intermediate of PhoE in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2009955>The influence of heptane-1,2,3-triol on the size and shape of LDAO micelles. Implications for the crystallisation of membrane proteins.</a></h2><p>The presence of small amphiphiles has been found to be necessary in the crystallization of several membrane-protein/surfactant complexes. It has been suggested that the role of the small amphiphile may be to reduce the size of the surfactant belt around the protein, making the formation of crystals easier. Thus far it was not known if this would involve changes in micellar size in general or whether the small amphiphile would merely replace LDAO during crystal growth. In the present study we have used small angle neutron scattering to study mixed micelles of lauryldimethyl amine oxide (LDAO; hydrogenated and deuterated) and heptane-1,2,3-triol (HP). Our results show that with increasing overall HP concentrations mixed LDAO/HP micelles of decreasing mass and radius are formed. The composition of these micelles has been determined. HP thus may decrease the size of the surfactant belt around a protein before crystallisation by insertion into a host micelle. As HP is a 'small amphiphile' compared to the surfactants used for solubilization of membrane proteins, the curvature of the host micelle will be increased by its insertion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16226039>Purification, crystallization, and properties of F1-ATPase complexes from the thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1.</a></h2><p>Recently, we reported the cloning of the atp operon encoding for the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase from the extremely thermoalkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1. In this study, the genes encoding the F(1) moiety of the enzyme complex were cloned from the atp operon into the vector pTrc99A and expressed in Escherichia coli in two variant complexes, F(1)-wt consisting of subunits alpha(3)beta(3)gammadeltaepsilon and F(1)Deltadelta lacking the entire delta-subunit as a prerequisite for overproduction and crystallization trials. Both F(1)-wt and F(1)Deltadelta were successfully overproduced in E. coli and purified in high yield and purity. F(1)Deltadelta was crystallized by micro-batch screening yielding three-dimensional crystals that diffracted to a resolution of 3.1A using a synchrotron radiation source. After establishing cryo and dehydrating conditions, a complete set of diffraction data was collected from a single crystal. No crystals were obtained with F(1)-wt. Data processing of diffraction patterns showed that F(1)Deltadelta crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell parameters of a=121.70, b=174.80, and c=223.50A, alpha, beta, gamma=90.000. The asymmetric unit contained one molecule of bacterial F(1)Deltadelta with a corresponding volume per protein weight (V(M)) of 3.25A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 62.1%. Silver staining of single crystals of F(1)Deltadelta analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed four bands alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon with identical M(r)-values as those found in the native F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase isolated from strain TA2.A1 membranes.

Numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate biochemical properties, as well as the three-dimensional structure of VDAC-1. However, functional and structural studies of VDAC-2 and VDAC-3 at atomic resolution are still scarce. VDAC-2 is highly similar to VDAC-1 in amino acid sequence, but has substantially different biochemical functions and expression profiles. Here, we report the reconstitution of functional VDAC-2 in lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) detergent micelles and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) lipid bilayer nanodiscs. We find that VDAC-2 is properly folded in both membrane-mimicking systems and that structural and functional characterization by solution NMR spectroscopy is feasible.

In the case of amine oxide amphiphiles  (DDAO) and p-dodecyloxybenzyldimethylamine oxide (pDoAO), the decrease in fluorescence emission, which signals DNA-amphiphile association, is accompanied by a large hypsochromic shift in the emission maximum of the bound probe; this eventually reaches a value characteristic of HO in a neutral or slightly basic environment. These findings are compared to results obtained by using the more common ethidium bromide (EB) probe, which shows no such shift. Circular dichroism and fluorescence depolarization experiments indicate that fluorescence emission only occurs from the DNA-bound probe, and the observed shift in emission maximum when using HO as a fluorescent probe is due to a variation in the local pH in the vicinity of the probe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9826614>The mechanism of detergent solubilization of liposomes and protein-containing membranes.</a></h2><p>The present study explores intermediate stages in detergent solubilization of liposomes and Ca2+-ATPase membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and medium-sized ( approximately C12) nonionic detergents. In all cases detergent partitioning in the membranes precedes cooperative binding and solubilization, which is facilitated by exposure to detergent micelles. Nonionic detergents predominantly interact with the lipid component of Ca2+-ATPase membranes below the CMC (critical micellar concentration), whereas SDS extracts Ca2+-ATPase before solubilization of lipid. At the transition to cooperative binding, n-dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether (C12E8), Triton X-100, and  induce fusion of small unilamellar liposomes to larger vesicles before solubilization. Solubilization of Ca2+-ATPase membranes is accompanied by membrane fragmentation and aggregation rather than vesicle fusion. Detergents with strongly hydrophilic heads (SDS and beta-D-dodecylmaltoside) only very slowly solubilize liposomal membranes and do not cause liposome fusion. These properties are correlated with a slow bilayer flip-flop. Our data suggest that detergent solubilization proceeds by a combination of 1) a transbilayer attack, following flip-flop of detergent molecules across the lipid bilayer, and 2) extraction of membrane components directly by detergent micelles. The present study should help in the design of efficient solubilization protocols, accomplishing the often delicate balance between preserving functional properties of detergent sensitive membrane proteins and minimizing secondary aggregation and lipid content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25990616>Selective Oxidation of 1,6-Hexanediol to 6-Hydroxycaproic Acid over Reusable Hydrotalcite-Supported Au-Pd Bimetallic Catalysts.</a></h2><p>Selective oxidation of 1,6-hexanediol into 6-hydroxycaproic acid was achieved over hydrotalcite-supported Au-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalyst using aqueous H2 O2 .

In the presence of the latter, the native structure and activity of the reaction center are preserved even at high concentrations of detergent. In contrast, SDS denatures the protein. It does this by a cooperative process, as shown by the sigmoidal relationship between primary photochemical activity and SDS concentration. SDS binds to the reaction center at up to about 6 g SDS/g protein. The most notable modifications brought about by low SDS concentrations are: a slowing down of rereduction of P+ by Q-B from 1 s-1 to 0.25 s-1 and, to a lesser extent, of P+ by Q-A; the reoxidation of Q-A and Q-B by N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine is accelerated as an exponential function of SDS concentration. In this case Q-A become more accessible to external acceptors but not Q-B. It is thought that these changes are mainly due to progressive binding of SDS resulting in the unfolding of the protein, probably accompanied by the loss of the metal. Herbicides partly protect the reaction center against SDS denaturation, but their efficiency to block electron transfer between QA and QB is greatly reduced in the altered reaction centers present in the transition region of the denaturation curve. It is concluded that in the early region of the SDS denaturation curve, no dissociation of the reaction center in subunits occurs. In the transition region, it appears that the reaction center reaches the critical state in which mainly dissociation of polypeptide H from the complex of chains L and M and loss of QA take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8262223>Catalytic and activating protons follow different  in the H(+)-ATPase of potato tuber mitochondria.</a></h2><p>The effect of some F0F1 inhibitors on the activation of the H(+)-ATPase by the electrochemical proton gradient was investigated in mitochondria extracted from potato tubers.

For N.N-alkylamine N-oxide detergents with chain lengths in the range from 8-13 carbon atoms, the number of detergent molecules associated with the reaction centers increased with decreasing chain length. The amount of detergent molecules associated with the reaction centers decreased almost tenfold if the pH was increased from pH 6 to pH 10. The addition of 5% 1,2,3-heptanetriol to various detergents lowered the detergent/reaction center ratio by a factor of two compared to that for the pure detergent. The detergent concentration at which solubilization of the reaction center occurs was close to the critical micelle concentration for all detergents studied. The absorption band at 865 nm of the primary donor in the reaction center shifts to 846 nm when detergent was removed from the reaction center; upon resolubilization with various detergents, this band shifts back to 865 nm. In 80-90% of the detergent-free reaction centers, the secondary electron transfer from QA to QB was inhibited: this electron transfer was restored after re-addition of detergent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8397084>The electrochemical-proton-gradient-activated states of F0F1 ATPase in plant mitochondria as revealed by detergents.</a></h2><p>ATP hydrolysis, triggered by the addition of polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (Lubrol) or lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) to energized plant mitochondria was studied in some details. The membrane disruption was quasi-instantaneous (2-3 s) with both detergents, as shown by the decrease of turbidity and the stopping of respiration. In pea leaf mitochondria, Lubrol triggered ATP hydrolysis in almost the same way as valinomycin plus nigericin, except that the activity was slightly stimulated and became insensitive to carboxyatractyloside. This allowed investigations of ATP hydrolysis without any interference of the ATP/ADP antiporter or the phosphate carrier. Lubrol did not prevent the ATPase from deactivating in pea leaf mitochondria, and did not trigger any ATP hydrolysis in potato tuber mitochondria. At variance with Lubrol, LDAO changed the properties of the F0F1 ATPase. It made the enzyme oligomycin insensitive and froze it in an activated state. The activity was also 5-8-times stimulated in pea leaf mitochondria. Moreover, LDAO revealed an important ATP hydrolase activity when added to energized potato tuber mitochondria. Despite the specific effect of LDAO, the activity triggered by this detergent strongly depended on the energized state of the organelles before detergent addition. From this study, it is concluded that the electrochemical proton gradient is completely necessary to activate the F0F1-ATPase in intact plant mitochondria, as known in chloroplasts and suggested by some reports in animal mitochondria. Moreover, it is suggested that the main difference between the enzymes of pea leaf and potato tuber mitochondria is their rate of deactivation after the collapse of the transmembrane electrochemical potential difference. Finally, when properly used, detergents appear to be a powerful tool to probe the state of the ATPase in intact mitochondria, and maybe in more integrated systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6994803>Physicochemical properties of detergent-solubilized photochemical reaction centers from two strains of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8386638>Phosphorylation of solubilised dark-adapted rhodopsin. Insights into the activation of rhodopsin kinase.</a></h2><p>A protocol for the separation of phosphorhodopsin from phospho-opsin has been developed. The method takes advantage of the finding that, while 0.5% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide completely solubilises membrane-embedded phosphorhodopsin, at this concentration of detergent, phospho-opsin is only sparingly soluble. Phosphorhodopsin solubilised in this manner may be freed from contaminant phospho-opsin by chromatography on hydroxyapatite. Using this method, the rhodopsin-kinase-catalysed phosphorylation of photoexcited rhodopsin and native rhodopsin was studied in rod outer-segment membranes at different levels of bleaching. Prior to analysis of the phosphorylation mixture, the phosphorylated form of photoexcited rhodopsin was converted into phospho-opsin by treatment with NH2OH. It was found that, while at a 5% bleach level the amount of phosphorhodopsin produced was 15% that of phospho-opsin, at 60% bleaching the phosphorhodopsin was less than 1% of phospho-opsin. The phosphorylation reaction under different bleaching conditions was also studied in a completely soluble system (using 2% dodecyl maltoside) and the pattern of phosphate incorporation into rhodopsin versus opsin was identical to that in the membrane system. We have previously proposed that rhodopsin kinase normally exists in an inactive form and is only activated following interaction with photoexcited rhodopsin. The present work strengthens this conclusion and also shows that, following activation, the kinase preferentially phosphorylates photoexcited rhodopsin but can also act upon unbleached rhodopsin. Two possible mechanisms for the activation of the kinase are considered. From the distribution of phosphorhodopsin and phospho-opsin at different bleaching levels, the relative rates of the phosphorylation of photoexcited rhodopsin (kR*) and rhodopsin (kR) were calculated. kR*/kR values for the membrane system of 71 +/- 20 and, for the solubilised system, of 80 +/- 19 were obtained. The algebraic equation used to obtain these values highlights the fact that the ratio of the concentrations of the two substrates, photoexcited rhodopsin and rhodopsin, in a sample, determines the final distribution of phosphate between bleached and unbleached rhodopsin. This conclusion may contribute to the understanding of 'high-gain' phosphorylation observed previously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24203796>Nanostructures from self-assembling triazine tertiary amine N-oxide amphiphiles.</a></h2><p>A new set of amphiphilic tertiary amine N-oxides has been prepared and their self-assembly properties observed in aqueous solution by tensiometry, dynamic and static light scattering.

The RG preparations were isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides by treatment with lauryl dimethyl amine oxide (LDAO). After excitation at lambda 280 nm the quantum yield of luminescence is 0,02. It is shown that 60% of tryptophanyls are located inside the protein globule in the surrounding of relaxating polar groups and the rest approximately 40% on the outer surface of the globule--predominantly in the positively charged region of the LDAO-RC protein--in the surrounding of protein-bound water molecules. There is a correlation between the pH dependencies of the position of the peak of luminescence from tryptophanyls and effectivity of electron transfer from the primary (quinone) to secondary acceptor. The two parameters are invariant at pH from 7 to 9 and vary at pH less than 7 and pH greater than 9.

Crude protein fractions solubilized from rat liver Golgi by several such detergents are very similar in composition as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

I. Slow quinone exchange between reaction center micelles and pure detergent micelles.</a></h2><p>The kinetics of light-induced electron transfer in reaction centers (RCs) from the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides were studied in the presence of the detergent lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO). After the light-induced electron transfer from the primary donor (P) to the acceptor quinone complex, the dark re-reduction of P+ reflects recombination from the reduced acceptor quinones, QA- or QB-. The secondary quinone, QB, which is loosely bound to the RC, determines the rate of this process. Electron transfer to QB slows down the return of the electron to P+, giving rise to a slow phase of the recovery kinetics with time tau P approximately 1 s, whereas charge recombination in RCs lacking QB generates a fast phase with time tau AP approximately 0.1 s. The amount of quinone bound to RC micelles can be reduced by increasing the detergent concentration. The characteristic time of the slow component of P+ dark relaxation, observed at low quinone content per RC micelle (at high detergent concentration), is about 1.2-1.5 s, in sharp contrast to expectations from previous models, according to which the time of the slow component should approach the time of the fast component (about 0.1 s) when the quinone concentration approaches zero. To account for this large discrepancy, a new quantitative approach has been developed to analyze the kinetics of electron transfer in isolated RCs with the following key features: 1) The exchange of quinone between different micelles (RC and detergent micelles) occurs more slowly than electron transfer from QB- to P+; 2) The exchange of quinone between the detergent "phase" and the QB binding site within the same RC micelle is much faster than electron transfer between QA- and P+; 3) The time of the slow component of P+ dark relaxation is determined by (n) > or = 1, the average number of quinones in RC micelles, calculated only for those RC micelles that have at least one quinone per RC (in excess of QA). An analytical function is derived that relates the time of the slow component of P+ relaxation, tau P, and the relative amplitude of the slow phase. This provides a useful means of determining the true equilibrium constant of electron transfer between QA and QB (LAB), and the association equilibrium constant of quinone binding at the QB site (KQ+). We found that LAB = 22 +/- 3 and KQ = 0.6 +/- 0.2 at pH 7.5. The analysis shows that saturation of the QB binding site in detergent-solubilized RCs is difficult to achieve with hydrophobic quinones. This has important implications for the interpretation of apparent dependencies of QB function on environmental parameters (e.g. pH) and on mutational alterations. The model accounts for the effects of detergent and quinone concentration on electron transfer in the acceptor quinone complex, and the conclusions are of general significance for the study of quinone-binding membrane proteins in detergent solutions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2431087>A rapid versatile microassay for cellular retinol-binding protein using Lipidex-1000 microcolumns.</a></h2><p>A new, rapid and versatile microassay for cellular retinol-binding protein has been developed based on separation of bound and free ligand by means of Lipidex-1000, a hydrophobic Sephadex derivative. This requires quantitative manipulation of retinol in aqueous solution. The tendency of retinol to adhere to glass and plastic surfaces was overcome by addition of the detergent Ammonyx LO, which yields a micellar dispersion. Detergent concentrations up to 10 mM did not interfere with binding of retinol to Lipidex-1000 or binding protein.

Separation of protein-bound retinol from free retinol is achieved via Lipidex-1000: protein-bound (specific and nonspecific) retinol is not retained and is eluted by buffer with the protein fraction. Free retinol is retained by Lipidex and is subsequently recovered by elution with methanol. Total recovery of ligand approaches 100%. Analysis time is about 4 hr for a maximum of ca. 50 samples.

This detergent activates Mg2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis in the isolated R. rubrum F0-F1 34-fold, whereas the Ca2+-ATPase activity is only slightly modified. ATPase activation by lauryl dimethylamine oxide enhances the effect on ATP hydrolysis exerted by free Mg2+ ions. Concentrations of free Mg2+ in the range of 0.025 mM favor activation while higher concentrations inhibit ATPase activity by approximately 70%. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that lauryl dimethylamine oxide induces a complex kinetic behavior for Mg-ATP in the chromatophores, similar to the untreated F0-F1 complex. The initial rate value for Mg-ATP unisite catalysis was found to be 6.3 times higher (3.5 X 10(-3) mol Pi per mol R. rubrum F0-F1 per second) in the presence than in the absence of detergent, where the initial rate was 5.5 X 10(-4) mol Pi per mol R. rubrum F0-F1 per second. These experiments show that lauryl dimethylamine oxide shifts the cation requirement for ATP-hydrolysis of the isolated R. rubrum H+-ATPase from Ca2+ to Mg2+ and that it activates both multisite and unisite catalysis.

The assay involved labeling of cells with a cell tracker dye and staining permeabilized cells with an antibody recognizing cleaved caspase 3. The assay proved to be robust and reliable in measuring antigen-specific CTL activity in a number of human and murine systems, including MLR, human peptide-specific T-cell responses induced in vitro, and CTL responses following immunization of mice with viral and peptide vaccines. The assay was found to yield comparable results as 51Cr-release, but with markedly higher sensitivity. When compared to detection of antigen-specific T cells via HLA tetramer/pentamer-based methods of T-cell staining in HIV gag peptide-specific human T cell lines the caspase 3 cleavage readout assay exhibited a comparable level of sensitivity with detection of CTL function at antigen-specific T-cell frequencies of 1:15,000 or lower. A similar level of sensitivity was obtained when murine CTL assays were performed with MLR in which effector cells were highly diluted with naïve syngeneic spleen cells. Our results indicate that the caspase 3 cleavage assay may be a powerful tool to measure antigen-specific CTL responses in human vaccine trials and in pre-clinical animal models of CTL function at both high and low effector cell frequencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6745260>Purification and characterization of the rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase of mitochondria from Arum maculatum.</a></h2><p>The non-ionic detergent lauryl dimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO) has been used to extract the NADH dehydrogenases of Arum maculatum mitochondria. Affinity chromatography on 5'-ADP-Sepharose 4B was used to separate the rotenone-sensitive (complex I) NADH dehydrogenase from the rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase. An 18-fold purification of the rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase was achieved. The enzyme is specific for NADH with optimal activity around pH 7.2. The apparent Km for NADH is 28 microM, with dichloroindophenol as acceptor at pH 7.2. The rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase appears to be a flavoprotein and no iron-sulphur centres were detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16977308>The regulator of the F1 motor: inhibition of rotation of cyanobacterial F1-ATPase by the epsilon subunit.</a></h2><p>The chloroplast-type F(1) ATPase is the key enzyme of energy conversion in chloroplasts, and is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor epsilon, tightly bound ADP, the membrane potential and the redox state of the gamma subunit. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of epsilon inhibition, we constructed an expression system for the alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex in thermophilic cyanobacteria allowing thorough investigation of epsilon inhibition. epsilon Inhibition was found to be ATP-independent, and different to that observed for bacterial F(1)-ATPase. The role of the additional region on the gamma subunit of chloroplast-type F(1)-ATPase in epsilon inhibition was also determined. By single molecule rotation analysis, we succeeded in assigning the pausing angular position of gamma in epsilon inhibition, which was found to be identical to that observed for ATP hydrolysis, product release and ADP inhibition, but distinctly different from the waiting position for ATP binding. These results suggest that the epsilon subunit of chloroplast-type ATP synthase plays an important regulator for the rotary motor enzyme, thus preventing wasteful ATP hydrolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8395515>Detergent binding as a measure of hydrophobic surface area of integral membrane proteins.</a></h2><p>The mode by which four nonionic detergents interact with integral membrane proteins was studied by relating detergent binding to characteristic detergent monolayer and micellar dimensions and to the surface area of the hydrophobic sector of the proteins. The detergents used (C12E8, Triton X-100, dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, and dodecyldimethylamineoxide) are efficient membrane solubilizers, which, according to our hydrodynamic analysis, form small approximately spherical micelles. Their binding by protomeric forms of bacteriorhodopsin, photosynthetic reaction center, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and cytochrome oxidase was measured after equilibration and delipidation, both by the use of successive chromatographies on silica gel and the use of agarose gel columns in combination with DEAE-cellulose chromatography. It was found that, despite detergent binding by silica gel, both chromatographic procedures gave equivalent and consistent results. The data obtained show systematic trends; thus dodecyldimethylamineoxide exhibited the highest binding levels, followed by dodecylmaltoside, whereas the polyethylene glycol detergents C12E8 and Triton X-100 had the lowest degree of binding. This ranking order is inversely related to the cross-sectional areas of these detergents in monolayers at an air-water interface and in micelles. Binding was reduced by aggregation of protomers, whereas the presence of strongly bound residual lipid slightly increased it. Among the membrane proteins with a high molecular mass (reaction center, Ca(2+)-ATPase, and cytochrome oxidase), relative binding could be related to the size of their hydrophobic sectors. On the other hand, bacteriorhodopsin bound somewhat more detergent per transmembrane helix, probably because of less steric hindrance, caused by the absence of a sizable hydrophilic domain in this protein. Theoretical calculations indicated monolayer binding of detergent to the hydrophobic surface of membrane proteins to be a better model for interaction with membrane proteins than binding of the detergents in micellar form.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744684>Substitution of betaGlu(201) in the alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex of the F(1)-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 increases the affinity of catalytic sites for nucleotides.</a></h2><p>In the crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F(1)-ATPase (MF(1)) (Abrahams, J. P., Leslie, A. G. W., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E. (1994) Nature 370, 621-628), the side chain oxygen of betaThr(163) interacts directly with Mg(2+) coordinated to 5'-adenylyl beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate or ADP bound to catalytic sites of beta subunits present in closed conformations. In the unliganded beta subunit present in an open conformation, the hydroxyl of betaThr(163) is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of betaGlu(199). Substitution of betaGlu(201) (equivalent to betaGlu(199) in MF(1)) in the alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex of the F(1)-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 with cysteine or valine increases the propensity to entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during hydrolysis of 50 microM ATP. These substitutions lower K(m3) (the Michaelis constant for trisite ATP hydrolysis) relative to that of the wild type by 25- and 10-fold, respectively. Fluorescence quenching of alpha(3)(betaE201C/Y341W)(3)gamma and alpha(3)(betaY341W)(3)gamma mutant subcomplexes showed that MgATP and MgADP bind to the third catalytic site of the double mutant with 8.4- and 4.4-fold higher affinity, respectively, than to the single mutant. These comparisons support the hypothesis that the hydrogen bond observed between the side chains of betaThr(163) and betaGlu(199) in the unliganded catalytic site in the crystal structure of MF(1) stabilizes the open conformation of the catalytic site during ATP hydrolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10417649>Na+ translocation by the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from Klebsiella pneumoniae.</a></h2><p>Complex I is the site for electrons entering the respiratory chain and therefore of prime importance for the conservation of cell energy. It is generally accepted that the complex I-catalysed oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone is coupled specifically to proton translocation across the membrane. In variance to this view, we show here that complex I of Klebsiella pneumoniae operates as a primary Na+ pump. Membranes from Klebsiella pneumoniae catalysed Na+-stimulated electron transfer from NADH or deaminoNADH to ubiquinone-1 (0.1-0.2 micromol min-1 mg-1). Upon NADH or deaminoNADH oxidation, Na+ ions were transported into the lumen of inverted membrane vesicles. Rate and extent of Na+ transport were significantly enhanced by the uncoupler carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to values of approximately 0.2 micromol min-1 mg-1 protein. This characterizes the responsible enzyme as a primary Na+ pump. The uptake of sodium ions was severely inhibited by the complex I-specific inhibitor rotenone with deaminoNADH or NADH as substrate. N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses of the partially purified Na+-stimulated NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from K. pneumoniae revealed that two polypeptides were highly similar to the NuoF and NuoG subunits from the H+-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases from enterobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12450409>The beta G156C substitution in the F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 affects catalytic site cooperativity by destabilizing the closed conformation of the catalytic site.</a></h2><p>Fluorescence titrations of the alpha(3)(betaG(156)C/Y(345)W)(3)gamma, alpha(3)(betaE(199)V/Y(345)W)(3)gamma, and alpha(3)(betaY(345)W)(3)gamma subcomplexes of TF(1) with nucleotides show that the betaG(156)C substitution substantially lowers the affinity of catalytic sites for ATP and ADP with or without Mg(2+), whereas the betaE(199)V substitution increases the affinity of catalytic sites for nucleotides. Whereas the alpha(3)(betaG(156)C)(3)gamma and alpha(3)(betaE(199)V)(3)gamma subcomplexes hydrolyze 2 mM ATP at 2% and 0.7%, respectively, of the rate exhibited by the wild-type enzyme, the alpha(3)(betaG(156)C/E(199)V)(3)gamma hydrolyzes 2 mM ATP at 9% the rate exhibited by the wild-type enzyme. The alpha(3)(betaG(156)C)(3)gamma, alpha(3)(betaG(156)C/E(199)V)(3)gamma, and alpha(3)(betaG(156)C/E(199)V/Y(345)W)(3)gamma subcomplexes resist entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover. Product [(3)H]ADP remains tightly bound to a single catalytic site when the wild-type, betaE(199)V, betaY(345)W, and betaE(199)V/Y(345)W subcomplexes hydrolyze substoichiometric [(3)H]ATP, whereas it is not retained by the betaG(156)C and betaG(156)C/Y(345)W subcomplexes. Less firmly bound, product [(3)H]ADP is retained when the betaG(156)C/E(199)V and betaG(156)C/E(199)V/Y(345)W mutants hydrolyze substoichiometric [(3)H]ATP. The Lineweaver-Burk plot obtained with the betaG(156)C mutant is curved downward in a manner indicating that its catalytic sites act independently during ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, the betaG(156)C/E(199)V and betaG(156)C/E(199)V/Y(345)W mutants hydrolyze ATP with linear Lineweaver-Burk plots, indicating cooperative trisite catalysis. It appears that the betaG(156)C substitution destabilizes the closed conformation of a catalytic site hydrolyzing MgATP in a manner that allows release of products in the absence of catalytic site cooperativity. Insertion of the betaE(199)V substitution into the betaG(156)C mutant restores cooperativity by restricting opening of the catalytic site hydrolyzing MgATP for product release until an open catalytic site binds MgATP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647685>An improved procedure for the purification of catalytically active alkane hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida GPo1.</a></h2><p>Bacterial alkane hydroxylases are of high interest for bioremediation applications as they allow some bacteria to grow in oil-contaminated environments. Furthermore, they have tremendous biotechnological potential as they catalyse the stereo- and regio-specific hydroxylation of chemically inert alkanes, which can then be used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high-cost chemicals. Despite their potential, progress on the detailed characterization of these systems has so far been slow mainly due to the lack of a robust procedure to purify its membrane protein component, monooxygenase AlkB, in a stable and active form. This study reports a new method for isolating milligramme amounts of recombinant Pseudomonas putida GPo1 AlkB in a folded, catalytically active form to purity levels above 90%. AlkB solubilised and purified in the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide was demonstrated to be active in catalysing the epoxidation reaction of 1-octene with an estimated K (m) value of 0.2 mM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9079639>Catalytic activity of the alpha3beta3gamma complex of F1-ATPase without noncatalytic nucleotide binding site.</a></h2><p>A mutant alpha3beta3gamma complex of F1-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 was generated in which noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites lost their ability to bind nucleotides. It hydrolyzed ATP at an initial rate with cooperative kinetics (Km(1), 4 microM; Km(2), 135 microM) similar to the wild-type complex. However, the initial rate decayed rapidly to an inactivated form. Since the inactivated mutant complex contained 1.5 mol of ADP/mol of complex, this inactivation seemed to be caused by entrapping inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site. Indeed, the mutant complex was nearly completely inactivated by a 10 min prior incubation with equimolar MgADP. Analysis of the progress of inactivation after initiation of ATP hydrolysis as a function of ATP concentration indicated that the inactivation was optimal at ATP concentrations in the range of Km(1). In the presence of ATP, the wild-type complex dissociated the inhibitory [3H]ADP preloaded onto a catalytic site whereas the mutant complex did not. Lauryl dimethylamineoxide promoted release of preloaded inhibitory [3H]ADP in an ATP-dependent manner and partly restored the activity of the inactivated mutant complex. Addition of ATP promoted single-site hydrolysis of 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP preloaded at a single catalytic site of the mutant complex. These results indicate that intact noncatalytic sites are essential for continuous catalytic turnover of the F1-ATPase but are not essential for catalytic cooperativity of F1-ATPase observed at ATP concentrations below approximately 300 microM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7654706>Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of the B800-850 light-harvesting complex from Rhodobacter sulphidophilus and its B800-830 spectral form.</a></h2><p>We demonstrate that the B800-830 spectral form of the B800-850 peripheral light-harvesting complex of Rhodobacter sulphidophilus, which is formed at low ionic strengths in the presence of the zwitterionic detergent LDAO, results from a local modification of the bacteriochlorophyll binding site and not the dissociation of the complex. This perturbation does not result in significant changes to the interactions between the pigments as studied by circular dichroism or fluorescence spectroscopy; however, modifications in the pigment binding sites are inferred from changes in the preresonance Raman spectrum. Specifically, an alteration of the hydrogen bonding of the 2-acetyl group of at least one of the bacteriochlorophyll groups that make up the 850 nm absorbing pair is observed. This implies an alteration in the conformation of the C-terminal domain of the alpha-polypeptide, in which are located the two tyrosyl residues that are believed to act as H-bond donors to these groups, induced by the protein-bound detergent in the absence of bound cations. We suggest that the ability of this complex to form an 800-830 complex is linked to the presence of an aspartyl residue immediately upstream of the tyrosyl residues. This study therefore provides a further illustration of the importance of hydrogen bonds to the 2-acetyl group of the bacteriochlorophyll in the determination of its spectral properties; furthermore, we provide a description of a conformational change that is able to modulate chromophore binding in these complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22117552>Characteristics of protection by MgADP and MgATP of α3β3γ subcomplex of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 βY341W-mutant F1-ATPase from inhibition by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole support a bi-site mechanism of catalysis.</a></h2><p>MgADP and MgATP binding to catalytic sites of βY341W-α(3)β(3)γ subcomplex of F(1)-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 has been assessed using their effect on the enzyme inhibition by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl). It was assumed that NBD-Cl can inhibit only when catalytic sites are empty, and inhibition is prevented if a catalytic site is occupied with a nucleotide. In the absence of an activator, MgADP and MgATP protect βY341W-α(3)β(3)γ subcomplex from inhibition by NBD-Cl by binding to two catalytic sites with an affinity of 37 µM and 12 mM, and 46 µM and 15 mM, respectively. In the presence of an activator lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO), MgADP protects βY341W-α(3)β(3)γ subcomplex from inhibition by NBD-Cl by binding to a catalytic site with a K(d) of 12 mM. Nucleotide binding to a catalytic site with affinity in the millimolar range has not been previously revealed in the fluorescence quenching experiments with βY341W-α(3)β(3)γ subcomplex. In the presence of activators LDAO or selenite, MgATP protects βY341W-α(3)β(3)γ subcomplex from inhibition by NBD-Cl only partially, and the enzyme remains sensitive to inhibition by NBD-Cl even at MgATP concentrations that are saturating for ATPase activity. The results support a bi-site mechanism of catalysis by F(1)-ATPases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17979812>Overexpression and purification of the RyR1 pore-forming region.</a></h2><p>Ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is a large homotetrameric calcium channel that plays a pivotal role in skeletal muscle contraction. Sequence comparison and mutagenesis studies indicate that the pore architecture of RyR1, including the last two transmembrane helices and the luminal loop linking them, is similar to that of the bacterial KcsA K(+) channel. Here, we describe the overexpression and purification of the C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged RyR1 pore-forming region. The nonionic detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) was selected for solubilization of the protein based on its ability to extract the protein from the membrane and to maintain it in a monodisperse state. The protein was then purified using nickel-affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Gel filtration analysis confirmed that the RyR1 fragment containing the pore-forming region (amino acids 4829-5037) is sufficient to form a tetramer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25660321>Stimuli responsive polymorphism of C12NO/DOPE/DNA complexes: Effect of pH, temperature and composition.</a></h2><p>N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (C12NO) is a surfactant that may exist either in a neutral or cationic protonated form depending on the pH of aqueous solutions. Using small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) we observe the rich structural polymorphism of pH responsive complexes prepared due to DNA interaction with C12NO/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) vesicles and discuss it in view of utilizing the surfactant for the gene delivery vector of a pH sensitive system. In neutral solutions, the DNA uptake is low, and a lamellar Lα phase formed by C12NO/DOPE is prevailing in the complexes at 0.2≤C12NO/DOPE<0.6 mol/mol. A maximum of ~30% of the total DNA volume in the sample is bound in a condensed lamellar phase LαC at C12NO/DOPE=1 mol/mol and pH7.2. In acidic conditions, a condensed inverted hexagonal phase HIIC was observed at C12NO/DOPE=0.2 mol/mol. Commensurate lattice parameters, aHC≈dLC, were detected at 0.3≤C12NO/DOPE≤0.4 mol/mol and pH=4.9-6.4 suggesting that LαC and HIIC phases were epitaxially related. While at the same composition but pH~7, the mixture forms a cubic phase (Pn3m) when the complexes were heated to 80°C and cooled down to 20°C. Finally, a large portion of the surfactant (C12NO/DOPE>0.5) stabilizes the LαC phase in C12NO/DOPE/DNA complexes and the distance between DNA strands (dDNA) is modulated by the pH value. Both the composition and pH affect the DNA binding in the complexes reaching up to ~95% of the DNA total amount at acidic conditions.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A new technique is introduced to obtain a defined and homogeneous protein distribution within the membrane. It is shown that both proteins preferentially partition into the fluid membrane phases coexisting with solid lipid domains, thus allowing formation of periodic protein distributions. Protein reconstitution in protein/lipid ratios up to 1:50 does not change the pressure, pi c, corresponding to the main lipid transition but changes the slope in the pressure/area isotherms. It also affects the pressure-induced lipid crystallization, in that the monolayer can be viewed as segregated into a protein-free and a protein-enriched phase. Whereas penetration of cytochrome c into the monolayer is highly dependent on lipid head group charge, this does not hold for cytochrome b. In both cases, monolayer penetration is monotonously reduced with increasing surface pressure, pointing to the dependence of hydrophobic protein-lipid interactions on hydrocarbon chain density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26998712>Derivation of original RESP atomic partial charges for MD simulations of the LDAO surfactant with AMBER: applications to a model of micelle and a fragment of the lipid kinase PI4KA.</a></h2><p>In this paper, we describe the derivation and the validation of original RESP atomic partial charges for the N, N-dimethyl-dodecylamine oxide (LDAO) surfactant. These charges, designed to be fully compatible with all the AMBER force fields, are at first tested against molecular dynamics simulations of pure LDAO micelles and with a fragment of the lipid kinase PIK4A (DI) modeled with the QUARK molecular modeling server. To model the micelle, we used two distinct AMBER force fields (i.e. Amber99SB and Lipid14) and a variety of starting conditions. We find that the micelle structural properties (such as the shape, size, the LDAO headgroup hydration, and alkyl chain conformation) slightly depend on the force field but not on the starting conditions and more importantly are in good agreement with experiments and previous simulations. We also show that the Lipid14 force field should be used instead of the Amber99SB one to better reproduce the C(sp3)C(sp3)C(sp3)C(sp3) conformation in the surfactant alkyl chain. Concerning the simulations with LDAO-DI protein, we carried out different runs at two NaCl concentrations (i.e. 0 and 300 mM) to mimic, in the latter case, the experimental conditions. We notice a small dependence of the simulation results with the LDAO parameters and the salt concentration. However, we find that in the simulations, three out of four tryptophans of the DI protein are not accessible to water in agreement with our fluorescence spectroscopy experiments reported in the paper.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14766305>Expression, purification, and aggregation studies of His-tagged thermoalkalophilic lipase from Bacillus thermocatenulatus.</a></h2><p>The His-tagged lipase BTL2 from Bacillus thermocatenulatus was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by a simple, one-step purification protocol using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The success of protein separation and purification was pH-dependent and increased with decreasing pH. The purified BTL2 lipase showed a strong tendency to aggregate upon concentration, which prevented a reproducible crystallization. Aggregation studies using dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analysis were performed to improve the purification and concentration of BTL2 lipase. Different chemical classes of additives were tested to manipulate the aggregation behaviour of BTL2 lipase with the aim of obtaining a monodisperse sample to use for crystallization. For the process of concentration of BTL2 lipase in monomeric form, the alcohol 2-propanol and the ionic detergent dodecyl dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) were found to be necessary.

Furthermore, conditions are reported under which the purified F1 exhibits Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity of about 35 mumol per min per mg protein. NaHCO3 stimulates the Mg2+-activity from 1.5 mumol per min per mg protein to 5 mumol per min per mg protein giving a maximal activity at a concentration of about 60 mM NaHCO3. Lauryl dimethylamine oxide (LDAO), octyl glucoside and nonanoyl N-methylglucamide enhance the Mg2+-ATPase activity from 1.5 to 14, 22 and 35 mumol per min per mg protein, respectively, in the absence of NaHCO3, and from 5 to 34, 30 and 37 mumol per min per mg protein, respectively, in the presence of 50 mM NaHCO3. The Vmax is increased, but the Km for ATP remains the same, about 0.22 mM, both in the absence of activators and in the presence of NaHCO3, LDAO or NaHCO3 plus LDAO.

The role of the unusually high number of cysteine residues in this isoform is poorly understood. Using a Cys-less construct of hVDAC-2, we have investigated the contribution of cysteines to channel function, barrel stability and its influence on the strength of protein-micelle interactions. We observe that despite the overall preservation in barrel structure upon cysteine mutation, subtle local variations in the mode of interaction of the barrel with its refolded micellar environment arise, which may manifest itself in the channel activity of both the proteins.Fluorescence measurements of the Trp residues in hVDAC-2 point to possible differences in the association of the barrel with lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) micelles. Upon replacement of cysteines in hVDAC-2, our data suggests greater barrel rigidity by way of intra-protein interactions. This, in turn, lowers the equilibrium barrel thermodynamic parameters in LDAOby perturbing the stability of the protein-micelle complex. In addition to this, we also find a difference in the cooperativity of unfolding upon increasing the LDAO concentration, implying the importance of micelle concentration and micelle-protein ratios on the stability of this barrel. Our results indicate that the nine cysteine residues of hVDAC-2 are the key in establishing strong(er) barrel interactions with its environment and also impart additional malleability to the barrel scaffold.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843446>The alpha 3(beta Y341W)3 gamma subcomplex of the F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 fails to dissociate ADP when MgATP is hydrolyzed at a single catalytic site and attains maximal velocity when three catalytic sites are saturated with MgATP.</a></h2><p>The hydrolytic properties of the alpha3beta3gamma and mutant alpha3(betaY341W)3gamma subcomplexes of the TF1-ATPase have been compared. ATPase activity of the mutant is less sensitive to turnover-dependent inhibition by azide, less suppressed by increasing concentrations of Mg2+ during assay, and less stimulated by lauryl dimethylamine oxide (LDAO). Therefore, it has much lower propensity than wild-type to entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover. The fluorescence of the introduced tryptophans in the alpha3(betaY341W)3gamma subcomplex is completely quenched when catalytic sites are saturated with ATP or ADP with or without Mg2+ present. As reported for the betaY331W mutant of Escherichia coli F1 (Weber, J., Wilke-Mounts, S., Lee, R. S.-F., Grell, E., Senior, A. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20126-20133), this provides a direct probe of nucleotide binding to catalytic sites. Addition of stoichiometric MgATP to the mutant subcomplex quenched one-third the tryptophan fluorescence which did not recover after 60 min. This was caused by entrapment of MgADP in a single catalytic site. Titration of catalytic sites of the alpha3(betaY341W)3gamma subcomplex with MgADP or MgATP revealed Kd's of < 50 nM, about 0.25 microM and about 35 microM. Titrations were not affected by azide, whereas LDAO lowered the affinities of catalytic sites 2 and 3 for MgADP by 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively. During titration with MgATP, LDAO slightly lowered affinity at ATP concentrations below 30 microM and had no effect at ATP concentrations above 30 microM. Maximal velocity was attained when the third catalytic site was titrated with MgATP in the presence or absence of LDAO. The same Kd's for binding MgATP to the (alphaA396C)3beta3(gammaA22C) mutant were observed before and after inactivating it by cross-linking alpha to gamma. This implies that the different affinities of catalytic sites for MgATP do not represent negative cooperativity, but rather represent heterogeneous affinities of catalytic sites dictated by the position of the coiled-coil of the gamma subunit within the central cavity of the (alpha beta)3 hexamer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11943219>Self-assembly of ATP synthase subunit c rings.</a></h2><p>Subunit c of the H(+) transporting ATP synthase is an essential part of its membrane domain that participates in transmembrane proton conduction. The annular architecture of the subunit c from different species has been previously reported. However, little is known about the type of interactions that affect the formation of c-rings in the ATPase complex. Here we report that subunit c over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in non-ionic detergent solutions self-assembles into annular structures in the absence of other subunits of the complex. The results suggest that the ability of subunit c to form rings is determined by its primary structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7200205>Decreased structure-linked latency of lysosomal dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-I activity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy fibroblasts.</a></h2><p>Crude lysosomal pellets were prepared from skin fibroblasts grown from patients having Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and from normal controls. Disruption of the lysosomes by nonionic detergents resulted in the expression of latent activity of the enzyme dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-I(DAP-I). Duchenne lysosomes showed less structure-linked latency than those from normal controls, and sedimentation studies demonstrated that the difference was not caused by increased leakage of the enzyme from lysosomes. Permeability properties of the lysosomes for an artificial substrate revealed no difference of the apparent Km. However, in intact lysosomes the apparent K, for Cl- of this chloride-requiring enzyme was found to be lower in DMD lysosomes. The apparent increase in entry for Cl- was closely related with the decreased amount of the DAP-I latency. High concentrations of extra-lysosomal Cl- corrected the abnormality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16223561>Influence of N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine N-oxide on the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-transporting ATPase reconstituted into diacylphosphatidylcholine vesicles: efects of bilayer physical parameters.</a></h2><p>Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.1.38) was isolated from rabbit white muscle, purified and reconstituted into vesicles of synthetic diacylphosphatidylcholines with monounsaturated acyl chains using the cholate dilution method. In fluid bilayers at 37 degrees C, the specific activity of ATPase displays a maximum (31.5+/-0.8 IU/mg) for dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (diC18:1PC) and decreases progressively for both shorter and longer acyl chain lengths. Besides the hydrophobic mismatch between protein and lipid bilayer, changes in the bilayer hydration and lateral interactions detected by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) can contribute to this acyl chain length dependence. When reconstituted into dierucoylphosphatidylcholine (diC22:1PC), the zwitterionic surfactant N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine N-oxide (C12NO) stimulates the ATPase activity from 14.2+/-0.6 to 32.5+/-0.8 IU/mg in the range of molar ratios C12NO:diC22:1PC=0/1.2. In dilauroylphosphatidylcholines (diC12:0PC) and diC18:1PC, the effect of C12NO is twofold-the ATPase activity is stimulated at low and inhibited at high C12NO concentrations. In diC18:1PC, it is observed an increase of activity induced by C12NO in the range of molar ratios C12NO:diC18:1PC< or =1.3 in bilayers, where the bilayer thickness estimated by SANS decreases by 0.4+/-0.1 nm. In this range, the 31P-NMR chemical shift anisotropy increases indicating an effect of C12NO on the orientation of the phosphatidylcholine dipole N(+)-P- accompanied by a variation of the local membrane dipole potential. A decrease of the ATPase activity is observed in the range of molar ratios C12NO:diC18:1PC=1.3/2.5, where mixed tubular micelles are detected by SANS in C12NO+diC18:1PC mixtures. It is concluded that besides hydrophobic thickness changes, the changes in dipole potential and curvature frustration of the bilayer could contribute as well to C12NO effects on Ca(2+)-ATPase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19396991>A light-initiated, dark oxidation of bacteriochlorophyll from reaction center particles.</a></h2><p>When reaction center particles from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides strain R26 are illuminated and then extracted with methanol, about one-third of the extracted bacteriochlorophyll slowly becomes oxidized, The oxidation does not occur under anaerobic conditions or in the absence of the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide. Alkaline conditions also prevent the reaction. A dark interval between illumination and extraction delays the onset of bacteriochlorophyll oxidation in a predictable way.

The molecular weight of the complex determined by means of gel filtration (Sepharose 6-B and Bio-Gel P-300) gives a value of approximately 240 kdalton.

The cross-linked ATPase resembles the native enzyme in the following properties: specific activity; activation by lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO); binding of aurovertin D and ADP; cross-linking products with 3,3'-dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); binding to ATPase-stripped everted membrane vesicles and the N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivity of the rebound enzyme. However, the rebound crosslinked ATPase differed from the native enzyme in lacking the ability to restore NADH oxidation - and ATP hydrolysis-dependent quenching of the fluorescence of quinacrine to ATPase-stripped membrane vesicles. It is proposed that the delta subunit is involved in the proton pathway of the ATPase, and that this pathway is affected in the alpha delta-cross-linked enzyme. The mechanism for activation of the ATPase by LDAO was examined. Evidence against the proposal of Lötscher, H.-R., De Jong, C. and Capaldi, R.A.

The RCs have been solubilized in aqueous solution of the detergent N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (LDAO). Changes in the protein conformation have been probed by monitoring the variation in the absorbance of the bacteriochlorine cofactors and modification in the efficiency of energy transfer from tryptophans to cofactors and among the cofactors (through fluorescence measurements). The RC aggregation taking place at high temperature has been investigated by means of dynamic light scattering. Two experimental protocols have been used: (i) isothermal kinetics, in which the time evolution of RC after a sudden increase of the temperature is probed, and (ii) T-scans, in which the RCs are heated at constant rate. The analysis of the results coming from both the experiments indicates that the minimal kinetic scheme requires an equilibrium step and an irreversible process. The irreversible step is characterized by a activation energy of 205+/-14 kJ/mol and is independent from the detergent concentration. Since the temperature dependence of the aggregation rate was found to obey to the same law, the aggregation process is unfolding-limited. On the other hand, the equilibrium process between the native and a partially unfolded conformations was found to be strongly dependent on the detergent concentration. Increasing the LDAO content from 0.025 to 0.5 wt.% decreases the melting temperature from 49 to 42 degrees C. This corresponds to a sizeable (22 kJ/mol at 25 degrees C) destabilization of the native conformation induced by the detergent. The nature of the aggregates formed by the denatured RCs depends on the temperature. For temperature below 60 degrees C compact aggregates are formed while at 60 degrees C the clusters are less dense with a scaling relation between mass and size close to that expected for diffusion-limited aggregation. The aggregate final sizes formed at different temperatures indicate the presence of an even number of proteins suggesting that these clusters are formed by aggregation of dimers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/854921>The absorption, tissue distribution, and excretion of  (DDAO) in selected animal species and the absorption and excretion of DDAO in man.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10833274>19F NMR investigation of F(1)-ATPase of Escherichia coli using fluorotryptophan labeling.</a></h2><p>Growth of Escherichia coli in the presence of glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, has permitted the production of proton-dislocating ATPase that is specifically labeled with 5-fluorotryptophan.

Its subunit composition was very similar to complex I purified by conventional means. Complex I was dissociated in the presence of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide and beta-mercaptoethanol, and two subcomplexes, I alpha and I beta, were isolated by chromatography. Subcomplex I alpha catalyzes electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone-1. It is composed of about 22 different and mostly hydrophilic subunits and contains 2.0 nmol of FMN/mg of protein. Among its subunits is the 51-kDa subunit, which binds FMN and NADH and probably contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster also. Three other potential Fe-S proteins, the 75- and 24-kDa subunits and a 23-kDa subunit (N-terminal sequence TYKY), are also present. All of the Fe-S clusters detectable by EPR in complex I, including cluster 2, are found in subcomplex I alpha. The line shapes of the EPR spectra of the Fe-S clusters are slightly broadened relative to spectra measured on complex I purified by conventional means, and the quinone reductase activity is insensitive to rotenone. Similar changes were found in samples of the intact chromatographically purified complex I, or in complex I prepared by the conventional method and then subjected to chromatography in the presence of lauryl maltoside. Subcomplex I beta contains about 15 different subunits. The sequences of many of them contain hydrophobic segments that could be membrane spanning, including at least two mitochondrial gene products, ND4 and ND5. The role of subcomplex I beta in the intact complex remains to be elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456854>Oligomeric states of the Shigella translocator protein IpaB provide structural insights into formation of the type III secretion translocon.</a></h2><p>The Shigella flexneri Type III secretion system (T3SS) senses contact with human intestinal cells and injects effector proteins that promote pathogen entry as the first step in causing life threatening bacillary dysentery (shigellosis). The Shigella Type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) consists of an anchoring basal body, an exposed needle, and a temporally assembled tip complex. Exposure to environmental small molecules recruits IpaB, the first hydrophobic translocator protein, to the maturing tip complex. IpaB then senses contact with a host cell membrane, forming the translocon pore through which effectors are delivered to the host cytoplasm. Within the bacterium, IpaB exists as a heterodimer with its chaperone IpgC; however, IpaB's structural state following secretion is unknown due to difficulties isolating stable protein. We have overcome this by coexpressing the IpaB/IpgC heterodimer and isolating IpaB by incubating the complex in mild detergents. Interestingly, preparation of IpaB with n-octyl-oligo-oxyethylene (OPOE) results in the assembly of discrete oligomers while purification in N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO) maintains IpaB as a monomer. In this study, we demonstrate that IpaB tetramers penetrate phospholipid membranes to allow a size-dependent release of small molecules, suggesting the formation of discrete pores. Monomeric IpaB also interacts with liposomes but fails to disrupt them. From these and additional findings, we propose that IpaB can exist as a tetramer having inherent flexibility, which allows it to cooperatively interact with and insert into host cell membranes. This event may then lay the foundation for formation of the Shigella T3SS translocon pore.Copyright © 2013 The Protein Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7293233>A comparison of the elimination and biotransformation of  (DDAO) by rats, rabbits, and man.</a></h2><p>1. The biotransformation of [1-14C] (DDAO) was studied in rats, rabbits and humans. 2. Metabolites eliminated in 0-24 h urine after oral dosing were separated by cation exchange chromatography into at least ten separate peaks for each species. Several prominent urinary metabolites were identified using reverse isotope dilution, g.l.c.-mass spectrometry and n.m.r. 3. Metabolite structures suggested   that included omega, beta-oxidation of the aliphatic chain, amine oxide reduction, and aliphatic mid-chain hydroxylation. 4. Comparison was made of the 0-24 h urinary metabolites from males of each species. N,N-Dimethyl-4-aminobutyric acid and its N-oxide accounted for 28% of the dose in humans, 28% in rabbits and 23% in rats. These species excreted 44, 51 and 60% of the dose, respectively, in 24 h. Therefore, humans and rabbits were more efficient than rats in degrading the alkyl chain to compounds containing four-carbon acids. In contrast to rabbits and humans, rats excreted greater than 12% of the dose as long-chain compounds. At least half of these compounds were C-hydroxylated amino-alcohols. 5.

The enzyme was maximally activated 3-fold in membranes and 5-6-fold for isolated ECF1 or the ECF1-F0 complex. The maximal specific activity of activated ECF1 was 140-160 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed min-1 mg-1. The activation by LDAO was reversible. LDAO specifically released subunit delta from ECF1, generating a four subunit enzyme (alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon subunits). The removal of subunit delta was not responsible for the stimulation of ATPase activity as evidenced by the full activation of the four subunit enzyme by LDAO. Treatment of ECF1 with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide generated a beta-epsilon cross-link in high yield [Lötscher, H.R., DeJong, C., & Capaldi, R. A. (1984) Biochemistry (accompanying paper in this issue)]. The formation of this cross-link was greatly reduced in the presence of LDAO, indicating that the detergent perturbated the interaction between epsilon and beta subunits although epsilon was not removed from the ECF1 complex. The results suggest that the interconversion of ECF1 from a low to a high ATPase activity form by LDAO is in major part due to a release of the inhibitory action of subunit epsilon on subunit beta.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22361591>NMR structures of the transmembrane domains of the α4β2 nAChR.</a></h2><p>The α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the predominant heteromeric subtype of nAChRs in the brain, which has been implicated in numerous neurological conditions. The structural information specifically for the α4β2 and other neuronal nAChRs is presently limited. In this study, we determined structures of the transmembrane (TM) domains of the α4 and β2 subunits in lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) micelles using solution NMR spectroscopy. NMR experiments and size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis demonstrated that the TM domains of α4 and β2 interacted with each other and spontaneously formed pentameric assemblies in the LDAO micelles. The Na(+) flux assay revealed that α4β2 formed Na(+) permeable channels in lipid vesicles. Efflux of Na(+) through the α4β2 channels reduced intra-vesicle Sodium Green™ fluorescence in a time-dependent manner that was not observed in vesicles without incorporating α4β2. The study provides structural insight into the TM domains of the α4β2 nAChR. It offers a valuable structural framework for rationalizing extensive biochemical data collected previously on the α4β2 nAChR and for designing new therapeutic modulators.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, complex I was purified from Escherichia coli and fragmented by replacing dodecylmaltoside with other detergents. Exchange into decyl maltoside led to the removal of the hydrophobic subunit NuoL from the otherwise intact complex. Diheptanoyl phosphocholine led to the loss of NuoL and NuoM subunits, whereas other subunits remained in the complex. The presence of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide or Triton X-100 led to further disruption of the membrane domain into fragments containing NuoL/M/N, NuoA/K/N, and NuoH/J subunits. Among the hydrophilic subunits, NuoCD was most readily dissociated from the complex, whereas NuoB was partially dissociated from the peripheral arm assembly in N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide. A model of subunit arrangement in bacterial complex I based on these data is proposed. Subunits NuoL and NuoM, which are homologous to antiporters and are implicated in proton pumping, are located at the distal end of the membrane arm, spatially separated from the redox centers of the peripheral arm. This is consistent with proposals that the mechanism of proton pumping by complex I is likely to involve long range conformational changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18281747>Effect of amphiphilic surfactant LDAO on the solubilization of DOPC vesicles and on the activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase reconstituted in DOPC vesicles.</a></h2><p>Solubilization of large unilamellar 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles by N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) was studied using turbidimetry. From turbidity data, the LDAO partition coefficient between the aqueous phase and DOPC bilayers was obtained. Using this partition coefficient, the LDAO:DOPC molar ratio in the bilayer was calculated and effects of LDAO on the bilayer stability, bilayer thickness and on the phosphohydrolase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transporting ATPase (SERCA) reconstituted into DOPC were compared at the same LDAO:DOPC molar ratios in the bilayer. The sequence "bilayers in vesicles - bilayer fragments (flat mixed micelles) - tubular mixed micelles - globular mixed micelles" was suggested for the solubilization mechanism of DOPC vesicles from the combined turbidimetric and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) results. The effective molecular packing parameter delta = 0.5, corresponding to the mixed bilayer - mixed tubular micelle transition, was calculated from fragmental DOPC and LDAO volumes at the molar ratio LDAO:DOPC = 2.00 in bilayers, in the middle of transition region observed earlier experimentally by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The bilayer thickness decrease induced by LDAO in DOPC observed by SANS did not result in the SERCA phosphohydrolase activity decrease and this indicates that some other factors compensated this bilayer effect of LDAO. The ATPase activity decrease at higher LDAO concentrations was caused by the bilayer deformation. This deformation resulted in the formation of non-bilayer aggregates in LDAO+DOPC system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10493921>alpha3beta3gamma complex of F1-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 can maintain steady-state ATP hydrolysis activity depending on the number of non-catalytic sites.</a></h2><p>Homogeneous preparations of alpha(3)beta(3)gamma complexes with one, two or three non-competent non-catalytic site(s) were performed as described [Amano, Hisabori, Muneyuki, and Yoshida (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 18128-18133] and their properties were compared with those of the wild-type complex. The ATPase activity of the complex with three non-competent non-catalytic sites decayed rapidly to an inactivated state, as reported previously [Matsui, Muneyuki, Honda, Allison, Dou, and Yoshida (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8215-8221]. In contrast, the complex with one or two non-competent non-catalytic sites displayed a substantial steady-state phase activity depending on the number of non-competent non-catalytic sites in the complex. This result indicates that one competent non-catalytic site can maintain the continuous catalytic turnover of the enzyme and can potentially relieve all three catalytic sites from inhibition by MgADP(-). Furthermore, the results suggest that the interaction between three non-catalytic sites might not be as strong as that between catalytic sites, which are all strictly required for a continuous catalytic turnover.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19591800>Optimization of the multiple enzymatic activities of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protein.</a></h2><p>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is known to possess multiple enzymatic activities.

The preparation obtained is free of a light-harvesting pigment-protein complex and cytochromes. A high degree of purity can be demonstrated from the adsorption indexes of the preparation equal to A280 : A800 = 1.2--1.3; A760 : A800 : A870 = 1 : 2 : 0.9. Data from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that the integral protein component of the preparation is made up of three polypeptides with molecular weights of 30 000, 24 000 and 20 000. Under continuous illumination the preparation exhibits an effective electron transfer from the bacteriochlorophyll dimer (BChl)2 to a system of quinone acceptors (X1, X2). The ambient potential Em of (BChl)2 half-recovery was estimated as + 475 mV and pH 7.2. The rate constant for direct electron transfer from X1- to X2 is about 0.5 . 10(3) s-1 at 300 degrees K (0.01 M phosphate buffer; 0.05% LDAO, pH 7.2). The activity of this transfer is exponentially reduced with a decrease in temperature within the range of 300 to 230 degrees K, with an activation energy, Ea, of approximately equal to 8 kcal. The recombination rate constant of light-induced ion-radicals, (BChl)2+ and X1-, was found to be 5 . 10(-2) s-1 at 180 degrees K.

The wild-type complex hydrolyzes 50 microM ATP in three kinetic phases: a burst decelerates to an intermediate phase, which then gradually accelerates to a final rate. In contrast, the mutant complex hydrolyzes 50 microM or 2 mM ATP in two kinetic phases. The mutation abolishes acceleration from the intermediate phase to a faster final rate. Both the wild-type and mutant complexes hydrolyze ATP with a lag after loading a catalytic site with MgADP. The rate of the MgADP-loaded wild-type complex rapidly accelerates and approaches that observed for the wild-type apo-complex. The MgADP-loaded mutant complex hydrolyzes ATP with a more pronounced lag, and the gradually accelerating rate approaches the slow, final rate observed with the mutant apo-complex. Lauryl dimethylamide oxide (LDAO) stimulates hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP catalyzed by wild-type and mutant complexes 4- and 7.5-fold, respectively. The rate of release of [3H]ADP from the Mg[3H]ADP-loaded mutant complex during hydrolysis of 40 microM ATP is slower than observed with the wild-type complex. LDAO increases the rate of release of [3H]ADP from the preloaded wild-type and mutant complexes during hydrolysis of 40 microM ATP. Again, release is slower with the mutant complex. When the wild-type and mutant complexes are irradiated in the presence of 2-N3-[3H]ADP plus Mg2+ or 2-N3-[3H]ATP plus Mg2+ and azide, the same extent of labeling of noncatalytic sites is observed. Whereas ADP and ATP protect noncatalytic sites of the wild-type and mutant complexes about equally from labeling by 2-N3-[3H]ADP or 2-N3-[3H[ATP, respectively, AMP-PNP provides little protection of noncatalytic sites of the mutant complex. The results suggest that the substitution does not prevent binding of ADP or ATP to noncatalytic sites, but rather that it affects cross-talk between liganded noncatalytic sites and catalytic sites which is necessary to promote dissociation of inhibitory MgADP.</p></html>
