<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1572909>Characterization of specific proteases associated with the surface of human skin fibroblasts, and their modulation in pathology.</a></h2><p>Human skin fibroblasts were probed for cell surface protease activity. One activity removing dipeptides from the NH2-terminal end of -Pro-pNA was specifically inhibited by di-isopropyl-fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulphony fluoride (PMSF), and diprotin A, and thus was identified as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). A group of bestatin-sensitive N-exoaminopeptidase activities was also characterized when Ala-, Leu-, and -pNA were used as chromogenic substrates. Using human monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 13 and anti-CD 26 that recognized, respectively, an N-Ala-aminopeptidase and DPP IV, it was found that human dermal fibroblasts expressed the CD 13 and CD 26 antigen on their surface. In addition, both peptidases were specifically immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 13 and anti-CD 26 from plasma membranes. Cell surface proteolytic activities were also investigated in human fibroblasts derived from dermatological and rheumatic diseases (i.e., , rheumatoid arthritis, and lichen planus). It was found that these fibroblasts also expressed both types of proteinases initially identified on normal skin fibroblasts and that the levels of Ala-aminopeptidase activities were similar in all cases. In contrast, the levels of -, Leu-exoaminopeptidase, and DPP IV activities were significantly higher (up to 6.6-fold) in the three pathological fibroblast populations than in their normal counterparts. These proteolytic enzymes, therefore, can potentially serve as markers in dermatological diseases. Taken together, our results suggest that skin fibroblast-derived proteinases associated with both serine and N-aminopeptidase activities may play an important role by participating in the extracellular events associated with fibroblast behaviour.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10733677>Overexpression of the oncofetal Fn variant containing the EDA splice-in segment in the dermal-epidermal junction of psoriatic uninvolved skin.</a></h2><p>The extracellular matrix protein, Fn, has critical functions in cell attachment, migration, differentiation, and proliferation. We have previously shown that fibronectin (Fn) is abnormally expressed and potentiates entry into the cell cycle of basal keratinocytes in uninvolved psoriatic skin, in combination with T cell lymphokines. It is not known what type of Fn is present in psoriatic skin, however, and how this Fn may regulate signaling. Embryonic forms of cellular Fn containing extra domains, designated EDA and EDB, are generated by alternative splicing and are seen in proliferating, developing tissue and in wound healing. Because the EDA segment enhances the integrin binding sequence , , Asp (RGD), which, when present, has been shown to be critical in integrin-extracellular matrix signaling, we were particularly interested in determining whether or not EDA-containing Fn (EDA+Fn) represented the aberrantly expressed Fn in . Increased EDA+ Fn protein was demonstrated by immunostaining at the dermal-epidermal junction in clinically uninvolved skin from six of six patients with , but not in skin from control subjects. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction an increased ratio of EDA+ Fn versus EDA- Fn mRNA was present in epidermal samples from psoriatic but not control individuals. Interestingly, the EDA+Fn in the psoriatic epidermis had the IIICS region spliced out (EDA+, FDB-, IIICS-, III9+), which was shared with normal epidermis (EDA-, EDB-, IIICS-, III9+). These results suggest a selective predominance of the EDA+ Fn isoform at the dermal-epidermal junction of psoriatic skin. The consistent aberrant localization of EDA+ Fn at the dermal-epidermal junction in uninvolved skin of psoriatics may confer the hyperresponsiveness of psoriatic uninvolved basal keratinocytes for rapid cellular proliferation in response to T cell signals.

Mast cell tryptase was stained with the sensitive substrate Z--Pro--4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide, and chymase with Suc-Val-Pro-Phe-MNA and monoclonal B7 anti-chymase antibody. In addition, healthy-looking skin from 27 psoriatic patients was tape-stripped resulting in induction of the Köbner response in 9 patients. Sequential biopsies were taken before and after (7, 14 and 21 days) tape-stripping, and both tryptase and chymase were stained enzyme-histochemically. In non-lesional psoriatic skin, 70 +/- 24% (mean +/- SD) of the mast cells contained chymase enzyme activity, and 78 +/- 18% chymase immunoreactivity. About 10% of the chymase-immunoreactive cells lacked chymase activity. In lesional psoriatic skin, tryptase-positive cells were increased in number throughout the dermis but especially beneath the epidermis. Chymase immunoreactivity paralleled the tryptase activity, whereas chymase activity was strongly diminished both in terms of mast cell numbers and in staining intensity in the papillary dermis. The apparent inactivation of chymase may be due to the action of the chymase inhibitors, alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, localized immunohistochemically in mast cells of lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin. In the developing psoriatic lesion, mast cells displaying chymase activity were already 27-38% decreased in number in the upper dermis on day 7 after tape-stripping, along with the first clinical signs of .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400241>From topical antidote against skin irritants to a novel counter-irritating and anti-inflammatory peptide.</a></h2><p>The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of the counter-irritating activity of topical iodine against skin lesions induced by chemical and thermal stimuli. The hypothesis that iodine exerts its activity by inducing an endogenous anti-inflammatory factor was confirmed by exposing guinea pig skin to heat stimulus followed by topical iodine treatment and skin extraction. Injection of the extract into naïve guinea pigs reduced heat-induced irritation by 69%. The protective factor, identified as a new nonapeptide (histone H2A 36-44, H-Lys--Asn-Tyr-Ala-Glu--Ileu-Ala-OH), caused reduction of 40% in irritation score in heat-exposed guinea pigs. The murine analog (H-Lys--His-Tyr-Ala-Glu--Val--OH, termed IIIM1) reduced sulfur mustard (SM)-induced ear swelling at a dose-dependent bell-shape manner reaching peak activity of 1 mg/kg. Cultured keratinocytes transfected with the peptide were more resistant towards SM than the control cells. The peptide suppressed oxidative burst in activated neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the peptide reduced glucose oxidase-induced skin edema in mice at a dose-dependent bell-shape manner. Apart from thermal and chemical-induced skin irritation this novel peptide might be of potential use in chronic dermal disorders such as  and pemphigus as well as non-dermal inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, arthritis and colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1706585>Quantitative enzyme-histochemical analysis of tryptase- and chymase-containing mast cells in psoriatic skin.</a></h2><p>Tryptase-containing mast cells have recently been found to be increased in the upper dermis of psoriatic lesions. In the present study, the distribution of chymase- and tryptase-containing mast cells was morphometrically analysed at different dermal levels of lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin (12 patients) as well as normal human skin. Mast cell tryptase was identified enzyme-histochemically, using Z--Pro--MNA as the substrate. For demonstrating mast cell chymase, a simple and specific enzyme-histochemical staining method was developed, using Suc-Val-Pro-Phe-MNA as the substrate. All mast cells positive for chymase were also positive for tryptase and Giemsa stain. Although the number of tryptase-positive mast cells was slightly increased throughout the dermis of lesional psoriatic skin, this increase was most pronounced in the upper dermis immediately beneath, and in close contact with, the epidermis. In contrast, the number of chymase-positive mast cells was clearly decreased in the upper dermis of psoriatic lesions, but not in the deeper dermis, as compared with non-lesional psoriatic skin. In addition, all chymase-positive mast cells observed in the upper dermis were very weakly stained when compared with those in the deeper dermis. No differences were found between non-lesional psoriatic skin and normal skin in which the number of mast cells containing chymase was 72-73% of the number containing tryptase. The present results suggest that T mast cells particularly, containing tryptase but no chymase, proliferate in psoriatic lesions, and that the increase in tryptase activity and the decrease in chymase activity in the upper dermis may lead to an imbalance in the biochemical regulatory systems.</p></html>
