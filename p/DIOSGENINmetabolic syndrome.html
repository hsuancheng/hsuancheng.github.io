The glucose intolerance, serum uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined.Protodioscin significantly improved glucose intolerance and reduced the levels of serum UA, BUN, Cr, TC and TG. Histological examinations showed that protodioscin ameliorated glomerular and tubular pathological changes. Protodioscin significantly reduced renal concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In addition, the effect of protodioscin on the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway was examined.Taken together, protodioscin is a potential drug candidate for high dietary fructose-induced metabolic syndrome and renal injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

High fat (HF) diet-fed mice and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was used to evaluate the effect of DSG. We showed that DSG attenuated metabolic dysfunction in HF diet-fed mice, as evidenced by reduction of blood glucose level and improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance. DSG ameliorated oxidative stress, reduced body weight, fat pads, and systematic lipid profiles and attenuated lipid accumulation. DSG inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and reduced adipocyte size through regulating key factors. DSG inhibited PPARγ and its target gene expression both in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and fat tissues in HF diet-fed mice. Overexpression of PPARγ suppressed DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation. DSG significantly increased nuclear expression of ERβ. Inhibition of ERβ significantly suppressed DSG-exerted suppression of adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression. In response to DSG stimulation, ERβ bound with RXRα and dissociated RXRα from PPARγ, leading to the reduction of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of DSG on adipocyte differentiation and demonstrate that ERβ-exerted regulation of PPARγ expression and activity is critical for DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the search for effective treatments is a high priority in biomedical research. Products derived from botanicals have a time-honored history of use in the treatment of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes. Trigonella foenum-graecum, commonly known as fenugreek, is an annual herbaceous plant that has been a staple of traditional herbal medicine in many cultures. Although fenugreek has been studied in both clinical and basic research settings, questions remain about its efficacy and biologic mechanisms of action. , 4-hydroxyisoleucine, and the fiber component of the plant are the most intensively studied bioactive constituents present in fenugreek. These compounds have been demonstrated to exert beneficial effects on several physiologic markers including glucose tolerance, inflammation, insulin action, liver function, blood lipids, and cardiovascular health. Although insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the favorable effects of fenugreek have been gained, we still do not have definitive evidence establishing its role as a therapeutic agent in metabolic disease. This review aims to summarize the currently available evidence on the physiologic effects of the 3 best-characterized bioactive compounds of fenugreek, with particular emphasis on biologic mechanisms of action relevant in the context of metabolic syndrome.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29534453>Fenugreek (Trigonella Foenum-Graecum) Seed Flour and  Preserve Endothelium-Dependent Arterial Relaxation in a Rat Model of Early-Stage Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Fenugreek is a common herb possessing several bioactive components including . Here, dietary fenugreek seed flour and  were evaluated on a model of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by abdominal aortas isolated from rats receiving high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHSD). 60 male Wistar rats were randomized into six groups: (i) negative control getting conventional rat feed regimen; (ii) positive control receiving HFHSD; (iii) a test group fed 2 g/kg bw/day fenugreek seed flour (containing 10 mg/kg bw/day ) + HFHSD; (iv) three test groups fed 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day  + HFHSD. Alimentary treatments were carried out for six weeks. The abdominal aortas were isolated, and 2 mm wide rings were sectioned off and mounted at a resting tension of 10 mN in organ baths containing Krebs solution (36 °C) exposed to 95% O₂ and 5% CO₂. After 60-min incubation, a norepinephrine concentration-response (E/c) curve was generated to determine their half-maximal effective concentration (EC) value. After 60-min wash-out, a pre-contraction with norepinephrine EC was made, followed by an acetylcholine E/c curve. Plasma glutathione levels, glutathione-handling enzyme activities and blood antioxidant capacities were also determined. HFHSD significantly decreased the dilatory response to acetylcholine and increased plasma glutathione levels and these effects were significantly reversed by fenugreek seed flour, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day . Both fenugreek and  treatments prevent HFHSD-induced endothelial dysfunction and redox changes. As fenugreek treatment was more effective at lower acetylcholine concentrations than  treatments, components of fenugreek other than  may contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary fenugreek seed flour.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743227>Antidiabetic effect of total saponins from Polygonatum kingianum in streptozotocin-induced daibetic rats.</a></h1><p>Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and related metabolic syndrome in Asian counties for centuries. In this study, the blood glucose regulation activity and mechanism of total saponins from P. kingianum (TSPK) were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in this research.TSPK (0.025g/kg and 0.1mg/kg) was administrated by gavage to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 8 weeks. Changes of body weight, food intakes, blood glucose, serum insulin and lipid indexes were observed. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to explore the gene expression alternation after treated with TSPK. Expressions of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the relative transcript level of glucose kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (GK/G6P) in the liver were investigated. Meanwhile, contents of AMPK, and glucose transporter subtype-4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, and peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue were investigated.TSPK could effectively alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats. Genome-wide expression profiling showed that TSPK up-regulated the expression of GLUT4 while down-regulated the expression of G6P in insulin signal pathway. In the liver, the expression of AMPK and GK are increased. Further more, TSPK promoted the expressions of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, respectively.These results provide possible mechanisms for the antidiabetic effects of TSPK. TSPK could promote not only glycogenesis but also glucose utilization in peripheral tissue. Our results suggested that TSPK may be used as adjuvant therapy to control blood glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic individuals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
