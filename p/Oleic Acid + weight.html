Present study is focused on assessment of wastewater grown indigenous microalga Chlorella sp. for fuel quality parameters. This was successfully grown in secondary treated waste water diluted with tap water (25% dilution) in glass house. The microalga showed a dry  of 0.849 g L with lipid content of 27.1% on dry  basis on 21st day of incubation. After transesterification, the yield of fatty  methyl ester was 80.64% with major fatty acids as palmitic, linoleic,  and linolenic. The physical parameters predicted from empirical equations in the biodiesel showed cetane number as 56.5, iodine value of 75.5 g I 100 g, high heating value 40.1 MJ kg, flash point 135 °C, kinematic viscosity 4.05 mm s with density of 0.86 g cm and cold filter plugging point as 0.7 °C. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), H, C NMR spectrum confirmed the chemical nature of biodiesel. The results indicated that the quality of biodiesel was almost as per the criterion of ASTM standards; hence, wastewater grown Chlorella sp. can be used as a promising strain for biodiesel production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475703>Benefits of blended oil consumption over other sources of lipids on the cardiovascular system in obese rats.</a></h2><p>High consumption of cooking oils in modern society is believed to be the major cause of cardiovascular disease. The effect of cooking oils depends on their fatty  composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of  (OA) (50.93%) and α-linolenic  (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and  (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower , fat , liver , fat ratio, food intake and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813326>The Antagonist Effect of Arachidonic  on  Gene Expression by Nuclear Receptor Type II Regulation.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797206>Trivalent Chromium Supplementation Ameliorates -Induced Hepatic Steatosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] is recognized as an essential trace element for human health, whereas its effect on hepatic lipid metabolism has not yet been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of Cr(III) on hepatic steatosis in an  (OA) induced mice model. Mice were fed with high OA for 12 weeks to induce lipid accumulation, and co-administrated with Cr(III) supplementation. Indexes of liver lipid accumulation, associated lipid genes expression, fatty acids (FAs) profile and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. The data showed that Cr(III) supplementation could attenuate disease progress of hepatic steatosis and protect liver from high OA. After Cr(III) supplementation, elevated  and liver injury in steatosis mice were reversed, excessive lipid accumulation and FAs were also reduced. The up-regulation of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) following steatosis induction were inhibited by Cr(III). Cr(III) reduced the content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α, IL-12) and restored the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) to the control values. Our results suggest that Cr(III) supplementation is a novel strategy for alleviating OA-induced hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28625206>Organic food consumption during pregnancy and its association with health-related characteristics: the KOALA Birth Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>To investigate the associations of organic food consumption with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, hypertension and diabetes in pregnancy, and several blood biomarkers of pregnant women.Prospective cohort study.Pregnant women were recruited at midwives' practices and through channels related to consumption of food from organic origin.Pregnant women who filled in FFQ and donated a blood sample (n 1339). Participant groups were defined based on the share of consumed organic products; to discriminate between effects of food origin and food patterns, healthy diet indicators were considered in some statistical models.Consumption of organic food was associated with a more favourable pre-pregnancy BMI and lower prevalence of gestational diabetes. Compared with participants consuming no organic food (reference group), a marker of dairy products intake (pentadecanoic ) and trans-fatty acids from natural origin (vaccenic and rumenic acids) were higher among participants consuming organic food (organic groups), whereas elaidic , a marker of the intake of trans-fatty acids found in industrially hydrogenated fats, was lower. Plasma levels of homocysteine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in the organic groups than in the reference group. Differences in pentadecanoic , vaccenic  and vitamin D retained statistical significance when correcting for indicators of the healthy diet pattern associated with the consumption of organic food.Consumption of organic food during pregnancy is associated with several health-related characteristics and blood biomarkers. Part of the observed associations is explained by food patterns accompanying the consumption of organic food.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486462>Influence of early stages of triglyceride pyrolysis on the formation of PAHs as coke precursors.</a></h2><p>Molecular beam (MB) time-of-flight mass spectrometry has been used to investigate thermal decomposition of triolein, to reveal the mechanisms of low temperature soot/coke formation characteristic for triglycerides (TGs). Mass detected pyrolysis products were observed at incremented temperatures using both VUV single photon ionization (general product detection) and REMPI based selective detection of aromatic products. To augment the simple mass characterizations, we have employed stoichiometric considerations; we have supplemented the analysis further by using the detailed information available from product analysis of batch reactor TG cracking. Both the VUV photoionization and batch reactor studies indicated that formation of C7-sized stable products is a marker of significant triolein decomposition that is coupled with PAH formation. A significant fraction of the C7 species observed likely formed as a result of a C-C bond scission at the allylic position to the ω-9 double bond of . REMPI detection indicated a high specificity for PAH formation at three distinct molecular  values, 276, 352 and 444 amu (the latter being a fullerene precursor). The stoichiometric analysis has shown that these PAHs likely arise from condensation reactions of either C7- or C8-sized fragments (three, four and five, respectively). The C8-sized intermediate would become essential whenever the PAH product of C7 fragment condensation contained an odd number of carbon atoms, resulting in a less stable aromatic structure with an incomplete double bond conjugation. MB experiments involving either addition or in situ generation of hydrogen resulted in an enhancement of lower molecular  PAH formation, i.e., a decrease in the effective number of condensing fragments. In contrast, an increase in temperature yielded the opposite effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651296>Association Mapping for Important Agronomic Traits in Safflower ( L.) Core Collection Using Microsatellite Markers.</a></h2><p> L. (safflower) is an important oilseed crop producing seed oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Scarcity of identified marker-trait associations is a major limitation toward development of successful marker-assisted breeding programs in safflower. In the present study, a safflower panel (CartAP) comprising 124 accessions derived from two core collections was assayed for its suitability for association mapping. Genotyping of CartAP using microsatellite markers revealed significant genetic diversity indicated by Shannon information index ( = 0.7537) and Nei's expected heterozygosity ( = 0.4432). In Principal Coordinate Analysis, the CartAP accessions were distributed homogeneously in all quadrants indicating their diverse nature. Distance-based Neighbor Joining analysis did not delineate the CartAP accessions in consonance with their geographical origin. Bayesian analysis of population structure of CartAP demonstrated the unstructured nature of the association panel. Kinship analysis at population ( ) and individual level ( ) revealed absence of or weak relatedness between the CartAP accessions. The above parameters established the suitability of CartAP for association mapping. We performed association mapping using phenotypic data for eight traits of agronomic value (., seed oil content, , linoleic , plant height, number of primary branches, number of capitula per plant, 100-seed  and days to 50% flowering) available for two growing seasons (2011-2012 and 2012-2013) through General Linear Model and Mixed Linear Model. Our study identified ninety-six significant marker-trait associations (MTAs;  < 0.05) of which, several MTAs with correlation coefficient () > 10% were consistently represented in both models and in both seasons for traits ., oil content,  content, linoleic  content and number of primary branches. Several MTAs with high -values were detected either in a majority or in some environments (models and/or seasons). Many MTAs were also common between traits (., /linoleic  content; plant height/days to 50% flowering; number of primary branches/number of capitula per plant) that showed positive or negative correlation in their phenotypic values. The marker-trait associations identified in this study will facilitate marker-assisted breeding and identification of genetic determinants of trait variability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054773>Fresh and stored copra meal in meat quail diets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the addition of fresh and stored copra meal to the diet of meat quails. Two hundred eighty-seven-day-old male and female quails were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five treatments, in a 2 × 2 + 1factorial arrangement. Two copra meal types (fresh and stored) at inclusion levels of 12.5% and 25%, respectively, were added to a corn-soybean meal-based diet, with seven replicates, of eight quails each. Copra meal acidity index recorded  percentage increase from 0.47 to 3.03% after six storage months. However, regardless of storage type, its addition to quails' diet resulted in higher values of metabolizable energy, in lower feed intake and better feed conversion than corn-soybean meal diet. Copra meal addition to quails' diet did not affect carcass traits, liver and pancreas relative , and bone growth and quality. Although copra meal storage for 180 days resulted in higher free fatty  content in the provided feed, it can be used fresh or after storage, in diet of meat quails from 7 to 42 days of age up to 25%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043568>Phenolics, tocopherols and fatty  profiling of wild and commercial mushrooms from Pakistan.</a></h2><p>Mushrooms can be used as nutraceutical or functional foods to maintain and promote good health.

Fisetin has also been demonstrated to have anti-obesity properties in mice. However, the effect of fisetin on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still elusive. Thus, the present study evaluated whether fisetin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and regulates lipid metabolism of FL83B hepatocytes in vitro.NAFLD was induced by HFD in male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with fisetin for 10 weeks. In another experiment, FL83B cells were challenged with  to induce lipid accumulation and treated with various concentrations of fisetin.NAFLD mice treated with fisetin had decreased  and epididymal adipose tissue  compared to NAFLD mice. Fisetin treatment also reduced liver lipid droplet and hepatocyte steatosis, alleviated serum free fatty , and leptin concentrations, significantly decreased fatty  synthase, and significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα and the production of sirt-1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the liver tissue. In vitro, fisetin decreased lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.This study suggests that fisetin is a potential novel treatment for alleviating hepatic lipid metabolism and improving NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK and β-oxidation pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

Enhanced incretin release may have beneficial metabolic effects. However, dietary fat may promote  gain and should therefore be restricted in obesity. We designed C4-dietary oil (1,3-di-butyryl-2-oleoyl glycerol) as a 2-oleoyl glycerol (2-OG)-generating fat type, which would stimulate incretin release to the same extent while providing less calories than equimolar amounts of common triglycerides, e.g., olive oil.We studied the effect over 180 min of (a) 19 g olive oil plus 200 g carrot, (b) 10.7 g C4 dietary oil plus 200 g carrot and (c) 200 g carrot, respectively, on plasma responses of gut and pancreatic hormones in 13 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Theoretically, both oil meals result in formation of 7.7 g 2-OG during digestion.Both olive oil and C4-dietary oil resulted in greater postprandial (P ≤ 0.01) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses (incremental area under curve (iAUC)): iAUC: 645 ± 194 and 702 ± 97 pM × min; iAUC: 4,338 ± 764 and 2,894 ± 601 pM × min) compared to the carrot meal (iAUC: 7 ± 103 pM × min; iAUC: 266 ± 234 pM × min). iAUC for GLP-1 and GIP were similar for C4-dietary oil and olive oil, although olive oil resulted in a higher peak value for GIP than C4-dietary oil.C4-dietary oil enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP to almost the same extent as olive oil, in spite of liberation of both 2-OG and , which also may stimulate incretin secretion, from olive oil. Thus, C4-dietary oil is more effective as incretin releaser than olive oil per unit of energy and may be useful for dietary intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845214>Effect of hesperetin derivatives on the development of selenite‑induced cataracts in rats.</a></h2><p>Cataracts are a major cause of blindness worldwide. As anti‑cataract pharmaceutical therapies require long‑term treatment, identifying anti‑cataract compounds that are ubiquitous in the human diet, have no adverse effects and are affordable, is of paramount importance. The present study focused on hesperetin and its derived compounds, hesperetin stearic  ester (Hes‑S) and hesperetin  ester (Hes‑O), in order to investigate their therapeutic potential to treat cataracts in a selenite animal model. Thirteen‑day‑old Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 12 groups. Animals in groups 1 and 7 were subcutaneously injected with vehicle, those in groups 2 and 8 were administered hesperetin, those in groups 3 and 9 received stearic , those in groups 4 and 10 were injected with , those in groups 5 and 11 were administered Hes‑S, and those in groups 6 and 12 received Hes‑O (10 nmol/kg  on days 0, 1 and 2). Animals in groups 7 to 12 were treated with sodium selenite (20 µmol/kg  given 4 h following the test compound treatment on day 0) to induce cataract. On day 6, rats had less severe central opacities and lower stage cataracts than rats in the selenite treatment‑only control groups. The levels of glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic  (AsA) in lenses with selenite‑induced cataracts declined to one‑third of that of controls, and the reduction in GSH and AsA levels was rescued following hesperetin, Hes‑S or Hes‑O treatment, with concentrations remaining to 70‑80% of that of controls. However, there were no changes in the plasma levels of GSH and AsA following treatments. Administration of either hesperetin or hesperetin‑derived compounds prevented the reduction of chaperone activity in the lens, and rats treated with Hes‑S or Hes‑O treatment had significantly greater chaperone activity than hesperetin‑treated rats. Collectively, these results suggested that hesperetin and hesperetin‑derived compounds may be novel drug compounds that have the potential to prevent or delay the onset of cataracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773586>Diets Enriched with Conventional or High- Canola Oils Lower Atherogenic Lipids and Lipoproteins Compared to a Diet with a Western Fatty  Profile in Adults with Central Adiposity.</a></h2><p>Novel oils high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are an alternative to partially hydrogenated oils high in trans-unsaturated fatty acids. There is widespread use of high-MUFA oils across the food industry; however, limited knowledge of their cardiovascular impact exists.We investigated the effects of diets containing canola oil, high- canola oil (HOCO), and a control oil blend (diet formulated to emulate a Western fat profile) on lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apos), as secondary outcomes of the trial.In a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, 3-period crossover, controlled feeding trial, men (n = 44) and women (n = 75) with a mean age of 44 y, mean  mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) of 31.7, and an increased waist circumference plus ≥1 metabolic syndrome criteria consumed prepared, -maintenance diets containing canola oil [17.5% MUFAs, 9.2% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), 6.6% SFAs], HOCO (19.1% MUFAs, 7.0% PUFAs, 6.4% SFAs), or control oil (10.5% MUFAs, 10.0% PUFAs, 12.3% SFAs) for 6 wk with ≥4-wk washouts. Fasting serum lipids were assessed at baseline and 6 wk. Diet effects were examined using a repeated  mixed model.Compared with the control, canola and HOCO diets resulted in lower endpoint total cholesterol (TC; -4.2% and -3.4%; P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (-6.6% and -5.6%; P < 0.0001), apoB (-3.7% and -3.4%; P = 0.002), and non-HDL cholesterol (-4.5% and -4.0%; P = 0.001), with no differences between canola diets. The TC:HDL cholesterol and apoB:apoA1 ratios were lower after the HOCO diet than after the control diet (-3.7% and -3.4%, respectively). There were no diet effects on triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, or apoA1 concentrations.HOCO, with increased MUFAs at the expense of decreased PUFAs, elicited beneficial effects on lipids and lipoproteins comparable to conventional canola oil and consistent with reduced cardiovascular disease risk in adults with central adiposity.

During the development of obesity and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty  oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than  loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver  and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, the Cs₂CO₃, PbO, Tetrabutylammonium Bromide (TOAB) powder, , and toluene solvent were uniformly mixed and purified to prepare high-quality QDs powders. Then, hexane was used as a dispersing agent for the QD powder to complete the perovskite QDs-CsPbBr₃ solution. Finally, a solution with different proportions of quantum dots CsPbBr₃ and PMMA was prepared and discussed. In the preparation of thin films, firstly, a thin film with the structure of glass/QD-CsPbBr₃/PMMA was fabricated in a glove box using a well-developed QDs-CsPbBr₃ solution by changing the ratio of CsPbBr₃:PMMA.

The effects of the B100 and B100⁻ blends on polymeric materials were examined by comparing changes in the gain/loss of mass and by measuring the hardness, the impact strength, and the tensile strength of the materials at the end of the exposure. The characterization of the polymers was carried out before and after exposure by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). After the immersion in B100⁻acids blends, the HDPE exhibited an increase in mass of 5%, which was very similar in all blends. The PA66 showed a small decrease in  (2% approx.) in all mixtures. The POM presented an increase in the percentage of  in the mixture of B100 with acetic  of 0.3%. A decrease was observed in the crystallinity of the HDPE when exposed to blends of B100⁻acids. This behavior may be associated with a plasticizing effect in the HDPE exposed to the blends. The mechanical properties of POM and HDPE showed no significant changes after immersion in the fuels. On the other hand, PA66 exhibited a significant decrease in maximum stress value after immersion in B100, B100⁻ and B100⁻palmitic  blends. The variation of the mechanical properties of the PA66 after exposure to B100 was potentiated by addition of organic acids. The assessed polymers did not undergo appreciable changes in the chemical structure of the samples after immersion in the fuels, so the variation in the mechanical properties could be explained by physical absorption of the fuel into the polymers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083505>Protective Effects of Licochalcone A Ameliorates Obesity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Via Promotion of the Sirt-1/AMPK Pathway in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Licochalcone A is a chalcone isolated from . It showed anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with acute lung injuries and regulated lipid metabolism through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes. However, the effects of licochalcone A on reducing  gain and improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated  loss and lipid metabolism in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a fatty liver cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with  and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased  as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue  compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue  and lipid droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of lipogenesis and fatty  synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty  chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes. Licochalcone A can potentially ameliorate obesity and NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773209>Relationship between polyunsaturated fatty  and eating disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Eating disorders result in poor nutrition, poor physical conditions and even suicidality and mortality. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and  and lower levels of adrenic , arachidonic , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to  outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific lipid metabolism under starvation state. To investigate the role of PUFAs on psychopathological and therapeutic effects in eating disorders, further larger clinical studies are warranted.Copyright © 2019.

Meat samples were collected from the longissimus dorsi muscles of 1000 Hanwoo steers that were 30-month-old (progeny of 85 proven Hanwoo bulls) to determine intramuscular fatty  profiles. Phenotypic data on carcass  (CWT), eye muscle area (EMA), back fat thickness (BFT), marbling score (MS), Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and intramuscular fat content (IMF) were also investigated using this half-sib population. Variance and covari.ance components were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood procedures under univariate and pairwise bivariate animal models.  (C18:1n-9) was the most abundant fatty , accounting for 50.69% of all investigated fatty acids, followed by palmitic (C16:0; 27.33%) and stearic  (C18:0; 10.96%). The contents of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were 41.64%, 56.24% and 2.10%, respectively, and the MUFA/SFA ratio, PUFA/SFA ratio, desaturation index (DI) and elongation index (EI) were 1.36, 0.05, 0.59 and 0.66, respectively. The h 2 estimates for individual fatty acids ranged from very low to high (0.03±0.14 to 0.63±0.14). The h 2 estimates for SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, DI and EI were 0.53±0.14, 0.49±0.14, 0.23±0.10, 0.51±0.13 and 0.53±0.13, respectively. The genetic and phenotypic correlations among individual fatty acids and fatty  classes varied widely (-0.99 to 0.99). Notably, C18:1n-9 had favourable (negative) genetic correlations with two detrimental fatty acids, C14:0 (-0.76) and C16:0 (-0.92). Genetic correlations of individual and group fatty acids with CWT, EMA, BFT, MS, WBSF and IMF ranged from low to moderate (both positive and negative) with the exception of low-concentration PUFAs. Low or near-zero phenotypic correlations reflected potential non-genetic contributions. This study provides insights on genetic variability and correlations among intramuscular fatty acids as well as correlations between fatty acids and carcass and meat-quality traits, which could be used in Hanwoo breeding programmes to improve fatty  compositions in meat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453116>Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic fraction obtained from stranded driftwood feedstocks for lipid production by .</a></h2><p>Stranded driftwood feedstocks may represent, after pretreatment with steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis, a cheap C-source for producing biochemicals and biofuels using oleaginous yeasts. The hydrolysis was optimized using a response surface methodology (RSM). The solid loading (SL) and the dosage of enzyme cocktail (ED) were variated following a central composite design (CCD) aimed at optimizing the conversion of carbohydrates into lipids (Y) by the yeast  DBVPG 5870. A second-order polynomial equation was computed for describing the effect of ED and SL on Y. The best combination (ED = 3.10%; SL = 22.07%) for releasing the optimal concentration of carbohydrates which gave the highest predicted Y (27.32%) was then validated by a new hydrolysis.

The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%),  (34.20%) and linolenic  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in , fat , and abnormal serum lipids induced by high-fat diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039663>Replacing Saturated Fat With Walnuts or Vegetable Oils Improves Central Blood Pressure and Serum Lipids in Adults at Risk for Cardiovascular Disease: A Randomized Controlled-Feeding Trial.</a></h2><p>Background Walnuts have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors, but it is unclear whether these effects are attributable to the fatty  ( FA ) content, including α-linolenic  ( ALA ), and/or bioactives. Methods and Results A randomized, controlled, 3-period, crossover, feeding trial was conducted in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease (n=45). Following a 2-week standard Western diet run-in (12% saturated FAs [ SFA ], 7% polyunsaturated FAs, 12% monounsaturated FAs), participants consumed 3 isocaloric -maintenance diets for 6 weeks each: a walnut diet ( WD ; 7% SFA , 16% polyunsaturated FAs, 3% ALA , 9% monounsaturated FAs); a walnut FA -matched diet; and an -replaced- ALA diet (7% SFA , 14% polyunsaturated FAs, 0.5% ALA , 12% monounsaturated FAs), which substituted the amount of ALA from walnuts in the WD with . This design enabled evaluation of the effects of whole walnuts versus constituent components. The primary end point, central systolic blood pressure, was unchanged, and there were no significant changes in arterial stiffness. There was a treatment effect ( P=0.04) for central diastolic blood pressure; there was a greater change following the WD versus the -replaced-ALA diet (-1.78±1.0 versus 0.15±0.7 mm Hg, P=0.04). There were no differences between the WD and the walnut fatty -matched diet (-0.22±0.8 mm Hg, P=0.20) or the walnut FA-matched and -replaced-ALA diets ( P=0.74). The WD significantly lowered brachial and central mean arterial pressure. All diets lowered total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and non- HDL cholesterol. Conclusions Cardiovascular benefits occurred with all moderate-fat, high-unsaturated-fat diets. As part of a low- SFA diet, the greater improvement in central diastolic blood pressure following the WD versus the -replaced-ALA diet indicates benefits of walnuts as a whole-food replacement for SFA .

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for  loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (, found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly palmitic  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective. Importantly, both olive oil as part of a Mediterranean diet, and omega-3 from fish and fish oil have been proven to reduce risk of cardiovascular (CV) events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649154>Chemical and Nutritional Composition of Terminalia ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Kernels: A Novel Nutrition Source.</a></h2><p> (Kakadu plum) is a native Australian fruit. Industrial processing of  fruits into puree generates seeds as a by-product, which are generally discarded. The aim of our present study was to process the seed to separate the kernel and determine its nutritional composition. The proximate, mineral and fatty  compositions were analysed in this study. Kernels are composed of 35% fat, while proteins account for 32% dry  (DW). The energy content and fiber were 2065 KJ/100 g and 21.2% DW, respectively. Furthermore, the study showed that kernels were a very rich source of minerals and trace elements, such as potassium (6693 mg/kg), calcium (5385 mg/kg), iron (61 mg/kg) and zinc (60 mg/kg) DW, and had low levels of heavy metals. The fatty  composition of the kernels consisted of omega-6 fatty , linoleic  (50.2%), monounsaturated  (29.3%) and two saturated fatty acids namely palmitic  (12.0%) and stearic  (7.2%).

There were 80 compounds, representing 99.99% of the total oil constituents. Among these, 77.31% were sesquiterpenes, 14.62% were fatty acids, 7.21% were other components (i.e., phenolics, hydrocarbons, etc.), and 0.85% were monoterpenes. The major compounds in the oil were γ-eudesmol (35.31%), 5-guaien-11-ol (14.43%), -cedrol (8.19%),  (5.23%), bulnesol (4.45%), α-linoleic  (4.20%), 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic  (3.83%), palmitic  (2.69%), isolongifolanone (2.68%), eicosane (1.41%), and cedrol (1.14%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were found to represent more than 50% percent of the total oil content. Moreover, the essential oil was evaluated for anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antipyretic, and antinociceptive activities using  and  models. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of the oil was evaluated using various  antioxidant tests, including DPPH, ABTS and FRAP. At a dose of 240 µl/kg, the oil showed anti-inflammatory (59.12%), antipyretic (37.00 ± 0.11), and antinociceptive (47.58%) activities and showed significant (p < 0.001) effect as compared to a standard drug (phenylbutazone and indomethacin).

The aim of this research was to develop FA modified SS bonds based prodrug of CDDP (namely FA-ss-CDDP) and Tf modified cystamine- (Tf-ss-OA). Further, FA-ss-CDDP and Tf-ss-OA were used to prepare NPs, which could target the lung tumor cells through receptor-mediated pathways to increase the efficiency of CDDP. FA and Tf modified CDDP loaded NPs (FA/Tf-CDDP-NPs) were constructed. The physiochemical properties, in vitro drug release profiles, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo biodistribution were investigated. The antitumor effect of self-assembed NPs was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. FA/Tf-CDDP-NPs exhibited remarkably enhanced accumulation in tumor tissue and better tumor inhibition effect in vitro and in vivo. FA/Tf-CDDP-NPs displayed almost complete suppression of tumor growth with no obviously  change of the treated mice. The newly constructed NPs could successfully load drugs and showed better efficiency than free drug formula; and FA/TF could function as excellent targeting ligands to improve the cell targeting ability of the NPs. The resulting FA/Tf-CDDP-NPs offered a promising tumor therapy strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism in BrCa have been widely reported, yet the contribution of fatty acids (FAs) in BrCa biology remains to be determined. We recently reported that adipocyte coculture alters MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell metabolism and promotes proliferation and migration. Since adipocytes are FA-rich, and these FAs are transferred to BrCa cells, we sought to elucidate the FA metabolism of BrCa cells and their response to FA-rich environments. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in serum-containing media supplemented with FAs accumulate extracellular FAs as intracellular triacylglycerols (TAG) in a dose-dependent manner, with MDA-MB-231 cells accumulating more TAG. The differences in TAG levels were a consequence of distinct differences in intracellular partitioning of FAs, and not due to differences in the rate of FA uptake. Specifically, MCF-7 cells preferentially partition FAs into mitochondrial oxidation, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells partition FAs into TAG synthesis. These differences in intracellular FA handling underpin differences in the sensitivity to palmitate-induced lipotoxicity, with MDA-MB-231 cells being highly sensitive, whereas MCF-7 cells are partially protected. The attenuation of palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in MCF-7 cells was reversed by inhibition of FA oxidation. Pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FAs increased TAG synthesis and reduced palmitate-induced apoptosis. Our results provide novel insight into the potential influences of obesity on BrCa biology, highlighting distinct differences in FA metabolism in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and how lipid-rich environments modulate these effects.© 2018 The Authors.

Cows were blocked by milk yield and assigned to 3 groups (12 cows per group) in a main plot: low (45.2 ± 1.7 kg/d), medium (53.0 ± 1.6 kg/d), and high (60.0 ± 1.9 kg/d). Within each production group, a truncated Latin square arrangement of fatty  (FA) treatments was used in 2 consecutive 35-d periods. The FA treatments supplemented at 1.5% of diet dry matter were (1) 80:10 (80% C16:0 + 10% cis-9 C18:1), (2) 73:17 (73% C16:0 + 17% cis-9 C18:1), (3) 66:24 (66% C16:0 + 24% cis-9 C18:1), and (4) 60:30 (60% C16:0 + 30% cis-9 C18:1). Treatment × production group interactions were observed for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, milk fat, milk protein, and milk lactose and energy partitioned to milk. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments reduced fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk energy output in low-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments did not affect milk yield, milk protein yield, and milk lactose yield in low- and medium-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Regardless of production level, there was no effect of treatments on dry matter intake; however, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased  change and  condition score change. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased total FA digestibility due to a linear increase in 16- and 18-carbon FA digestibilities. Interactions between FA treatments and production level were observed for the yield of milk fat and milk FA sources. In low-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments decreased milk fat yield due to a decrease in de novo and mixed milk FA without changes in preformed milk FA. In contrast, in high-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased milk fat yield due to an increase in de novo and preformed milk FA. Our results indicate that high-producing dairy cows (averaging 60 kg/d) responded better to a fat supplement containing more cis-9 C18:1, whereas low-producing cows (averaging 45 kg/d) responded better to a supplement containing more C16:0.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Pigs were offered four diets that contained either pectin or cellulose with or without beef tallow or maize oil in two Youden square designs (n 6). Each period lasted 15 d. Faeces, ileal and caecal contents were collected to determine apparent ileal digestibility (AID), apparent caecal digestibility and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dietary components. The interactions between DF and lipid types influenced (P &lt;0·05) the digestibility of DM and FA flows. The addition of maize oil decreased (P &lt;0·05) AID of DM in pectin diets, and the addition of beef tallow depressed (P &lt;0·001) ATTD of DM in cellulose diets. Dietary supplementation with beef tallow decreased (P &lt;0·05) the AID of FA in pectin-containing diets but had no effects in cellulose-containing diets. Dietary supplementation with beef tallow increased (P &lt;0·05) AID of SFA and PUFA and the flow of ileal , vaccenic, linolenic and eicosadienoic acids and reduced the flow of faecal lauric, docosatetraenoic and docosapentaenoic acids in pectin- and cellulose-containing diets. In conclusion, the interaction between DF type and lipid saturation modulates digestibility of DM and lipids and FA flows but differs for soluble and insoluble fibre sources, SFA and unsaturated fatty acids and varies in different gastrointestinal segments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603449>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of lipo-alkaloids and fatty acids in Aconitum carmichaelii using LC-MS and GC-MS.</a></h2><p>Lipo-alkaloid (LA) is a kind of C -norditerpenoid alkaloid in Aconitum species, which usually contains an aconitane skeleton and one or two fatty  residues.To qualify and quantify the fatty acids and lipo-alkaloids in Aconitum carmichaelii.An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QQQ-MS) method was established to quantify LAs, while the free fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS).Six major LAs (1-6) containing linoleic, palmitic, and  residues as side chains were quantified. Eighteen fatty acids were determined by GC-MS, and 15 were detected as the side chains of LAs. The LAs containing these 15 fatty  residues accounted for about a third of the total identified LAs.

While chemical synthesis often leads to undesired racemic mixtures, microbial production allows obtaining optically pure lactones. The production of a specific lactone by biotransformation depends on the supply of the corresponding hydroxy fatty , which has economic and industrial value similar to γ-lactones. Hence, the identification and exploration of microorganisms with the rare natural ability for de novo biosynthesis of lactones will contribute to the long-term sustainability of microbial production. In this study, the innate ability of Ashbya gossypii for de novo production of γ-lactones from glucose was evaluated and improved.Characterization of the volatile organic compounds produced by nine strains of this industrial filamentous fungus in glucose-based medium revealed the noteworthy presence of seven chemically different γ-lactones. To decipher and understand the de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones from glucose, we developed metabolic engineering strategies focused on the fatty  biosynthesis and the β-oxidation pathways. Overexpression of AgDES589, encoding a desaturase for the conversion of  (C18:1) into linoleic  (C18:2), and deletion of AgELO624, which encodes an elongase that catalyses the formation of C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acids, greatly increased the production of γ-lactones (up to 6.4-fold; (7.6 ± 0.8) × 10 µg/g). Further substitution of AgPOX1, encoding the exclusive acyl-CoA oxidase in A. gossypii, by a codon-optimized POX2 gene from Yarrowia lipolytica, which encodes a specific long chain acyl-CoA oxidase, fine-tuned the biosynthesis of γ-decalactone to a relative production of more than 99%.This study demonstrates the potential of A. gossypii as a model and future platform for de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones. By means of metabolic engineering, key enzymatic steps involved in their production were elucidated. Moreover, the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies developed resulted in improved de novo biosynthesis of γ-decalactone. In sum, these proof-of-concept data revealed yet unknown metabolic and genetic determinants important for the future exploration of the de novo production of γ-lactones as an alternative to biotransformation processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602867>Effect of Gangjihwan on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in high fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>Gangjihwan (DF), a polyherbal drug composed of Ephedra intermedia Schrenk et C. A. Mayer (Ephedraceae), Lithospermum erythrorhizon Siebold et Zuccarini (Borraginaceae), and Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), is used to treat obesity in local Korean clinics. The constituents of DF have traditionally been reported to exert anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of DF on obesity and NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms.DF was extracted with water (DF-FW), 30% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA30), or 70% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA70). The chemical profile of DF was monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet analysis. The effects of DF on indices of obesity and NAFLD in high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Oil red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry.The presence of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, aloe-emodin, and emodin in DF was determined by 3D chromatography using HPLC. Administration of DF-GA70 to HFD-fed obese mice decreased , epididymal adipose tissue mass, and epididymal adipocyte size. DF-GA70 reduced serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All three DF extracts lowered serum alanine transaminase levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages, with the largest effects observed for DF-GA70. DF-GA70 increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation genes and decreased mRNA levels of genes for lipogenesis and inflammation in the liver of obese mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, whereas all three DF extracts inhibited lipid accumulation. DF-GA70 also altered the expression of lipolytic and lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells.These results indicate that DF inhibits obesity and obesity-induced severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation without any adverse effects and that these effects may be mediated by regulation of the hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and inflammatory genes.

HepG2 cells treated with  (OA) in the presence of SCE exhibited reduced OA-induced lipid accumulation, which was likely mediated by reductions in SREBP-1c expression. SCE attenuated the acetylation of total lysine and H3K9 that was otherwise increased by OA. Male obese mice fed with either a low-fat diet or Western diet exhibited reduced  and liver  when supplemented with 1% SCE. The SCE-mediated attenuation of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of lipogenic genes. SCE also attenuated the expression of acetylated lysine and non-acetylated forms of H3K9 acetylation in the livers of these mice. Taken together, these results suggest that SCE has potential for further development as a novel therapeutic agent for the prevention of steatosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The lentivirus vector carrying the human VEGF165 gene was constructed. According to the random number table method, 90 male SD rats were divided into ALI model group, phosphate buffer solution (PBS) group, EPCs treatment group, none transfected EPCs treatment group and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group, and the rats in each group were subdivided into 4, 12 and 48 hours subgroups, with 6 rats in each subgroup. The rat model of ALI was reproduced by intravenous injection of  (0.15 μL/g). Then each treatment group was given PBS, EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs respectively with the same volume of 0.2 mL. For the groups with cells, about 1×10 cells were contained. Abdominal aortic blood and lung tissue were harvested at 4, 12 and 48 hours. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed. The lung wet/dry  ratio (W/D) was calculated. The expressions of induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and VEGF165 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After dyed with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), the lung tissue pathology was observed and the lung injury score was performed.Compared with the ALI model group, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO) in EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment groups was significantly increased from 4 hours, and lung W/D, expressions of iNOS and ET-1 were significantly decreased, and VEGF165 expression was significantly increased. Compared with the EPCs treatment group, the increase in PaO, the decrease in lung W/D and expressions of iNOS and ET-1, and the increase in VEGF165 expression in VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group were more significant [4 hours: PaO (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) was 82.84±10.69 vs. 72.34±9.36, lung W/D ratio was 4.83±0.23 vs. 5.55±0.37, iNOS (ng/mg) was 8.77±1.10 vs. 14.84±1.34, ET-1 (ng/mg) was 103.41±5.66 vs. 153.08±5.12, VEGF165 (ng/mg) was 130.56±12.16 vs. 83.03±5.95; 12 hours: PaO (mmHg) was 91.67±6.81 vs. 78.5±8.81, lung W/D ratio was 4.44±0.35 vs. 5.32±0.25, iNOS (ng/mg) was 7.23±0.24 vs. 14.04±1.18, ET-1 (ng/mg) was 91.98±3.52 vs. 125.99±7.55, VEGF165 (ng/mg) was 164.49±5.71 vs. 96.61±6.12]; individual parameters reached valley value or peak value at 48 hours [lung W/D ratio was 4.26±0.30 vs. 4.89±0.15, iNOS (ng/mg) was 5.79±0.85 vs. 12.72±1.10, ET-1 (ng/mg) was 74.53±7.10 vs. 108.33±5.84, VEGF165 (ng/mg) was 237.43±10.79 vs. 134.24±11.99, all P < 0.05]. Over time, lung tissue injury in each group was gradually increased, and the lung injury score was gradually increased. The lung injury score at 48 hours in the EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment groups were lower than that in the ALI model group. Compared with the EPCs treatment group, the VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group had a lower score at 48 hours (8.50±1.05 vs. 10.50±1.05, P < 0.05).The transplantation of EPCs which were transfected with VEGF165 mediated by lentivirus could obviously improve the oxygen pressure, reduce the lung water seepage, decrease the iNOS and ET-1 expressions in lung tissue, and had obvious protective effects on ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29282029>Docosahexaenoic  reduces sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and fatty  synthase expression and inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting pAkt signaling in a human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.</a></h2><p>Fatty  synthase (FASN), the major enzyme in de novo fatty  synthesis, is highly expressed in breast cancer and its expression is reduced by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in liver. We previously found a positive association between rat mammary tumor levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic  (AA) and tumor . We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or  (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation.DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin.We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811133>[New functional food ingredient - lipid module, source of astaxantine and plasmalogenes].</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to study the impact of modification of fatty acids composition of laboratory animals' diet in the presence of plasmalogenes (PG), astaxanthin (ASTA) and their combination on animals' adaptation potential in stress conditions.The fatty acids composition of diet was altered with the use of lipid module, containing 88.7% of high  sunflower oil, 6.3% of coconut oil and 5% of micralagae Schizochytrium sp. oil. The experiment was conducted with the use of 80 male Wistar rats with initial  125±5 g. Selected animals (n=50) were divided into 5 groups according to their activity in tests «Open field» (OF) and «Elevated plus-maze» (EPM). The animals of control group 1st were not exposed to physiological tests - this was an intact control group. The animals of control groups 1st and 2nd were treated with standard half-synthetic diets for 30 days [381 kcal/100 g of dry food, 20.1% of casein on calories, 10% of fat (the mixture of lard and sunflower oil in 1:1 ratio)]. In the diet of 3d group animals the sunflower oil (50% of fat in the diet) was substituted with lipid module, enriched with ASTA (4.0±0.3 mg/day/kg b.w.); in the diet of group 4 animals - with lipid module, enriched with PG (79.0±2.0 mg/day/kg b.w.); in the diet of group 5 animals - with lipid module, enriched with ASTA and PG (the same doses). The evaluation of anxiety level and total exploration activity was conducted in «elevated plus maze» test. On the 31st day of experiment, animals were exposed to forced swim test for evaluation of their physical endurance and capacity in the conditions of high stress.The introduction into the animal diet of lipid module, enriched with PG and/or ASTA had pronounced hypolipidemic effect, lowered total serum cholesterol against a background of decrease in low-density lypoproteins (LDL) level. The concentration of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) - docosahexaenoic  in liver cells of animals treated with lipid module enriched with PG and/or ASTA increased more the 3 times, while ω-6 linoleic  decreased twice. The consumption of enriched with ASTA lipid module inhibited the increase in blood corticosterone level after stress (exhausting physical exercise) and lowered it to the control animals values, thus showing adaptogenic effect. The animals treated with lipid module enriched with ASTA (group 3) spent significantly less time in open arms of the maze in comparison with the first test, what may show the increase in anxiety level. The introduction of PG into lipid module neutralized this effect. The forced swim test with load showed no increase in working ability and endurance of animals of all tested groups.The further study of adaptogenic action of PG in combination with ASTA in the composition of lipid module compared to the similar effect of traditional phospholipids is of special interest.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28564636>Depot-specific differences in fat mass expansion in WT and ob/ob mice.</a></h2><p>The study was designed to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the differential fat expansion in different fat depots in wild type (WT) and ob/ob (OB) mice. At 6 weeks old, no differences in fat mass were found between SAT and VAT in WT mice, while O-SAT showed significantly higher  than that of O-VAT. The average adipocyte size of SAT (~ 4133.47 μm2) was smaller than that of VAT (~ 7438.91 μm2) in OB mice. O-SAT preadipocytes gained higher triglyceride contents and higher levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα than did O-VAT preadipocytes upon in vitro differentiation. W-SAT and W-VAT displayed no significant differences in fatty  uptake, while 1.36 fold significantly higher fatty  uptake was found in O-SAT compared to O-VAT. Approximately 52% of the radioactivity recovered in cellular lipids was found in TAG in O-SAT, which was significantly higher than the other three adipocyte types. Significantly more radiolabelled  was β-oxidized to CO2 in adipocytes from O-VAT than that from O-SAT. ATP production was significantly lower in W-SAT compared with W-VAT, whereas no significantly ATP level was observed between O-SAT and O-VAT. Expression of UCP-1 in SAT from either WT or OB mice was significantly higher than the counterpart of VAT, which demonstrated higher uncoupled respiration and lower oxidative phosphorylation in SAT. Together, a combined increase in adipogenesis and FA uptake, and decreases in β-oxidation and ATP production, contributed to greater expansion of SAT compared to VAT in obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211867>Effects of corn dried distillers' grains with solubles on performance, egg quality, yolk fatty  composition and oxidative status in laying ducks.</a></h2><p>The study investigated the effects of increasing content of corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in the diets of laying ducks on oxidative status, laying performance, egg quality, and egg yolk fatty  composition. Longyan females (1080) with similar BW at 17 wk of age were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups, each consisting of 6 replicates of 30 birds. The basal diet (I) was a typical corn-soybean ration while the experimental diets (II to VI) substituted corn DDGS for soybean meal and wheat bran and a small reduction of corn. The level of substitution in diets (II to VI) was 6%, 12%, 18%, 24% and 30%. The experiment lasted for 18 wk. Average egg  decreased linearly as the level of corn DDGS inclusion increased (P < 0.001). Haugh unit, albumen , and proportion declined as linear responses to corn DDGS substitution (P < 0.05), but yolk color linearly increased (P < 0.001); the proportions of  (C18:1) and total monounsaturated fatty acids in egg yolk linearly decreased with increasing corn DDGS and many of the key polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like linoleic (C18:2n-6), arachidonic (C20:4n-6) and α-linolenic (C18:3n-3) acids linearly increased (P < 0.001), but not those of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docoshexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids. The PUFAs n-6/n-3 ratio linearly increased with increasing corn DDGS level (P < 0.001). Increasing corn DDGS linearly increased hepatic expression of GPX1, HO-1, and Nrf2 and hepatic activity of GSH-Px and the liver content of MDA (P < 0.001). There were no treatment effects on egg production, egg mass, feed conversion ratio, eggshell thickness, strength, and yolk cholesterol content (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the current study indicates that the use of corn DDGS is possible as a replacement, primarily for soybean meal at levels up to 18% in the diets of laying ducks without affecting laying performance, egg quality, and antioxidant status. Increasing amounts of corn DDGS linearly increased egg yolk concentrations of key fatty acids like like C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 and the antioxidant enzyme activity of GSH-Px through the Nrf2 pathway to avoid oxidative stress.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712532>Influence of different intravenous lipid emulsions on growth, development and laboratory and clinical outcomes in hospitalised paediatric patients: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Fats in the form of lipid emulsions (LEs) are an integral part of intravenous nutrition. The fatty  composition of different LEs varies. The exact composition of a LE may influence cell and tissue function and clinical outcome. Currently, it is not clear which LE might be best for paediatric patients. We conducted a systematic review of the effects of different intravenous LEs in hospitalised paediatric patients.Randomised controlled trials published in a peer reviewed journal, written in the English language, and comparing two or more different intravenous LEs in hospitalised paediatric patients were included. Data on outcomes of relevance (growth, development, laboratory and clinical outcomes) were extracted, collated and interpreted.Thirty-one articles involving 1522 infants or children were included. Most outcomes were not affected by the nature of the LE used. LEs containing fish oil, a source of omega-3 fatty acids, improved outcome of retinopathy of prematurity, decreased liver cholestasis and increased blood omega-3 fatty  levels. LEs containing olive oil increased blood  level and had a cholesterol lowering effect.Blood fatty acids are influenced by the nature of the intravenous LE used in hospitalised paediatric patients. Most studies suggest limited differences in relevant laboratory or clinical outcomes or in growth in paediatric patients receiving different LEs, although several studies do find benefits from including fish oil or olive oil. There is a need for larger trials to fully evaluate the effects of the available LE types in hospitalised paediatric patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high-fat diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and . APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This single-blinded 3-way cross-over pilot study aimed to investigate the ability of the two most abundant dietary plant-derived fats,  (OA) and linoleic (LA) acids, to modulate postprandial appetite and levels of circulating appetite and metabolic regulators in overweight/obese individuals. Meals were a high-carbohydrate control, a high-OA or a high-LA meal, and provided 30% of participants' estimated energy requirements. Meals were consumed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected over 3¼ h. Appetite parameters were assessed via a validated visual analogue scale questionnaire. Hormones and other circulating factors were quantified using multiplex immunoassays. Eight participants (age 45.8 ± 3.6 (years),  mass index 32.0 ± 1.3 (kg/m²)) completed the study. All meals significantly increased fullness and reduced desire to eat. The control and high-OA meals significantly decreased prospective food intake. The high-LA meal increased ghrelin levels ( < 0.05), a hormone which encourages food intake. This was coupled with a significant acute increase in resistin levels, which impairs insulin signaling. Taken together, this study indicates that in overweight/obese individuals, high-LA meals may promote excess energy intake and alter glucose handling, though a larger cohort may be required to strengthen results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30165350>Inhibition of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Increased Lipid Accumulation Through SREBP1 Modulation.</a></h2><p>Excess energy intake leads to metabolic dysfunction, accompanied by oxidative stress and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation.To determine the role of PARP activation in the incidence of metabolic dysfunction, PJ34, the PARP inhibitor, was administered to the -treated hepatoma cells and high-fat diet-fed mice. The expression of genes was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Lipid droplets in the cells and tissues were stained with Oil Red O.PJ34 treatment aggravated -induced lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells and induced SREBP1 expression by modulating the modification of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). The high-fat diet-mice exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation after 3 months of feeding. Although the serum level of lipid was not altered after PJ34 treatment, the expression level of lipogenic gene was up-regulated and the lipid accumulation was increased in the liver tissues of high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice. In the high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice, the insulin sensitivity was slightly changed and the levels of blood glucose and serum insulin were decreased compared with the mice fed with a high-fat diet alone.Taken together, PARP inhibition up-regulated the expression level of lipogenic gene and significantly induced lipid accumulation in the liver, which might worsen lipid metabolism disorders. These data will guide future research into the application of PARP inhibitors in the management of metabolic diseases.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The metabolic feature of pigs after intake of corn-soybean meal or casein-starch diets are largely unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the dynamic postprandial changes of plasma metabolic profile using growing pigs using metabolomics.Twenty-four growing pigs with average initial  (BW) about 30 kg were placed in metabolic cages and then fitted with precaval vein catheters. Pigs were fed daily 4% of initial . Two experimental diets were included: (i) a starch-casein based purified diet (PD) and (ii) a common corn-soybean meal diet (CD). Plasma was collected before feeding and 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h after feeding.In both diets, compared to prior to feeding, the concentrations of glucose, most amino acids, metabolites such as 5-aminopentanoic , pipecolic , ornithine and 5-hydroxy--tryptophan were significantly increased in plasma during the first hour, whereas the concentrations of plasma triglycerides, glutamate, glycine, palmitelaidic , 13-HODE and  were decreased in the first hour. Compared with PD group, concentration of plasma leucine and isoleucine declined at 30 min in CD group. Plasma linoleic , sphingosine and many dipeptides were significantly higher in pigs fed CD.Most significant metabolic changes occurred during the first hour after feeding and then became relatively stable after 2 h in both diets. These results show a broad scope picture of postprandial changes in plasma metabolites after intake of PD and CD and could be a reference for further nutrition intervention as well as the design of nutritional studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28972742>Ultrasmall Paramagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoprobe Targeting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor for In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common worldwide cancer that is rising rapidly in incidence. MRI is a powerful noninvasive imaging modality for HCC detection, but lack of specific contrast agents limits visualization of small tumors. EGFR is frequently overexpressed in HCC and is a promising target. Peptides have fast binding kinetics, short circulatory half-life, low imaging background, high vascular permeability, and enhanced tissue diffusion for deep tumor penetration. We demonstrate a peptide specific for EGFR labeled with an ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide (UPIO) nanoparticle with 3.5 nm dimensions to target HCC using T-weighted MRI. We modified the hydrophobic core with  and capped with PEGylated phospholipids DSPE-PEG and DSPE-PEG-Mal. The EGFR peptide is attached via thioether-mediated conjugation of a GGGSC linker to the maleimide-terminated phospholipids. On in vivo MR images of HCC xenograft tumors, we observed peak nanoprobe uptake at 2 h post-injection followed by a rapid return to baseline by ∼24 h. We measured significantly greater MR signal in tumor with the targeted nanoprobe versus scrambled peptide, blocked peptide, and Gadoteridol. Segmented regions on MR images support rapid renal clearance. No significant difference in animal , necropsy, hematology, and chemistry was found between treatment and control groups at one month post-injection. Our nanoprobe based on an EGFR specific peptide labeled with UPIO designed for high stability and biocompatibility showed rapid tumor uptake and systemic clearance to demonstrate safety and promise for clinical translation to detect early HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333859>Comparison of physicochemical traits of dry-cured ham from purebred Berkshire and crossbred Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc (LYD) pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to compare the physicochemical traits of dry-cured hams made from two different pig breeds: Berkshire and Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc (LYD). Pigs were slaughtered at a live  of approximately 110 kg and cooled at 0°C for 24 h in a chilling room.

The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of LNPs on adiposity and the mechanisms involved, and to evaluate their impact on metabolic homeostasis.Young Zucker fa/fa rats were treated with LNP599 (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Effects on , adiposity (regional re-distribution, morphology, and function of adipose tissues), cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, and liver function were evaluated. Direct effects on insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling were studied in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.LNP599 treatment limited the age-dependent remodeling and inflammation of subcutaneous, epididymal, and visceral adipose tissues, and prevented total fat deposits and the development of obesity.  stabilization was not related to reduced food intake but rather to enhanced energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were also improved and were significantly correlated with  but not with plasma norepinephrine. Insulin and AMPK signaling were enhanced in hepatic tissues of treated animals, whereas blood markers of hepatic disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced. In cultured HepG2 cells, LNP ligands phosphorylated AMPK and the downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevented -induced intracellular lipid accumulation. They also significantly potentiated insulin-mediated AKT activation and this was independent from AMPK.Selective I imidazoline receptor agonists protect against the development of adiposity and obesity, and the associated cardio-metabolic disorders. Activation of I receptors in the liver, leading to stimulation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK and insulin sensitization, and in adipose tissues, leading to improvement of morphology and function, are identified as peripheral mechanisms involved in the beneficial actions of these ligands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803133>Use of olive leaves (whether or not fortified with sodium selenate) in rabbit feeding: Effect on performance, carcass and meat characteristics, and estimated indexes of fatty  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Sixty New Zealand White weaned rabbits were divided into three groups and subjected to different dietary treatments: a standard diet for the control (C), a standard feed supplemented with 10% of plain olive leaves (OL) and a standard feed supplemented with 10% of selenium-fortified olive leaves (100 mg/L of foliar spray sodium selenate solution; SeOL). The productive performance was recorded at the time of slaughter (after 35 days); the carcass and meat traits were determined and estimated indexes of fatty  metabolism were calculated. No significant differences were found on the rabbit productive performance and the physical-chemical characteristics of the meat.

However, the introgression of some beneficial wild traits may be paralleled by negative effects on some other important agronomic and quality traits. From the quality point of view, virgin olive oil (VOO) from olive cultivars is highly appreciated for its fatty  composition (high monounsaturated  content) and the presence of several minor components. However, the composition of VOO from wild origin and its comparison with VOO from olive cultivars has been scarcely studied. In this work, the variability for fruit characters (fruit  and oil content, OC), fatty  composition, and minor quality components (squalene, sterols and tocopherols content and composition) was studied in a set of plant materials involving three different origins: wild genotypes ( = 32), cultivars ( = 62) and genotypes belonging to cultivar × wild progenies ( = 62). As expected, values for fruit size and OC in wild olives were lower than those obtained in cultivated materials, with intermediate values for cultivar × wild progenies. Wild olives showed a remarkably higher C16:0 percentage and tocopherol content in comparison to the cultivars. Contrarily, lower C18:1 percentage, squalene and sterol content were found in the wild genotypes, while no clear differences were found among the different plant materials regarding composition of the tocopherol and phytosterol fractions. Some common highly significant correlations among components of the same chemical family were found in all groups of plant materials. However, some other correlations were specific for one of the groups. The results of the study suggested that the use of wild germplasm in olive breeding programs will not have a negative impact on fatty  composition, tocopherol content, and tocopherol and phytosterol profiles provided that selection for these compounds is conducted from early generations. Important traits such as tocopherol content could be even improved by using wild parents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859764>A 90-day repeated-dose toxicity study of dietary alpha linolenic -enriched diacylglycerol oil in rats.</a></h2><p>Diets supplemented with alpha-linolenic  (ALA)-enriched diacylglycerol (DAG) oil-which mainly consists of  and linolenic, linoleic acids-have potential health benefits in terms of preventing or managing obesity. Although safety of DAG oil has been extensively investigated, toxicity of ALA-DAG oil has not been well understood. Hence, the present study was conducted to clarify the potential adverse effects, if any, of ALA-DAG oil in rats (10/sex/group) fed diets containing 1.375%, 2.75%, or 5.5% ALA-DAG oil for 90 days. Compared to control rats fed rapeseed oil or ALA-triacylglycerol oil (flaxseed oil), rats receiving ALA-DAG oil did not reveal any toxicologically significant treatment-related changes as evaluated by clinical signs, functional observational battery, , food consumption, ophthalmology, urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ , necropsy and histopathology. The no observed adverse effect levels for dietary exposure to ALA-DAG oil for male and female rats were 2916 and 3326 mg/kg /day, respectively, the highest dose tested. The findings from this study suggest that consumption of ALA-DAG oil is unlikely to cause adverse effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Permeability and cytotoxicity of RAP-loaded NEs were also inspected. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were created with  and Capryol 90 (as oil phase) and four surfactants and co-surfactants at various  ratios (R). Selected NEs from O/W region on the phase diagrams with the drug concentration of 1 mg/mL, were prepared via the spontaneous emulsification technique, characterized for particle size and subjected to stability tests at various temperatures over 9-12 months. Cumulative drug release was determined for a period of 48 h using a dialysis sac. The assay of RAP was determined using HPLC technique. Cytotoxicity of NEs was evaluated by MTT assay on breast cancer cell line, namely SKBR-3. The permeability of RAP-loaded NEs across Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by measurement of TEER (transepithelial electrical resistance) value. The intracellular uptake of coumarin 6-loaded NEs by SKBR-3 cells was also investigated using florescence microscopy. NEs containing /Tween 20/propylene glycol, Capryol 90/Tween 20/-propanol, and Capryol 90/Cremophor RH40/Transcutol P showed more cytotoxicity and permeability compared with the RAP methanolic solution. The minimum toxic concentration of RAP in NE formulations was found to be 7.5 µg/mL. The highest intracellular uptake was observed for the NE composed of Capryol 90/Tween 20/-propanol which was in consistent with the results obtained from cytotoxicity and permeability tests. The overall results implicated that this novel carrier was effective for enhancing RAP permeation in Caco-2 cell membrane along with enhancement of cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578555>Effect of Texel crossbreeding on productive traits, carcass and meat quality of Segureña lambs.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to assess the effect of crossbreeding a local breed (Segureña, S × S) with Texel as the sire line (Texel × Segureña crossbred, T × S) on productive traits and meat quality attributes. Sixty-eight lambs (both males and females) from each genotype, weaned at about 45 days old and intensively fed with concentrates and cereal straw ad libitum until they were 72 days old, were used to assess productive traits, and ten animals from each genotype were used to assess meat quality.The crossbreeding with Texel improves productivity, with a greater  at birth (+1 kg) and at slaughter (+3 kg) and a greater average daily gain (+29 g). T × S lambs had a better conformation, less carcass fatness, and higher content of muscle (+45 g kg ) as opposed to a lower fat content (-50.6 g kg ). With regard to meat quality, crossbreeding with Texel provided a meat with a higher protein content (+4 g kg ) and a lower  content (21% less), although the differences were very scarce from a sensory point of view, and non-existent with respect to instrumental quality.Crossbreeding could comprise a useful tool in the production of ovine meat in local breeds, such as Segureña, within the Mediterranean Area, and, consequently, a way of increasing the profitability of the farms. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28540041>Effects of quantitative feed restriction and sex on carcass traits, meat quality and meat lipid profile of Morada Nova lambs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of feed restriction (FR) and sex on the quantitative and qualitative carcass traits of Morada Nova lambs. Thirty-five animals with an initial  of 14.5 ± 0.89 kg and age of 120 d were used in a completely randomized study with a 3 × 3 factorial scheme consisting of three sexes (11 entire males, 12 castrated males and 12 females) and three levels of feeding (ad libitum - AL and 30% and 60% FR).Entire males presented greater hot and cold carcass  ( < 0.05), followed by castrated males and females. However, the hot carcass yield was higher for females and castrated males than for entire males. Luminosity values were influenced ( < 0.05) by sex, with entire males presenting higher values than castrated males and females. Females showed higher ( < 0.05) concentrations of linoleic  and arachidonic  in the meat of the  muscle. The meat of animals submitted to AL intake and 30% FR showed similar ( > 0.05) concentrations, and the concentrations of palmitic , palmitoleic , stearic ,  and conjugated linoleic  were higher ( < 0.05) than those of animals with 60% FR. The meat of females had a higher ω6/ω3 ratio and lower h/H ratio, and females had greater levels of feeding. The meat of animals on the 60% FR diet had a greater ω6/ω3 ratio, lower h/H ratio and lower concentration of desirable fatty acids in addition to a greater atherogenicity index (AI) and thrombogenicity index (TI).Lambs of different sexes had carcasses with different quantitative traits without total influence on the chemical and physical meat characteristics.

In this study, we investigated associations between fatty  taste, olfaction, mouthfeel of fat, dietary intake, eating behaviour, and  mass index (BMI). Fifty women attended three sessions to assess  taste and olfaction thresholds, the olfactory threshold for -butanol and subjective mouthfeel ratings of custard samples. Dietary intake and eating behaviour were evaluated using a Food Frequency and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, respectively. Binomial regression analysis was used to model fat taste and olfaction data. Taste and olfactory detection for  were positively correlated ( = 0.325;  < 0.02).  taste hypersensitive women had significantly increased -butanol olfactory sensitivity ( < 0.03). The eating behaviour disinhibition and BMI were higher in women who were hyposensitive to  taste ( < 0.05). Dietary intake of nuts, nut spreads, and seeds were significantly correlated with high olfactory sensitivity to  ( < 0.01). These findings demonstrate a clear link between fatty  taste sensitivity and olfaction and suggest that fat taste perception is associated with specific characteristics of eating behaviour and  composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against  gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Mixed FW was mechanically macerated (Pcon) and hydrolysed (at 250gL water) via chemical (Ch), thermal (Th) and TCh (combined Ch and Th) treatments. Cleared hydrolysates from individual pre-treatment processes were used as culture medium for cultivation of R. glutinis, while the residual solids (RS) were subjected to AD. Pcon cultivation yielded maximal R. glutinis dry  biomass (5.18gL) and total fatty  contents (1.03gg DW). Dominant fatty  methyl esters (FAME) were Palmitic - (C-26%); Stearic - (C-17%) and  acids (C-38%), ideal for bio-diesel production. Highest methane yields (actual ∼0.139mkg volatile solids) were measured from AD of Th-derived RS.

The experiment consisted of a 2 × 3 factorial design with two corn types (normal corn and ageing corn) and three concentrations of VE (0, 20 and 100 IU/kg). A total of 216 Lohmann laying hens (50-week-old) were randomly allocated into six treatment diets for 12 week. Each treatment had six replicates with six hens. The results showed that ageing corn significantly reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI; p < 0.01) and egg  (p < 0.05). Dietary VE supplementation had no significant influences on egg production performance (p > 0.05). Egg yolk colour was decreased in ageing corn diets (p < 0.01), while 20 and 100 IU/kg VE significantly improved vitelline membrane strength (p < 0.01) compared with feeding of 0 IU/kg VE. Ageing corn also significantly decreased the content of cholesterol including total cholesterol (TC; p < 0.05), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; p < 0.01) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C; p < 0.05) in the serum. Feeding 100 IU/kg VE significantly increased the content of LDL-C (p < 0.01) and VLDL-C (p < 0.05) in the serum. Furthermore, the content of the , docosahexaenoic  and total monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) was lower (p < 0.05) and stearic  and total saturated fatty  (SFA) was higher (p < 0.05) in egg yolks in ageing corn diets. Ageing corn resulted in reduced feed intake, egg  and yolk colour, but the effects of VE supplementation were independent of those of age of corn and were unable to counteract the negative effects of feeding ageing corn.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30407633>Triacylglycerol-Lowering Effect of Docosahexaenoic  Is Not Influenced by Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Involved in Lipid Metabolism in Humans.</a></h2><p>The triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering effects of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, and in particular docosahexaenoic  (DHA), are well documented, although these effects manifest large interindividual variability. The objective of this secondary analysis is to investigate whether common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes involved in DHA synthesis and TAG metabolism are associated with the responsiveness of blood lipids, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentration to dietary treatment by DHA supplied in high- canola oil (HOCO). In a randomized, crossover-controlled feeding trial, 129 subjects with metabolic syndrome received high- canola oil (HOCO) and high- canola oil supplemented with DHA (HOCO-DHA), each for 4 weeks. During the HOCO-DHA phase, the intake of DHA ranged from 1 to 2.5 g/day. The subjects were genotyped for apolipoprotein E (APOE) isoforms, and SNP including FADS1-rs174561, FADS2-rs174583, ELOVL2-rs953413, ELOVL5-rs2397142, CETP-rs5882, SCD1-rs2234970, PPARA-rs6008259, and LIPF-rs814628 were selected as important genes controlling fatty  metabolism. Overall, consumption of HOCO-DHA oil reduced blood concentrations of TAG by 24% compared to HOCO oil. The reduction in TAG was independent of genetic variations in the studied genes. Similarly, no treatment-by-gene interactions were evident in the response to other lipids, lipoproteins, or apolipoproteins to DHA supplementation. Nevertheless, a lower interindividual variation in the TAG response to DHA supplementation compared to other studies was observed in this analysis. The TAG-lowering effect of a supplemental -based dose of DHA was not influenced by genetic variations in APOE, FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL2, ELOVL5, CETP, SCD1, PPARA, and LIPF.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614657>Overall Nutritional and Sensory Profile of Different Species of Australian Wattle Seeds ( spp.): Potential Food Sources in the Arid Semi-Arid Regions.</a></h2><p>Wattle seed  spp. is a well-known staple food within indigenous communities in Australia.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating obesity-related nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427245>Energy balance in grazing Jersey cows in early lactation supplemented with peanut and sunflower oils.</a></h2><p>In this study, we evaluated the effects of supplementation with peanut and sunflower oils on intake and digestibility, milk yield and composition, energy balance (EB), changes in  and  condition score (BW and BCS), and blood metabolites of Jersey cows on pasture in early lactation.

After 12 hours of fasting, each subject was given one of the two test meals standardized, including 2 muffins and water (HSM, 42.1% of saturated fat , or HMM, 34.5% of monounsaturated fat ). Plasma fatty  profile and concentrations of apolipoproteins A1 and B100, complement C3, and triacylglycerols were analyzed during fasting and at 2, 3, and 5 postprandial hours.Among the markers studied, the triacylglycerol (TAG) and complement C3 were significantly higher in the OW group, compared to NW. The increment in the C3 concentration was higher after HSM intake, compared with HMM (iAUC = 4365.5 ± 5477.4 vs. 1215.2 ± 882.4; p = 0.006), with no differences between groups. After 5 hours postprandial, plasma  values remained high compared with the fasting value in the NW group, but not in the OW group (26.0 ± 4.2 vs 23.7 ± 3.9%; p < 0.001). Women with high percentage of total plasma saturated fatty acids (SFA) at the beginning of the intervention had higher incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for the palmitic, stearic, and total fatty acids (p < 0.005). Those women with a high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) showed lower iAUC values for the same fatty  profile (p < 0.005).This study demonstrated the effect of the HSM on postprandial increment of C3 concentration, suggesting another mechanism for saturated fat metabolism.

A rabbit  (OA)-induced pulmonary edema model was used. Thirty-two New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: a control group and three pulmonary edema groups (mild, moderate and severe). Features of transthoracic B-line artifacts (BLA), blood pH, PaO and PaCO, serum inflammatory factors, lung coefficient (LC), lung wet-to-dry  ratio (W/D) and lung histopathology were assessed. BLA features and severity of pulmonary edema were semiquantitatively scored. Correlations between the number of BLA and PaO, PaCO, serum inflammatory factors, LC and W/D were analyzed. An additional 8 rabbits with severe pulmonary edema were used as the verified group, in which the lung was divided into ex vivo BLA (BLA-ev)-free (BLA-ev-free) and BLA-ev-clustered subregions depending on the features of BLA-ev recorded by ex vivo lung ultrasound. Lung specimens from each subregion were collected for histopathological examination. Relationships between features of BLA-ev and lung histopathological abnormalities were analyzed. With increasing doses of OA, number of BLA, W/D and levels of serum inflammatory factors decreased. Meanwhile, lung pathologic abnormalities were aggravated. In addition, time of appearance of BLA, blood pH and PaO and PaCO decreased dose dependently on OA (p < 0.05). Number of BLA was linear positively correlated with severity of pulmonary edema (r = 0.953, p < 0.05). Consistently, the features of BLA-ev reflected the severity of lung histopathological abnormalities (r = 0.936, p < 0.05).

Ten newborn pigs from 5 litters were randomly assigned to two groups and fed either 5 mL of a control vehicle (2% Tween 80) or a vehicle containing clofibrate (75 mg/kg , treatment). The pigs received oral gavage daily for three days. In vitro fatty  oxidation was then measured in kidneys with and without mitochondria inhibitors (antimycin A and rotenone) using [1-C]-labeled  (C18:1) and erucic  (C22:1) as substrates. Clofibrate significantly stimulated C18:1 and C22:1 oxidation in mitochondria ( < 0.001) but not in peroxisomes. In addition, the oxidation rate of C18:1 was greater in mitochondria than peroxisomes, while the oxidation of C22:1 was higher in peroxisomes than mitochondria ( < 0.001). Consistent with the increase in fatty  oxidation, the mRNA abundance and enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) in mitochondria were increased. Although mRNA of mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (mHMGCS) was increased, the β-hydroxybutyrate concentration measured in kidneys did not increase in pigs treated with clofibrate.

Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an energy-restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk energy-restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion. Additionally, dietary ALA was unable to compensate for a decrease in serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, their applications are limited by poor oral bioavailability, low compliance and some serious side effects. To solve these problems, we successfully prepared chitosan microspheres (CTMS) and chitosan-capsaicin microspheres (CCMS) in previous study. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the ability of CTMS and CCMS to eliminate lipid accumulation in hepatocytesand also characterized their pharmacokinetic parameters after administration. The results showed that the two microspheres could significantly reduce intracellular lipid accumulation and dose-dependently improve the triglyceride (TG) content in HepG2 cells. A pharmacokinetic study indicated that CTMS and CCMS were distributed in almost all of the measured tissues, especially liver and kidney, and that their absorption was better than those of chitosan and capsaicin. Simultaneously, the prolonged circulating half-lives, the lower clearance and higher plasma concentration of CTMS and CCMS showed that their bioavailability was effectively enhanced. All of the results indicated that the lipid accumulation inhibition of CTMS and CCMS was better than that of chitosan and capsaicin, and that these microspheres can be developed as preventive agents for fatty liver or obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889655>Improved anti-obesity effect of herbal active and endogenous lipids co-loaded lipid nanocarriers: Preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.</a></h2><p>The association of numerous advantages of natural active compounds (from vegetal and herbs) and endogenous lipid in the same delivery system is a straightforward approach for the development of safe and better tolerated anti-obesity therapy. In the present study we envisage a novel concept for obesity therapy, devoted to the development of innovative lipid nanostructured formulas with improved gastric tolerability and enhanced specificity in adipose cells targeting. For this purpose, an anti-obesity herbal active from red pepper extract - Capsaicin (Cap) and an endogenous lipid regulator of appetite - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or a structural analogue of OEA - Phenylalaninol oleamide (PAO), are simultaneously integrated within the same delivery system - nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared with linseed oil that has anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties. The NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap presented mean diameters under 200 nm, size that allow an efficient uptake of actives by enterocytes and lead to an extended biological action of all actives - Cap, OEA/PAO and linolenic . NLC revealed a polidispersity index ranging from 0.16 to 0.22, which represents a narrow dispersion around mean size and suggests an adequate unimodal behavior. The two types of NLC co-loaded with Cap and OEA/PAO were both negatively charged, with zeta potentials of -42.8 mV and -58.5 mV that offered a guarantee for an excellent stability of NLC in time. Despite to the competition between the accommodations of both actives into the lipid core of nanocarriers, the entrapment efficiency exceeds 92% for OEA/PAO and is ranged between 71 and 82% for Cap. In the presence of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap, ABTS inhibition proceeded in a Capsaicin concentration dependent manner and was dependent on the type of NLC formulation. A remarkable radical-scavenging activity against ABTS was determined for Cap and OEA based-NLC. The in vitro release demonstrated that NLC played an important role on the delay of Cap dissolution; the NLC have ensured a slow release of Cap, eg only 21% Cap was released after 24 h of in vitro experiments. The in vivo pharmacological evaluation has revealed that the NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap treatment resulted in a  decrease and improves the lipid and glucose profile, as compared to the obese mice batch. Obesity mice treated with NLC-OEA exhibited a  loss of ~15% and ~10%  loss for NLC-POA, after 10-days treatment. Administration of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap to the Albino Swiss mice led to significant decrease of glucose level (e.g. 117.4 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap treated mice versus 213.9 mg/dL for obese mice batch) and exhibited a desired decrease effect of triglyceride (e.g. 71.1 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap versus 129.5, for obese batch). Moreover, the cholesterol values have been lowered to almost half from the value determined for the control batches. Overall, study highlights that using appropriate lipid mediators in association with an herbal anti-obesity active, both formulated into lipid nanocarriers, could enhance the therapeutic response in the obesity treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown fat-specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous fat pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic  (STA; 18:0),  (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic  (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ-linolenic  (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or pinolenic  (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty  effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty  and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown fat-specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216837>Effect of lipid chain length on nanostructured lipid carriers: Comprehensive structural evaluation by scattering techniques.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate nano-dispersed systems of differently chained lipids (solid phases) using various scattering techniques. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were fabricated by employing the microemulsification methodology in which dialkyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) of different alkyl chain length (x = 12, 14, 16, 18) and  were used as the solid lipid and liquid lipid, respectively. For the first time, the effect of DDAB as a function of the chain length of the double alkyl chain on the structural characteristics of NLCs was investigated. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS) results showed that a small but systematic size increase occurs with increase in the chain length 'x' of the DDAB from 12 to 16, yet DDAB based NLCs exhibited the smallest size irrespective of its higher hydrophobicity. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis revealed the structural make up of NLCs having spherical nanoparticles and triaxial ellipsoidal core-shell micelles in the system. In-vitro cytotoxicity evaluation indicated that toxicity is simply concentration-dependent phenomena and NLCs with less than 5 mg/mL are preferred for better in-vivo tolerance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Five isoenergetic (3,011.5 kcal AME/kg DM) and isonitrogenous (169 g CP/kg DM) diets were formulated using different lipid sources at a constant 30 g/kg inclusion level. The control, polyunsaturated omega-3 (PUFA n-3), polyunsaturated omega-6 (PUFA n-6), monounsaturated omega-9 (MUFA n-9), and saturated fatty  (SFA) diets consisted of linseed- and fish oil (50:50 blend), fish oil, sunflower oil, high  sunflower oil, and tallow, respectively. A total of 200 individually caged Hy-Line Silver-Brown hens (20 wk of age) were randomly allocated to the 5 treatments (n = 40 replicates/treatment) and received the experimental diets for 54 wk. During weeks 58, 62, 66, 70, and 74 of age (end-of-lay period), 20 eggs/treatment per day (n = 140 eggs/treatment per week) were selected for determining eggshell quality traits. At 74 wk of age, 10 birds per treatment (n = 10 birds/treatment) were randomly selected for the determination of bone quality characteristics. Data were statistically analyzed (P < 0.05) using a fully randomized 1-way ANOVA. Dietary treatment had no effect (P > 0.05) on eggshell quality traits. The MUFA n-9 treatment with the highest unsaturated to SFA ratio (UFA: SFA) resulted in a higher (P < 0.05) femur  (10.34 g) as well as femur- (52.99%) and tibia ash (51.07%) content than the SFA treatment. Also, the PUFA n-3 diet resulted in a higher (P < 0.05) femur  (10.21 g), femur ash (51.82%), and percentage femur (0.57%) compared to the SFA diet. Results suggested that prolonged feeding of diets varying in FA profile had no negative effect on eggshell quality, whereas UFA: SFA and long-chain n-3 PUFA affected the bone quality (especially the femur) of hens at the end of lay.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296789>Protective Effect and Mechanism of Alprostadil in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by  in Rats.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND This study investigated the role and mechanism of alprostadil in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by  (OA) in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, OA model, and OA + Alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg, respectively) groups. The ARDS model was induced by femoral vein injection of OA, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. Lung injury was evaluated by lung wet-dry  ratio (W/D) and histological analyses. Expressions of ACE, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways were determined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the OA model group had significantly increased W/D, lung injury score, and collagen deposition at 3 h after OA injection. However, alprostadil (10 μg/kg) treatment significantly reduced OA-induced elevation of these indicators. Additionally, OA-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-1β were suppressed by alprostadil. The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) κB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil. CONCLUSIONS Alprostadil has a protective effect on ARDS induced by OA in rats, possibly through inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways, and decreasing ACE protein expression. Therefore, the use of alprostadil in clinical ARDS treatment is promising.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772411>Valorization of crude glycerol based on biological processes for accumulation of lipophilic compounds.</a></h2><p>Bacteria that are capable of accumulating lipids in their cells as storage compounds can also produce polyhydroxyalkanoates of high technological value, depending on the specific culture conditions. The objective of this study was to utilize crude glycerol from biodiesel (CGB) as a substrate, which is a major byproduct from biodiesel production, to produce lipophilic compounds. Bacillus megaterium INCQS 425 was cultivated and evaluated for the production of lipophilic compounds and the properties of these compounds were investigated. Cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 0.60:1 favored the accumulation of lipids by (17.5%) comprising mainly palmitic  (13.08%), palmitoleic (39.48%), and especially  (37.02%), which imparts good characteristics to biodiesel. Meanwhile, cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 4:1 favored the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.31gL) mainly comprising medium and long chain PHA. Low crystallinity (<30%) and excellent thermal properties make them suitable for processes that demand high temperatures, such as extrusion. The lipids produced in the present study had satisfactory oxidative stability for the production of quality biodiesel. The polyhydroxyalkanoates produced in the study are of low cost and have promising thermal properties that justify its technological potential, thereby configuring highly competitive bioproducts.Copyright © 2019.

Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As knowledge about FcγRIIb in the literature is mostly generated from studies on skeletal muscle tissue, the expression and function of FcγRIIb in the liver and hepatocytes are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to  (OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of , , , , and  in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower liver  and liver to  ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers. In glycometabolism, FcγRIIb hindered insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1, and in turn upregulated  and  mRNA expression, suggesting that FcγRIIb promotes gluconeogenesis by suppressing the AKT/FOXO1// pathway in hepatocytes.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of feeding low (LO) or high  (HO) diets to AL pigs reared in individual pens (IND) or outdoors (OUT) with access to pasture. Biceps femoris and dorsal subcutaneous fat (DSF) samples were collected to analyse chemical composition and lipids fatty  (FA) profile. The expression of seven genes involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis and FA transport, as well as two transcription factors were also evaluated in the muscle. B. femoris and DSF presented lower lipid content in OUT-reared than in IND-reared pigs. Two genes involved in lipogenesis, ACACA and FASN, were under-expressed in B. femoris from OUT-reared pigs, while two involved in lipolysis, LPL and HSL were over-expressed. HO diet also significantly reduced FASN expression. Both rearing system and diet affected the FA profile of tissues, particularly DSF. Overall, OUT-reared pigs presented lower n6 to n3 FA ratios in all tissues, and lower monounsaturated (MUFA) and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content in DSF. When compared to LO-fed ones, HO-fed pigs presented higher  proportions in all tissues, and lower SFA, higher MUFA and PUFA levels, as well as lower saturation, atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes in DSF.

Daming capsule (DMC), a medicine for lowering blood lipids, is marketed in China; however, its mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DMC reduces blood lipids.A rat model of hyperlipidaemia was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet (HFD), and the serum lipid levels were detected with an automatic biochemical analyser. DMC (162 mg/kg) and atorvastatin calcium (10 mg/kg) were orally administered to the hyperlipidaemic rats for 4 weeks. HFD feeding markedly induced increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); however, DMC treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in rats serum. Meanwhile, the hepatic TC and TG levels, liver / ratio, and  were significantly lower in the DMC-treated rats than in the HFD rats. Moreover, DMC significantly alleviated hepatomegaly, hepatic lipid deposition, and hepatic steatosis. The protein expression level of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (Thr172) in HFD rat livers was lower than that in normal rat livers, whereas it increased in the liver of the DMC-treated rats; however, the protein expression level of total-AMPK in the liver was not different among the groups. The AMPK-activating effect of DMC was blocked by Compound C (a specific AMPK inhibitor) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, DMC considerably increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) transcription and concentration in the liver. This effect of DMC was also inhibited by Compound C in HepG2 cells. DMC also promoted LDL receptor (LDLR) protein expression by activating AMPK. We further found that DMC reduced the levels of TC and TG in -treated HepG2 cells, and it restored the expression levels of p-AMPK, PPARα, LPL, and LDLR compared to the decreased levels observed in -treated HepG2 cells.DMC lowered lipids in serum and the liver by activating AMPK. On the one hand, the activation of AMPK enhanced PPARα expression and LPL transcription to lead to the hydrolysis of TG; on the other hand, it increased LDLR protein expression to promote lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The new materials are based on ionic liquid monomers formed by cations containing the silver(I) ion coordinated with two 1-vinylimidazole ligands. Up to seven different silver-based PIL sorbent coatings were developed by polymerizing the silver-IL monomer in the presence of either silver bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, and/or a dicationic ionic liquid crosslinker. The obtained sorbent coatings were found to possess adequate thermal stability despite the presence of the silver(I) ions. Thermal desorption of the analytes at 175 °C was effectively used without any significant decrease in extraction efficiency. The developed sorbent coatings were used in two different applications: the determination of alkenes/alkynes via headspace SPME and the determination of unsaturated fatty acids using direct-immersion SPME. In the former approach, the silver-based PILs were particularly selective for the determination of unsaturated compounds with terminal double bonds such as 1,5-hexadiene, 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene, and 1,8-nonadiene. A study of the extraction mechanism of the analytes to the sorbent coating revealed a competitive partitioning of the analytes. In the second approach, the most selective silver-based PILs were applied for the determination of , linoleic , and linolenic . After proper optimization of the method, the coatings were found to be more or as sensitive as the commercial polydimethylsiloxane fiber. Limits of detection between 2.6 and 8.2 μg L in ultrapure water and from 12 to 14 μg L in tap water were obtained for the best silver-based PIL, with relative standard deviations lower than 13% in all cases at a spiked level of 160 μg L. Finally, the fiber was effectively applied for the analysis of rinse water from a dairy farm, with adequate detection of the analytes at concentrations between 52 and 179 μg L.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, the intake of ω-3 fatty acids, , calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric  and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> 2.5 l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading probiotics (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary.

The oxidation time was shortened by a factor of two compared to that of the reported method. This oxidation process has no obvious adverse effects on the phases of UCNPs. STEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) characterization demonstrated the successful growth of MnO on the surfaces of UCNPs. Furthermore, when the  ratio of MnO/UCNPs reached (147.61 ± 17.63) μg mg, 50% of the initial upconversion luminescence of UCNPs was quenched, as revealed by fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) results. The presence of the surface MnO precipitate not only confers high dispersity of UCNPs in water, but also allows further activatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence multimodal imaging after reduction to Mn by intracellular glutathione (GSH). A novel targeted drug carrier nanosystem was prepared to protect MnO from early decomposition in blood circulation by coating with mesoporous silica and capping with a gelatin nanolayer. Aptamer sgc8 was then attached to the surface of the gelatin nanolayer by covalent crosslinking to achieve targeted drug delivery.

The ratio between seeds and inflorescence , and seed germinability, decreased with the planting delay and density increase. Seed oil, protein, and antioxidant content (polyphenols and selenium) were highest with the last crop cycle. The polyunsaturated fatty acids, predominant in oil, increased with planting time delay, whereas the monounsaturated fatty acids decreased. Linoleic, , and palmitic  prevailed among polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and saturated fatty acids, respectively. Planting from 20 December to 10 January with 3.3 cold-stored bulbs per m was the most effective combination in terms of seed yield per hectare, whereas seed oil content and quality were the best, with the last crop cycle starting on 21 February, independent of bulb density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30588890>Optimization growth of Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis in photobioreactor under varied nitrogen concentration for maximized biomass, carotenoids and lipid contents.</a></h2><p>Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis (SP) microalgae were cultured in Zarrouk medium (ZM), containing three nitrogen concentrations (N-limited, N-optimal and N-rich medium) in ten liter-photo-bioreactor (10 L PBR) for 15-days, in order to study changes in lipid compounds (total carotenoids and total lipids and their effect on fatty  profile). Based on US patent, the yield of bioactive compounds (such as gamma-linolenic  GLA, C18:3) extracted from microalgae biomass, mainly depends on the extraction processes (1). GLA has much attention in respect of its therapeutic properties such as its ability to decrease blood cholesterol levels.The impact of the addition of N in cultures of S. platensis in terms of growth, biomasses and induced lipid compounds (total carotenoids and total lipid contents and its fatty  profile) as well as the sonication (SON) and microwave (MIC) process as aiding techniques for lipid extraction compared with a cold condition (COL) were examined. GC/MS method was used to determine the fatty  profile of lipid extract of SP cultures.In all S. platensis tested culture, the SP was growing successfully, with varied degrees. In N-rich media, the highest cell growth rate and biomass yield were obtained compared with that recorded in other cultures. Under an N-limited condition, SP had a higher total carotenoids (TCAR, 45.54 mg/g dw) and total lipid contents (TL, 29.51%± 1.92 g/100g dw) compared with that recorded either in N-rich (11.2 mg/g dw) or in N-optimal (6.23 mg/g dw) cultures. Thus, SP copes with the N -stress by altering the metabolic pathways toward inducing lipid biosynthesis. To maximize the TL and TCAR extraction yields, from N-limited cultures, a set of operating process was applied including the sonication (SON) and microwave (MIC), which were used as aiding techniques for lipid extraction compared with the cold condition (COL) techniques. The results showed that the extraction efficiency of the S. platensis TL increased in the following order: MIC (29.51%± 1.92) > SON (25.46% ± 1.65> COL (20.43% ±1.43). In comparative study for its fatty  profiles (FAPs) among all SP cultures, lipids were analyzed by GC/MS. The predominant fatty acids (>10%, of total FA) were found to be myristic  (C14:0, MA), palmitic  (C16:0, PA) and  (C18:1).The study concluded that N-limited condition was found to be a strong influence on biomass dry  and lipid contents and total carotenoids in SP cells compared to either N-rich or N-optimal conditions. The use of sonication and the microwave techniques lead to great increase in the extraction of lipid contents and in high amount polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in N-limited cultures, in particular the omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) of the essential C18 fatty acids. It seems that the SP rich in lipid content with a high amount of GLC produced under nitrogen limitation in PBR conditions can be used as a food additive or as a nutritional supplement.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471852>Optimisation, experimental validation and thermodynamic study of the sequential oil extraction and biodiesel production processes from seeds of Sterculia foetida.</a></h2><p>Non-edible seeds are not used in any commercial applications, which implies that they can be used for biofuel applications. The present study aimed to maximise the process conditions for oil extraction and sterculia biodiesel production from Sterculia foetida (poon oil). GC-MS identified the methyl esters of sterculia oil as sterculic  (32%), palmitic  (15.88%),  (10.00%), linoleic  (9.95%) and malvalic  (9%). Response surface methodology (RSM) based parametric optimisation of oil extraction was carried out by choosing process variables such as sample , volume of solvent to seed ratio and time. The optimum sample amount of 7.5 g and the volume of solvent to seed ratio of 40 mL/g resulted in a maximum oil yield of 45.27% at 3 h. The results were statistically significant (P < 0.05) with a regression coefficient (R) of 0.9988. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in an R value greater than 0.9, which validates the RSM. Conventional optimisation of the temperature (55 °C), feedstock to methanol ratio (1:12), catalyst proportion (1.5%) and transesterification reaction time (60 min) yield 90.87% biodiesel production. The physicochemical characteristics of oil and biodiesel complied with the requirements of the ASTM standards. The rate constant and thermodynamic variables at the optimum temperature (333 K) were calculated from the experimental data. The activation energy (E), activation enthalpy in transition state theory (ΔH), activation entropy in transition state theory (ΔS) and Gibbs free energy in transition state theory (ΔG) were 37.91 kJ mol, 35.14 kJ mol, - 239.58 J mol K and 79.81 kJ mol respectively.

Numerous genes participate in regulating the biosynthesis and accumulation of the storage lipids in seeds or other reservoir organs, among which several transcription factors, such as  (), , and  (), involved in embryo development also control the lipid reservoir in seeds. In this study, the  gene was transferred into the peanut genome and expressed in a seed-specific manner driven by the NapinA full-length promoter or its truncated 230-bp promoter. Four homozygous transgenic lines, two lines with the longer promoter and the other two with the truncated one, were selected for further analysis. The  mRNA level and the corresponding protein accumulation in different transgenic overexpression lines were altered, and the transgenic plants grew and developed normally without any detrimental effects on major agronomic traits. In the developing seeds of transgenic peanuts, the mRNA levels of a series of genes were upregulated. These genes are associated with fatty  (FA) biosynthesis and lipid accumulation. The former set of genes included the homomeric ACCase A (), the BC subunit of heteromeric ACCase (), ketoacyl-ACP synthetase (), and stearoyl-ACP desaturase (), while the latter ones were the diacylglycerol acyltransferases and oleosins (, and ).

Since impairment of neurogenesis and dendritic maturation are very likely key determinants of intellectual disability in DS, interventions targeted to these defects may translate into a behavioral benefit. While most of the neurogenesis enhancers tested so far in DS mouse models may pose some caveats due to possible side effects, substances naturally present in the human diet may be regarded as therapeutic tools with a high translational impact. Linoleic  and  are major constituents of corn oil that positively affect neurogenesis and neuron maturation. Based on these premises, the goal of the current study was to establish whether treatment with corn oil improves hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory in the Ts65Dn model of DS. Four-month-old Ts65Dn and euploid mice were treated with saline or corn oil for 30 days. Evaluation of behavior at the end of treatment showed that Ts65Dn mice treated with corn oil underwent a large improvement in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Evaluation of neurogenesis and dendritogenesis showed that in treated Ts65Dn mice the number of new granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and their dendritic pattern became similar to those of euploid mice. In addition, treated Ts65Dn mice underwent an increase in  and brain . This study shows for the first time that fatty acids have a positive impact on the brain of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. These results suggest that a diet that is rich in fatty acids may exert beneficial effects on cognitive performance in individuals with DS without causing adverse effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of raw and heat-treated hempseed (HHS, Cannabis sativa L.) on performance, egg quality and antioxidant activity in laying hens. 2. A total of 108 laying hens, aged 36 weeks, were divided into three treatment groups with 12 replicates and each replicate contained three laying hens. The treatments were as follows: (1) Control (no hempseed), (2) 15% raw hempseed (RHS) in diet and (3) 15% HHS in the diet. Experiments lasted for 12 weeks. 3. Feed intake of the RHS group was lower than those of the control and HHS groups. Egg , egg mass, shell , shell surface area and shell thickness of the HHS group were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of the RHS group. Roche (DSM) colour fan values of the RHS group were higher than that of the HHS group (P < 0.01). 4. Palmitic, palmitoleic and  acids of egg yolk were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the RHS and HHS groups; however, linoleic, α-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) of egg yolk increased (P < 0.05) for both treatment diets compared to the control group. 5.

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in  and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver , liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

Thirty-two Nellore bull male were distributed in a completely randomized design and fed diets with condensed tannin extract as follows: 0, 10, 30, and 50 g/kg total DM basis. The physicochemical composition of the meat, lipid oxidation, fatty  profile, flavor, tenderness, and overall acceptance were evaluated. There was a linear decrease (P ≤ 0.05) on lipid content, tenderness, cooking  loss, myristic, palmitic, and  acids in meat as tannin increased in the diets. The total saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the atherogenicity index decreased. However, a linear increase (P ≤ 0.05) was observed for linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids. The physicochemical characteristic of the meat, such as moisture, ash, and protein contents, water retention capacity, final pH, Warner-Bratzler shear force, collagen, and color indexes (lightness, redness, yellowness, and chrome) did not change with dietary tannin. Also, CLA, n-6:n-3 ratio, Δ -desaturase, and elongase activity were not different among diets. In conclusion, condensed tannin linearly increases unsaturated fatty acids and decreases the atherogenicity index of meat; thus, it can be recommended at the highest level (50 g/kg DM) in the diet of Nellore steers.Agriculture byproducts plays an important part in the diet of ruminant animals and consequently on food chain and has implications for the composition and quality of the livestock products (milk, meat, and eggs) that people consume. Feeding tannin to steers increases the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and meat tenderness, with a concomitant reduction on saturated fatty acids and the atherogenicity index in meat. Thus, we recommend adding tannin to steer diets to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in red meat for human consumption.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638739>Four-oil intravenous lipid emulsion effect on plasma fatty  composition, inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes in acutely ill patients: A randomised control trial (Foil fact).</a></h2><p>Data in critically ill patients on the effect of intravenous lipid emulsions (LEs), containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in parenteral nutrition (PN) are scarce and conflicting. This study compared the effects of a four-oil LE (30% soybean oil, 30% medium-chain triglycerides, 25% olive oil and 15% fish oil (FO)) (SMOFlipid®) to those of a 100% soybean oil-based LE in critically ill adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients.In this double-blind, randomised study, patients (n = 75) predicted to need PN for more than 5 days were randomised to receive either a four-oil LE (Study Group (SG)) or a 100% soybean oil LE (Control Group (CG)). Isocaloric, isonitrogenous PN was administered continuously for 5 days. FO was provided at a dose of 0.09-0.22 g/kg . Measurements included biochemical parameters and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score daily and plasma total phospholipid fatty acids (FAs) and cytokine levels on days 1, 3, 6. Days on mechanical ventilation, length of stay and mortality were also recorded. ANOVA was used to compare response variables between the two groups over the time and Pearson correlation was used to measure relationships between continuous variables.68 patients completed the study (n = 35 SG, n = 33 CG), with male predominance (66% SG, 56% CG). Average age was 60.8 ± 13.9 years (SG) versus 55.7 ± 14.8 (CG) (p = 0.143). The majority were surgical admissions (85% SG versus 91% CG) followed by medical. Plasma phospholipid  (p = 0.022) and alpha-linolenic  (p<0.0005) increased in both groups. In the SG, plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA increased (both p<0.001), whereas the omega-6:omega-3 PUFA (n-6:n-3 PUFA) ratio decreased (p < 0.001). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin decreased in both treatment groups. Considering only the change from day 1 to day 6 there was a bigger decrease in AST, ALT and bilirubin levels in the SG. Concentrations of TNF-α decreased from day 1 to day 6 in the SG, whereas they increased in the CG, but the change was not statistically significant (p = 0.112). A significant negative correlation was found between EPA provision on day 3 and the SOFA score (r = -0.4047, p = 0.018). Days on mechanical ventilation (1.24 ± 0.83 days in SG versus 0.88 ± 1.63 days in CG, p = 0.385) and ICU LOS (9.5 ± 7.09 days in SG versus 10.7 ± 7.6 days in CG, p = 0.490) were not different between groups.PN containing a four-oil LE increased plasma EPA and DHA, decreased n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio, and was safe and well tolerated. The negative relationship between day 3 EPA and SOFA score seems promising, but EPA intake and effects may have been diluted by enteral nutrition which was started in more than half of patients on day 4. There was no significant difference in terms of other biochemical measurements, SOFA score, length of ICU stay and mortality.

Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) reported from various plants are known to be involved in transferring lipids between membranes and in plants defense response. Here, we describe the complete primary structure of a monomeric non-specific lipid transfer protein 1 (nsLTP1), with molecular  of 9.66 kDa, from ajwain seeds. The nsLTP1 has been purified by combination of chromatographic techniques, and further characterized by mass spectrometry, and Edman degradation. The ajwain nsLTP1 is comprised of 91 amino acids, with eight conserved cysteine residues. The amino  sequence based predicted three dimensional (3D) structure is composed of four α-helices stabilized by four disulfide bonds, and a long C-terminal tail. The predicted model was verified by using different computational tools; i.e. ERRAT, verify 3D web server, and PROCHECK. The docking of ajwain nsLTP1 with ligands; myristic  (MYR), and  (OLE) was performed, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to validate the docking results.

Ninety fish (average : 41.84 ± 0.07 g) were randomly fed a control diet (6% fat) or a high-fat diet (11% fat) for 9 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were evaluated at the end of the trial. The liver samples of both groups were harvested for molecular analysis and histological evaluation. Compared to the Control group, the high-fat diet group showed no effects on either growth performance or energy intake in blunt snout bream. However, high-fat diet resulted in a massive accumulation of lipid and pathological structural alternations, and disrupted expression of lipid transport-related genes and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of the fish. In vitro, after exposure of the isolated primary hepatocytes from blunt snout bream to , the cells showed increased intracellular TG accumulation, decreased VLDL secretion, which was attributed to altered expression levels of lipid transport-related genes through the activated IRE1/XBP1 signaling. The -induced detrimental effects were alleviated by co-incubating the cells with an IER1 inhibitor, 4μ8c. In conclusion, high-fat diet could lead to aberrant lipid secretion by activating the ER stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Inhibiting the activity of IRE1 represents a promising target to rescue the side-effects of high-fat diet on the liver function of blunt snout bream.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, organic acids were excreted into the medium. LS3, our best lipid-producing strain, could also accumulate lipids from exogenous , up to 38.1 ± 1.6% of its dry-cell , and synthesize lipids from various sugar substrates, up to 36.6 ± 0.5% when growing in cellobiose. Both species, represented by LS3 and CBS 8244, could grow with little filamentation in the lipogenic medium from 28 to 45 °C and reached lipid titers ranging from 1.76 ± 0.28 to 3.08 ± 0.49 g/L in flasks. Under these conditions, the maximum bioconversion yield (  = 0.093 ± 0.017) was obtained with LS3 at 37 °C.

In low RUFA experiment (LRUFA), FA supplement rich in either SA or calcium salts-OA was added to a basal diet with a low concentration of RUFA (0.75 vs 1.4 %, LRUFA-SA vs LRUFA-OA). In high RUFA experiment (HRUFA), 2% soybean oil was added to the diet fed in the LRUFA experiment. In each experiment, thirty multiparous cows were blocked by parity and predicted transmitting ability for milk yield and were randomly fed one of two treatment diets from 2 to 13 wk postpartum. In the LRUFA experiment, LRUFA-SA had 2.4 kg/d more dry matter intake (DMI) (P < 0.01), 3.8 kg/d more energy corrected milk (P < 0.01), and 0.3%-units more milk fat percentage (P < 0.01) and 0.2 kg/d more milk fat yield (P < 0.01).

In the HRUFA experiment, HRUFA-SA had 1.4 kg/d more DMI (P = 0.03) but similar milk and milk components yields (P > 0.1). HRUFA-SA had a tendency to gain more  (P = 0.07) and had more positive energy balance (P = 0.01) and decreased gross feed efficiency (milk yield / DMI) (P = 0.01). Consistently, HRUFA-S increased intake energy partitioning into  tissues (P = 0.02) and decreased energy partitioning into milk (P = 0.01). In summary, SA supplementation had more DMI relative to OA, but the effects on milk and milk fat production were different and affected by the level of RUFA in the basal diet. In application, SA supplementation was more effective to improve milk production when included in the basal diet with the low RUFA.© The Author(s) 2019.

The rat ALI model was reproduced by injection of 0.01 mL/kg  into the tail vein, and the rats in NS control group were injected with the same amount of NS. The rats in KGF-2 pretreatment group were instilled with 5 mg/kg KGF-2 in the airway at 72 hours before the model reproduction, and the rats in the NS control group and the ALI model group were instilled with the same amount of NS. The abdominal aortic blood of rats was collected at 8 hours after model reproduction, and then the rats were sacrificed, bronchoalveolar in left lung was lavage, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for determination of protein levels in plasma and BALF, and the lung permeability index (LPI) was calculated. The lung tissues were harvested, after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the histopathological changes were observed under light microscope, and the ALI pathology score (LIS) was calculated. The lung wet/dry  (W/D) ratio was determined. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the expressions of FKN and claudin-5 in the lung tissue. The correlation between two variables was analyzed by linear or curve fitting correlation analysis.In the ALI model group, the lung tissue was severely damaged, and obvious pathological changes were observed, including thickened alveolar space and inflammatory cell infiltration, and LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly higher than those of the NS control group (LIS: 3.56±0.28 vs. 0.62±0.36, lung W/D ratio: 6.37±0.29 vs. 4.39±0.33, LPI: 3.46±0.69 vs. 0.98±0.17, all P < 0.01). Compared with the NS control group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of the ALI model group was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.97±0.18 vs. 0.62±0.04, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.56±0.11 vs. 1.06±0.13, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.817, P = 0.025). After pretreatment with KGF-2, the degree of lung tissue damage was significantly reduced, and the pathological changes were significantly improved, and the LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly lower than those of the ALI model group (LIS: 2.41±0.17 vs. 3.56±0.28, lung W/D ratio: 5.45±0.55 vs. 6.37±0.29, LPI: 2.42±0.19 vs. 3.46±0.69, all P < 0.01). Compared with the ALI model group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of KGF-2 pretreatment group was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.79±0.03 vs. 0.97±0.18, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.80±0.05 vs. 0.56±0.11, P < 0.01). There was still a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.847, P = 0.012).KGF-2 may restore the expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 by down-regulating the expression of chemokine FKN, thereby reducing the damage of blood barrier in ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128217>Altering the ratio of dietary palmitic, stearic, and  acids in diets with or without whole cottonseed affects nutrient digestibility, energy partitioning, and production responses of dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of varying the ratio of dietary palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and  (cis-9 C18:1) acids in basal diets containing soyhulls or whole cottonseed on nutrient digestibility, energy partitioning, and production response of lactating dairy cows. Twenty-four mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows were used in a split-plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet with soyhulls (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12) that was fed throughout the experiment. Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treatments was used in 4 consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (CON; no supplemental fat), (2) high C16:0 supplement [PA; fatty  (FA) supplement blend provided ∼80% C16:0], (3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; FA supplement blend provided ∼40% C16:0 + ∼40% C18:0), and (4) C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; FA supplement blend provided ∼45% C16:0 + ∼35% cis-9 C18:1). Interactions between basal diets and FA treatments were observed for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Among the SH diets, PA and PA+SA increased DMI compared with CON and PA+OA treatments, whereas in the CS diets PA+OA decreased DMI compared with CON. The PA, PA+SA, and PA+OA treatments increased milk yield compared with CON in the SH diets. The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased  (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased energy partitioning toward  reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased energy partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased energy partitioned to  reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased energy output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased energy storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

The current pilot study aims to determine whether breast-milk lipidome had any impact on the early growth-pattern of preterm infants fed their own mother's milk. A prospective-monocentric-observational birth-cohort was established, enrolling 138 preterm infants, who received their own mother's breast-milk throughout hospital stay. All infants were ranked according to the change in  -score between birth and hospital discharge. Then, we selected infants who experienced "slower" ( = 15, -1.54 ± 0.42 -score) or "faster" ( = 11, -0.48 ± 0.19 -score) growth; as expected, although groups did not differ regarding gestational age, birth  -score was lower in the "faster-growth" group (0.56 ± 0.72 vs. -1.59 ± 0.96). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry lipidomic signatures combined with multivariate analyses made it possible to identify breast-milk lipid species that allowed clear-cut discrimination between groups. Validation of the selected biomarkers was performed using multidimensional statistical, false-discovery-rate and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) tools. Breast-milk associated with faster growth contained more medium-chain saturated fatty  and sphingomyelin, dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA)-containing phosphethanolamine, and less -containing triglyceride and DGLA-oxylipin. The ability of such biomarkers to predict early-growth was validated in presence of confounding clinical factors but remains to be ascertained in larger cohort studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670757>Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor antagonist, SKL-14959, suppressed  gain on diet-induced obesity mice.</a></h2><p>Gastric inhibitory polypeptide plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism and is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. The objective of this study is to confirm the anti-obesity effects of the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor antagonist, SKL-14959, on diet-induced obesity mice.Diet-induced obesity mice at 20 weeks of age were administered with or without SKL-14959 for 96 d.  and food intake were monitored throughout the experiment. Mice were sacrificed, and physiological and biochemical markers were measured, and then histochemical and gene expression analyses were also performed. In further studies, mice were orally gavaged with [C]- to investigate the excursion of digested lipids.SKL-14959 significantly suppressed  gain without affecting food intake, decreased triacylglycerol contents in the liver and the muscle and the intensity stained with oil-red in the liver. It also improved plasma glutamic pyruvic transaminase and 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in addition to notably down-regulated relative gene expression of srebf1 and dgat1 in the liver despite not altering in the adipose tissue. Furthermore, SKL-14959 showed remarkable inhibition of lipid uptake in the adipose tissue after the oil challenge.SKL-14959 inhibited lipids uptake and improved lipids metabolism, results in suppression of  gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186272>Butyrate Protects Mice Against Methionine-Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis by Improving Gut Barrier Function, Attenuating Inflammation and Reducing Endotoxin Levels.</a></h2><p>Butyrate exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg ) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425639>Oleaginous yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii shows fermentative metabolism of sugars in the biosynthesis of ethanol and converts raw glycerol and cheese whey permeate into polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>We studied the biotechnological potential of the recently isolated yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii BI281A to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids and ethanol, comparing products yields using glucose, raw glycerol from biodiesel synthesis, or whey permeate as substrates. The yeast metabolism was evaluated for different C/N ratios (100:1 and 50:1). Results found that M. guilliermondii BI281A was able to assimilate all tested substrates, and the most efficient conversion obtained was observed using raw glycerol as carbon source (C/N ratio 50:1), concerning biomass formation (5.67 g·L ) and lipid production (1.04 g·L ), representing 18% of dry cell . Bioreactors experiments under pH and aeration-controlled conditions were conducted. Obtained fatty acids were composed of ~67% of unsaturated fatty acids, distributed as palmitoleic  (C , 9.4%),  (C , 47.2%), linoleic  (C , 9.6%), and linolenic  (C , 1.3%). Showing fermentative metabolism, which is unusual for oleaginous yeasts, M. guilliermondii produced 13.7 g·L of ethanol (yields of 0.27) when growing on glucose medium. These results suggest the promising use of this uncommonly studied yeast to produce unsaturated fatty acids and ethanol using cheap agro-industrial residues as substrates in bioprocess.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820744>Chemical composition, in vitro gas production, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silage (Brassica napus) with four levels of molasses.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of four levels of molasses on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silages. A canola (Brassica napus var. Monty) crop was established in a small-scale agricultural farm and harvested 148 days after sowing. Four levels of molasses were tested with respect to the fresh  (1.5 kg); these were 1% (CS-1), 2% (CS-2), 3% (CS-3) and 4% (CS-4) molasses, and 0% molasses (CS-0) was included as a control. A total of 45 microsilages were prepared using PVC pipes (4 in. of diameter × 20 cm of length), and the forage was compressed using a manual press. The effects of control and treatments were tested using the general linear model Y = μ + T + E. The linolenic  (C18:3n3), palmitic  (C16:0) and linoleic  methyl ester (C18:2n6c) accounted for 30%, 21% and 10.5% of total fatty acids, respectively; the fermentation parameters and in vitro methane production were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments; in vitro digestibility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) as the level of molasses increased. It was concluded that CS-4 improved the DM content by 9% and showed high content of linolenic  methyl ester.

Seventy-two rats were randomly divided into normal control group (group N, n=24), ARDS model group (group L, n=24) and dexamethasone group (group D, n=24). The ARDS rat model was established by jointly injecting  and lipopolysaccharide via the caudal vein, while rats in group D received intervention with dexamethasone. The wet/dry  ratios of lung tissues were measured, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and VEGF in serum and BALF were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The wet/dry  ratio of lung tissues of rats in group D was significantly decreased compared with that in group L (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and VEGF in serum and BALF of rats in group L and D were obviously increased compared with those in group N at each time point (P<0.01). The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and VEGF in serum and BALF of rats in group D were significantly decreased compared with those in group L (P<0.01).

At present, the mortality remains high in ARDS. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) using perfluorocarbon (PFC) has been proven to improve gas exchange and respiratory dynamics of the lungs during ARDS. However, PLV has not been shown to reduce the mortality of ARDS. Some studies have shown that mild hypothermia therapy can reduce lung injuries in animal models of ARDS by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels in lung tissues. However, hypothermia cannot produce a lung protection effect alone, and it may have a synergistic effect with other protective . To explore the possible role of PLV combined with mild hypothermia in the treatment of ARDS, in this study, we used PFC liquid ventilation to induce mild hypothermia in dogs suffering from ARDS and analyzed the effects of PFC liquid ventilation-induced mild hypothermia on the levels of inflammatory factors and lung histopathology in dogs with ARDS. The experimental dogs were randomly divided into conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), normal temperature PFC liquid ventilation (NPLV), hypothermic PFC liquid ventilation (HPLV), and mechanical ventilation (MV) groups. After induction of ARDS, the CMV group was treated with CMV for respiratory support, the HPLV group was treated with PLV-induced mild hypothermia using 15 °C PFC and maintained the rectal temperature at 34-36 °C, the NPLV group was treated with PLV using 36 °C PFC and maintained the rectal temperature at 36-38 °C. The MV group served as the control group. Analyses of the pulmonary pathology, partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, and lung wet-dry  ratio (W/T) of each dog revealed that PLV-induced mild hypothermia significantly increased the PaO values and attenuated lung injury, and there were no adverse effects on hemodynamics. Furthermore, treatment with PLV-induced mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and attenuated the expression of interleukin (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in peripheral blood and in lung BALF. Moreover, the results showed that the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NF-κB p65 in lung tissues was significantly decreased by PLV-induced mild hypothermia compared with NPLV and CMV. Our results indicated that PLV combined with mild hypothermia can provide protection against -induced ARDS in dogs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final acylation reaction of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, acting as one of the rate-limiting enzymes for oil biosynthesis in plant seeds. Here, a cDNA clone VgDGAT1A encoding the DGAT1 protein was isolated from the high oil plant Vernonia galamensis. VgDGAT1A was specifically overexpressed in soybean seeds, and several high-generation transgenic lines (T7) were obtained by continuous selection. qPCR analysis showed that VgDGAT1A was highly expressed in the mid-development stage (30-45 DAF) of the transgenic seeds. Accordingly, the DGAT enzyme activity in the transgenic seeds was increased by 7.8 folds in comparison with the wild-type controls. Seed oil and starch contents were, respectively, increased by 5.1% (Dry ) and reduced by 2%-3% in the transgenic soybeans. Importantly, protein content was not significantly different between transgenic and control seeds. Seed  and germination rate of the transgenic lines exhibited no negative effect. Fatty  profiling demonstrated that antioxidant  (C18:1Δ9) content in the transgenic seed oil was elevated by 8.2% compared to the control, and correspondingly, easily-oxidized linoleic  (C18:2Δ9,12) and linolenic  (C18:3Δ9,12,15) were decreased by 6% and 2% respectively. Taken together, seed-specific overexpression of an exogenous VgDGAT1A gene can break the negative linkage of oil and protein contents in soybean seeds, indicating that engineering of this highly-active DGAT enzyme is an effective strategy to improve oil yield and nutritional value in oilseeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29634315>Plasma fatty  ethanolamides are associated with postprandial triglycerides, ApoCIII, and ApoE in humans consuming a high-fructose corn syrup-sweetened beverage.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological and clinical research studies have provided ample evidence demonstrating that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increases risk factors involved in the development of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our previous study demonstrated that when compared with aspartame (Asp), 2 wk of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-sweetened beverages provided at 25% of daily energy requirement was associated with increased , postprandial (pp) triglycerides (TG), and fasting and pp CVD risk factors in young adults. The fatty  ethanolamide, anandamide (AEA), and the monoacylglycerol, 2-arachidonoyl- sn-glycerol (2-AG), are two primary endocannabinoids (ECs) that play a role in regulating food intake, increasing adipose storage, and regulating lipid metabolism. Therefore, we measured plasma concentrations of ECs and their analogs, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), and docosahexaenoyl glycerol (DHG), in participants from our previous study who consumed HFCS- or Asp-sweetened beverages to determine associations with  gain and CVD risk factors. Two-week exposure to either HFCS- or Asp-sweetened beverages resulted in significant differences in the changes in fasting levels of OEA and DHEA between groups after the testing period. Subjects who consumed Asp, but not HFCS, displayed a reduction in AEA, OEA, and DHEA after the testing period. In contrast, there were significant positive relationships between AEA, OEA, and DHEA vs. ppTG, ppApoCIII, and ppApoE in those consuming HFCS, but not in those consuming Asp. Our findings reveal previously unknown associations between circulating ECs and EC-related molecules with markers of lipid metabolism and CVD risk after HFCS consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29040817>Potential for mcl-PHA production from nonanoic and azelaic acids.</a></h2><p>Greater than 65% of canola and high- soy oil fatty acids is , which is readily converted to nonanoic (NA) and azelaic (AzA) acids by ozonolysis. NA is an excellent substrate for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) production but AzA has few uses. Pseudomonas citronellolis DSM 50332 and Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400, both able to produce mcl-PHA from fatty acids and to grow on AzA as the sole source of carbon and energy, were assessed for the accumulation of mcl-PHA from AzA and NA. In N-limited shake flasks using NA, P. citronellolis produced 32% of its dry biomass as mcl-PHA containing 78% 3-hydroxynonanoate with 22% 3-hydroxyheptanoate. Pseudomonas fluorescens produced only 2% PHA. N-limited P. citronellolis on AzA produced 20% dry  PHA containing 75% 3-hydroxydecanoate and 25% 3-hydroxyoctanoate, indicative of de novo synthesis. Although selective pressure, including β-oxidation inhibition, under well-controlled (chemostat) conditions was applied to P. citronellolis, no side-chain carboxyl groups were detected.

In the present study, we observed the effect of ethanol extract of  (EAF) on NAFLD and have suggested the possibility of using EAF as a natural product for application in the development of a treatment for NAFLD.The preventive effect on hepatic lipid accumulation was estimated by using an  (OA)-induced NAFLD model  and a Western diet (high-fat high-sucrose; WD)-induced obese mouse model. Animals were divided into three groups (n = 7): normal diet group (ND), WD group, and WD plus 1% EAF group.EAF reduced OA-stimulated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells in the absence of cellular cytotoxicity and significantly blocked transcriptional activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and fatty  synthase genes. Subsequently, we investigated these effects  in mice fed either ND or WD in the presence or absence of EAF supplementation. In comparison to the ND controls, the WD-fed mice exhibited increases in , liver , epididymal fat , and accumulation of fat in hepatocytes, and these effects were significantly attenuated by EAF supplementation. attenuates the development of NAFLD, and EAF elicits anti-lipogenic activity in liver.

We test the effect of enteral DHA to prevent ROP and/or severity and to reduce hospital stay.This was a double-blind parallel clinical trial. Preterm infants (n = 110; 55 per group) with birth  <1500 g but ≥1000 g were recruited in a neonatal intensive care unit. Infants were randomized to receive 75 mg of DHA/kg/d (DHA group) or high  sunflower oil (control group) for 14 days by enteral feeding. The effect of DHA was evaluated on any stage of ROP, severe ROP (stage ≥3) incidence, and hospital stay. Groups were compared with relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, or Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Logistic regression was applied to adjust for confounders.There was no difference between the DHA and control groups in ROP risk (RR for DHA = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.49-1.27; P = 0.33). However, patients who received DHA showed lower risk for stage 3 ROP (RR for DHA = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99; P = 0.03). After adjusting for confounders, this decreased risk remained significant (adjusted odds ratio = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.011-0.886; P = 0.04).

CGKRK is one of the well-known tumor targeting peptides with significant specificity for angiogenic blood vessels and tumor cells. Here, we designed fatty acyl conjugated CGKRK peptides, based on the hypothesis that hydrophobically-modified CGKRK peptide could enhance cellular permeation and delivery of siRNA targeted to tumor cells for effective silencing of selected proteins. We synthesized six fatty acyl-peptide conjugates, using a diverse chain of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids to study the efficiency of this approach. At peptide:siRNA / ratio of 10:1 (N/P ≈ 13.6), almost all the peptides showed complete binding with siRNA, and at a w/w ratio of 20:1 (N/P ≈ 27.3), complete protection of siRNA from early enzymatic degradation was observed. Conjugated peptides and peptide/siRNA complexes did not show significant cytotoxicity in selected cell lines. The -conjugated peptide showed the highest efficiency in siRNA uptake and silencing of kinesin spindle protein at peptide:siRNA w/w ratio of 80:1 (N/P ≈ 109). The siRNA internalization into non-tumorigenic kidney cells was negligible with all fatty acyl-peptide conjugates. These results indicate that conjugation of fatty acids to CGKRK could create an efficient delivery system for siRNA silencing specifically in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183494>Hypolipidemic, Antioxidant, and Antiapoptotic Effects of Polysaccharides Extracted from Reishi Mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum (Leysser: Fr) Karst, in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underlying the effect of Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi mushroom) polysaccharides (GLP) on obesity are not clear. In this study, GLP were found to attenuate the -induced cell viability loss and apoptosis dose dependently in splenic lymphocytes in vitro. The effects of GLP on lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in mice fed a high-fat diet (HD) were determined. GLP administration (200 and 400 mg/kg bw) significantly lowered the  increases; liver, heart, and white adipose tissues indexes; serum lipid accumulation; and serum and small intestine oxidative stress in mice fed a HD. Moreover, GLP inhibited HD-induced apoptosis by decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and suppressing caspase-3 activation in splenic lymphocytes.

An important role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was demonstrated. Here, we study the role of miR-182-5p in TLR4 expression and high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NASH in vitro and in vivo Material and methods. Following transfection with a miR-182-5p mimic, the effect of miR-182-5p on TLR4 in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells was investigated. Following administration of the miR-182-5p mimic into the livers of HFD-induced NASH mice, we determined the in vivo expression of TLR4, TNFa, and IL-6 and assessed the histologic features of the livers. Results Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of RAW264.7 cells, real-time RT-PCR and western blot results indicated decreases levels of TLR4 mRNA and protein in the miR-182-5p group as compared with levels observed in controls, with similar trends were observed in TNFa and IL-6 protein levels. Following  (OA) treatment of HepG2 cells, TLR4, TNFa, and IL-6 levels were significantly decreased in the miR-182-5p group as compared with levels observed in controls. Following miR-182-5p administration, TLR4 mRNA and protein levels decreased along with those of TNFa and IL-6 proteins, and the liver / ratio of treated mice was less than that observed in controls. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the miR-182-5p-treated group exhibited low adiposecell cross-sectional areas, and Oil Red O staining showed decreases in the size of lipid droplets in the miR-182-5p-treated group.miR-182-5p ameliorated HFD-induced NASH by suppressing TLR4.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

The  was assessed once weekly. After 12 wk, the liver and serum samples were extracted. The liver tissue expression levels of RIP3, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, protein disulfide isomerase, apolipoprotein-B, X-box binding protein-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty  synthase, cluster of differentiation-36, diglyceride acyltransferase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 were assessed.  treated primary hepatocytes from WT and RIP3KO mice were stained with Nile red. The expression of inflammatory cytokines, including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, CXCL2, and TNF-α, in monocytes was evaluated.RIP3KO HF diet fed mice showed a significant gain in , and liver , liver to  ratio, and liver triglycerides were increased in HF diet fed RIP3KO mice compared to HF diet fed WT mice. RIP3KO primary hepatocytes also had increased intracellular fat droplets compared to WT primary hepatocytes after  treatment. RIP3 overexpression decreased hepatic fat content. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression of very-low-density lipoproteins secretion markers (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, protein disulfide isomerase, and apolipoprotein-B) was significantly suppressed in RIP3KO mice. The overall NAFLD Activity Score was the same between WT and RIP3KO mice; however, RIP3KO mice had increased fatty change and decreased lobular inflammation compared to WT mice. Inflammatory signals (CXCL1/2, TNF-α, and interleukin-6) increased after lipopolysaccharide and pan-caspase inhibitor (necroptotic condition) treatment in monocytes.

In addition, changes in the total phospholipid fatty  content and cold tolerance of non-diapausing and diapausing pupae were examined. The critical daylength for diapause induction were 12.43 h at 20°C and lower temperatures that can induce in 50% of population. Moreover, the composition of total phospholipid fatty acids in the pupae revealed seven major fatty acids in both non-diapausing and diapausing pupae:  (26-32%), palmitic (21-29%), linoleic (18-21%), palmitoleic (4-10%), stearic (9%), linolenic (7-8%), and pentadecanoic acids (3-5%) with an increase in proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in diapause state. In contrast to increase of  (C18:1) from 26 to 32% in non-diapausing to diapausing pupae, a decrement trend from 29 to 21% in palmitic  (C16:0) was observed at the same state. Additionally, supercooling point was observed to be significantly lower in diapausing (-22.6°C) than in non-diapausing pupae (-18.5°C) and the fresh  of diapausing pupae was found to be significantly higher than non-diapausing ones. The significance of these findings would allow us a better understanding of interrelationship between diapause and cold tolerance.© The Authors 2017.

In this work, a selective process using carbon feast-famine cycles was applied to obtain an indigenous microbial community of hydrocarbon-degrading and lipid-accumulating bacteria, using a real lubricant-based wastewater as carbon source. In the conditions applied, the enriched bacterial community, dominated by members of the genus Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, was able to degrade almost all hydrocarbons present in the wastewater within 24 h' incubation and to accumulate, although in low levels, triacylglycerol (TAG) (<5% of cell dry  (CDW)) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.8% ± 1.1% of the CDW) as well as an unknown lipid (29% ± 6% of CDW), presumably a wax ester-like compound. The influence of culture conditions, namely carbon and nitrogen concentrations (and C/N ratio) and cultivation time, on the amount and profile of produced storage compounds was further assessed using a statistical approach based on a central composite circumscribed design and surface response methodology. The regression analysis of the experimental design revealed that only nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio are significant for neutral lipid biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Maximum neutral lipid content, i.e. 33% (CDW basis), was achieved for the lowest carbon and nitrogen concentrations evaluated (10 g COD L and 0.02 g N L). PHA accounted for less than 5% of CDW. In these conditions, neutral lipid content was mainly composed by TAG, about 70% (w/w). TAG precursors, namely monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and fatty acids (FA), accounted for 22% of total neutral lipids and WE for about 7%. Nevertheless, according to the applied response surface model, further improvement of neutral lipids content is still possible if even lower nitrogen concentrations are used. The fatty acids detected in TAG extracts ranged from myristic  (C14:0) to linoleic  (C18:2), being the most abundant palmitic  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0) and  (C18:1). This study shows the feasibility of combining treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated wastewater, herein demonstrated for lubricant-based wastewater, with the production of bacterial neutral lipids using open mixed bacterial communities. This approach can decrease the costs associated to both processes and contribute to a more sustainable waste management and production of lipid-based biofuels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

During the dry season, pasture scarcity leads animals to lose up to 40% of their , a condition known as Seasonal  Loss (SWL) that is one of the major constraints in ruminant production. Breeds with high tolerance to SWL are relevant to understand the physiological responses to pasture scarcity so they could be used in programs for animal breeding. In the Canary Islands there are two dairy goat breeds with different levels of tolerance to SWL: the Palmera, susceptible to SWL; and the Majorera, tolerant to SWL. Fat is one of the milk components most affected by environmental and physiological conditions. This study hypothesises that feed-restriction affects Majorera and Palmera breeds differently, leading to different fatty  profiles in the mammary gland and milk. An interaction between breed and feed-restriction was observed in the mammary gland. Feed-restriction was associated with an increase in  and a decrease in palmitic  percentage in the Palmera breed whereas no differences were observed in the Majorera breed. Palmitic and  acids together constituted around 60% of the total fatty acids identified, which suggests that Palmera breed is more susceptible to SWL. In milk, feed-restriction affected both breeds similarly. Regarding the interaction of the breed with the treatment, we also observed similar responses in both breeds, but this influence affects only around 2% of the total fatty acids. In general, Majorera breed is more tolerant to feed-restriction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29876936>Influence of different light conditions and time of sprouting on harmful and beneficial aspects of rutabaga sprouts in comparison to their roots and seeds.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the presence and content of selected phytochemicals, namely glucosinolates, fatty acids and phenolic compounds, in rutabaga (Brassica napus L. var. napobrassica) sprouts grown under various light conditions, in comparison to rutabaga seeds and roots. As rutabaga sprouts are likely to become new functional food, special emphasis was placed on the related risks of progoitrin and erucic  presence - compounds with proven antinutritive properties.Time of sprouting significantly decreased progoitrin content, especially after 10 days (by 91.5%) and 12 days (by 97.5%), as compared to 8 days. In addition, sprouts grown under dark conditions showed 27%, 60% and 17% reduction in progoitrin level in 8, 10 and 12 days after sowing, respectively, as compared to sprouts grown under natural conditions. Progoitrin was found to be the predominant glucosinolate in rutabaga seeds (804.07 ± 60.89 mg 100 g dry  (DW)), accompanied by glucoerucin (157.82 ± 21.04 mg 100 g DW), also found in the roots (82.20 ± 16.53 mg 100 g DW). Among the unsaturated fatty acids in rutabaga sprouts, erucic, linoleic, linolenic and gondoic acids decreased significantly, and only  increased as germination days progressed. The amount of harmful erucic  in rutabaga sprouts was found to vary between 1.8% and 7%, depending on the day of seeding or light conditions, as compared to 42.5% in the seeds.The evaluated rutabaga products showed a wide content range of potentially antinutritive compounds, sprouts having the lowest amounts of erucic  and progoitrin. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753956>Smart gated magnetic silica mesoporous particles for targeted colon drug delivery: New approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases treatment.</a></h2><p>Magnetic mesoporous silica microparticles were loaded with safranin O (S1) and with hydrocortisone (S2) and the outer surface functionalized with a bulky azo derivative bearing urea moieties. Aqueous suspensions of both solids at pH 7.4 showed negligible payload release whereas a marked delivery was observed in the presence of sodium dithionite due to the rupture of the azo bonds. Besides, a moderate cargo release was observed at acidic pH due to the hydrolysis of the urea bonds that linked the azo derivative onto the external surface of the inorganic scaffolds. In vitro digestion models showed that S1 and S2 microparticles could be used for the controlled release of payload in the reducing colon environment (in which azoreductase enzymes are present). On the other hand, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that safranine O release from S1 microparticles was concentrated in colon. The performance of S2 microparticles for the treatment of colitis in rats (induced by oral administration of a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution) was tested. The controlled release of hydrocortisone from S2 in the colon of injured rats induced marked reduction in colon/ ratio and in clinical activity score. Also, histological studies showed a marked decrease in inflammation followed by intensive regeneration and almost normal mucosal structure of the individuals treated with S2. Besides, the use of a magnetic belt increased the therapeutic performances of S2 due to an enhanced retention time of the particles in the colon.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study the microalgal growth and chlorophyll, lipid, and fatty acids content; along with the expression of some genes implicated in the biosynthesis of lipids were examined in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii subjected to pH values of 7.0, 7.8, and 8.5. At pH 7.8 an increase in cell growth was observed with a significant accumulation of chlorophyll (1.75-fold) when compared with growth at pH 7, while at pH 8.5 a sharp decrease in both parameters was observed when compared with the other pH values tested. Lipid content increased 3.0 (14.81% of dry cell , dcw) and 2.3 times (11.43% dcw) at pH 7.8 and 8.5, respectively, when compared with the experiment at pH 7 (4.97% dcw). The compositions of major fatty acids in the strains growing at pH 7.0, 7.8, or 8.5 were 25.7, 28.0, and 32.1% for palmitic ; 17.3, 14.7, and 25.7% for ; and 9.8, 12.1, and 4.6% for linoleic ; respectively. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcripts of ß-carboxyltransferase, Acyl carrier protein 1, acyl-ACP thiolase 1, acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and diacylglycerol acyl transferase isoform 3 were significantly induced at pH 7.8 when compared with the other two pH conditions. These results indicate that the induction of genes implicated in the early and final steps of lipid biosynthesis contributes to their accumulation in the stationary phase. Our research suggests that a pH of 7.8 might be ideal to maximize growth and lipid accumulation.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28707223>Inhibition of exendin-4-induced steatosis by protein kinase A in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes, resulting in a steatotic liver. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and its analog exendin-4 can ameliorate certain aspects of this syndrome by inducing  loss and reducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation, but it is unclear whether these effects result from the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 on the pancreas, or from direct action on the liver. This study investigated the direct action and putative cellular mechanism of exendin-4 on steatotic hepatocytes in culture. Steatosis was induced in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells by incubation in media supplemented with 2 mM each of linoleic  and . Steatotic hepatocytes were then pre-incubated in the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 for 30 min, then treated with exendin-4 over a period of 24 h. Cell viability and triglyceride content were characterized by a TUNEL assay and AdipoRed staining, respectively. Our results showed that steatotic cells maintained high levels of intracellular triglycerides (80%) compared to lean controls (25%). Exendin-4 treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular triglyceride content after 12 h that persisted through 24 h, while protein kinase A inhibitors abolished the effects of exendin-4. The results demonstrate the exendin-4 induces a partial reduction in triglycerides in steatotic hepatocytes within 12 h via the GLP-1 receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase A. Thus, the reduction in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation is likely driven primarily by downregulation of lipogenesis and upregulation of β-oxidation of free fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216387>Lipid profile changes in erythrocyte membranes of women with diagnosed GDM.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a glucose intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty  profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty  methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic  significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the  and vaccenic  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic  levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis-vaccenic  concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty  profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593897>Fatty acids uptake and oxidation are increased in the liver of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis.</a></h2><p>Severe rheumatoid cachexia is associated with pronounced loss of muscle and fat mass in patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis. This condition is associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) have not yet been consistently defined in severe arthritis. Similarly, the metabolism of these lipids in the arthritic liver has not yet been clarified. Aiming at filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating lipid profile and of the fatty acids uptake and metabolism in perfused livers of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and liver (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and oxidation of palmitic and  acids was higher in arthritic livers. The phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic liver. Indeed, NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, which additionally presented higher activities of the citric  cycle driven by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced synthesis of fatty acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the lipid hepatic metabolism in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry  ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry  ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the mitochondria of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287560>In vivo kinetic study of materno-fetal fatty  transfer in obese and normal  pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Placental structure and function can be modified as a result of maternal obesity affecting materno-fetal fatty acids (FA) transport. We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo- and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar metabolism (stearic :  C-SA; palmitic :  C-PA; :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a  mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a  mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

Four hours after OA injection, lung tissues were excised for biochemical and histopathologic evaluation.OA treatment increased lung  and tissue malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels, but erdosteine pretreatment significantly suppressed these changes (0.57 ± 0.1 g, 3.27 ± 0.48 nmol/mg protein, and 33.57 ± 4.6 nmol/mg protein, respectively, for OA versus 0.36 ± 0.02 g, 1.84 ± 0.15 nmol/mg protein, and 22.10 ± 2.55 nmol/mg protein, respectively, for OA + erdosteine; P < 0.05 for all). Erdosteine pretreatment increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (0.16 ± 0.03 k/g and 0.3 ± 0.01 U/mg protein, respectively, for OA versus 0.33 ± 0.05 k/g and 0.34 ± 0.01 U/mg protein, respectively, for OA + erdosteine; P < 0.05 for both).

We evaluated the effects of breed, 24 h fasting, and dietary energy source (HO:  versus CH: carbohydrates) on the expression of candidate genes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis in the adipose tissue from Iberian and Duroc growing pigs. The Iberian pigs showed greater feed intake, backfat thickness, and saturated fatty acids (SFA) content in the subcutaneous fat, whereas the Duroc pigs had greater ham  and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content. In both breeds, the diet induced changes in the fatty  (FA) composition of subcutaneous fat samples. The HO group had higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and , and lower SFA than the CH group. Regarding gene expression, breed and feeding status (fasting versus postprandial) had significant effects on gene expression, with quantitative interactions between them, while diet showed negligible effects. In general, adipogenic and lipogenic genes were upregulated in the Iberian pigs and in postprandial samples. In contrast, the expression of lipolytic genes showed complex interaction effects. Our results agree with the phenotypic differences between the Iberian and Duroc breeds and with the inhibition of lipogenesis by fasting. Quantitative interactions between breed and feeding status effects were observed, which indicates a different response to fasting of the two breeds, with the obese Iberian breed showing a more stable expression of lipogenic genes.

Release liners and backing membranes were selected based on their ability to peel without leaving a residue and their affinity to formulation respectively. Drug-in-adhesive patches developed were investigate for their in vitro drug permeation over 48 h across dermatomed human skin using Franz diffusion cells. Silicone based pressure sensitive adhesive along with colloidal silicon dioxide as viscosity builder, fluoropolymer coated membranes as the release liner and polyester based membranes as backing were chosen to develop a drug in silicone adhesive patch. Polyisobutylene adhesive based patch was developed with drug in polyisobutylene adhesive, along with  and oleyl alcohol as permeation enhancers, polyester for the release liner and polyethylene as backing. Among the patches developed, polyisobutylene adhesive based patch with higher drug concentration exhibited superior transdermal permeation (1608.5 ± 53.4 µg/cm over 48 h). The final patch was further tested for uniformity in coat , shear strength, tack and peel adhesion.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The animals were distributed in a randomized block design and treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design, two small ruminant species/breed (Boer crossbreed goat × Santa Inês breed sheep), and two supplementation strategies (energy × protein energy). There was not an interaction between the small ruminant species and the supplementation on average daily gain, tissue composition, chemical composition, or FA profile of the longissimus lumborum muscle. Sheep presented greater  and yield of fat in the subcutaneous, intermuscular, and total depots than goats, which results in better finishing of the sheep for slaughter. Goat meat presented a lower lipid concentration than sheep meat. The protein-energy supplementation increased , ΣUFA, ΣMUFA, hypocholesterolemic/ Hypercholesterolemic index, and enzymatic activity Δ9-desaturase C18 and decreased SFA capric  in the muscle when compared with energetic supplementation. In Caatinga biome conditions, Boer crossbreed goats meat has a lower concentration of lipids and a healthier FA composition compared with Santa Inês breed sheep because it has a lower SFA and greater PUFA content, which are sources of n-3 and n-6, which may contribute to the reduction of blood cholesterol (LDL). In addition, protein-energy supplementation also improved the quality of animal fat compared with supplementation only with the energetic concentrate, regardless of species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28490085>Cellulose nanomaterials emulsion coatings for controlling physiological activity, modifying surface morphology, and enhancing storability of postharvest bananas (Musa acuminate).</a></h2><p>Cellulose nanomaterials (CNs)-incorporated emulsion coatings with improved moisture barrier, wettability and surface adhesion onto fruit surfaces were developed for controlling postharvest physiological activity and enhancing storability of bananas during ambient storage. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based emulsion coating (CNFC: 0.3% CNF/1% /1% sucrose ester fatty  (w/w wet base)) had low contact angle, high spread coefficient onto banana surfaces, and lower surface tension (ST, 25.4mN/m) than the critical ST (35.2mN/m) of banana peels, and exhibited good wettability onto banana surfaces. CNFC coating delayed the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and reduced ethylene and CO production, thus delaying fruit ripening. As the result, CNFC coating minimized chlorophyll degradation,  loss, and firmness of bananas while ensuring the properly fruit ripening during 10d of ambient storage. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of CNF based emulsion coatings for improving the storability of postharvest bananas.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following  loss. We investigated the effect of  loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of  changes between groups revealed that the -loss group had greater reductions in . The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the -loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the -loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the -loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following  loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the -loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild  loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

In this study, we examined the effects of ICR and food content in syngeneic BALB/c mice injected with CT26 mouse colon cancer cells. Mice were subjected to 24-h fasting once a week for 4 weeks, and then provided with a control, high-calorie, or trans fatty -rich diet. While ICR resulted in increases in tumor , metastasis and in the number of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumors or blood of mice fed the control and high-fat diets, it had no effect on  after 4 weeks. In particular, we detected increases in the numbers of CSCs in the tumor or blood on the day after starvation, when food overconsumption was detected. Conversely, continuous calorie restriction had no effect on tumor , metastasis, or the number of CSCs in tumors or blood. In the post-starvation period, energy metabolism in the tumor was altered from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis/lactate fermentation, with the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hyperglycemia at the post-starvation period induced the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, hypoxia-induced factor-1α and Nanog, as well as the phosphorylation of Stat3. Taken together, these findings suggest that ICR induces an increase in the number of CSCs and enhances EMT by promoting the Warburg/Crabtree effect following post-fasting food overconsumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252854>Human milk enriched with human milk lyophilisate for feeding very low birth  preterm infants: A preclinical experimental study focusing on fatty  profile.</a></h2><p>Human milk, with essential nutrients and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as the omega 3 and 6 fatty acids is important for development of the central nervous system and the retina in very low birth  infants (<1,500 g). However, breast milk may not be sufficient to meet these needs. The possibility of supplementing breast milk with a lyophilisate of human milk was explored in this study. The objectives of this study were to determine the total lipid content and the lipid profile of the Human Milk on Baseline (HMB) and that of the Concentrates with the Human Milk + lyophilisate (with lyophilisate of milk in the immediate period (HMCI), at 3 months (HMC3m), and at 6 months (HMC6m) of storage).Fifty donors from the Human Milk Bank of Children's Hospital provided consent, and donated milk samples. Macronutrient (including total lipids) quantification was performed using the MIRIS® Human Milk Analyzer, and the fatty  profile was determined by gas chromatography (CG-FID, SHIMADZU®).There was a higher lipid concentration in HMCI relative to HMB. The concentrations of the main fatty acids (% of total) were as follows: palmitic  (C16:0) HMB, 22.30%; HMCI, 21.46%; HMC3m, 21.54%; and HMC6m, 21.95% (p<0.01);  (C18:1n-9) HMB, 30.41%; HMCI, 30.47%; HMC3m, 30.55%; and HMC6m, 29.79% (p = 0.46); linoleic  (C18:2n-6) HMB, 19.62%; HMCI, 19.88%; HMC3m, 19.49%; and HMC6m, 19.45% (p = 0.58); arachidonic  (C20:4n-6) HMB, 0.35%; HMCI, 0.16%; HMC3m, 0.13%; and HMC6m, 0.15% (p<0.01); α-linolenic  (C18:3n-3) HMB,1.32%; HMCI, 1.37%; HMC3m, 1.34%; and 1.34% HMC6m (p = 0.14); docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3) HMB, 0.10%; HMCI, 0.06%; HMC3m, 0.05%; and HMC6m, 0.06% (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in the lipid profile when stored. There was no evidence of peroxidation during storage.Freeze-dried human milk fortified with a human milk concentrate brings potential benefits to newborns, mainly by preserving the essential nutrients present only in breast milk; however, further clinical studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the concentrate as a standard nutritional food option for very low birth  infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28652194>Adipose tissue conditioned media support macrophage lipid-droplet biogenesis by interfering with autophagic flux.</a></h2><p>Obesity promotes the biogenesis of adipose tissue (AT) foam cells (FC), which contribute to AT insulin resistance. Autophagy, an evolutionarily-conserved house-keeping process, was implicated in cellular lipid handling by either feeding and/or degrading lipid-droplets (LDs). We hypothesized that beyond phagocytosis of dead adipocytes, AT-FC biogenesis is supported by the AT microenvironment by regulating autophagy. Non-polarized ("M0") RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to AT conditioned media (AT-CM) exhibited a markedly enhanced LDs biogenesis rate compared to control cells (8.3 Vs 0.3 LDs/cells/h, p<0.005). Autophagic flux was decreased by AT-CM, and fluorescently following autophagosomes over time revealed ~20% decline in new autophagic vesicles' formation rate, and 60-70% decrease in autophagosomal growth rate, without marked alternations in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Suppressing autophagy by either targeting autophagosome formation (pharmacologically, with 3-methyladenine or genetically, with Atg12±Atg7-siRNA), decreased the rate of LD formation induced by . Conversely, interfering with late autophago-lysosomal function, either pharmacologically with bafilomycin-A1, chloroquine or leupeptin, enhanced LD formation in macrophages without affecting LD degradation rate. Similarly enhanced LD biogenesis rate was induced by siRNA targeting Lamp-1 or the V-ATPase. Collectively, we propose that secreted products from AT interrupt late autophagosome maturation in macrophages, supporting enhanced LDs biogenesis and AT-FC formation, thereby contributing to AT dysfunction in obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

This study investigated the effects of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)/medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) on the reduction of bile  absorption in the small intestine and the mechanisms of action in vivo and partially verified in vitro.Thirty-six C57BL/6 J mice with hypercholesterolaemia were randomly divided into 3 groups: fed a cholesterol-rich diet (CR group), fed a cholesterol-rich and medium-chain triglyceride diet (CR-MCT group) and fed a cholesterol-rich and long-chain triglyceride diet (CR-LCT group).   and blood lipid profiles were measured in all groups after 16 weeks of treatment. The concentrations of bile acids in bile and faeces were analysed using HPLC-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Gene transcription and the expression levels associated with bile  absorption in the small intestines were determined using real-time PCR and Western blot. Ileal bile  binding protein (I-BABP) was analysed using immunofluorescence. The effects of MCFAs on the permeability of bile  (cholic , CA) in Caco-2 cell monolayers and I-BABP expression levels in Caco-2 cells treated with caprylic  (C8:0), capric  (C10:0), stearic  (C18:0) and  (C18:1) were determined.Mice in the CR-MCT group exhibited lower   and serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and a higher HDL-C/LDL-C ratio than the CR-LCT group ( < 0.05). The concentrations of primary bile acids (primarily CA) and secondary bile acids in faeces and secondary bile acids in bile in the CR-MCT group were significantly higher than in the CR-LCT group ( < 0.05). C8:0 and C10:0 decreased the permeability of CA in Caco-2 cell monolayers. MCT/MCFAs (C8:0 and C10:0) inhibited I-BABP gene expression in the small intestines and Caco-2 cells ( < 0.05).MCT slowed the  increase and promoted the excretion of bile acids. MCT lowered serum cholesterol levels at least partially via reduction of bile  absorption in the small intestine by inhibition of I-BABP expression.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ethyl acetate fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc) in the modulation of lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In cellular studies, CO-EtOAc attenuated -induced lipid accumulation; we then elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CO-EtOAc in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of fatty  transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and lipogenesis genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited  gain, epididymal adipose tissue , and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of fatty  transporter, lipogenesis, and fatty  oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet.

Oxymatrine (OMT) alone or combined with other drugs can ameliorate paraquat- or -induced lung injury. However, the effect of OMT on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether OMT can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through regulation of the ENaC and MAPK pathway using an ALI mouse model. Histological assessment of the lung and inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were performed by H&E and Wright-Giemsa staining. The lung wet/dry (W/D)  ratio and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), ENaC subunits, and the MAPK pathway members were determined. Isolated type II rat alveolar epithelial cells were incubated with OMT 30 min before LPS stimulation to investigate the activation of ENaC and the MAPK pathway. The results showed that OMT remarkably alleviated histopathologic changes in lung and pulmonary edema, reduced inflammatory cell counts in BALF, and decreased TNF-α and CRP levels in a dose-dependent manner. OMT significantly increased the three subunits of ENaC proteins in vivo and in vitro, while it decreased p-ERK/ERK, p-p38/p38, and p-JNK/JNK ratios in vivo. However, only the JNK pathway was markedly inhibited in vitro following pretreatment with OMT.

The evaluation of non-conventional water resources and water-saving techniques has gained importance during the last decades in arid and semiarid environments. This study evaluated the effects of irrigation with two water sources: low-cost water DEsalination and SEnsoR Technology (DESERT) desalinated water (DW) EC ∼1 dS m) and reclaimed water (RW) (EC ∼ 3 dS m) combined with two irrigation strategies: full irrigation (FI) (100% of ET) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI, 50% of ET) on fruit yield, ripening indices, and oil yield and quality of olive trees cv Arbosana planted in Mediterranean conditions. Our results showed that RW without water restrictions increased the fruit yield by 35% due to a slight increase in the fruit  and, mainly, to a greater fruit set than the control trees; although this did not result in a higher oil yield (g tree) since the oil content per fruit dry  was reduced. The RDI strategy did not decrease the fruit yield despite the fact that olive  tended to decrease, and it increased the oil yield by ∼14.5%. The combination of both stresses (RW and RDI) neither decreased the fruit yield; however, it significantly reduced oil yield (25% less in 2018) since oil content per fruit dry  was strongly reduced (40%) compared to control trees. Both RDI treatments, regardless water source, determined acidity levels in olive paste lower than in FI treatments; however, it reduced oil extractability and fatty yield. The finding about oil quality indicated that olive exposure to RW, regardless of the water amount, decreased oil quality mainly due to the reduction of  and the increase of C18:2/C18:3 ratio and peroxides; on the contrary, both RW and RDI improved the total polyphenols. In all cases, the parameters met the legislation. In short, with appropriate management, RW and RDI have great potential to manage oil olive production; nevertheless, studies subjected to long-term use of these techniques should be experienced to ensure the sustainability of oil yields and quality.Copyright © 2019 Romero-Trigueros, Vivaldi, Nicolás, Paduano, Salcedo and Camposeo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660334>Fatty acids modulate the efficacy of lutein in cataract prevention: Assessment of oxidative and inflammatory parameters in rats.</a></h2><p>Effects of lutein (L) and fatty acids [linoleic  (LA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)+docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (OA)] on oxidative stress and inflammation in cataract were assessed.Cataract was induced in male Wistar rat pups (11 days old) by giving a single dose of sodium selenite (25 μM/kg ) by IP. Lutein (1.3 μmol/kg ) was given one day before and five days after selenite injection as a micelle with 7.5 mM LA, or 7.5 mM EPA + DHA or 7.5 mM OA. Serum and lens oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters having a bearing cataract were assessed.Serum and lens nitric oxide, MDA and protein carbonyls were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in cataract compared to control and experimental groups. Catalase, SOD, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase activity and glutathione level in serum and lens of cataract group were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased. Serum eicosanoids (PGE, LTB, and LTC) and cytokines (CRP, TNF-α, IL1-β, and MCP-1) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in cataract. The activity of cPLA2 and Cox-2 in cataract lens was higher (p < 0.05) compared to other groups. EP-1, NOS-2 and NF-kB expression were higher (p < 0.05) in cataract. The ratio of water insoluble to water soluble protein was increased in cataract lens. Group administered with L + EPA + DHA exhibited highest cataract prevention compared to L + LA and L + OA. Pups given lutein with EPA + DHA had the highest amount of lutein in the lens.The anti-cataract activity of lutein was influenced by fatty acids and found to be highest with EPA + DHA compared to LA or OA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

They are rich in bioactive molecules with nutritional, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or hormone-like properties. In the present study, the concentrations of phenolics, triterpenic acids, carotenoids and vitamins, as well as fatty  profiles and antioxidant activity, were analyzed in the edible portion of black table olives (Olea europea L.) from Italian (Cellina di Nardò and Leccino) and Greek (Kalamàta and Conservolea) cultivars fermented with selected autochthonous starters and in the corresponding monovarietal olive oils.On a fresh  basis, Cellina di Nardò and Leccino table olives showed the highest total phenolic content. No significant differences were found with respect to the levels of total triterpenic (maslinic and oleanolic) acids and vitamin E among cultivars. All table olives were characterized by high amounts of , linoleic and palmitic acids. Oils were richer in lipophilic antioxidants (carotenoids and tocochromanols) than table olives, which, instead, showed a higher content of polyphenols and triterpenic acids than oils.The present study demonstrates that fermented table olives are an excellent natural source of unsaturated fatty acids, as well as being nutritionally important health-promoting bioactive compounds. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445019>M3 muscarinic receptor activation reduces hepatocyte lipid accumulation via CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that hepatic muscarinic receptors modulate both acute and chronic liver injury, however, the role of muscarinic receptors in fatty liver disease is unclear. We observed in patients who underwent  loss surgery, a decrease in hepatic expression of M3 muscarinic receptors (M3R). We also observed that fat loading of hepatocytes, increased M3R expression. Based on these observations, we tested the hypothesis that M3R regulate hepatocyte lipid accumulation. Incubation of AML12 hepatocytes with 1 mM  resulted in lipid accumulation that was significantly reduced by co-treatment with a muscarinic agonist (pilocarpine or carbachol), an effect blocked by atropine (a muscarinic antagonist). Similar treatment of Hepa 1-6 cells, a mouse hepatoblastoma cell line, showed comparable results. In both, control and fat-loaded AML12 cells, pilocarpine induced time-dependent AMPKα phosphorylation and significantly up-regulated lipolytic genes (ACOX1, CPT1, and PPARα). Compound C, a selective and reversible AMPK inhibitor, significantly blunted pilocarpine-mediated reduction of lipid accumulation and pilocarpine-mediated up-regulation of lipolytic genes. BAPTA-AM, a calcium chelator, and STO-609, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase inhibitor, attenuated agonist-induced AMPKα phosphorylation. Finally, M3R siRNA attenuated agonist-induced AMPKα phosphorylation as well as agonist-mediated reduction of hepatocyte steatosis. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that M3R has protective effects against hepatocyte lipid accumulation by activating AMPK pathway and is a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Pakistan, the production of edible oil is less than the required quantity; the situation is being worsened with the increasing population. Thus, there is dire need to grow those sunflower genotypes which perform better under a given set of agronomic practices. In this 2-year study, we compared four sunflower genotypes, viz., Armoni, Kundi, Sinji, and S-278 for their yield potential, oil contents, fatty  composition, and profitability under three sowing methods, viz., bed sowing, line sowing, and ridge sowing and two tillage system, viz., plow till and minimum till. Among the sunflower genotypes, the genotype Armoni produced the highest plant height, number of leaves, head diameter, 1000-achene , and achene yield; the oil contents and  were the highest in genotype Sinji. Among the sowing methods, the highest number of leaves per plant, head diameter, number of achenes per head, achene yield, and oil contents were recorded in ridge sowing. Among the tillage systems, the highest head diameter 16. 2 cm, 1000-achene  (57.2 g), achene yield (1.8 t ha), oil contents (35.2%), and  (15.2%) were recorded in minimum till sunflower.

The dietary treatments were as follows: CON (control total mixed ration with SBM, no WLS), WLS30 (30% of the SBM was replaced, on a DM basis, by WLS), and WLS50 (50% of the SBM was replaced by WLS).Feed intake by the cows was not affected (p = 0.331) by the diets. Milk production decreased with increasing proportions of WLS in the diet. Cows fed WLS50 yielded approximately 1 kg/d (p < 0.001) less milk than cows fed the CON diet. The proportions of milk fat (p = 0.640), protein (p = 0.507), and lactose (p = 0.709) were not altered by the diet. For milk fat, feeding with WLS50 reduced the proportion of total short-chain fatty acids (SFA; p < 0.001) and increased the proportion of total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; p < 0.001), mainly through  (p < 0.001). No differences were found in feed efficiency, , and blood plasma metabolites between groups. Rumen ammonia-N levels tended (p = 0.087) to increase with increasing proportions of WLS in the diet, whereas no effect of diet on rumen pH was found (p = 0.558).We did not identify the safe range within which raw WLS can efficiently replace SBM in the diet of high-producing dairy cows.

In an effort to streamline the fatty  extraction process, this study compared the standard Folch lipid extraction method to a one-step method involving a column that selectively elutes the lipid phase. The methods were tested on raw beef, salmon, and chicken. Compared to the standard Folch method, the one-step extraction process generally yielded statistically insignificant differences in chicken and salmon fatty  concentrations, percent composition and  percent. Initial testing showed that beef stearic,  and total fatty  concentrations were significantly lower by 9-11% with the one-step method as compared to the Folch method, but retesting on a different batch of samples showed a significant 4-8% increase in several omega-3 and omega-6 fatty  concentrations with the one-step method relative to the Folch. Overall, the findings reflect the utility of a one-step extraction method for routine and rapid monitoring of fatty acids in chicken and salmon. Inconsistencies in beef concentrations, although minor (within 11%), may be due to matrix effects.A one-step fatty  extraction method has broad applications for rapidly and routinely monitoring fatty acids in the food supply and formulating controlled dietary interventions.© 2017 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478005>Nutritional profile and nutraceutical components of olive ( L.) seeds.</a></h2><p>Olive seeds, a potential food by-product from both table olive and olive oil industries, were examined for their overall proximate composition, oil, protein, mineral and phenolic components.

DHA and EPA are omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that are plentiful in fish oil, and  is an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty , rich in olive oil. Dietary intake of these unsaturated long-chain fatty acids have been associated with insulin sensitivity and  loss, which contrasts with the impairment of insulin sensitivity and  gain associated with high intakes of saturated long-chain fatty acids. The recent discovery that free fatty  receptor 4 (FFA4, also known as GPR120) acts as a sensor for unsaturated long-chain fatty acids started to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial functions played by these unsaturated long-chain fatty acids in various physiological processes, which include the secretions of gastrointestinal peptide hormones and glucose homeostasis.

Hyperlipidemic rats treated with APNO showed a reduction in the total serum cholesterol similar to those treated with simvastatin, an increased  temperature by 1 °C, and a reduction in the  gain and mesenteric depot of white adipose tissue compared to the hyperlipidemic controls rats. There was an increase in the relative liver  of rats treated with APNO, without, however, any change in the serum markers of hepatic toxicity. In addition, there was an increase in the moisture and lipid content of the feces of the rats treated with APNO compared to the controls.

Hepatic levels of miR-27a were significantly augmented in HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Further studies demonstrated that miR-27a directly interacted with 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of hepatic Fasn and Scd1 mRNAs and reduced their expression levels in mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-27a robustly blocked sodium oleate-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes and reduced liver TG contents in mice via repressing hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of hepatic miR-27a impaired lipid contents of livers and attenuated NAFLD development through suppressing lipogenesis in HCD-fed and ob/ob mice.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, , behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced liver steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with insulin resistance parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in insulin signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029479>Altered materno-fetal transfer of 13C-polyunsaturated fatty acids in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity at conception is considered a major predictor of offspring obesity. This could by driven at least in part by an altered placental fat transfer. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We investigated the in vivo materno-fetal transfer of fatty acids (FAs) in obese pregnant women using stable isotopes.Ten obese and ten normo- pregnant women (control) received orally a bolus of C-labeled FAs 12 h before elective caesarean section:  (C-OA), linoleic  (C-LA) and docosahexaenoic  (C-DHA). Maternal blood samples were collected at -12 (basal), -8, -4, -2, 0 h relative to the time of cesarean section. At the time of birth, arterial and venous cord bloods as well as placental tissue were collected. FAs composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.Maternal plasma insulin and placental  tended to higher values in obese pregnant women although they did not present serum hyperlipidemia. Higher concentrations of C-LA and C-DHA were found in non-esterified FAs fraction in maternal plasma of obese mothers. The ratio of placental uptake for C-LA and C-DHA was lower in obese women compared to normal  pointing toward a limited capacity of FA placental transfer, especially of essential FAs. Maternal insulin was associated to this lower placenta/maternal plasma ratio for both C-LA (R = -0.563, P = 0.012) and C-DHA (R = -0.478, P = 0.033). In addition, the ratio cord/maternal plasma of C-LA was significantly lower in obese women compared to controls.In conclusion, obese mothers without hyperlipidemia showed a reduced materno-fetal transfer of polyunsaturated FAs which could affect fetal development. This affect dietary recommendation for obese pregnant women.ISRCTN69794527.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Lambs were blocked by BW and allocated to alfalfa paddocks (2 lambs/paddock and 3 paddocks/treatment). Each paddock within a block was assigned randomly to drinking water treatments for 30 d: 1) control (CON), 2) 120 g fructose/L of drinking water (FRU), or 3) 120 g glycerol/L of drinking water (GLY). Lambs grazed alfalfa with free access to water treatments for 28 d and then were fasted in indoor pens for a final 2 d with access to only water treatments. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with water treatment and time (when appropriate) in the model. During the 28-d grazing period, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON or FRU. During the 2-d fasting period, BW shrink was lower ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with CON or FRU. Hot carcass  was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for FRU. The interaction for glycogen content × postmortem time was significant ( = 0.003) in LM and semitendinosus (ST) muscles.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet. Here, we evaluated the relationship among hepatic mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-AKT2-insulin-induced gene 2 (Insig2) signaling, lipogenic transcription factors and lipid synthesis enzymes in obese mice with or without RYGB operation. Hepatic mTOR activity and Insig2a were stimulated, while AKT2, sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were decreased by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in both DMSO and rapamycin treated diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Increment of hepatic lipogenesis and decline of mTOR signaling induced by rapamycin were significantly reversed by RYGB in DIO mice. RYGB significantly improved high-fat diet- and rapamycin- induced hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo lipogenesis. Administration of adenovirus-mediated p70 ribosomal protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (Ad-S6K1) from tail vein improved hepatic steatosis. Infusion of Ad-S6K1 suppressed AKT2, SREBP1c, PPARγ, and lipogenesis-related genes while stimulating Insig2a in DIO mice. Ad-S6K1 decreased -induced lipid deposition in primary mouse hepatocytes. Our results suggest that mTOR-AKT2-Insig2 signaling pathway contributes to the improvement effect of RYGB on hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat diet.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, examples of their combination with other materials are relatively rare. Herein, a salt-free zero-charged catanionic surfactant with low chain melting temperature was prepared by mixing equimolar tetradecyltrimethylammonium oxide (TTAOH) and  (OA) in water, and its concentration-dependent aggregate transition was investigated. In the dilute region (c ≤ 5 wt%), fluorescence microscopy observations revealed the formation of vesicles (the L phase). Further increasing c induced a transition from the L phase to LLCs via a region where vesicles and lamellae coexist. With ordered hydrophobic domains, the LLCs can be used as hosts for the doping of fullerene C (refers to C hereafter) with the highest C/TTAO  ratio of 0.04. The doping of C effectively improves the viscoelasticity of the LLCs confirmed by rheological characterization while only slight modifications on their matrixes have been detected using small angle X-ray scattering measurements. The LLC/C hybrids with c = 80 wt% were then subjected to tribological measurements, and an obvious reduction in their friction coefficients and wear volumes was observed. The C/TTAO  ratio at which the best tribological performance appears was determined to be 0.01.

Role of Sirtuins 1 and 3.</a></h2><p>Susceptibility to develop hypertension may be established during early stages of life that include the intrauterine period, infancy and childhood. We recently showed that blood pressure increased when rats reached adulthood when sucrose was ingested for a short-term critical window from postnatal day 12 to 28 in the rat, which corresponds to days around weaning. Here, we studied several factors that might participate in the increased susceptibility to hypertension when adulthood is reached by analyzing the changes produced at the end of the sucrose ingestion during this critical period.  of the rats at the end of the sucrose period was decreased even if there was an increased ingestion in Kcal. We found an increase in blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in the aorta. When insulin was administered to rats receiving sucrose, glucose in plasma diminished later than in controls and this slight insulin resistance may reduce nitric oxide synthase action.  that modulates eNOS expression was increased, lipoperoxidation was elevated and total non-enzymatic anti-oxidant capacity was decreased. There was also a decrease in SOD2 expression. We also studied the expression of Sirt1, which regulates eNOS expression and Sirt3, which regulates SOD2 expression as possible epigenetic targets of enzyme expression involved in the long- term programming of hypertension. Sirt3 was decreased but we did not find an alteration in Sirt1 expression. We conclude that these changes may underpin the epigenetic programming of increased susceptibility to develop hypertension in the adults when there was exposure to high sucrose levels near weaning in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31093907>Activity-Structure Study on the Peptide Fraction of AG2: a Potent In Vitro Transfection Agent.</a></h2><p>Gemini-based amphiphiles are candidates for biomedical applications.

We synthesized a series of novel amphiphilic amino  derivatives of low molecular , named AGn-C (N), in which the same apolar region (m) of  or palmitic  was maintained and the peptide region was modified by amino  insertions, deletions, and substitutions. We also determined the transfection efficiency, critical micelle concentration, particle size, and ζ-potential for these derivatives. Amphiphiles AG10-C and AG10-C were more active at a lower N/P ratio than AG2-C. These amphiphiles showed no activity when lysine was replaced by ornithine, and the activity of all derivatives increased when there were more ornithine residues and a W/O = 1 ratio in the peptide region. It can be said that for AG10-C, these two structural requirements on the amino  portion predominated over the type of aliphatic chain used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959800>Effects of pearl millet silage ammoniation with urea on carcass and meat quality of lambs.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pearl millet silage ammoniated with urea on lamb carcass characteristics and meat quality. Thirty-two noncastrated crossbred lambs at 4-5 months of age, with an average initial  of 17.39 ± 2.16 kg, were distributed into four treatments in a randomized block experimental design with eight animals per treatment. Experimental diets were composed of pearl millet silage ammoniated with four levels of urea (0%, 2%, 4% and 6%, on dry matter basis (DM). Carcass conformation and fatness decreased linearly (p < 0.05). Except for the fat content, the proximate composition was not influenced (p < 0.05) by the diets. Meat lightness and yellowness increased linearly (p < 0.05). There was no effect of diets (p > 0.05) on cooking losses or shear force. The levels of  and erucic fatty  levels in the meat decreased linearly (p < 0.05), whereas linoleic and eicosadienoic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA:SFA ratio and ω6 contents increased (p < 0.05). Pearl millet silage ammoniated with urea allows for the production of good-quality lamb meat, with greater concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, lambs fed diets with pearl millet ammoniated with up to 6% lead to a reduction of carcass characteristics without significantly affecting loin-eye area possibly associated with low palatability of the additive used. The lower acceptance of the silages with higher levels of urea is due to the ammonia retention in the material is attributed to the ammonization process. Thus, in spite of the benefits on lamb meat quality, it is suggested that the use of this additive in the ammonization of tropical forages be carried out with care, in limits of up to 6%.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29337857>Low Molecular  Chitosan-Insulin Complexes Solubilized in a Mixture of Self-Assembled Labrosol and Plurol Oleaque and Their Glucose Reduction Activity in Rats.</a></h2><p>Oral insulin delivery that better mimics physiological pathways is a necessity as it ensures patient comfort and compliance. A system which is based on a vehicle of nano order where positively charged chitosan interacts with negatively charged insulin and forms a polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) solubilizate, which is then solubilized into an oily phase of , labrasol, and plurol oleaque-protects insulin against enzymatic gastrointestinal reduction. The use of an anionic fatty  in the oily phase, such as , is thought to allow an interaction with cationic chitosan, hence reducing particle size. Formulations were assessed based on their hypoglycaemic capacities in diabetic rats as compared to conventional subcutaneous dosage forms. 50 IU/kg oral insulin strength could only induce blood glucose reduction equivalent to that of 5 IU/kg (1 International unit = 0.0347 mg of human insulin). Parameters that influence the pharmacological availability were evaluated. A preliminary investigation of the mechanism of absorption suggests the involvement of the lymphatic route.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473916>Effects of Diets Differing in Composition of 18-C Fatty Acids on Adipose Tissue Thermogenic Gene Expression in Mice Fed High-Fat Diets.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids play important roles in the regulation of fat accumulation or metabolic phenotype of adipocytes, either as brown or beige fat. However, a systematic comparison of effects of diets with different composition of 18-C fatty acids on browning/beiging phenotype has not been done. In this study, we compared the effects of different dietary fats, rich in specific 18-carbon fatty acids, on thermogenesis and lipid metabolism. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet containing 5.6% kcal fat from lard and 4.4% kcal fat from soybean oil (CON) or high-fat diets (HFD) containing 25% kcal from lard and 20% kcal fat from shea butter (stearic -rich fat; SHB), olive oil (-rich oil; OO), safflower oil (linoleic -rich oil; SFO), or soybean oil (mixed , linoleic, and α-linolenic acids; SBO)  for 12 weeks, with or without a terminal 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. When compared to SHB, feeding OO, SFO, and SBO resulted in lower  gain. The OO fed group had the highest thermogenesis level, which resulted in lower  fat accumulation and improved glucose and lipid metabolism. Feeding SFO downregulated expression of lipid oxidation-related genes and upregulated expression of lipogenic genes, perhaps due to its high n-6:n-3 ratio. In general, HFD-feeding downregulated  expression in both subcutaneous and epididymal white adipose tissue, and suppressed NE-induced  expression in brown adipose tissue. These results suggest that the position of double bonds in dietary fatty acids, as well as the quantity of dietary fat, may have a significant effect on the regulation of oxidative and thermogenic conditions in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760668>Optimization of Synechococcus sp. VDW Cultivation with Artificially Prepared Shrimp Wastewater for Ammonium Removal and Its Potential for Use As a Biofuel Feedstock.</a></h2><p>To investigate the potential of application of marine cyanobacterium for concurrent biomass production and ammonium removal, Synechococcus sp. VDW was cultured under different conditions in medium containing varying concentrations of NHCl. Response surface methodology (RSM) was then used to build a predictive model of the combined effects of independent variables (pH, inoculum size, ammonium concentration). At the optimum conditions of initial pH 7.4, inoculum size 0.17 (OD730) and ammonium concentration 10.5 mg L, the maximum ammonium removal and biomass productivity were about 95% and 34 mg Ld, respectively, after seven days of cultivation. The result of fatty  methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed that the major fatty acids were palmitic  (C16:0), linoleic  (C18:2 n6 cis), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1 n9 cis), which accounted for more than 80%  of total fatty acids. Further, analysis of neutral lipid accumulation using flow cytometry revealed that the mean of the fluorescence intensity increased under optimal conditions. These results indicate that Synechococcus sp.

Obesity is directly linked to breathing problems and medical complications with lung, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma….In the present work, we aimed to investigate the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on lung lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, fatty  composition and proportions in lung and implication in asthma development. The likely protection provided by grape seed extract (GSSE) was also investigated.In order to assess HFD effect on lung and GSSE protection we used a rat model. We analyzed the lipid plasma profile, lung peroxidation and antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT and POD). We also analyzed transition metals (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and iron) and lung free fatty acids using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS).HFD induced lipid profile imbalance increasing cholesterol and VLDL-C. HFD also induced an oxidative stress assessed by elevated MDA level and the drop of antioxidant activities such as SOD, CAT and POD. Moreover, HFD induced mineral disturbances by decreasing magnesium level and increasing Calcium and iron levels. HFD induced also disturbances in lung fatty  composition by increasing , stearic and arachidonic acids. Interestingly, GSSE alleviated all these deleterious effects of HFD treatment.As a whole, GSSE had a significant preventive effect against HFD-induced obesity, and hence may be used as an anti-obesity agent, and a benefic agent with potential applications against damages in lung tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208481>Detection thresholds for four different fatty stimuli are associated with increased dietary intake of processed high-caloric food.</a></h2><p>BMI-specific differences in food choice and energy intake have been suggested to modulate taste perception. However, associations between  composition and fat taste sensitivity are controversial. The objective of this study was to examine the association between  composition, dietary intake and detection thresholds of four fatty stimuli (, paraffin oil, canola oil, and canola oil spiked with ) that could be perceived via gustatory and/or textural cues. In 30 participants, fat detection thresholds were determined in a repeated measurements design over twelve days.  status was examined by measuring the participants' BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. The habitual food intake was assessed via several questionnaires and twelve, non-consecutive 24-hour food diaries. In this study, a negative correlation was found between fat detection thresholds and the intake of food rich in vitamins and fibre. Moreover, a positive correlation was identified between the intake of high-fat food and fat detection thresholds. No differences in fat detection thresholds were observed due to variations in BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. These findings indicate that a regular intake of fatty foods might decrease an individuals' perceptual response to fats which might lead to excess fat intake on the long term.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An in vitro NAFLD model was generated by treating HepG2 cells with  and palmitic acids. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) with or without supplementation with either 1% or 3% TA (w/w) for 12 weeks. Finally, the possibility of interacting p300 and TA was simulated.TA suppressed HAT activity both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TA abrogated occupancy of p300 on the sterol regulatory element in the fatty  synthase and ATP-citrate lyase promoters, eventually inducing hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H3K36. Furthermore, TA decreased acetylation at lysine residues 9 and 36 of histone H3 protein and that of total proteins. Consequently, TA decreased the mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes and attenuated lipid accumulation in vivo. We observed that NAFLD features, including , liver mass, fat mass, and lipid profile in serum, were improved by TA supplementation in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility that TA directly binds to p300 through docking simulation between ligand and protein.Our findings demonstrate that TA, a novel HATi, has potential application for the prevention of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Therefore, we propose a new type of artificial skin for humanoid robots with hybrid functions, which we have termed hybrid skin (H-Skin). To realize the fabrication of such a solar cell, we have continued to utilize the principles of ordinary solid-state wet-type or dye-sensitized solar rubber as a follow-up study to the first report. In the first report, we dealt with both photovoltaic- and piezo-effects for dry-type magnetic compound fluid (MCF) rubber solar cells, which were generated because the polyisoprene,  of the magnetic fluid (MF), and water served as p- and n- semiconductors. In the present report, we deal with wet-type MCF rubber solar cells by using sensitized dyes and electrolytes. Photoreactions generated through the synthesis of these components were investigated by an experiment using irradiation with visible and ultraviolet light. In addition, magnetic clusters were formed by the aggregation of Fe₃O₄ in the MF and the metal particles created the hetero-junction structure of the semiconductors. In the MCF rubber solar cell, both photo- and piezo-electricity were generated using a physical model. The effects of tension and compression on their electrical properties were evaluated. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated the effect of the distance between the electrodes of the solar cell on photoelectricity and built-in electricity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668424>Lycopus lucidus Turcz. ex Benth.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The , relative liver , hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the , relative liver , serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

Alterations in triglyceride metabolism, inflammation and oxidative status were monitored. Results show that IF mainly reduced triglyceride accumulation, TNF-α release and ROS activation in metabolic disordered cells. Next, a high-fat diet, which induced a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, was used to evaluate the therapeutic action of IF. Our results show that treatment with IF significantly inhibited the high-fat diet-induced elevation in , liver , lipid metabolism (TG, TC and HDL-C) and hepatic injury in mice. In biochemical terms, treatment with IF resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC, as well as reduced hepatic expression of FAS and HMGC, suggesting that lipogenesis was compromised. We also found robust evidence that treatment with IF significantly depleted infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80 Kupffer cells and CD68 macrophages) and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity in IF-treated hepatic tissue correlated with down-regulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB transcription.

To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall  composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high  canola oil:docosahexaenoic ; H+EPA, 85:15 high  canola oil:eicosapentaenoic ; HOCO, high  canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on energy expenditure and overall  composition to determine if dietary fatty  (DFA) composition affects diet-induced obesity (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of  composition, energy expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710138>Disruption of Lipid Uptake in Astroglia Exacerbates Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>Neuronal circuits in the brain help to control feeding behavior and systemic metabolism in response to afferent nutrient and hormonal signals. Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate energy homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by , whereas it is decreased in response to palmitic  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated  gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic insulin resistance. We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution,  regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28751159>Ghrelin ameliorates acute lung injury induced by  via inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with excessive mortality and lacks appropriate therapy. Ghrelin is a novel peptide that protects the lung against ALI. This study aimed to investigate whether endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) mediates the protective effect of ghrelin on ALI.We used a rat  (OA)-induced ALI model. Pulmonary impairment was detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, lung mechanics, wet/dry  ratio, and arterial blood gas analysis. Plasma and lung content of ghrelin was examined by ELISA, and mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein levels were detected by western blot.Rats with OA treatment showed significant pulmonary injury, edema, inflammatory cellular infiltration, cytokine release, hypoxia and CO retention as compared with controls. Plasma and pulmonary content of ghrelin was reduced in rats with ALI, and mRNA expression was downregulated. Ghrelin (10nmol/kg) treatment ameliorated the above symptoms, but treatment with the ghrelin antagonists D-Lys GHRP-6 (1μmol/kg) and JMV 2959 (6mg/kg) exacerbated the symptoms. ERS induced by OA was prevented by ghrelin and augmented by ghrelin antagonist treatment. The ERS inducer, tunicamycin (Tm) prevented the ameliorative effect of ghrelin on ALI. The decreased ratio of p-Akt and Akt induced by OA was improved by ghrelin treatment, and was further exacerbated by ghrelin antagonists.Ghrelin protects against ALI by inhibiting ERS. These results provide a new target for prevention and therapy of ALI.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Rat ALI model was established by injection of 0.01 mL/kg  into the tail vein. Rats in the control group were injected with the same amount of normal saline (NS). In the ALI + KGF-2 group, 5 mg/kg of KGF-2 was instilled into the airway of rats 72 hours before the model preparation, and the control group and the ALI model group were instilled with the same amount of NS. The lung permeability index (LPI) and lung wet/dry  (W / D) ratios were measured 8 hours after the model preparation. The permeability of pulmonary microvascular endothelium was evaluated by Evans blue leakage test. Histopathological changes were observed under light microscope and the ALI pathology score (LIS) was calculated. Ultrastructural changes of lung tissue were observed under electron microscope. The apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. The expression of Claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE Cadherin in lung tissue was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Western Blot, and qRT-PCR, respectively.The ALI model group had severe lung injury and obvious pathological changes, including alveolar septal thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration. TUNEL assay showed that the apoptosis of ALI group was significantly increased. The LIS score, lung W/D ratio, LPI, and Evans blue leakage were significantly higher than those in the control group; electron microscopy showed that the alveolar-capillary barrier was severely damaged in the ALI group. Compared with the control group, the expression of Claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE cadherin in the lung tissue of the ALI model group was significantly attenuated. After pretreatment with KGF-2, the degree of lung tissue damage was significantly reduced and the pathological changes were significantly improved. TUNEL assay showed that the apoptosis of ALI group was decreased. Lung W/D ratio, LPI, and Evans blue leakage decreased; electron microscopy showed that the alveolar-capillary barrier of ALI group recovered significantly. Compared with the ALI model group, the expression of Claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE cadherin in the lung tissue of the KGF-2 pretreatment group increased.The results indicate that KGF-2 may attenuate -induced ALI in rats by maintaining the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier, which is an effective ALI preventive measure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29659214>Investigations of Magnetic Properties of  and Oleyl Amine Capped Nanostructured Co( x) Ni(1−x)  (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) Alloys.</a></h2><p>In this study, nanocrystalline  and oleyl amine capped Co x Ni1−x alloys (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) have been synthesized via chemical reduction route. As-prepared as well as annealed samples were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CoNi alloys were found to be capped with -oleylamine complex even after heat treatment up to 400 °BC. XRD patterns confirm that the CoNi alloys crystallize in pure fcc phase with average crystallite sizes in the range of 8–11 nm. TEM micrographs confirm nearly spherical morphologies with narrow particle size distribution of the synthesized CoNi alloys. Average TEM particle sizes range from 7 nm to 12 nm. As-prepared as well as annealed CoNi alloys are ferromagnetic in nature at 298 K. M s values for annealed CoNi alloys are found to be in the range of 25–59.6 emu/g after correction for  fraction of capped matrix and H c values are in the range of 52–314 Oe. Observed magnetic properties have been interpreted on the basis of size effects, altered crystal anisotropies and spin canting on the surface. FC/ZFC magnetization measurements show magnetic irreversibility and superparamagnetic blocking of nanoparticles due to strong dipolar interactions and particle size distribution. A structure-property correlation in CoNi alloys has been attempted in this investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484482>Investigation of the Genetic Diversity and Quantitative Trait Loci Accounting for Important Agronomic and Seed Quality Traits in .</a></h2><p> (BBCC) is an allotetraploid in  with unique alleles for agronomic traits and has huge potential as source for biodiesel production. To investigate the genome-wide molecular diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern in this species, we genotyped a panel of 81 accessions of  with genotyping by sequencing approach DArTseq, generating a total of 54,510 polymorphic markers. Two subpopulations were exhibited in the  accessions. The average distance of LD decay ( = 0.1) in B subgenome (0.25 Mb) was shorter than that of C subgenome (0.40 Mb). Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) identified a total of seven markers significantly associated with five seed quality traits in two experiments. To further identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important agronomic and seed quality traits, we phenotyped a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population derived from the "YW" cross between two parents (Y-BcDH64 and W-BcDH76) representing from the two subpopulations. The YW DH population and its parents were grown in three contrasting environments; spring (Hezheng and Xining, China), semi-winter (Wuhan, China), and spring (Wagga Wagga, Australia) across 5 years for QTL mapping. Genetic bases of phenotypic variation in seed yield and its seven related traits, and six seed quality traits were determined. A total of 282 consensus QTL accounting for these traits were identified including nine major QTL for flowering time, , linolenic , pod number of main inflorescence, and seed . Of these, 109 and 134 QTL were specific to spring and semi-winter environment, respectively, while 39 consensus QTL were identified in both contrasting environments. Two QTL identified for linolenic  (B3) and erucic  (C7) were validated in the diverse lines used for GWAS. A total of 25 QTL accounting for flowering time, erucic , and  were aligned to the homologous QTL or candidate gene regions in the C genome of . These results would not only provide insights for genetic improvement of this species, but will also identify useful genetic variation hidden in the C subgenome of  to improve canola cultivars.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28504296>Supplementation with n-3, n-6, n-9 fatty acids in an insulin-resistance animal model: does it improve VLDL quality?</a></h2><p>Insulin-resistance (IR), of increased cardiovascular risk, is characterized by the production of altered VLDL with greater atherogenicity. Dietary fatty acids influence the type of circulating VLDL. But, it is not clear how dietary fatty acids impact VLDL characteristics in IR.to evaluate the effects of n-3, n-6 and n-9 fatty  supplementation on preventing atherogenic alterations in VLDL, in a diet-induced IR rat model. Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were fed: standard diet (control, n = 8) and a sucrose rich diet (30% sucrose in water/12 weeks, SRD; n = 24). Simultaneously, SRD was subdivided into SRD-C (standard diet), and three other groups supplemented (15% w/w) with: fish oil (SRD-n3), sunflower oil (SRD-n6) and high  sunflower oil (SRD-n9). Lipid profile, free fatty acids, glucose, and insulin were measured. Isolated VLDL (d < 1.006 g ml) was characterized by chemical composition and size (size exclusion-HPLC). In comparison with SRD-C: SRD-n3 showed an improved lipoprotein profile (p < 0.01), with lower levels of insulin and HOMA-IR (p < 0.05). SRD-n6 showed increased levels of HDL-cholesterol and lower insulin levels. SRD-n9 did not exhibit differences in lipid and IR profile, and even favored  gain and visceral fat. Only SRD-n3 prevented the alterations in VLDL-TG% (54.2 ± 4.4% vs. 68.6 ± 8.2, p < 0.05) and showed lower large VLDL-% (22.5[19.7-35.6] vs. 49.1[15.5-82.0], p < 0.05), while SRD-n6 and SRD-n9 did not show effects.In IR, while n-3 PUFA showed expected favorable effects, supplementation with n-6 PUFA and n-9 MUFA did not prevent atherogenic alterations of VLDL. Thus, the recommendations of supplementation with these fatty acids in general diet should be revised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617756>Preparation and Characterization of an Oral Norethindrone Sustained Release/Controlled Release Nanoparticles Formulation Based on Chitosan.</a></h2><p>Norethindrone has short half-life and low bioavailability. The objective was to prepare an oral Sustained Release/Controlled Release (SR/CR) Liquid Medicated Formulation (LMF) to enhance bioavailability and improve patient compliance. Norethindrone was solubilized in HP-β-CD then complexed with different concentrations of Low Molecular  Chitosan (LMWC) (mucoadhesive). PolyElectrolyte Complexes (PECs) were homogenized with  using different concentrations of tween 80 to form LMFs (nanoemulsions). PECs and LMFs were characterized using different techniques. LMF 2 (optimum formula containing 2.5% w/v LMWC 11 kDa) was administered orally to dogs and mice for pharmacokinetic and adhesion evaluation. DSC, FTIR spectroscopy and SEM images indicated complex formation. Mean diameters of PECs were 183-425 nm, mean zeta potentials were + 18.6-+ 31 mV, and complexation efficiencies were 18.0-20.6%. Ten to fifteen percent tween was needed to prepare homogenous LMFs. Mean diameter of LMF 2 was 10.5 ± 0.57 nm, mean zeta potential was - 11.07 ± - 0.49 mV, encapsulation efficiency was 95.28 ± 1.75%, and each mL contained 145.5 μg norethindrone. SEM images showed spherical homogeneous oil droplets. All of these parameters were affected by molecular  and concentration of chitosan. Norethindrone release from LMFs was controlled (zero order) for 96 h. It was little affected by molecular  and concentration of chitosan but affected by concentration of tween 80. LMF 2 adhered to GIT for 48 h and enhanced the bioavailability. It showed no cytotoxicity after considering dilution in GIT and was stable for 3 months refrigerated. In conclusion an effective SR/CR LMF was prepared.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29040293>Mapping of important taxonomic and productivity traits using genic and non-genic transposable element markers in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.).</a></h2><p>A mapping population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from TMV 2 and its mutant, TMV 2-NLM was employed for mapping important taxonomic and productivity traits using genic and non-genic transposable element markers in peanut. Single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number variation using RAD-Sequencing data indicated very limited polymorphism between TMV 2 and TMV 2-NLM. But phenotypically they differed significantly for many taxonomic and productivity traits. Also, the RIL population showed significant variation for a few additional agronomic traits. A genetic linkage map of 1,205.66 cM was constructed using 91 genic and non-genic Arachis hypogaea transposable element (AhTE) markers. Using single marker analysis and QTL analysis, the markers with high phenotypic variance explained (PVE) were identified for branching pattern (32.3%), number of primary and secondary branches (19.9% and 28.4%, respectively), protein content (26.4%), days to 50% flowering (22.0%), content of  (15.1%), test  (13.6%) and pod width (12.0%). Three genic markers (AhTE0357, AhTE0391, AhTE0025) with Arachis hypogaea miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (AhMITE1) activity in the genes Araip.TG1BL (B02 chromosome), Aradu.7N61X (A09 chromosome) and Aradu.7065G (A07 chromosome), respectively showed strong linkage with these taxonomic, productivity and quality traits. Since TMV 2 and TMV 2-NLM differed subtly at DNA level, the background noise in detecting the marker-trait associations was minimum; therefore, the markers identified in this study for the taxonomic and productivity traits may be significant and useful in peanut molecular breeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473730>Bioconversion of cheese whey permeate into fungal oil by .</a></h2><p>Oleaginous fungi are efficient tools to convert agricultural waste streams into valuable components. The filamentous fungus  was cultivated in whey permeate, a byproduct from cheese production, to produce an oil-rich fungal biomass. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the fermentation conditions such as pH and temperature for increased biomass yield and lipid accumulation. Quantification and characterization of the fungal biomass oil was conducted.Upstream lactose hydrolysis of the whey permeate increased the biomass yield from 2.4 to 7.8 (g dry biomass/L) compared to that of non-hydrolyzed whey permeate. The combination of low pH (4.5) and pasteurization minimized microbial competition, thus favoring fungal growth. A central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the effects of temperature (22.4-33.6 °C) and a lower pH range (3.6-4.7) on biomass yield and composition. The highest biomass yield and oil content was observed at high temperature (33.6 °C), while the pH range evaluated had a less pronounced effect. The predictive model was validated at the optimal conditions of 33.6 °C and pH 4.5. The fungal biomass yield plateaued at 9 g dry cell  per liter, while the oil content and lipid yield reached a maximum of 24% dry biomass and 2.20 g/L, respectively, at 168 h. Triacylglycerides were the major lipid class (92%), which contained predominantly  (41%), palmitic (23%), linoleic (11%), and γ-linolenic  (9%).This study provided an alternative way of valorization of cheese whey permeate by using it as a substrate for the production of value-added compounds by fungal fermentation.

"Hass" avocado is the most commercialized cultivar, while the native Mexican avocado varieties have been displaced. Thus, studies regarding their chemical and nutraceutical characterization are scarce. We studied the total lipid content, fatty  profile, carotenoid content, and free radical-scavenging activity of the fruit pulp from 12 accessions of the native Mexican avocado (Persea americana var. drymifolia). The results show that the chemical and nutraceutical characteristics depend on the accession type. The total lipid content ranged from 13.22 to 23.41%. The major saturated fatty  in all the avocado accessions was palmitic  (15.54-22.68%). Monounsaturated fatty acids, like  (56.58-74.19%), linoleic (5.62-16.85%) and linolenic (0.63-2.85%) acids were the most abundant unsaturated fatty acids in all the native Mexican avocado accessions. The total carotenoid content (1.57 to 7.83 mg eq. of β-carotene 100 g- fresh ) and the free radical-scavenging activity (7.58-88.62 mMol trolox equivalent 100 g fresh ) also varied significantly (p < 0.05) among accessions. Native Mexican avocados have a great nutraceutical potential due to their high content of omega-9, omega-6, and omega-3 fatty acids and carotenoids.

As the first step in investigating the feasibility of using microalgae to provide Viet Nam with a domestic source of oil for food and edible oil industries, fifty lipid-producing microalgae were isolated and characterized. The microalgae were isolated from water sources ranging from freshwater to brackish and marine waters from a wide geographic distribution in Viet Nam. Initial analyses showed that 20 of the 50 strains had good growth rates, produced high biomass and had high lipid content, ranging up to 50% of dry  biomass. 18S rRNA gene sequence analyses of the 50 strains showed a great diversity in this assemblage of microalgae, comprising at least 38 species and representatives of 25 genera, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and  Some of the species are closely related to well-known lipid producers such as , but some other strains are not closely related to the strains found in public sequence databases and likely represent new species. Analysis of oil quality showed that fatty  profiles of the microalgal strains were very diverse and strain-dependent. Fatty acids in the microalgal oils comprised saturated fatty acids (SFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The main SFA was palmitic . MUFAs and PUFAs were dominated by , and linoleic and linolenic acids, respectively. Some strains were especially rich in the essential fatty  α-linolenic  (ALA), which comprised more than 20% of the fatty acids in these strains.

However, effective removal of surfactants is a prerequisite to evaluate the catalytic properties of these catalysts in any reaction of interest. Here we report on the colloidal preparation of surfactant-free Ni/AlO model catalysts. Monodisperse Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with mean particle size ranging from 4 to 9 nm were synthesized via thermal decomposition of a zerovalent precursor in the presence of . Five  percent Ni/AlO catalysts were produced by direct deposition of the presynthesized NPs on an alumina support, followed by thermal activation (oxidation-reduction cycle) for complete surfactant removal and surface cleaning. Structural and morphological characteristics of the nanoscale catalysts are described in detail following the propagation of the bulk and surface Ni species at the different treatment stages. Powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction experiments as well as infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption and magnetic measurements were conducted. The applied thermal treatments are proven to be fully adequate for complete surfactant removal while preserving the metal particle size and the size distribution at the level attained by the colloidal synthesis. Compared with standard impregnated Ni/AlO catalysts, the current model materials display narrowed Ni particle size distributions and increased reducibility with a higher fraction of the metallic nickel atoms exposed at the catalyst surface.</p></html>
