Their morphology and functional changes are correlated with the release of danger signals induced by stroke. These cells are normally responsible for clearing away dead neural cells and restoring neuronal functions. However, when excessively activated by the damage-associated molecular patterns following stroke, they can produce a large number of proinflammatory cytokines that can disrupt neural cells and the blood-brain  and influence neurogenesis. These effects indicate the important roles of microglia/macrophages in the pathophysiological processes of stroke. However, the modifiable and adaptable nature of microglia/macrophages may also be beneficial for brain repair and not just result in damage. These distinct roles may be attributed to the different microglia/macrophage phenotypes because the M1 population is mainly destructive, while the  population is neuroprotective. Additionally, different gene expression signature changes in microglia/macrophages have been found in diverse inflammatory milieus. These biofunctional features enable dual roles for microglia/macrophages in brain damage and repair. Currently, it is thought that the proper inflammatory milieu may provide a suitable microenvironment for neurogenesis; however, detailed mechanisms underlying the inflammatory responses that initiate or inhibit neurogenesis remain unknown. This review summarizes recent progress concerning the mechanisms involved in brain damage, repair and regeneration related to microglia/macrophage activation and phenotype transition after stroke. We also argue that future translational studies should be targeting multiple key regulating molecules to improve brain repair, which should be accompanied by the concept of a "therapeutic time window" for sequential therapies.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Though AD has been studied for more than 100 years since 1906, the exact cause(s) and pathogenic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. Also, the efficient disease-modifying treatment and ideal diagnostic method for AD are unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, an invariant pathophysiological feature of AD, may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we firstly discussed the features of cerebral glucose metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. Then, we further reviewed the contribution of glucose transportation abnormality and intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction in AD pathophysiology, and proposed a hypothesis that multiple pathogenic cascades induced by impaired cerebral glucose metabolism could result in neuronal degeneration and consequently cognitive deficits in AD patients. Among these pathogenic processes, altered functional status of thiamine metabolism and brain insulin resistance are highly emphasized and characterized as major pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, considering the fact that AD patients exhibit cerebral glucose hypometabolism possibly due to impairments of insulin signaling and altered thiamine metabolism, we also discuss some potential possibilities to uncover diagnostic biomarkers for AD from abnormal glucose metabolism and to develop drugs targeting at repairing insulin signaling impairment and correcting thiamine metabolism abnormality. We conclude that glucose metabolism abnormality plays a critical role in AD pathophysiological alterations through the induction of multiple pathogenic factors such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so forth. To clarify the causes, pathogeneses and consequences of cerebral hypometabolism in AD will help break the bottleneck of current AD study in finding ideal diagnostic biomarker and disease-modifying therapy.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Beginning at gestation day (GD) 6, dams were continuously infused with either saline or 6 mg/kg/day nicotine (Nic). At GD 14, dams received either sterile broth or 105 colony-forming units Mycoplasma pulmonis (MP), resulting in four treatment groups: control (4 dams, 33 fetal units); MP only (5 dams, 55 fetal units); Nic only (5 dams, 61 fetal units), and Nic + MP (7 dams, 82 fetal units). At GD 18, nicotine exposure significantly increased (P ≤ 0.02) the percentage of amniotic fluids and fetuses infected by MP but did not impact colonization rates of maternal sites. Nicotine exposure significantly reduced the numbers of MP in the placenta required for high microbial loads (≥104 color-changing units) in the amniotic fluid (P < 0.01). Fetal inflammatory response lesions were most extensive in the Nic only and Nic + MP groups (P < 0.0001). Control and MP only placentas were interleukin (IL)10-dominant, consistent with an /Th2 environment. Placentas exposed to nicotine shifted to a neutral environment, with equivalent levels of interferon gamma (IFNG) and IL10. Both IL6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in amniotic fluid were highly elevated when both nicotine and infection were present. Our study suggests that prenatal exposure to nicotine increases the risk for intrauterine infection, lowers the infectious dose required to breach the placental  and infect the amniotic fluid and fetus, and alters the pathology and inflammatory profile associated with maternal and fetal sites.© The Authors 2017.

There is an unmet clinical need for therapy that will protect the lungs from damage caused by lower respiratory infection. Here, we analyzed the role of EMAPII, a stress- and virus-induced pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic factor, in IAV-induced lung injury. First, we demonstrated that IAV induces EMAPII surface translocation, release, and apoptosis in cultured endothelial and epithelial cells. Next, we showed that IAV induces EMAPII surface translocation and release to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mouse lungs, concomitant with increases in caspase 3 activity. Injection of monoclonal antibody (mAb) against EMAPII attenuated IAV-induced EMAPII levels, weight loss, reduction of blood oxygenation, lung edema, and increase of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha. In accordance with the pro-apoptotic properties of EMAPII, levels of caspase 3 activity in BALF were also decreased by mAb treatment. Moreover, we detected EMAPII mAb-induced increase in lung levels of -like macrophage markers YM1 and CD206. All together, these data strongly suggest that EMAPII mAb ameliorates IAV-induced lung injury by limiting lung cell apoptosis and shifting the host inflammatory setting toward resolution of inflammation.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We hypothesize that the observed modulation of the systemic inflammatory milieu is related to T regulatory cells and a subsequent increase in the locoregional neuroprotective  macrophage population.C57B6 mice were injected with intravenous MAPC 2 and 24 hours after controlled cortical impact injury. Animals were euthanized 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after injury. In vivo, the proportion of CD4(+)/CD25(+)/FOXP3(+) T-regulatory cells were measured in the splenocyte population and plasma. In addition, the brain CD86(+) M1 and CD206(+)  macrophage populations were quantified. A series of in vitro co-cultures were completed to investigate the need for direct MAPC:splenocyte contact as well as the effect of MAPC therapy on M1 and  macrophage subtype apoptosis and proliferation.Significant increases in the splenocyte and plasma T regulatory cell populations were observed with MAPC therapy at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. In addition, MAPC therapy was associated with an increase in the brain /M1 macrophage ratio at 24, 48 and 120 hours after cortical injury. In vitro cultures of activated microglia with supernatant derived from MAPC:splenocyte co-cultures also demonstrated an increase in the /M1 ratio. The observed changes were secondary to an increase in M1 macrophage apoptosis.The data show that the intravenous delivery of MAPC after cortical injury results in increases in T regulatory cells in splenocytes and plasma with a concordant increase in the locoregional /M1 macrophage ratio. Direct contact between the MAPC and splenocytes is required to modulate activated microglia, adding further evidence to the central role of the spleen in MAPC-mediated neuroprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139852>Targeting gut microbiota and   with prebiotics to alleviate autoimmune manifestations in NOD mice.</a></h2><p>Adopting a diet containing indigestible fibre compounds such as prebiotics to fuel advantageous bacteria has proven beneficial for alleviating inflammation. The effect of the microbial changes on autoimmunity, however, remains unknown. We studied the effects of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on pancreatic islet and salivary gland inflammation in NOD mice and tested whether these were mediated by the gut microbiota.Mother and offspring mice were fed an XOS-supplemented diet until diabetes onset or weaning and were compared with a control-fed group. Diabetes incidence was monitored, insulitis and sialadenitis were scored in histological sections from adult mice, and several metabolic and immune variables were analysed in mice before the development of diabetes. Gut   was assessed using an in vivo FITC-dextran permeability test. The importance of XOS-mediated gut microbial changes were evaluated in antibiotic-treated mice fed either XOS or control diet or given a faecal microbiota transplant from test animals.Diabetes onset was delayed in the XOS-fed mice, which also had fewer cellular infiltrations in their pancreatic islets and salivary glands. Interestingly, insulitis was most reduced in the XOS-fed groups when the mice were also treated with an antibiotic cocktail. There was no difference in sialadenitis between the dietary groups treated with antibiotics; the mice were protected by microbiota depletion regardless of diet. Faecal microbiota transplantation was not able to transfer protection. No major differences in glucose-insulin regulation, glucagon-like peptide-1, or short-chain fatty acid production were related to the XOS diet. The XOS diet did, however, reduce gut permeability markers in the small and large intestine. This was accompanied by a more anti-inflammatory environment locally and systemically, dominated by a shift from M1 to  macrophages, a higher abundance of activated regulatory T cells, and lower levels of induction of natural killer T cells and cytotoxic T cells.Prebiotic XOS have microbiota-dependent effects on salivary gland inflammation and microbiota-independent effects on pancreatic islet pathology that are accompanied by an improved gut  that seems able to heighten control of intestinal diabetogenic antigens that have the potential to penetrate the mucosa to activate autoreactive immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22826984>[Chronic kidney disease during a 12-year period at tertiary health institution].</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatric population.The aim of the study was analysis of aetiology, staging and associated complications of CKD at the time of diagnosis.Data of 97 patients (56 boys) of average age 7.8 +/- 5.8 years, referred for the first time to the Institute for Mother and Child Healthcare "Dr Vukan Cupić", Belgrade in the period 1998-2009, due to CKD, stage 2-5, were analysed. In each patient illness history was obtained, and physical examination, laboratory, X-ray and other investigations were performed according to the indications. CKD was classified according to the glomerular filtration rate into four grades: 2--mild (60-90 ml/min/1.73 ); 3--moderate (30-60 ml/min/1.73 ); 4--advanced (15-30 ml/ min/1.73 ); and 5--terminal (< 15 ml/min/1.73 ).The most frequent causes of CKD were congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (43.3%), followed by glomerular diseases (17.5%), hereditary kidney diseases (16.5%), metabolic diseases (7.2%) and other causes (15.5%). Mild CKD was found in 29.8%, moderate in 28.9%, advanced in 22.7%, and terminal in 18.6% children. Among patients with CKD stage 4 and 5, 75% of patients presented with acute renal failure, while 25% had earlier detected CKD (stage 1), but were not under regular follow-up. Associated complications included metabolic acidosis (63%), anaemia (60%), hypertension (42.3%), short stature (25.8%), renal osteodystrophy (13.4%) and cardiovascular diseases (7.2%).Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are the leading cause of CKD in paediatric population. A significant proportion (41.3%) of patients had advanced and terminal CKD.

Ischemia was induced by ligating the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at its  segment and reperfusion was induced by releasing the ligation. The diameter alteration of the MCA, arterial anastomoses and collateral arteries were imaged and measured in real time. BBB disruption was assessed by Evans Blue (EB) and sodium fluorescein (Na-F) extravasation at 3 hours of reperfusion. The reperfusion produced an extensive vasodilation and a sustained hyperemia. Although expression of NOSs was not altered at 3 hours of reperfusion, L-NAME (a non-specific NOS inhibitor) abolished reperfusion-induced vasodilation/hyperemia and significantly reduced EB and Na-F extravasation. L-NIO (an endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitor) significantly attenuated cerebral vasodilation but not BBB disruption, whereas L-NPA and 7-NI (neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitors) significantly reduced BBB disruption but not cerebral vasodilation. In contrast, aminoguanidine (AG) (an inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor) had less effect on either cerebral vasodilation or BBB disruption. On the other hand, papaverine (PV) not only increased the vasodilation/hyperemia but also significantly reduced BBB disruption. Combined treatment with L-NAME and PV preserved the vasodilation/hyperemia and significantly reduced BBB disruption. Our findings suggest that nNOS may play a major role in early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia via a hyperemia-independent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27390192>Stereotactic Administration of Edaravone Ameliorates Collagenase-Induced Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Rat.</a></h2><p>Edaravone is widely used for treating ischemic stroke, but it is not still confirmed in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) as an ideal medication targeting the brain parenchyma. We aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of stereotactic administration of edaravone (SI) into the brain parenchyma.Intracerebral hemorrhage rat models were established by infusion of collagenase into the caudate nucleus. Neural functional recovery was assessed using modified neurological severity scores (mNSS). A comparative study of therapeutic effects between SI and intraperitoneal injection of edaravone (IP) involved in cerebral edema, blood-brain  (BBB) permeability, hematoma absorption, inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis.Compared with IP, the mNSS was significantly (P < 0.05) improved by SI; cerebral edema and BBB permeability were dramatically ameliorated (P < 0.05); IL-4 and IL-10 levels increased, but IL-1β and TNF-α levels significantly decreased; neuron apoptosis decreased markedly (P < 0.05); and caspase-3 and Bax expression significantly dropped, but Bcl-2 increased in SI group (P < 0.05).SI markedly improved neurological deficits in ICH rat models via antiinflammatory and antiapoptosis mechanisms and promoted -type microglia differentiation.

Two different types of PRB media, with and without the presence of ferric chloride sludge, for the removal of pollutants were examined. The composite media of PRB comprised a clay and sand mixture of 40:60%w/w (system 1) and a clay, ferric chloride sludge and sand mixture of 30:10:60%w/w (system 2). The system was operated at a hydraulic loading rate of 0.028 m3/.d and hydraulic retention time of 10 days. The results showed that the performance of system 2 was better in terms of pollutant removal efficiencies, with average biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and total Kjeldahl nitrogen removals of 76.1%, 68.5% and 73.5%, respectively. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix analyses of water samples and sequential extraction of PRB media suggested the removal of humic substances through the formation of iron-organic complex. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the treatment of PRB were 8.2-52.1 mgCH4/.d, 69.1-601.8 mgCO2/.d and 0.04-0.99 mgN2O/.d. The use of system 2 with vegetation resulted in lower GHG emissions. The results show that PRB with vegetation could be used as a primary treatment for leachate from closed landfill sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901973>Monocyte and M1 Macrophage-induced  Defect Contributes to Chronic Intestinal Inflammation in IBD.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are key players in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This study aimed to determine site-specific effects of defined macrophage subtypes on the integrity of the intestinal epithelial .Macrophage subtypes in situ in intestinal specimens of patients with IBD were visualized by immunohistochemistry. In vitro polarization of human peripheral CD14 cells yielded M1 or  macrophages. The influence of primary monocytes or macrophage subtypes on epithelial  integrity was analyzed by transepithelial resistance measurements, Western blot analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and cytometric bead array in a coculture model of primary human macrophages and layers of intestinal epithelial cell lines.The lamina propria of the inflamed intestine in patients with IBD, predominantly in Crohn's disease, is massively infiltrated by CD68 cells also positive for inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α. The presence of M1 macrophage shifted the balance in the local macrophage compartment towards a proinflammatory state. In the coculture model, monocytes and M1 macrophages reduced transepithelial resistance as a marker for epithelial  integrity. The mechanisms for paracellular leakage included intracellular relocalization of tight junction proteins like claudin-2 and epithelial cell apoptosis. Determined by specific cytokine blockade, M1 macrophages exerted their deleterious effect mainly through TNF-α, whereas monocyte-mediated damage was driven by the inflammasome effector cytokines, interleukin-1β and interleukin-18.Lamina propria monocytes and M1 macrophages invading intestinal tissues directly contribute to disrupting the epithelial  through deregulation of tight junction proteins and induction of epithelial cell apoptosis, thus driving intestinal inflammation in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22947942>Engineered bi-histidine metal chelation sites map the structure of the mechanical unfolding transition state of an elastomeric protein domain GB1.</a></h2><p>Determining the structure of the transition state is critical for elucidating the mechanism behind how proteins fold and unfold. Due to its high free energy, however, the transition state generally cannot be trapped and studied directly using traditional structural biology methods. Thus, characterizing the structure of the transition state that occurs as proteins fold and unfold remains a major challenge. Here, we report a novel (to our knowledge) method that uses engineered bi-histidine (bi-His) metal-binding sites to directly map the structure of the mechanical unfolding transition state of proteins. This method is adapted from the traditional ψ-value analysis, which uses engineered bi-His metal chelation sites to probe chemical (un)folding transition-state structure. The φ(+)(U)-value is defined as ΔΔG(‡-N)/ΔΔG(U-N), which is the energetic effects of metal chelation by the bi-His site on the unfolding energy  (ΔG(‡-N)) relative to its thermodynamic stability (ΔG(U-N)) and can be used to obtain information about the transition state in the mutational site. As a proof of principle, we used the small protein GB1 as a model system and set out to map its mechanical unfolding transition-state structure. Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy and spectrofluorimetry, we directly quantified the effect of divalent metal ion binding on the mechanical unfolding free energy and thermodynamic stability of GB1, which allowed us to quantify φ(+)(U)-values for different sites in GB1. Our results enabled us to map the structure of the mechanical unfolding transition state of GB1. Within GB1's mechanical unfolding transition state, the interface between force-bearing β-strands 1 and 4 is largely disrupted, and the first β-hairpin is partially disordered while the second β-hairpin and the α-helix remain structured. Our results demonstrate the unique application of ψ-value analysis in elucidating the structure of the transition state that occurs during the mechanical unfolding process, offering a potentially powerful new method for investigating the design of novel elastomeric proteins.Copyright © 2012 Biophysical Society.

We have examined the potency, voltage dependence, and kinetics of spermine block in dimeric Kir2.1 constructs containing one nonreactive subunit and one cysteine-substituted subunit before and after modification by methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. At position 169C (between the D172 "rectification controller" and the selectivity filter), modification by either 2-aminoethyl MTS (MTSEA) or 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl MTS (MTSET) reduced the potency and voltage dependence of spermine block, consistent with this position overlapping the spermine binding site. At position 176C (between D172 and the  helix bundle crossing), modification by MTSEA also weakened spermine block. In contrast, MTSET modification of 176C dramatically slowed the kinetics of spermine unblock, with almost no effect on potency or voltage dependence. The data are consistent with MTSET modification of 176C introducing a localized  in the inner cavity, resulting in slower spermine entry into and exit from a "deep" binding site (likely between the D172 rectification controller and the selectivity filter), but leaving the spermine binding site mostly unaffected. These findings constrain the location of deep spermine binding that underlies steeply voltage-dependent block, and further suggest important chemical details of high affinity binding of spermine in Kir2.1 channels-the archetypal model of strong inward rectification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27768970>Polymeric nanoparticles promote macrophage reversal from  to M1 phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has shown promising treatment effects for a variety of cancers. However, the immune treatment efficiency for solid tumors is limited owing to insufficient infiltration of immune cells into solid tumors. The conversion of tumor-supportive macrophages to tumor-suppressive macrophages, inducing the functional reversal of macrophages, is an effective method and contributes to a subsequent antitumor response. The current challenge in the field is the poor distribution and systemic side effects associated with the use of cytokines. As a solution to this issue, we designed and synthesized microenvironment-responsive nanoparticles (P) with IL-12 payload (IL-12⊂P1). These nanoparticles could promote the systemic administration and release of IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment, and the locally responsive property of IL-12⊂P1 could subsequently re-educate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In particular, our results illustrated the great therapeutic effects derived from the functional conversion of macrophages. Our strategy was to design a microenvironment-responsive material for local macrophage modification to overcome the physiological  of solid tumors. The shifting of macrophage phenotypes via IL-12⊂P1 achieved immunomodulation in the microenvironment for cancer therapy, with negligible cytotoxicity. We expect that the functional regulation of TAMs by pH-responsive nanomaterials is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the brain, fibrillin-1 functions as an attachment protein in the basement membrane, providing structural support to the blood-brain  (BBB). Here, we investigated whether fibrillin-1 impairment affects the permeability of the BBB proper and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid  (BCSFB), and whether this leads to the accelerated accumulation of lipids (xanthomas) in the brain. ApoE(-/-) (n=61) and ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-) (n=73) mice were fed a Western-type diet (WD). After 14 weeks WD, a significantly higher permeability of the BBB was observed in ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-) mice compared to age-matched ApoE(-/-) mice. This was accompanied by leukocyte infiltration, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor-β, and by decreased expression of tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. After 20 weeks WD, 83% of ApoE(-/-)Fbn1(C1039G+/-) mice showed xanthomas in the brain, compared to 23% of their ApoE(-/-) littermates. Xanthomas were mainly located in fibrillin-1-rich regions, such as the choroid plexus and the neocortex. Our findings demonstrate that dysfunctional fibrillin-1 impairs BBB/BCSFB integrity, facilitating peripheral leukocyte infiltration, which further degrades the BBB/BCSFB. As a consequence, lipoproteins can enter the brain, resulting in accelerated formation of xanthomas.Copyright © 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Within term-equivalent rat brains exposed to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus HI, it was previously showed that neurons produce IL-1β earlier than do glial cells, and that blocking IL-1 was neuroprotective. To further define the mechanisms whereby IL-1 exerts its neurotoxic effect, we hypothesize that IL-1β plays a pivotal role in a direct and/or indirect mechanistic loop of neuronal self-injury through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9.An established preclinical rat model of LPS+HI-induced neonatal encephalopathy was used. In situ hybridization, ELISA, and immunolabeling techniques were employed. Selective blocking compounds allowed addressing the respective roles of IL-1 and MMP-9.In LPS+HI-exposed forebrains, neuronal IL-1β was first detected in infarcted neocortical and striatal areas and later in glial cells of the adjacent white matter. Neuronal IL-1β played a key role: (i) in the early post-HI exacerbation of neuroinflammation and (ii) in generating both core and penumbral infarcted cerebral areas. Systemically administered IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reached the brain and bound to the neocortical and deep gray neuronal membranes. Then, IL-1Ra down-regulated IL-1β mRNA and MMP-9 neuronal synthesis. Immediately post-HI, neuronal IL-1β up-regulated cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. MMP-9 would disrupt the blood-brain , which, combined to CINC-1 up-regulation, would play a role in polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration into the LPS+HI-exposed brain. IL-1β blockade prevented PMN infiltration and oriented the phenotype of macrophagic/microglial cells towards anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic  profile. IL-1β increased the expression of activated caspase-3 and of receptor-interacting-protein (RIP)-3 within infarcted forebrain area. Such apoptotic and necroptotic pathway activations were prevented by IL-1Ra, as well as ensuing cerebral palsy-like brain damage and motor impairment.This work uncovered a new paradigm of neuronal self-injury orchestrated by neuronal synthesis of IL-1β and MMP-9.

MicroRNA-124 is the most abundant brain-specific microRNA and has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of D-4F treatment of stroke in type one diabetes mellitus (T1DM) rats. Male Wistar rats were induced with T1DM, subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with PBS or D-4F (1 mg/kg i.p.) at 2, 24 and 48 hours after stroke (n=8/group). A battery of  tests, brain blood  (BBB) integrity, white matter changes and microRNA expression were evaluated  and . D-4F treatment in T1DM-stroke rats significantly improves functional outcome, decreases BBB leakage, increases tight junction protein expression, decreases white matter damage and inflammatory factor expression, while increasing anti-inflammatory  macrophage polarization in the ischemic brain. D-4F significantly increases microRNA-124a expression, and decreases matrix metalloproteinase-9, tumor necrosis factor-α and toll-like receptor-4 gene expression in the ischemic brain, and in primary cortical neuronal and microglial cultures. Inhibition of microRNA-124 in cultured primary cortical neurons and microglia attenuates D-4F induced anti-inflammatory effects and  macrophage polarization. D-4F treatment of T1DM-stroke increases microRNA-124 expression, promotes anti-inflammatory effects and  macrophage polarization, which may contribute to D-4F-induced improvement in neurological , and BBB and white matter integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30285152>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spray improves the growth performance, immune status, and respiratory mucosal barrier in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that supplementing  in a nasal spray can provide prophylaxis against upper respiratory tract infections. Previously, we found that spraying with Bacillus reduced the concentration of atmospheric ammonia and airborne microbiological aerosols in broiler houses. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of spraying with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens on the respiratory mucosal barrier in broilers. Two trails were conducted simultaneously in four environmentally controlled chambers. In each trail, 320 1-d-old male broilers were randomly assigned to control (CON) and B. amyloliquefaciens (BAQ) group. Eight cages containing 20 birds per cage were placed in two chambers. The BAQ group chambers were sprayed with B. amyloliquefaciens at 4 × 109 CFU/ each day for 42 d. Spraying with B. amyloliquefaciens increased average daily gain and average daily feed intake in broilers (P < 0.01), but had no effects on FCR (P > 0.05). The relative weights of the bursa (21 d) and spleen (42 d) were higher in the BAQ group (P < 0.05). The serum IgG, IgM (21 d), and IgA, Ig M (42 d) levels were improved in BAQ group (P < 0.05). The sIgA levels in tracheal lavage fluid were significantly higher in the BAQ group than the CON group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with BAQ downregulated IL-6 and IFN-γ (P < 0.05), but upregulated IL-2, occludin, and mucin-2 (P < 0.05). In addition, the number of acidic goblet cells was significantly higher in the tracheas of treated broilers than untreated broilers (P < 0.05).

The contact between astrocytes and HUVECs was demonstrated by electron microscopy: astrocytes endfeet pass through the 8.0 μm pores inducing HUVECs to assume a cerebral phenotype. Using this model we evaluated transmigration of melanoma cells from two different patients (M1 and ) selected among seven melanoma primary cultures.  cells showed a statistically significant higher capability to pass across the in vitro BBB model, compared to M1. Expression of adhesion molecules was evaluated by flow cytometry: a statistically significant increased expression of MCAM, αvβ3, and CD49b was detected in M1. PCR array data showed that  had a higher expression of several matrix metalloproteinase proteins (MMPs) compared to M1. Specifically, data suggest that MMP2 and MMP9 could be directly involved in BBB permeability and that brain invasion by melanoma cells could be related to the overexpression of many MMPs.

However, prolonged exposure to the neurotransmitter drives the receptor to a desensitization state, which plays an important role in shaping synaptic transmission. Much progress has been made through more than half a century's research since Katz and Thesleff first descried desensitization for muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In this review, we summarized recent research developments of receptor desensitization. Now, it has been identified that many parts of the receptor, such as the pore domain (including the hinge in the -M3 linker), the binding domain, the coupling region, and the intracellular domain, are all involved in the cys-loop receptor desensitization and that uncoupling between the amino-terminal domain and channel lining domain seems to play a central role in desensitization. This uncoupling is mainly governed by the balance between coupling strength and relative tightness of gating machinery and influenced by other parts of the receptor. Agonist binding induces conformational change to overcome the gating  to open the channel through the stressed coupling region, which is subsequently broken, causing receptor desensitization. With rapid advancement in structural biology of membrane receptors, final validation of this mechanism is expected to occur in the near future when the high-resolution structure of the desensitized state is available.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26303836>The Role of Activated Microglia and Resident Macrophages in the Neurovascular Unit during Cerebral Ischemia: Is the Jury Still Out?</a></h2><p>Paracrine signaling in the neurovascular unit (NVU) is aimed to adjust the supply of oxygen and nutrients to metabolic demands of the brain in a feed-forward manner. Cerebral ischemia (CI) severely disrupts this homeostatic mechanism and also causes activation of microglia and resident macrophages in the brain. Contradictory data exist on the time pattern of microglial activation and polarization during CI, on molecular mechanisms that trigger them and on effects of microglia-derived cytokines on brain cells. It appears that conditions that occur during transient ischemia or in the penumbra of focal ischemia in vivo or equivalent conditions in vitro trigger polarization of resting microglia/macrophages into the  phenotype, which mainly exerts anti-inflammatory and protective effects in the brain, while prolonged ischemia with abundant necrosis promotes microglial polarization into the M1 phenotype. During the later stages of recovery, microglia that polarized initially into the  phenotype can shift into the M1 phenotype. Thus, it appears that cells with both phenotypes are present in the affected area, but their relative amount changes in time and probably depends on the proximity to the ischemic core. It was assumed that cells with the M1 phenotype exert detrimental effects on neurons and contribute to the blood-brain  opening. Several M1 phenotype-specific cytokines exert protective effects on astrocytes, which could be important for reactive gliosis occurring after ischemia. Thus, whether or not suppression of microglial activity after CI is beneficial for neurological outcome still remains unclear and current evidence suggests that no simple answer could be given to this question.© 2015 S.

Part I: historical observations and clinical perspectives on the etiology of increased CSF protein levels, CSF clotting, and communicating hydrocephalus: a comprehensive review.</a></h2><p>Phacomatoses are a special group of familial hamartomatous syndromes with unique neuro-cutaneous manifestations as well as disease characteristic tumors. Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representatives of this family. Vestibular schwannoma (VS) and subependymal giant cell tumor (SGCT) are two of the most common intracranial tumors associated with NF2 and TSC, respectively. These tumors can present with obstructive hydrocephalus due to their location adjacent to or in the ventricles. However, both tumors are also known to have a unique association with an elevated protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sometimes in association with non-obstructive (communicating) hydrocephalus (HCP), the causality of which has been unclear. Furthermore, SGCTs have repeatedly been shown to have a predisposition for CSF clotting, causing debilitating obstructions and recurrent malfunctions in shunted patients. However, the exact relation between high protein levels and spontaneous clotting of the CSF is not clear, nor is the mechanism understood by which CSF may clot in SGCTs. Elevated protein levels in the CSF are thought to be caused by increased vascular permeability and dysregulation of the blood-brain . The two presumed underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms for that, in the context of tumorigenesis, are angiogenesis and inflammation. Both mechanisms are correlated to the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway which is a major tumorigenesis pathway in nearly all phacomatoses. In this review, we discuss the influence of angiogenesis and inflammation on vascular permeability in VSs and SGCTs at the phenotypic level as well as their possible genetic and molecular determinants. Part I describes the historical perspectives and clinical aspects of the relationship between vascular permeability, abnormal CSF protein levels, clotting of the CSF, and communicating HCP. Part II describes different cellular and molecular pathways involved in angiogenesis and inflammation in these two tumors and the correlation between inflammation and coagulation. Interestingly, while increased angiogenesis can be observed in both VS and SGCT, inflammatory processes seem more prominent in SGCT. Both pathologies are characterized by different subgroups of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM): the pro-inflammatory, M1 type is predominating in SGCTs while pro-angiogenetic,  type is predominating in VSs. We suggest that lack of NF2 protein in VS and lack of TSC1/2 proteins in SGCT determine this fundamental difference between the two tumor types, by defining the predominant TAM type. Since inflammatory reactions and coagulation processes are tightly connected, a "pro-inflammatory state" of SGCT can be used to explain the observed associated enhanced CSF clotting process. These distinct cellular and molecular differences may have direct therapeutic implications on tumors that are unique to certain phacomatoses or those with similar genetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25614586>Genetic diversity in three bovine-like human G8P[14] and G10P[14] rotaviruses suggests independent interspecies transmission events.</a></h2><p>The group A rotavirus (RVA) P[14] genotype has been detected sporadically in humans and is thought to be acquired through zoonotic transmission. The present study describes the full-length genome analysis of two G8P[14] and one G10P[14] human RVAs detected in Italy. The strains possessed the typical bovine-like I2-R2-C2--A3/A11-N2-T6-E2-H3 genotype constellation. All the segments of the two G8P[14] RVAs were most closely related to bovine(-like) strains but were relatively distant to each other, suggesting two independent interspecies transmission events. Likewise, the G10P[14] RVA gene segments were most similar to bovine(-like) RVAs but distinct from the G8 strains. The history of these strains probably involved the interspecies transmission of these viruses to humans from an as-yet-unidentified animal host, without evidence of reassortment events involving human RVAs. These results reinforce the potential of animal viruses to cross the host-species , causing disease and increased viral genetic diversity in humans.© 2015 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243812>Attenuation of Nitrogen Mustard-Induced Pulmonary Injury and Fibrosis by Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Antibody.</a></h2><p>Nitrogen mustard (NM) is a bifunctional alkylating agent that causes acute injury to the lung that progresses to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a prominent infiltration of macrophages into the lung and upregulation of proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. In these studies, we analyzed the ability of anti-TNFα antibody to mitigate NM-induced lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Treatment of rats with anti-TNFα antibody (15 mg/kg, iv, every 9 days) beginning 30 min after intratracheal administration of NM (0.125 mg/kg) reduced progressive histopathologic alterations in the lung including perivascular and peribronchial edema, macrophage/monocyte infiltration, interstitial thickening, bronchiolization of alveolar walls, fibrin deposition, emphysema, and fibrosis. NM-induced damage to the alveolar-epithelial , measured by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein and cell content, was also reduced by anti-TNFα antibody, along with expression of the oxidative stress marker, heme oxygenase-1. Whereas the accumulation of proinflammatory/cytotoxic M1 macrophages in the lung in response to NM was suppressed by anti-TNFα antibody, anti-inflammatory/profibrotic  macrophages were increased or unchanged. Treatment of rats with anti-TNFα antibody also reduced NM-induced increases in expression of the profibrotic mediator, transforming growth factor-β. This was associated with a reduction in NM-induced collagen deposition in the lung. These data suggest that inhibiting TNFα may represent an efficacious approach to mitigating lung injury induced by mustards.© The Author 2015.

The saliva inoculated in this microenvironment modulates host hemostasis, inflammation and adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanisms involved in these biological activities remain poorly understood and few studies explored the potential roles of mosquito saliva on the individual cellular components of the immune system. Here, we report the immunomodulatory activities of Aedes aegypti salivary cocktail on murine peritoneal macrophages.The salivary gland extract (SGE) of Ae. aegypti inhibited the production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12, as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NF-κB by murine macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The spare respiratory capacity, the phagocytic and microbicidal activities of these macrophages were also reduced by Ae. aegypti SGE. These phenotypic changes are consistent with SGE suppressing the proinflammatory program of M1 macrophages. On the other hand, Ae. aegypti SGE did not influence -associated markers (urea production, arginase-1 and mannose receptor-1 expression), either in macrophages alternatively activated by IL-4 or in those classically activated by LPS plus IFN-γ. In addition, Ae. aegypti SGE did not display any cytokine-binding activity, nor did it affect macrophage viability, thus excluding supposed experimental artifacts.Given the importance of macrophages in a number of biological processes, our findings help to enlighten how vector saliva modulates vertebrate host immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23825621>In vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia show discrepancy in therapeutic effects of  macrophages.</a></h2><p>THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE FOLLOWING ISCHEMIC STROKE IS DOMINATED BY INNATE IMMUNE CELLS: resident microglia and blood-derived macrophages. The ambivalent role of these cells in stroke outcome might be explained in part by the acquisition of distinct functional phenotypes: classically (M1) and alternatively activated () macrophages. To shed light on the crosstalk between hypoxic neurons and macrophages, an in vitro model was set up in which bone marrow-derived macrophages were co-cultured with hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation. The results showed that macrophages provided potent protection against neuron cell loss through a paracrine mechanism, and that they expressed -type alternative polarization. These findings raised the possibility of using bone marrow-derived  macrophages in cellular therapy for stroke. Therefore, 2 million  macrophages (or vehicle) were intravenously administered during the subacute stage of ischemia (D4) in a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Functional neuroscores and magnetic resonance imaging endpoints (infarct volumes, blood-brain  integrity, phagocytic activity assessed by iron oxide uptake) were longitudinally monitored for 2 weeks. This cell-based treatment did not significantly improve any outcome measure compared with vehicle, suggesting that this strategy is not relevant to stroke therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29088998>Post-Injury Administration of Galantamine Reduces Traumatic Brain Injury Pathology and Improves Outcome.</a></h2><p>Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that plays a key role in cognitive , including learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) reduces cholinergic neurotransmission, decreases evoked release of acetylcholine, and alters cholinergic receptor levels. Galantamine (U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease) has been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and allosterically potentiate nicotinic receptor signaling. We investigated whether acute administration of galantamine can reduce TBI pathology and improve cognitive  tested days after the termination of the drug treatment. Post-injury administration of galantamine was found to decrease TBI-triggered blood-brain  (BBB) permeability (tested 24 h post-injury), attenuate the loss of both GABAergic and newborn neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus, and improve hippocampal  (tested 10 days after termination of the drug treatment). Specifically, significant improvements in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and context-specific fear memory tasks were observed in injured animals treated with galantamine. Although messenger RNAs for both M1 (Nos2, TLR4, and IL-12ß) and  (Arg1, CCL17, and Mcr1) microglial phenotypes were elevated post-TBI, galantamine treatment did not alter microglial polarization tested 24 h and 6 days post-injury.

However, aside from the well-established roles of smooth muscle cells and pericytes, the contributions of other vascular-associated cells are poorly understood. Our goal was to ascertain the  of perivascular macrophages in adult tissues under nonpathological conditions.We combined confocal microscopy, in vivo cell depletion, and in vitro assays to investigate the contribution of perivascular macrophages to vascular . We found that resident perivascular macrophages are associated with capillaries at a frequency similar to that of pericytes. Macrophage depletion using either clodronate liposomes or antibodies unexpectedly resulted in hyperpermeability. This effect could be rescued when -like macrophages, but not M1-like macrophages or dendritic cells, were reconstituted in vivo, suggesting subtype-specific roles for macrophages in the regulation of vascular permeability. Furthermore, we found that permeability-promoting agents elicit motility and eventual dissociation of macrophages from the vasculature. Finally, in vitro assays showed that -like macrophages attenuate the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin upon exposure to permeability-promoting agents.This study points to a direct contribution of macrophages to vessel  integrity and provides evidence that heterotypic cell interactions with the endothelium, in addition to those of pericytes, control vascular permeability.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777483>MyD88 signaling pathway is involved in renal fibrosis by favoring a TH2 immune response and activating alternative  macrophages.</a></h2><p>Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Molecules released by the inflamed injured tissue can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs), thereby modulating macrophage and CD4(+) T-cell activity. We propose that in renal fibrogenesis,  macrophages are recruited and activated in a T helper subset 2 cell (T(H)2)-prone inflammatory milieu in a MyD88-dependent manner. Mice submitted to unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO) demonstrated an increase in macrophage infiltration with collagen deposition after 7 d. Conversely, TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 knockout (KO) mice had an improved renal  together with diminished T(H)2 cytokine production and decreased fibrosis formation. Moreover, TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 KO animals exhibited less  macrophage infiltration, namely interleukin (IL)-10(+) and CD206(+) CD11b(high) cells, at 7 d after surgery. We evaluated the role of a T(H)2 cytokine in this context, and observed that the absence of IL-4 was associated with better renal , decreased IL-13 and TGF-β levels, reduced arginase activity and a decrease in fibrosis formation when compared with IL-12 KO and wild-type (WT) animals. Indeed, the better renal outcomes and the decreased fibrosis formation were restricted to the deficiency of IL-4 in the hematopoietic compartment. Finally, macrophage depletion, rather than the absence of T cells, led to reduced lesions of the glomerular filtration  and decreased collagen deposition. These results provide evidence that future therapeutic strategies against renal fibrosis should be accompanied by the modulation of the M1: and T(H)1:T(H)2 balance, as T(H)2 and  cells are predictive of fibrosis toward mechanisms that are sensed by innate immune response and triggered in a MyD88-dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461570>Type 1 Immune Mechanisms Driven by the Response to Infection with Attenuated Rabies Virus Result in Changes in the Immune Bias of the Tumor Microenvironment and Necrosis of Mouse GL261 Brain Tumors.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapeutic strategies for malignant glioma have to overcome the immunomodulatory activities of  monocytes that appear in the circulation and as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).  cell products contribute to the growth-promoting attributes of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and bias immunity toward type 2, away from the type 1 mechanisms with antitumor properties. To drive type 1 immunity in CNS tissues, we infected GL261 tumor-bearing mice with attenuated rabies virus (RABV). These neurotropic viruses spread to CNS tissues -axonally, where they induce a strong type 1 immune response that involves Th1, CD8, and B cell entry across the blood-brain  and virus clearance in the absence of overt sequelae. Intranasal infection with attenuated RABV prolonged the survival of mice bearing established GL261 brain tumors. Despite the failure of virus spread to the tumor, infection resulted in significantly enhanced tumor necrosis, extensive CD4 T cell accumulation, and high levels of the proinflammatory factors IFN-γ, TNF-α, and inducible NO synthase in the TME merely 4 d postinfection, before significant virus spread or the appearance of RABV-specific immune mechanisms in CNS tissues. Although the majority of infiltrating CD4 cells appeared functionally inactive, the proinflammatory changes in the TME later resulted in the loss of accumulating  and increased M1 TAMs. Mice deficient in the Th1 transcription factor T-bet did not gain any survival advantage from RABV infection, exhibiting only limited tumor necrosis and no change in TME cytokines or TAM phenotype and highlighting the importance of type 1 mechanisms in this process.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604502>Identification of lignin-deficient Brachypodium distachyon (L.)

However, the implantation of collagen membranes also elicits foreign body reaction (FBR), the imbalance of which may lead to failures of dental implants. Macrophages play a pivotal role in FBR as macrophages can polarize into pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-regenerative () phenotypes. Therefore, collagen membranes based on modulation of macrophage polarization have gained increased attention. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-modified collagen membranes have been previously shown to downregulate the expression of inflammatory factors. In the present study, scanning electron microscopy images showed that EGCG-modified collagen membranes prevented the migration of keratinocytes and maintained space for osteoblasts. CCK-8 and live/dead cell assays showed that EGCG-modified collagen membranes unaffected the cell viability of osteoblasts. In addition, immunofluorescent staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed an increased number of  macrophages, an upregulated expression of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and an upregulation of osteogenic differentiation-related factors including Runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteopontin after implantation of EGCG-modified collagen membranes. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Micro-CT further demonstrated that the application of EGCG-modified collagen membranes promoted new bone formation in vivo. From these findings it is concluded that EGCG-modified collagen membranes have promising potentials in GBR surgery which served as suitable  membranes and promoted bone regeneration in vivo by recruiting  macrophages, promoting secretion of growth factors and osteogenic differentiation.Copyright © 2019.

Remyelination requires the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelinating OLs, which in the CNS with neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), is often inhibited. Among the inhibitors of OPC differentiation are toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) signaling, and both are negatively regulated by microRNA-146a (miR-146a). Therefore, we hypothesized that increase of miR-146a level in the CNS would foster OPC differentiation and remyelination by inhibiting the TLR2/IRAK1 signaling pathway. Here, we tested this hypothesis using exogenous miR-146a mimics and a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein peptide (PLP). EAE mice were treated by miR-146a mimics or miR-146a mimic negative controls, respectively, which initiated at day 14 post immunization, once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. Neurological  was monitored daily. Immunofluorescent staining, qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure the differentiation of OPCs and myelination, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of action of miR-146a. Using a fluorescence tracing approach, we found that miR-146a mimics crossed the blood brain  and targeted OPCs and microglia/macrophages after systemic administration. MiR-146a mimic treatment substantially improved neurological functional outcome, increased the number of newly generated OLs which may facilitate remyelination in the CNS. The cell number, cytokine level and protein levels of  phonotype of microglia/macrophages significantly increased, while cytokine and protein levels of the M1 phenotype significantly decreased after miR-146a mimic treatment. Increased OPC differentiation and remyelination were associated with reduction of TLR2/IRAK1 signaling pathway activity by miR-146a mimic treatment. This study provides insight into the cellular and molecular bases for the therapeutic effects of miR-146a on OPC differentiation and remyelination, and suggests the potential of enhancing miR-146a as a treatment of demyelinating disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Each protonated state, denoted as iH, where i = 0-4, has a different number of protonated histidines, from 0 to 4. The DF of water in each state exhibits closed structures of 0H, 1H, and 2H and open structures in 3H and 4H. In the closed form, the DF and PMF indicate that hydronium ions are excluded from the channel. In contrast, the ion can distribute throughout the opened channel. The  in PMF of 3H, approximately 3-5 kJ/mol, is lower than that of 4H, 5-7 kJ/mol, indicating that 3H has higher permeability to protons. On the basis of the radial DFs of water and hydronium ions around the imidazole rings of His37, we propose a new mechanism of proton transfer through the gating region of the channel. In this process, a hydronium ion hands a proton to a non-protonated histidine through a hydrogen bond between them, and then the other protonated histidine releases a proton to a water molecule via a hydrogen bond. The process transfers a proton effectively from one water molecule to another.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426249> ameliorate renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by modulating the phenotype of macrophages through the IL-10/GSK-3β/PTEN signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>After renal ischemic reperfusion injury, a series of pathological changes, such as impaired intestinal barrier function, intestinal flora, and endotoxin translocation, are caused by intestinal ischemia and hypoxia, which then trigger systemic inflammatory responses and affect the condition and prognosis of the patients. In this study, a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by examining changes in renal function, intestinal barrier function, inflammatory index, oxidative stress, and macrophage phenotypes to evaluate the effect of probiotic VSL#3 on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results showed that, after VSL#3 intervention, the levels of BUN, Scr, Cys C, PRO, and NGAL were all significantly decreased compared with the I/R group, while the value of Ccr showed a significant increase. In addition, the concentrations of MPO, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, ED-1, and PCNA were all significantly lower than those in the I/R group, while the levels of endotoxin, DOA, and D-lactic acid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, the proteins associated with intestinal barrier functions, such as ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1, were significantly upregulated compared with the I/R group. Overall, the VSL#3 intervention group was able to maintain the required number of beneficial intestinal flora and to inhibit the proliferation of harmful bacteria. At the same time, the VSL#3 intervention could also prevent the decrease in the levels of CAT, GSH-PX, HO, and T-SOD, while downregulating the expression of Keap1 and Nrf2. After the intervention with the VSL#3, the expression levels of CD68 and CD86 proteins were significantly decreased, while the expression levels of CD163 and CD206 proteins were significantly higher. Further experiments confirmed that the expression of iNOS protein was significantly decreased after the VSL#3 intervention, and the expression of Arg-1 and Ym1 proteins was significantly increased. The VSL#3 was able to induce high expressions of p-GSK-3β and p-PTEN proteins, while the use of IL-10 antibody impaired the effect of the VSL#3. In summary, this research confirms that  can alleviate renal dysfunction caused by ischemia and reperfusion by protecting the intestinal barrier function and maintaining the functions of intestinal flora. The pathway screening test of this study suggests that IL-10/GSK3β/PTEN may play an important role in the process of the prototypic VSL#3 inducing  transformation of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816717>Impact of host plant connectivity, crop border and patch size on adult Colorado potato beetle retention.</a></h2><p>Tagged Colorado potato beetles (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), were released on potato plants, Solanum tuberosum L., and tracked using a portable harmonic radar system to determine the impact of host plant spatial distribution on the tendency of the pest to remain on the colonized host plant or patch. Results confirmed the long residency time on the host plant and showed that close connection of the plant to neighboring plants hastened dispersal between plants. Tracking walking CPB for over 6 h in small potato plots revealed that all types of mixed borders tested (potato/bare ground, potato/timothy and potato/woodland) acted as a strong  and retained beetles within the patch. In another experiment in potato patches surrounded by bare ground borders, tracked walking CPB displayed similar behaviour for up to four days. The distribution of turning angles in the CPB walking paths was not uniform and corresponded to beetles following the edge rows of potato patches in response to the crop border  or reversing their direction as they reached the end of a row and therefore a border. Patch size had no or little effect on beetle retention in the patch. The relative distribution of counts of tagged beetles detected among small (16 ), medium (64 ) and large size (256 ) patches of potato four days after initial release remained similar to that of numbers released. Even though mixed crop borders were a strong  to walking CPB emigrating from potato patches, the departure rate of beetles over time was high. Results suggest that the effect of mixed borders is largely limited to dispersal by walking and does not apply to beetles leaving host patches by flight. The manipulation of crop borders and patch size seem to have limited potential for the management of CPB emigrating from potato fields.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23580401>The Himalayas:  and conduit for gene flow.</a></h2><p>The Himalayan mountain range is strategically located at the crossroads of the major cultural centers in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Although previous Y-chromosome studies indicate that the Himalayas served as a natural  for gene flow from the south to the Tibetan plateau, this region is believed to have played an important role as a corridor for human migrations between East and West Eurasia along the ancient Silk Road. To evaluate the effects of the Himalayan mountain range in shaping the maternal lineages of populations residing on either side of the cordillera, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA variation in 344 samples from three Nepalese collections (Newar, Kathmandu and Tamang) and a general population of Tibet. Our results revealed a predominantly East Asian-specific component in Tibet and Tamang, whereas Newar and Kathmandu are both characterized by a combination of East and South Central Asian lineages. Interestingly, Newar and Kathmandu harbor several deep-rooted Indian lineages, including , R5, and U2, whose coalescent times from this study (U2, >40 kya) and previous reports ( and R5, >50 kya) suggest that Nepal was inhabited during the initial peopling of South Central Asia. Comparisons with our previous Y-chromosome data indicate sex-biased migrations in Tamang and a founder effect and/or genetic drift in Tamang and Newar. Altogether, our results confirm that while the Himalayas acted as a geographic  for human movement from the Indian subcontinent to the Tibetan highland, it also served as a conduit for gene flow between Central and East Asia.Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600120>Effects of cevimeline on excitability of parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the superior salivatory nucleus of rats.</a></h2><p>The superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) contains parasympathetic preganglionic neurons innervating the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Cevimeline, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist, is a sialogogue that possibly stimulates SSN neurons in addition to the salivary glands themselves because it can cross the blood-brain  (BBB). In the present study, we examined immunoreactivities for mAChR subtypes in SSN neurons retrogradely labeled with a fluorescent tracer in neonatal rats. Additionally, we examined the effects of cevimeline in labeled SSN neurons of brainstem slices using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Mainly M1 and M3 receptors were detected by immunohistochemical staining, with low-level detection of M4 and M5 receptors and absence of  receptors. Most (110 of 129) SSN neurons exhibited excitatory responses to application of cevimeline. In responding neurons, voltage-clamp recordings showed that 84% (101/120) of the neurons exhibited inward currents. In the neurons displaying inward currents, the effects of the mAChR antagonists were examined. A mixture of M1 and M3 receptor antagonists most effectively reduced the peak amplitude of inward currents, suggesting that the excitatory effects of cevimeline on SSN neurons were mainly mediated by M1 and M3 receptors. Current-clamp recordings showed that application of cevimeline induced membrane depolarization (9/9 neurons). These results suggest that most SSN neurons are excited by cevimeline via M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Biofilms are communities of microbes embedded in matrices composed of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and have been implicated in both the healthy microbiome and disease states. The immune system recognizes many different bacterial patterns, molecules, and antigens, but these components can be camouflaged in the biofilm mode of growth. Instead, immune cells come into contact with components of the EPS matrix, a diverse, hydrated mixture of extracellular DNA (bacterial and host), proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. As bacterial cells transition from planktonic to biofilm-associated they produce small molecules, which can increase inflammation, induce cell death, and even cause necrosis. To survive, invading bacteria must overcome the epithelial , host microbiome, complement, and a variety of leukocytes. If bacteria can evade these initial cell populations they have an increased chance at surviving and causing ongoing disease in the host. Planktonic cells are readily cleared, but biofilms reduce the effectiveness of both polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages. In addition, in the presence of these cells, biofilm formation is actively enhanced, and components of host immune cells are assimilated into the EPS matrix. While pathogenic biofilms contribute to states of chronic inflammation, probiotic Lactobacillus biofilms cause a negligible immune response and, in states of inflammation, exhibit robust antiinflammatory properties. These probiotic biofilms colonize and protect the gut and vagina, and have been implicated in improved healing of damaged skin. Overall, biofilms stimulate a unique immune response that we are only beginning to understand.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The pharmacokinetics and disposition of deferasirox were investigated in rats. The animals received single intravenous (10 mg/kg) or p.o. (10 or 100 mg/kg) doses of 14C-radiolabeled deferasirox. Biological samples were analyzed for radioactivity (liquid scintillation counting, quantitative whole-body autoradioluminography), for deferasirox and its iron complex [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/UV], and for metabolites (HPLC with radiodetection, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C NMR, and two-dimensional NMR techniques). At least 75% of p.o.-dosed deferasirox was absorbed. The p.o. bioavailability was 26% at the 10 mg/kg dose and showed an overproportional increase at the 100 mg/kg dose, probably because of saturation of elimination processes. Deferasirox-related radioactivity was distributed mainly to blood, excretory organs, and gastrointestinal tract. Enterohepatic recirculation of deferasirox was observed. No retention occurred in any tissue. The placental  was passed to a low extent. Approximately 3% of the dose was transferred into the breast milk. Excretion of deferasirox and metabolites was rapid and complete within 7 days. Key clearance processes were hepatic metabolism and biliary elimination via multidrug resistance protein 2. Deferasirox, iron complex, and metabolites were excreted largely via bile and feces (total > or = 90%). Metabolism included glucuronidation at the carboxylate group (acyl glucuronide M3) and at phenolic hydroxy groups, as well as, to a lower degree, cytochrome P450-catalyzed hydroxylations. Two hydroxylated metabolites (M1 and ) were administered to rats and were shown not to contribute substantially to iron elimination in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30154789>Memory Inflation Drives Tissue-Resident Memory CD8 T Cell Maintenance in the Lung After Intranasal Vaccination With Murine Cytomegalovirus.</a></h2><p>Tissue-resident memory T (T) cells provide first-line defense against invading pathogens encountered at  sites. In the lungs, T cells protect against respiratory infections, but wane more quickly than T cells in other tissues. This lack of a sustained T population in the lung parenchyma explains, at least in part, why infections with some pathogens, such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), recur throughout life. Intranasal (IN) vaccination with a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) vector expressing the M protein of RSV (MCMV-M) has been shown to elicit robust populations of CD8 T cells that accumulate over time and mediate early viral clearance. To extend this finding, we compared the inflationary CD8 T cell population elicited by MCMV-M vaccination with a conventional CD8 T cell population elicited by an MCMV vector expressing the  protein of RSV (MCMV-). Vaccination with MCMV- induced a population of -specific CD8 T cells that waned rapidly, akin to the -specific CD8 T cell population elicited by infection with RSV. In contrast to the natural immunodominance profile, however, coadministration of MCMV-M and MCMV- did not suppress the M-specific CD8 T cell response, suggesting that progressive expansion was driven by continuous antigen presentation, irrespective of the competitive or regulatory effects of -specific CD8 T cells. Moreover, effective viral clearance mediated by M-specific CD8 T cells was not affected by the coinduction of -specific CD8 T cells. These data show that memory inflation is required for the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the lungs after IN vaccination with MCMV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662770>Glomerular haemodynamic profile of patients with Type 1 diabetes compared with healthy control subjects.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the glomerular haemodynamic profile of patients with Type 1 diabetes with either renal hyperfiltration (GFR ≥ 135 ml/min/1.73  ) or renal normofiltration (GFR 90-134 ml/min/1.73  ) during euglycaemic and hyperglycaemic conditions, and to compare this profile with that of a similar group of healthy control subjects.Gomez's equations were used to derive afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances, glomerular hydrostatic pressure and filtration pressure.At baseline, during clamped euglycaemia, patients with Type 1 diabetes and hyperfiltration had lower mean ± sd afferent arteriolar resistance than both those with Type 1 diabetes and normofiltration (914 ± 494 vs. 2065 ± 597 dyne/s/cm5 ; P < 0.001) and healthy control subjects (1676 ± 707 dyne/s/cm(5) ; p < 0.001). By contrast, efferent arteriolar resistance was similar in the three groups. Patients with Type 1 diabetes and hyperfiltration also had higher mean ± sd glomerular hydrostatic pressure than both healthy control subjects and patients with Type 1 diabetes and normofiltration (66 ± 6 vs. 60 ± 3 vs. 55 ± 3 mmHg; P < 0.05). Similar findings for afferent arteriolar resistance, efferent arteriolar resistance, glomerular hydrostatic pressure and filtration pressure were observed during clamped hyperglycaemia.Hyperfiltration in Type 1 diabetes is primarily driven by alterations in afferent arteriolar resistance rather than efferent arteriolar resistance. Renal protective therapies should focus on afferent renal arteriolar mechanisms through the use of pharmacological agents that target tubuloglomerular feedback, including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and incretins.© 2015 The Authors.

Investigation of their molecular architecture and the dynamic process of transporting substrate or transmitting signals across the membrane  has been one of the frontiers in biomedical research. The past decade has seen numerous successes in the use of X-ray or electron crystallography in determining atomic-resolution structures of membrane proteins, and in some cases, even snapshots of different physiological states of the same protein have been obtained. But there are also many cases in which long-standing efforts to crystallize proteins have yet to succeed. Therefore we have practical needs for developing complementary biophysical tools such as NMR spectroscopy and electron microscopy for tackling these systems. This paper provides a number of key examples where the utility of solution NMR was pivotal in providing structural and functional information on ion channels and transporters.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The underlying pathophysiology is characterized by secondary processes including neuronal death and gliosis. To elucidate the role of the NG2 proteoglycan we investigated the response of NG2-knockout mice (NG2-KO) to TBI. Seven days after TBI behavioral analysis, brain damage volumetry and assessment of blood brain  integrity demonstrated an exacerbated response of NG2-KO compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Reactive astrocytes and expression of the reactive astrocyte and neurotoxicity marker Lcn2 (Lipocalin-2) were increased in the perilesional brain tissue of NG2-KO mice. In addition, microglia/macrophages with activated morphology were increased in number and mRNA expression of the  marker Arg1 (Arginase 1) was enhanced in NG2-KO mice. While TBI-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes was unchanged between genotypes, PCR array screening revealed a marked TBI-induced up-regulation of the C-X-C motif chemokine 13 gene Cxcl13 in NG2-KO mice. CXCL13, known to attract immune cells to the inflamed brain, was expressed by activated perilesional microglia/macrophages seven days after TBI. Thirty days after TBI, NG2-KO mice still exhibited more pronounced neurological deficits than WT mice, up-regulation of Cxcl13, enhanced CD45+ leukocyte infiltration and a relative increase of activated Iba-1+/CD45+ microglia/macrophages. Our study demonstrates that lack of NG2 exacerbates the neurological outcome after TBI and associates with abnormal activation of astrocytes, microglia/macrophages and increased leukocyte recruitment to the injured brain. These findings suggest that NG2 may counteract neurological deficits and adverse glial responses in TBI.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309756>Dichotomous  of IL-33 in health and disease: From biology to clinical implications.</a></h2><p>Interleukin (IL)-33 is a cytokine that is released from epithelial and endothelial cells at  surfaces upon tissue stress or damage to operate as an alarmin. IL-33 has been primarily implicated in the induction of T helper (Th) 2 type immune responses. Therefore, IL-33 has attracted a lot of interest as a potential therapeutic target in asthma and other allergic diseases. Over the years, it has become clear that IL-33 has a much broader activity and also contributes to Th1 immunity, expanding the possibilities for therapeutic modulation of IL-33 activity to multiple inflammatory diseases. However, more recently IL-33 has also been shown to mediate immunosuppression and tissue repair by activating regulatory T cells (Treg) and promoting  macrophage polarization. These pleiotropic activities of IL-33 illustrate the need for a tight molecular regulation of IL-33 activity, and have to be taken into account when IL-33 or its receptor is targeted for therapeutic modulation. Here we review the multiple molecular mechanisms that regulate IL-33 activity and describe how IL-33 can shape innate and adaptive immune responses by promoting Th1, Th2 and Treg . Finally, we will discuss the possibilities for therapeutic modulation of IL-33 signaling as well as possible safety issues.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Intraperitoneal administration of azithromycin significantly reduced blood-brain  damage and cerebral infiltration of myeloid cells, including neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages. These effects resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of cerebral ischemic damage, and in a remarkable amelioration of neurological deficits up to 7 days after the insult. Neuroprotection was associated with increased arginase activity in peritoneal exudate cells, which was followed by the detection of Ym1- and arginase I-immunopositive  macrophages in the ischemic area at 24-48 h of reperfusion. Pharmacological inhibition of peritoneal arginase activity counteracted azithromycin-induced neuroprotection, pointing to a major role for drug-induced polarization of migratory macrophages towards a protective, non-inflammatory  phenotype.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The adopted orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα is a constitutive transcriptional repressor as it lacks AF2 domain and was earlier shown to be present in macrophages. In the present study, we highlight the differences in the relative subcellular localization of Rev-erbα in monocytes and macrophages. The nuclear localization of Rev-erbα in macrophages is subsequent to monocyte differentiation. Expression analysis of Rev-erbα elucidated it to be considerably more expressed in M1 phenotype in comparison with . Rev-erbα overexpression augments antimycobacterial properties of macrophage by keeping IL10 in a basal repressed state. Further, promoter analysis revealed that IL10 promoter harbors a Rev-erbα binding site exclusive to humans and higher order primates and not mouse, demonstrating a species  in its functionality. This direct gene repression is mediated by recruitment of co-repressors NCoR and HDAC3. In addition, our data elucidate that its overexpression reduced the survival of intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis by enhancing phagosome lysosome maturation, an event resulting from IL10 repression. Thus, these findings suggest that Rev-erbα bestows protection against mycobacterial infection by direct gene repression of IL10 and thus provide a novel target in modulating macrophage microbicidal properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28425709>Beyond Structural Biology to Functional Biology: Solid-State NMR Experiments and Strategies for Understanding the  Proton Channel Conductance.</a></h2><p>In terms of structural biology, solid-state NMR experiments and strategies have been well established for resonance assignments, leading to the determination of three-dimensional structures of insoluble membrane proteins in their native-like environment. It is also known that NMR has the unique capabilities to characterize structure- relationships of membrane-bound biological systems beyond structural biology. Here, we report on solid-state NMR experiments and strategies for extracting functional activities on a sub-millisecond time scale. Specifically, we use the His37-labeled full length  (M2FL) protein of the Influenza A virus embedded in synthetic lipid bilayers as an example to characterize the proton conduction mechanism and kinetics. The integral membrane  protein assembles as a tetrameric bundle to form a proton-conducting channel that is activated by low pH and is essential for the viral lifecycle. Our results present convincing evidence for the formation of imidazolium-imidazole hydrogen bonds in the His37 tetrad at low pH and that these hydrogen bonds have a low  that facilitates the proton conduction mechanism in the M2FL protein. Moreover, it has been possible to measure hydronium ion exchange between water and the protons in the His37 NH bonds based on chemical exchange spectroscopy with minimized spin diffusion.

However, the expression of Arrb2 in microglial cells and its influence on HSE prognosis is still undefined. We explore the pathophysiological effect of Arrb2 in the brain using experimental HSE mice. The expression of Arrb2 in microglia was decreased significantly 48 hours following HSV-1 infection. Arrb2 overexpression transgenic (TG) mice had a significantly lower mortality and survival rate was improved by 40% compared to wild-type mice. Arrb2 suppressed the generation of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 expression. Arrb2 also inhibited the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in microglial cells. Arrb2 TG mice attenuated the blood-brain  breakdown and relieved cerebral edema, meanwhile, Arrb2 improved mice neurological  compared with wild-type mice.

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant and has a potential to improve cognitive functions. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of ALA in AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity mouse model. Effect of ALA (25mg/kg/day) was evaluated in the AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity (AlCl3 150 mg/kg/day) mouse model on learning and memory using behaviour tests and on the expression of muscarinic receptor genes (using RT-PCR), in hippocampus and amygdala. Following ALA treatment, the expression of muscarinic receptor genes M1,  and choline acetyltransferase (ChaT) were significantly improved (p<0.05) relative to AlCl3-treated group. ALA enhanced fear memory (p<0.01) and social novelty preference (p<0.001) comparative to the AlCl3-treated group. Fear extinction memory was remarkably restored (p<0.001) in ALA-treated group demonstrated by reduced freezing response as compared to the AlCl3-treated group which showed higher freezing. In-silico analysis showed that racemic mixture of ALA has higher binding affinity for M1 and  compared to acetylcholine. These novel findings highlight the potential role of ALA in cognitive functions and cholinergic system enhancement thus presenting it an enviable therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Ready meals are often rich in energy, fat and sugar and lack vegetables; however, studies investigating associations between ready-meal consumption, overweight and cooking skills are lacking. The present study examines whether demographic factors, overweight, beliefs about the nutritional value and taste of ready meals and cooking skills are associated with ready-meal consumption.Cross-sectional survey.Ready-meal consumption, weight status, cooking skills, beliefs about the taste and nutritional value of ready meals and demographic variables were assessed with self-administered questionnaires. Data were analysed with one-way ANOVA and multiple regression analysis.A total of 1017 adults from the German-speaking part of Switzerland.Men reported being more positive about ready meals and having fewer cooking skills compared with women. Overweight adults (BMI > 25 kg/) were more positive about nutrients and vitamins in ready meals compared with normal-weight adults. Ready-meal consumption was associated with cooking skills (β = -0·192), age (β =- 0·228), overweight (β = 0·129), nutritional value (β = -0·131), taste (β = -0·126), working status (β = 0·096) and gender (β = 0·084).Cooking skills were identified as a strong predictor of ready-meal consumption.

Further studies indicate that Metrnl is produced by Alternatively Activated Macrophages (AAM) and M-CSF cultured bone marrow macrophages (-like macrophages). In the skin, METRNL is expressed by resting fibroblasts and IFNγ-treated keratinocytes. A screen of human skin-associated diseases showed significant over-expression of METRNL in psoriasis, prurigo nodularis, actinic keratosis and atopic dermatitis. METRNL is also up-regulated in synovial membranes of human rheumatoid arthritis.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) caused by JEV is characterized by extensive inflammatory cytokine secretion, microglia activation, blood-brain  (BBB) breakdown, and neuronal death, all of which contribute to the vicious cycle of inflammatory damage. There are currently no effective treatments for JE. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to have a therapeutic effect on many central nervous system (CNS) diseases by regulating inflammation and other mechanisms.In vivo, 8- to 10-week-old mice were infected intraperitoneally with JEV and syngeneic bone marrow MSCs were administered through the caudal vein at 1 and 3 days post-infection. The mortality, body weight, and behavior were monitored daily. Brains from each group were harvested at the indicated times for hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical observation, flow cytometric analysis, TUNEL staining, Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and BBB permeability assays.

The inflammatory response, microglia activation, neuronal damage, BBB destruction, and viral load (VL) were significantly decreased in the MSC-treated group. In co-culture experiments, MSCs reprogrammed M1-to- switching in microglia and improved neuron survival.

Among a handful of drug-resistant mutants, -S31N is the predominant mutation and persists in more than 95% of currently circulating influenza A strains. We recently designed two classes of -S31N inhibitors, S31N-specific inhibitors and S31N/WT dual inhibitors, which are represented by N-[(5-cyclopropyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)methyl]adamantan-1-amine (WJ379) and N-[(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)methyl]adamantan-1-amine (BC035), respectively. However, their antiviral activities against currently circulating influenza A viruses and their genetic  to drug resistance are unknown. In this report, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of these two classes of -S31N inhibitors (WJ379 and BC035) by profiling their antiviral efficacy against multidrug-resistant influenza A viruses, in vitro drug resistance , and synergistic effect with oseltamivir. We found that -S31N inhibitors were active against several influenza A viruses that are resistant to one or both classes of Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-influenza drugs. In addition, -S31N inhibitors display a higher in vitro genetic  to drug resistance than amantadine. The antiviral effect of WJ379 was also synergistic with oseltamivir carboxylate. Overall, these results reaffirm that -S31N inhibitors are promising antiviral drug candidates that warrant further development.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300344>LIM-only protein FHL2 regulates experimental pulmonary Schistosoma mansoni egg granuloma formation.</a></h2><p>LIM-only protein FHL2 is associated with several immune and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, influenza A virus infection, and lung inflammation. However, the role of FHL2 in macrophage differentiation and in the development of granuloma formation is unknown. Here, we show that expression of FHL2 is induced in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) following stimulation with  cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. FHL2-knockout (FHL2-KO) BMMs exhibit a proinflammatory M1 phenotype after LPS treatment and display a reduced anti-inflammatory  phenotype following IL-4 treatment. Furthermore, thioglycollate-induced migration of macrophages and B cells is enhanced in FHL2-KO mice. To evaluate the importance of FHL2 in the development of pulmonary granuloma formation, FHL2-KO mice were challenged with Schistosoma mansoni eggs. FHL2-KO mice show an enhanced number of granulomas and display decreased expression of Th2 markers and an exacerbated Th1 type of inflammation, characterized by enhanced expression of neutrophil markers and Th1 cytokines. Furthermore, the expression of  proteins is reduced in FHL2-KO lung compared to WT. Collectively, these data identify a previously unrecognized role for FHL2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary granulomatous inflammation, partly through its effect on macrophage polarization, modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance and regulation of permeability in lung.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We examined whether administering extracts of MSCs (MSC-Ex) instead of MSCs could augment the beneficial effects of MSC therapy by overcoming the low homing efficiency of MSCs systemically administered in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model was established in C57BL/6 mice, and MSC-Ex was administered intraperitoneally. MSC-Ex reduced colitis, disease activity index (DAI), and histological colitis scores, and increased the body weight. Treatment with MSC-Ex completely blocked the induction of inflammatory cytokines, which were strongly detected in mice with colitis. MSC-Ex shifted the macrophage functional phenotype from M1 to  by decreasing the levels of MCP1, CXCL9, and iNOS, but increasing the levels of IL-10, LIGHT, CCL1, and Arg-1. MSC-Ex recovered the destruction of the epithelial  in the differentiated Caco-2 cells in vitro. Treatment with MSC-Ex was more potent than that with MSC in reducing DAI, the histological score, and nitrite levels. These data strongly support that MSC-Ex treatment can be a potent approach to overcome severe refractory IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078119>A responsive human triple-culture model of the air-blood : incorporation of different macrophage phenotypes.</a></h2><p>Current pulmonary research underlines the relevance of the alveolar macrophage (AM) integrated in multicellular co-culture-systems of the respiratory tract to unravel, for example, the mechanisms of tissue regeneration. AMs demonstrate a specific functionality, as they inhabit a unique microenvironment with high oxygen levels and exposure to external hazards. Healthy AMs display an anti-inflammatory phenotype, prevent hypersensitivity to normally innocuous contaminants and maintain tissue homeostasis in the alveolus. To mirror the actual physiological  of the AM, we developed three different polarized [classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated ( , wound-healing;  , regulatory)] macrophage models using a mixture of differentiation mediators, as described in the current literature. To test their immunological impact, these distinct macrophage phenotypes were seeded on to the epithelial layer of an established in vitro air-blood  co-culture, consisting of alveolar epithelial cells A549 or H441 and microvascular endothelial cells ISO-HAS-1 on the opposite side of a Transwell filter-membrane. IL-8 and sICAM release were measured as functionality parameters after LPS challenge. The M1 model itself already provoked a severe inflammatory-like response of the air-blood  co-culture, thus demonstrating its potential as a useful in vitro model for inflammatory lung diseases. The two  models represent a 'non-inflammatory' phenotype but still showed the ability to trigger inflammation following LPS challenge. Hence, the latter could be used to establish a quiescent, physiological in vitro air-blood model. Thus, the more complex differentiation protocol developed in the present study provides a responsive in vitro triple-culture model of the air-blood- that mimics AM features as they occur in vivo.© 2015 The Authors Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25182730>Microwave & magnetic () proteomics reveals CNS-specific protein expression waves that precede clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</a></h2><p>Central nervous system-specific proteins (CSPs), transported across the damaged blood-brain- (BBB) to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood (serum), might be promising diagnostic, prognostic and predictive protein biomarkers of disease in individual multiple sclerosis (MS) patients because they are not expected to be present at appreciable levels in the circulation of healthy subjects. We hypothesized that microwave &magnetic (M(2)) proteomics of CSPs in brain tissue might be an effective means to prioritize putative CSP biomarkers for future immunoassays in serum. To test this hypothesis, we used M(2) proteomics to longitudinally assess CSP expression in brain tissue from mice during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Confirmation of central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating inflammatory cell response and CSP expression in serum was achieved with cytokine ELISPOT and ELISA immunoassays, respectively, for selected CSPs. M(2) proteomics (and ELISA) revealed characteristic CSP expression waves, including synapsin-1 and α-II-spectrin, which peaked at day 7 in brain tissue (and serum) and preceded clinical EAE symptoms that began at day 10 and peaked at day 20. Moreover, M(2) proteomics supports the concept that relatively few CNS-infiltrating inflammatory cells can have a disproportionally large impact on CSP expression prior to clinical manifestation of EAE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28317235>Astrocyte-specific insulin-like growth factor-1 gene transfer in aging female rats improves stroke outcomes.</a></h2><p>Middle aged female rats sustain larger stroke infarction and disability than younger female rats. This older group also shows age-related reduction of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 in serum and in astrocytes, a cell type necessary for poststroke recovery. To determine the impact of astrocytic IGF-1 for ischemic stroke, these studies tested the hypothesis that gene transfer of IGF-1 to astrocytes will improve stroke outcomes in middle aged female rats. Middle aged (10-12 month old), acyclic female rats were injected with recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) packaged with the coding sequence of the human (h)IGF-1 gene downstream of an astrocyte-specific promoter glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (AAV5-GFP-hIGF-1) into the striatum and cortex. The AAV5-control consisted of an identical shuttle vector construct without the hIGF-1 gene (AAV5-GFAP-control). Six to eight weeks later, animals underwent transient (90 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion via intraluminal suture. While infarct volume was not altered, AAV5-GFAP-hIGF-1 treatment significantly improved blood pressure and neurological score in the early acute phase of stroke (2 days) and sensory-motor performance at both the early and late (5 days) acute phase of stroke. AAV5-GFAP-hIGF-1 treatment also reduced circulating serum levels of GFAP, a biomarker for blood brain  permeability. Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells in the brain at 24 hr poststroke showed that AAV5-GFAP-hIGF-1 altered the type of immune cells trafficked to the ischemic hemisphere, promoting an anti-inflammatory profile. Collectively, these studies show that targeted enhancement of IGF-1 in astrocytes of middle-aged females improves stroke-induced behavioral impairment and neuroinflammation.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370534>Tasquinimod modulates suppressive myeloid cells and enhances cancer immunotherapies in murine models.</a></h2><p>A major  for cancer immunotherapy is the presence of suppressive cell populations in patients with cancer, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Tasquinimod is a novel antitumor agent that is currently at an advanced stage of clinical development for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. A target of tasquinimod is the inflammatory protein S100A9, which has been demonstrated to affect the accumulation and  of tumor-suppressive myeloid cells. Here, we report that tasquinimod provided a significant enhancement to the antitumor effects of two different immunotherapeutics in mouse models of cancer: a tumor vaccine (SurVaxM) for prostate cancer and a tumor-targeted superantigen (TTS) for melanoma. In the combination strategies, tasquinimod inhibited distinct MDSC populations and TAMs of the -polarized phenotype (CD206(+)). CD11b(+) myeloid cells isolated from tumors of treated mice expressed lower levels of arginase-1 and higher levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and were less immunosuppressive ex vivo, which translated into a significantly reduced tumor-promoting capacity in vivo when these cells were coinjected with tumor cells. Tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells were increased markedly in the circulation and in tumors. Furthermore, T-cell effector functions, including cell-mediated cytotoxicity and IFNγ production, were potentiated. Taken together, these data suggest that pharmacologic targeting of suppressive myeloid cells by tasquinimod induces therapeutic benefit and provide the rationale for clinical testing of tasquinimod in combination with cancer immunotherapies.©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27284780>UV-selective face cream (Acne RA-1,2) in acne patients: clinical study of its effects on epidermal  , sebum production, tolerability and therapy adherence.</a></h2><p>General skin care recommendations such as the use of moisturizers and products with adequate photoprotection are important components of management for acne patients to complement the medical regimen. This study aimed to evaluate the real-life clinical effects of a novel UV-selective face cream (Acne RA-1,2, Meda Pharma, Solna, Sweden) on acne, epidermal  , sebum production, adherence and tolerability when used together with pharmacological acne treatment.Forty patients receiving pharmacological acne treatment applied Acne RA-1,2 once-daily for three months. Investigator's Global Assessment of acne, trans-epidermal water loss, sebum production and tolerability were assessed at one and three months.After 3 months, there was a 38% significant clinical improvement in mean Investigator Global Assessment score (3.4 to 2.1), a 29% significant reduction in trans-epidermal water loss (13.2 to 9.4 g/h/), and a 17% significant decrease in sebum production vs. baseline (234.6 to 195.6 µg/cm2; all P<0.01).

As DBD is commonly diagnosed late, it is important to understand the chronic impact of DM on bladder tissues. While changes in bladder smooth muscle and innervation have been reported in diabetic patients, the impact of DM on the specialized epithelial lining of the urinary bladder, the urothelium (UT), is largely unknown. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and electron microscopy were used to evaluate UT gene expression and cell morphology 3, 9, and 20 wk following streptozotocin (STZ) induction of DM in female Sprague-Dawley rats compared with age-matched control tissue. Desquamation of superficial (umbrella) cells was noted at 9 wk DM, indicating a possible breach in  . One causative factor may be metabolic burden due to chronic hyperglycemia, suggested by upregulation of the polyol pathway and glucose transport genes in DM UT. While superficial UT repopulation occurred by 20 wk DM, the phenotype was different, with significant upregulation of receptors associated with UT mechanosensation (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1; TRPV1) and UT autocrine/paracrine signaling (acetylcholine receptors AChR- and -M3, purinergic receptors P2X(2) and P2X(3)). Compromised   and alterations in UT mechanosensitivity and cell signaling could contribute to bladder instability, hyperactivity, and altered bladder sensation by modulating activity of afferent nerve endings, which appose the urothelium.

She underwent 6 cycles of FEC followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (TZB), resulting in a clinical complete response. After 15 cycles of a TZB-containing regimen, she complained of dizziness and nausea, and imaging examinations revealed multiple brain metastases. Whole-brain irradiation(33.6 Gy) was performed, and the chemotherapy regimen was changed to lapatinib (LAP: orally at 1,250 mg/day, every day) and capecitabine (CAP: orally at 2,000 mg/, every day for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest interval, as 1 cycle). After 6 weeks of the new treatment, magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked shrinkage of brain metastases. A clinical complete response was maintained for 19 months. While brain metastasis is an important problem with treatment with TZB, LAP is drawing attention because of its ability to pass the blood-brain  because of its small molecular weight.

To minimize the epidermal  challenge we optimized the design of adult incontinence briefs. In the fluid absorption area we interposed a special type of acidic, curled-type of cellulose between the top sheet in contact with the skin and the absorption core beneath containing the polyacrylate superabsorber. The intention was to minimize disturbance of the already weak acid mantle of aged skin. We also employed air-permeable side panels to minimize skin occlusion and swelling of the stratum corneum.The surface pH of diapers was measured after repeated wetting with a urine substitute fluid at the level of the top sheet. Occlusive effects and hydration of the stratum corneum were measured after a 4 hour application of different side panel materials by corneometry on human volunteers. Finally, we evaluated skin symptoms in 12 patients with preexisting IAD for 21 days following the institutional switch to the optimized diaper design. Local skin care protocols remained in place unchanged.The improved design created a surface pH of 4.6 which was stable even after repeated wetting throughout a 5 hour period. The "standard design" briefs had values of 7.1, which is alkaline compared to the acidic surface of normal skin. Side panels made from non-woven material with an air-permeability of more than 1200 l//s avoided excessive hydration of the stratum corneum when compared to the commonly employed air-impermeable plastic films. Resolution of pre-existing IAD skin lesions was noted in 8 out of 12 patients after the switch to the optimized brief design.An improved design of adult-type briefs can create an acidic pH on the surface and breathable side panels avoid over-hydration of the stratum corneum and occlusion. This may support the epidermal   and may help to reduce the occurrence of IAD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21711026>Free energy calculations on the two drug binding sites in the  proton channel.</a></h2><p>Two alternative binding sites of adamantane-type drugs in the influenza A  channel have been suggested, one with the drug binding inside the channel pore and the other with four drug molecule S-binding to the C-terminal surface of the transmembrane domain. Recent computational and experimental studies have suggested that the pore binding site is more energetically favorable but the external surface binding site may also exist. Nonetheless, which drug binding site leads to channel inhibition in vivo and how drug-resistant mutations affect these sites are not completely understood. We applied molecular dynamics simulations and potential of mean force calculations to examine the structures and the free energies associated with these putative drug binding sites in an -lipid bilayer system. We found that, at biological pH (~7.4), the pore binding site is more thermodynamically favorable than the surface binding site by ~7 kcal/mol and, hence, would lead to more stable drug binding and channel inhibition. This result is in excellent agreement with several recent studies. More importantly, a novel finding of ours is that binding to the channel pore requires overcoming a much higher energy  of ~10 kcal/mol than binding to the C-terminal channel surface, indicating that the latter site is more kinetically favorable. Our study is the first computational work that provides both kinetic and thermodynamic energy information on these drug binding sites. Our results provide a theoretical framework to interpret and reconcile existing and often conflicting results regarding these two binding sites, thus helping to expand our understanding of -drug binding, and may help guide the design and screening of novel drugs to combat the virus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028547>(+)-Borneol improves the efficacy of edaravone against DSS-induced colitis by promoting  macrophages polarization via JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Compound edaravone injection (C.EDA), a compound preparation composed of edaravone (EDA) and (+)-Borneol with the mass ratio of 4: 1, displays a better anti-inflammatory activity than EDA. However, its precise mechanism remains to be further studied. In this work, we investigated whether (+)-Borneol could improve the efficacy of EDA against DSS-induced colitis. We found that C.EDA at 7.5 and 15mg/kg could significantly relieve the disease activity index (DAI) and reduce the loss of body weight and colon length in a dose-dependent manner, while EDA or (+)-Borneol alone only had moderate effects even at the highest dose. Additionally, ELISA revealed that C.EDA could more dramatically decrease the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines and increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine than EDA or (+)-Borneol alone both in colon tissues and serum. H&E staining and IHC assay also indicated that C.EDA exhibited more prominent effects on increasing the population of  macrophages, decreasing M1 macrophages infiltration and protecting intestinal  integrity. Furthermore, in vitro studied demonstrated that C.EDA, EDA or (+)-Borneol failed in inhibiting M1 macrophages activation but could specifically induce the activation of  macrophages in a STAT3-dependent manner. Knockdown the expression of STAT3 successfully abolished the effect of C.EDA and EDA on promoting  macrophages activation. Consistent with in vivo study, C.EDA exhibited a more efficient ability of inducing  macrophages polarization and STAT3 activation than EDA or (+)-Borneol alone in vitro. In conclusion, we confirmed that (+)-Borneol improved the efficacy of EDA against DSS-induced colitis by promoting  macrophages polarization via JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp), gut permeability (sugar and polyethylene glycol absorption tests, plasma zonulin), and gut microbiota profiles (high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were assessed before and after overfeeding, and 14 d after intervention. Additionally, inflammation markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, calprotectin, regulated on activation normal, T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were measured in plasma by ELISA. Finally, lipid parameters were analyzed in serum by a laboratory service.Although participants gained 0.9 ± 0.6 kg (P < 0.001) body weight, overnutrition was not associated with a significant change in insulin sensitivity (M value and glucose disposal). Overfeeding for 7 d resulted in elevated serum total (10.2%), LDL (14.6%) and HDL (14.8%) cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.01). In contrast, fasting plasma triglyceride significantly declined (29.3%) during overfeeding (P < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers. Urine excretion of 4 sugars and polyethylene glycol, used as a proxy for gut permeability, and plasma concentration of zonulin, a marker of paracellular gut permeability, were unchanged. Moreover, overfeeding was not associated with consistent changes in gut microbiota profiles, but marked alterations were observed in a subgroup of 6 individuals.Our findings suggest that short-term overfeeding with an HFD does not significantly impair insulin sensitivity and gut permeability in normal-weight healthy men, and that changes in dominant communities of fecal bacteria occur only in certain individuals.

Obesity is closely correlated with inflammation in adipose tissue, and maintaining adipose tissue in a less-inflamed state requires intestinal integrity or a   to protect the intestine from the disruption that can be caused by a high-fat diet (HFD). Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory and intestinal -protecting effects of LG2055 in C57BL/6 mice fed a normal-fat diet (NFD), HFD, or the HFD containing LG2055 (HFD-LG) for 21 weeks. HFD-LG intake significantly prevented HFD-induced increases in body weight, visceral fat mass, and the ratio of inflammatory-type macrophages to anti-inflammatory ones in adipose tissue. Mice fed the HFD showed higher intestinal permeability to a fluorescent dextran administered by oral administration and an elevated concentration of antibodies specific to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the blood compared with those fed the NFD, suggesting an increased penetration of the gut contents into the systemic circulation. These elevations of intestinal permeability and anti-LPS antibody levels were significantly suppressed in mice fed the HFD-LG. Moreover, treatment with LG2055 cells suppressed an increase in the cytokine-induced permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers. These results suggest that LG2055 improves the intestinal integrity, reducing the entry of inflammatory substances like LPS from the intestine, which may lead to decreased inflammation in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535851>Preparation and characterization of agar/clay nanocomposite films: the effect of clay type.</a></h2><p>Agar-based nanocomposite films with different types of nanoclays, such as Cloisite Na+, Cloisite 30B, and Cloisite 20A, were prepared using a solvent casting method, and their tensile, water vapor , and antimicrobial properties were tested.

This study is a systematic comparison of the principal features of the inflammatory-like changes in the WM in different pathological conditions characterized by axonal damage/degeneration, focusing in particular on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) compared to non immune-mediated disorders. The study was performed on sections of NAWM from 15 MS cases, 11 cases of non immune-mediated disorders with wallerian axonal degeneration (stroke, trauma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), 3 cases of viral encephalitis, 6 control cases. Common features of the inflammatory-like changes observed in all of the conditions of WM pathology were diffuse endothelial expression of VCAM-1, microglial activation with expression of  markers, increased expression of sphingosine receptors. Inflammation in MS NAWM was characterized, compared to non immune-mediated conditions, by higher VCAM-1 expression, higher density of perivascular lymphocytes, focal perivascular inflammation with microglial expression of M1 markers, ongoing acute axonal damage correlating with VCAM-1 expression but not with microglia activation. Inflammatory changes in MS NAWM share all the main features observed in the WM in non immune-mediated conditions with wallerian axonal degeneration (with differences to a large extent more quantitative than qualitative), but with superimposition of disease-specific perivascular inflammation and ongoing acute axonal damage.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Prior studies of minocycline investigated short-term neuroprotective effects during subacute stage of stroke; however, the late effects of minocycline against early reperfusion injury on neurovascular remodeling are less well studied. We have shown that spontaneous angiogenesis vessels in ischemic brain regions have high blood-brain  (BBB) permeability due to lack of major tight junction proteins (TJPs) in endothelial cells at three weeks. In the present study, we longitudinally investigated neurological outcome, neurovascular remodeling and microglia/macrophage alternative activation after spontaneous and minocycline-induced stroke recovery.Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats had a 90 minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. At the onset of reperfusion they received a single dose of minocycline (3 mg/kg intravenously) or a vehicle. They were studied at multiple time points up to four weeks with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), immunohistochemistry and biochemistry.Minocycline significantly reduced the infarct size and prevented tissue loss in the ischemic hemispheres compared to vehicle-treated rats from two to four weeks as measured with MRI. Cerebral blood flow measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) showed that minocycline improved perfusion. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI indicated that minocycline reduced BBB permeability accompanied with higher levels of TJPs measured with Western blot. Increased MMP-2 and -3 were detected at four weeks. Active microglia/macrophage, surrounding and within the peri-infarct areas, expressed YM1, a marker of  microglia/macrophage activation, at four weeks.

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements  1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2)  2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2)  3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and levonorgestrel-releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1)  4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2)  5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2)  6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2)  7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving measures that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements  8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3)  9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non- method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual  or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is more effective than levonorgestrel emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception (levonorgestrel emergency contraception and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 25 kg/ and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 35 kg/. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's body weight or body mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of levonorgestrel emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

Though several inflammatory biomarkers have been postulated as the risk factors of TBI, there has not been any comprehensive description of them. Fingolimod, a new kind of immunomodulatory agent which can diminish various kinds of inflammatory responses, has shown additional therapeutic effects in the treatment of intracranial cerebral hematoma (ICH), ischemia, spinal cord injury (SCI), and many other CNS disorders. However, its therapeutic application has not been confirmed in TBI. Thus, we hypothesized that a 3-day consecutive fingolimod administration could broadly modulate the inflammatory reactions and improve the outcomes of TBI. The TBI models of C57/BL6 mice were established with the controlled cortical impact injury (CCI) system. A 3-day consecutive fingolimod therapy (given at 1, 24, and 48 h post injury) was performed at a dose of 1 mg/kg. The flow cytometry, immunoflourence, cytokine array, and ELISA were all applied to evaluate the immune cells and inflammatory markers in the injured brains. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-APP antibody was performed to assess the axonal damage. The neurological functions of these TBI models were assessed by mNSS/Rota-rod and Morris water maze (MWM). The brain water content and integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were also observed. On the 3rd day after TBI, the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines reached the peak and administration of fingolimod reduced as many as 20 kinds of cytokines and chemokines. Fingolimod decreased infiltrated T lymphocytes and NK cells but increased the percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells, and the concentration of IL-10 on the 3rd day after TBI. Fingolimod also notably attenuated the general activated microglia but augmented the /M1 ratio accompanied by decreased axonal damage. The neurological functions were improved after the fingolimod treatment accompanied with alleviation of the brain edema and BBB damage. This study suggests that the 3-day consecutive fingolimod administration extensively modulates multiple immuno-inflammatory responses and improves the neurological deficits after TBI, and therefore, it may be a new approach to the treatment of secondary TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863083>Promotion of neurological recovery in rat spinal cord injury by mesenchymal stem cells loaded on nerve-guided collagen scaffold through increasing alternatively activated macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are characterized by multidifferentiation and immunoregulatory potential and have been used in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI), but direct transplantation may limit effectiveness due to their quick diffusion. The role of macrophages in healing is being increasingly recognized because of their ability to polarize into pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. In the present study, nerve-guide collagen scaffold (CS) combined with rat MSCs was developed. After CS was confirmed to minimize MSC distribution in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the repair capacity of combined implantation of CS and MSCs and the effect on classically activated macrophage/alternatively activated macrophage () polarization was assessed in a hemisected SCI rat model. In vivo studies showed that, compared to the control group, the rats in the combined implantation group exhibited more significant recovery of nerve function evidenced by the 21-point Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score and footprint analysis. Morphological staining showed less macrophage infiltration, apoptosis and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and more neurofilaments, and the fibres were guided to grow through the implant. More  were observed in the combined implantation group. The data suggest that the combined implantation could support MSCs to play a protective role of SCI, not only through inhibiting chronic scar formation and providing linear guidance for the nerve, but also benefitting  polarization to form an anti-inflammatory environment. Thus, the combination of biomaterial and MSCs might be a prominent therapeutic treatment for SCI.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26588796>Management of LUTS in patients with dementia and associated disorders .</a></h2><p>To systematically review the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in patients with dementia and associated disorders.This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA statement. Studies were identified by electronic search of Embase and Medline databases (last search August 2015) and by screening of reference lists and reviews.Of 1,426 abstracts that were screened, 102 full-text articles were identified and assessed for eligibility. Seventy-six articles were then included in the quantitative synthesis. Urinary incontinence (UI) prevalence rates in dementia patients have varied considerably, ranging from 11 to 93%. In Alzheimer's disease patients, UI usually correlates with disease progression (late-stage dementia). In contrast, LUTS usually precede severe mental failure in Lewy body disease and in vascular dementia. Behavioral therapy, including toilet training and prompted voiding, may be especially useful in patients with unawareness UI. High-quality data to guide the choice of treatment strategies in this population are lacking. Current evidence suggests that antimuscarinics, especially oxybutynin, can be associated with cognitive worsening, due to the blockade of M1 receptors. Thus, the use of antimuscarinics that do not easily cross the blood-brain  or are more /M3 selective should be considered. No data are available for beta-3 agonists so far.Different types of dementia cause different LUTS at varying time points during the disease process and need singular therapeutic approaches. Treatment of LUTS should be tailored to individual patient needs and disease status, considering factors like mobility, cognitive , and general medical condition. Neurourol.

Its  is to cleave the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or N-acetylglucosamine moieties from its substrates. Here we reveal and consolidate many important aspects of the catalytic mechanism of GalNAc removal from the GM2 ganglioside. The reaction mechanism for this reaction is proposed to be substrate-assisted. It is expected to evolve through a mechanism similar to others glycosidase mechanisms, even though this fact has never been confirmed and the proposal still lacks atomic level detail in its description. To overcome these two limitations we have used the ONIOM formalism (B3LYP:Amber and M06-2X:Amber) with electrostatic embedding to calculate a bidimensional potential energy surface for the rate-limiting step. The potential energy surface reveals the mechanism with atomic detail. The formation of the covalent bond within the substrate has been confirmed, and its energy of stabilization has been calculated as 5.1 kcal/mol. The electronic energy  for this step is 22.5 kcal/mol at the hybrid ONIOM(M06-2X:Amber) level, well in line with the typical experimental values for similar reactions in glycosylases. The conformational transitions of the substrate GalNAc ring have been mapped in the PES for the first time. They support the hypothesis of a (4)S(2) skew boat-(4)E envelope-(4)C(1) chair pathway and provide much finer detail to the earlier proposals. In general the results are in line with earlier predictions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505255>CXCR7: A key neuroprotective molecule against alarmin HMGB1 mediated CNS pathophysiology and subsequent memory impairment.</a></h2><p>High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous alarmin that drives the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including cognitive decline. Therefore, HMGB1 is thought to be a common biomarker as well as promising therapeutic target for neuroinflammation associated with neurocognitive disorders. Here, for the first time, we have unmasked the potential inhibitory effect of a novel receptor of HMGB1-CXCL12 complex; atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3/CXCR7) on HMGB1 induced glial phenotype switching, neuroinflammation, and subsequent memory loss. Upregulation of CXCR7 inhibits HMGB1-CXCL12 complex induced peripheral immune cells infiltration to CNS by regulating blood-brain  (BBB) integrity in HMGB1 induced dementia model of mice. Whereas, gene knockdown study by RNA interference (non-invasive intranasal delivery to animal model) shows CXCR7 ablation aggravates inflammatory responses in hippocampus region and immune cell infiltration to CNS tissue by breached BBB. This study also indicates the important role of CXCR7 molecule in maintaining CNS homeostasis by balancing M1/ microglia, A1/A2 astrocytes, long term potentiation/long term depression markers which ultimately ameliorates HMGB1 induced neurodegeneration, synaptic depression and memory loss (assessed by both radial arm maze and Morris water maze) in male mice model of dementia. Overall, the study summarizes several significant protective functions afforded by CXCR7 against HMGB1 induced disbalance in neuroimmunological axis, neurodegeneration and memory loss and thereby provides a new paradigm for strategic development of novel therapeutics against neurodegenerative diseases with dementia as a common symptom.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Biophysical and structural evidence shows that this RNA-binding tetramer is strongly modulated by a CCCH Zn binding motif. We show that while the global dissociation/unfolding free energy is 10 kcal mol, more stable for the respiratory syncytial virus -1, the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) counterpart shows a 7 kcal mol higher intersubunit affinity. Removal of Zn from both homologues leads to an apo-monomer of identical secondary structure that further undergoes a slow irreversible oligomerization. Mutation of the histidine residue of the Zn motif to cysteine or alanine leads directly to large oligomers, strongly suggesting that metal coordination has an exquisite precision for modulating the quaternary arrangement. Zn removal is very slow and requires subdenaturing concentrations of guanidine chloride, suggesting a likely local folding energy . Exploring a broad combination of denaturant and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid conditions, we showed that the metapneumovirus protein has to overcome a higher energy  to trigger Zn removal-driven dissociation, in concordance with a slower dissociation kinetics. In silico modeling of open and close conformations for both -1 tetramers together with interaction energy calculations reveals that the gradual opening of protomers decreases the number of intersubunit contacts. Half of the interaction energy holding each protomer in the tetramer comes from the CCCH motif, while HMPV--1 harbors additional contacts between the CCCH motif of one subunit and the core domain of a protomer located in trans, allowing the rationalization of the experimental data obtained. Overall, the evidence points at a key role of the CCCH motif in switching between structural and consequently functional alternatives of the -1 protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901977>Effect of Heat Stress and Stocking Density onGrowth Performance, Breast Meat Quality,and Intestinal   in Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>The present experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of heat stress (HS) andstocking density (SD) on growth performance, breast meat quality, and intestinal  functionin broiler chickens. Experimental treatments included two different ambient temperatures (20 °C:thermoneutral conditions, or 27.8 °C: HS conditions) and two different SD (low: 9 birds/ andhigh: 18 birds/) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. A total of 1140 21-day-old broiler chickens wereallotted 1 of 4 treatments with five replicates. At the end of the experiment (35 days of age), twobirds per replicate were euthanized for sample collections. The results indicated no interactionsbetween HS and SD for all measurements. For main effects, HS decreased (p < 0.05) the growthperformance of broiler chickens. Similarly, high SD also decreased (p < 0.05) body weight gain andfeed intake. HS decreased (p < 0.01) jejunal trans-epithelial electric resistance (TER), whereas highSD did not affect TER. Neither HS nor high SD affected jejunal tight junction-related geneexpressions; however, high SD reduced (p < 0.05) occludin expression. In conclusion, HS and highSD are key environmental factors decreasing broiler performance; however, the interactive effectsof HS and high SD are not significant under the current conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19552820>Epidermal wound healing in severe sepsis and septic shock in humans.</a></h2><p>The effect of sepsis on epidermal wound healing has not been previously studied. It was hypothesised that epidermal wound healing is disturbed in severe sepsis.Blister wounds were induced in 35 patients with severe sepsis and in 15 healthy controls. The healing of the wounds was followed up by measuring transepidermal water loss and blood flow in the wound, reflecting the restoration of the epidermal   and inflammation, respectively. The first set of suction blisters (early wound) was made within 48 hours of the first sepsis-induced organ failure and the second set (late wound) four days after the first wound. In addition, measurements were made on the intact skin.The average age of the whole study population was 62 years (standard deviation [SD] 12). The mean Acute  and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score on admission was 25 (SD 8). The two most common causes of infections were peritonitis and pneumonia. Sixty-six percent of the patients developed multiple organ failure. The decrease in water evaporation from the wound during the first four days was lower in septic patients than in the control subjects (56 g/ per hour versus 124 g/ per hour, P = 0.004). On the fourth day, septic patients had significantly higher blood flow in the wound compared with the control subjects (septic patients 110 units versus control subjects 47 units, P = 0.001). No difference in transepidermal water loss from the intact skin was found between septic patients and controls. Septic patients had higher blood flow in the intact skin on the fourth and on the eighth day of study compared with the controls.The restoration of the epidermal   is delayed and wound blood flow is increased in patients with severe sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27365222>Evaluation of the route dependency of the pharmacokinetics and neuro-pharmacokinetics of tramadol and its main metabolites in rats.</a></h2><p>Tramadol hydrochloride is a centrally acting analgesic used for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain. It has three main metabolites: O-desmethyltramadol (M1), N-desmethyltramadol (), and N,O-didesmethyltramadol (M5). Because of the frequent use of tramadol by patients and drug abusers, the ability to determine the parent drug and its metabolites in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid is of great importance. In the present study, a pharmacokinetic approach was applied using two groups of five male Wistar rats administered a 20mg/kg dose of tramadol via intravenous (i.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) routes. Plasma and CSF samples were collected at 5-360min following tramadol administration. Our results demonstrate that the plasma values of Cmax (C0 in i.v. group) and area under the curve (AUC)0-t for tramadol were 23,314.40±6944.85 vs. 3187.39±760.25ng/mL (Cmax) and 871.15±165.98 vs. 414.04±149.25μg·min/mL in the i.v. and i.p. groups, respectively (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between i.v. and i.p. plasma values for tramadol metabolites (p>0.05). Tramadol rapidly penetrated the blood-brain  (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid  (BCSFB) (5.00±0.00 vs. 10.00±5.77min in i.v. and i.p. groups, respectively). Tramadol and its metabolites (M1 and ) were present to a lesser extent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than in the plasma. M5 hardly penetrated the CSF, owing to its high polarity. There was no significant difference between the AUC0-t of tramadol in plasma (414.04±149.25μg·min/mL) and CSF (221.81±83.02μg·min/mL) in the i.p. group. In addition, the amounts of metabolites (M1 and ) in the CSF showed no significant differences following both routes of administration. There were also no significant differences among the Kp,uu,CSF(0-360) (0.51±0.12 vs. 0.63±0.04) and Kp,uu,CSF(0-∞) (0.61±0.10 vs. 0.62±0.02) for i.v. and i.p. pathways, respectively (p>0.05). Drug targeting efficiency (DTE) values of tramadol after i.p. injection were more than unity for all scheduled time points. Considering the main analgesic effect of M1, it is hypothesized that both routes of administration may produce the same amount of analgesia.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We developed an in vitro mechanical scratch injury model in air-liquid interface differentiated primary human small airway epithelial cells that recapitulates many of the characteristics observed during epithelial wound injury in both human tissue and small animal models. Wound closure was initially associated with de-differentiation of the differentiated apical cells and rapid migration into the wound site, followed by proliferation of apical cells behind the wound edge, together with increases in FAK expression, fibronectin and reduction in PAI-1 which collectively facilitate cell motility and extracellular matrix deposition. Macrophages are intimately involved in wound repair so we sought to investigate the role of macrophage sub-types on this process in a novel primary human co-culture model. M1 macrophages promoted FAK expression and both M1 and  macrophages promoted epithelial de-differentiation. Interestingly, M2a macrophages inhibited both proliferation and fibronectin expression, possibly via the retinoic acid pathway, whereas M2b and M2c macrophages prevented fibronectin deposition, possibly via MMP expression. Collectively these data highlight the complex nature of epithelial wound closure, the differential impact of macrophage sub-types on this process, and the heterogenic and non-delineated  of these macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30318996>Acteoside Improves Muscle Atrophy and Motor  by Inducing New Myokine Secretion in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury.</a></h2><p>Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is difficult to cure, even by several approaches effective at the acute or subacute phase. We focused on skeletal muscle atrophy as a detrimental factor in chronic SCI and explored drugs that protect against muscle atrophy and activate secretion of axonal growth factors from skeletal muscle. We found that acteoside induced the secretion of axonal growth factors from skeletal muscle cells and proliferation of these cells. Intramuscular injection of acteoside in mice with chronic SCI recovered skeletal muscle weight reduction and motor  impairment. We also identified pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2) as a secreted factor from skeletal muscle cells, stimulated by acteoside. Extracellular PKM2 enhanced proliferation of skeletal muscle cells and axonal growth in cultured neurons. Further, we showed that PKM2 might cross the blood-brain . These results indicate that effects of acteoside on chronic SCI might be mediated by PKM2 secretion from skeletal muscles. This study proposes that the candidate drug acteoside and a new myokine, PKM2, could be used for the treatment of chronic SCI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24700269>Physical properties and biocompatibility of oligochitosan membrane film as wound dressing.</a></h2><p>The physical and biological characteristics of oligochitosan (O-C) film, including its  and mechanical properties, in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo biocompatibility, were studied to assess its potential use as a wound dressing.Membrane films were prepared from water-soluble O-C solution blended with various concentrations of glycerol to modify the physical properties of the films.

This enables them to play a relevant role in supporting the archetypical functions of the testis, namely spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. During infection, the characteristic blunted immune response of TM reflects the need for a delicate balance between a sufficiently strong reaction to counteract invading pathogens, and the prevention of excessive proinflammatory cytokine levels with the potential to disturb or destroy spermatogenesis.

Our understanding of the complex interactions of the innate immune system in wound healing has significantly improved, particularly in our understanding of the role of antimicrobials and peptides and the nature of the switch from inflammatory to reparative processes. This takes place against an emerging understanding of the relationship between human cells and commensal bacteria in the skin.  It is well established and accepted that early local inflammatory mediators in the wound bed  as an immunological vehicle to facilitate immune cell infiltration and microbial clearance upon injury to the skin . Both impaired and excessive innate immune responses can promote nonhealing wounds. It appears that the switch from the inflammatory to the proliferative phase is tightly regulated and mediated, at least in part, by a change in macrophages. Defining the factors that initiate the switch in such macrophage phenotypes and functions is the subject of multiple investigations.  The review highlights processes that may be useful targets for further investigation, particularly the switch from M1 to  macrophages that appears to be critical as dysregulation of this switch occurs during defective wound healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141443>Serum Zinc Concentrations in Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis.</a></h2><p>Bangladesh is a tuberculosis (TB) burden country. It is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity and a major  of social and economic development. Zinc is a major trace element and an essential component of the body immune system. It's an important determinant of resistance to infection by maintaining cell mediated immunity. This analytical case control study was conducted in the Department of Internal Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh to see the association of serum zinc concentrations with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in adult population (18-60 years) from January 2015 to January 2016. Freshly diagnosed PTB patients before initiating anti-TB chemotherapy as cases (N=43) and TB negative subjects as controls (N=48) were included conveniently in this study with a rigid selection criteria. Serum zinc concentrations were estimated by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The mean±SD age and BMI of the case group and control group were 33.30±14.71 and 32.69±11.60 years, 19.88±2.31 and 22.08±2.80 kg/ respectively. The concentrations of serum zinc were significantly lower (P=0.01) in PTB group (840.9±230.0 μgm/l) compared with the control group (965.6±219.9 μgm/l). There was marked variation of mean±SD serum zinc concentrations between male (1008.95±246.16 μgm/l) and female (937.24±200.35 μgm/l) in control group (P=0.182) though the variation is minimal in PTB group (P=0.724). The serum zinc concentrations showed positive correlation with BMI (P=0.642) but negative correlation with age (P=0.023) in both case and control. The lower serum zinc concentrations (12.06%) in PTB patients indicate relative immune deficiency. Routine assessment of serum zinc concentration of PTB patients should be considered and further outcome should be assessed with zinc supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25812389>[Impact of wet work on epidermal  (tewl and stratum corneum hydration) and skin viscoelasticity in nurses].</a></h2><p>Nurses are prone to develop hand eczema due to occupational exposure to irritants, including wet work. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of wet work on selected skin properties, reflecting epidermal  --transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration--and additionally skin viscoelasticity, in nurses.Study subjects included 90 nurses employed in hospital wards. Measurements were carried out within the dorsal aspect of the dominant hand, using a Cutometer MPA 580 equipped with Tewameter TM 300 and Corneometer CM 825 (Courage & Khazaka, Germany) probes. Examina- tions took place on hospital premises. Similar measurements were performed in the control group of females non-exposed to irritants.In the examined group of nurses, mean TEWL was 15.5 g/h/ and was higher than in the control group (12.99 g/h/). After rejecting the extreme results, the difference between the groups proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean value of stratum corneum hydration was lower in the examined group (37.915) compared with the control group (40.05), but the difference was not sta tistically significant. Also results of viscoelasticity assessment showed no significant differences between studied groups.The results of the assessment of skin biophysical properties show that wet work exerts a moderately adverse impact on skin condition.

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements 1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2) 2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2) 3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and levonorgestrel-releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1) 4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2) 5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2) 6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2) 7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving measures that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements 8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3) 9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non- method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual  or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is more effective than levonorgestrel emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception (levonorgestrel emergency contraception and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17. Levonorgestrel emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 25 kg/ and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a body mass index > 35 kg/. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's body weight or body mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of levonorgestrel emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

Although intravenous enzyme replacement therapy is a viable approach for the treatment of non-neuronopathic forms of MPS, its effectiveness in the central nervous system (CNS) is limited by the blood-brain . Alternatively, enzyme replacement therapies and other therapies that directly target the brain represent approaches that circumvent the blood-brain  and, in the case of gene therapies, are intended to negate the need for repetitive dosing.In the present study, gene therapy was targeted to the brains of young adult mice affected by mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) by bilateral delivery of two different therapeutic lentivirus vectors to the cerebral lateral ventricles. One vector expressed codon optimised murine sulphamidase, whereas the other co-expressed sulphamidase and sulfatase modifying factor-1.Six months after gene delivery, bladder distension was prevented in all treated animals, and behavioural deficits were improved. Therapeutic enzyme activity from the most efficacious vector, which was also the simpler vector, ranged from 0.5- to four-fold normal within the brains of treated animals, and the average amount of integrated vector ranged from 0.1-1 gene copies per cell. Consequently, levels of ganglioside and lysosomal β-hexosaminidase, both of which are characteristically elevated in MPS IIIA, were significantly reduced, or were normalised.The present study demonstrates the efficacy of the intraventricular injection as a tool to target the brain with therapeutic genes in adult MPS IIIA mice, and provides evidence supporting this approach as a potentially effective means of treating CNS pathology in MPS IIIA patients.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697404>IL-33 improves wound healing through enhanced  macrophage polarization in diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>IL-33 is a newly discovered member of the IL-1 family and has been identified as a potent inducer of Th2 type immunity. Emerging evidence imply that IL-33 may also act as an alarm to alert the immune system when released by epithelial  tissues during trauma or infection. In this study, we further investigate the potential efficacy of IL-33 on dermal wound healing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. A full-thickness skin wound was generated on the back of diabetic mice and treated with IL-33 or vehicle topically. Our data showed that IL-33 delivery contributed to diabetic wound closure with wounds gaping narrower and exhibiting elevated re-epithelialization. IL-33 promoted the new extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and angiogenesis formation, which indicates an important role of IL-33 on matrix synthesis and neovascularization. Meanwhile, IL-33 accelerated the development of  macrophages in wound sites in vivo, and amplified IL-13-induced polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages toward a  phenotype in vitro. Furthermore, IL-33-amplified  macrophages augmented the proliferation of fibroblasts and ECM deposition. All together, these results strongly suggest manipulation of IL-33-mediated signal might be a potential therapeutic approach for diabetic skin wounds.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the expression of PLD isoforms and related phospholipid phosphatases in patients with ARDS, and their roles in a murine model of self-limited acute lung injury (ALI). Gene expression microarray analysis on whole blood obtained from patients that met clinical criteria for ARDS and clinically matched controls (non-ARDS) demonstrated that PLD1 gene expression was increased in patients with ARDS relative to non-ARDS and correlated with survival. In contrast, PLD2 expression was associated with mortality. In a murine model of self-resolving ALI, lung Pld1 expression increased and Pld2 expression decreased 24 h after intrabronchial acid. Total lung PLD activity was increased 24 h after injury. Pld1 mice demonstrated impaired alveolar   and increased tissue injury relative to WT and Pld2 , whereas Pld2 mice demonstrated increased recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, and decreased tissue injury. Isoform-specific PLD inhibitors mirrored the results with isoform-specific Pld-KO mice. PLD1 gene expression knockdown in human leukocytes was associated with decreased phagocytosis by neutrophils, whereas reactive oxygen species production and phagocytosis decreased in -macrophages. PLD2 gene expression knockdown increased neutrophil and -macrophage transmigration, and increased -macrophage phagocytosis. These results uncovered selective regulation of PLD isoforms after ALI, and opposing effects of selective isoform knockdown on host responses and tissue injury. These findings support therapeutic strategies targeting specific PLD isoforms for the treatment of ARDS.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28240183>Influenza A Virus Nucleoprotein: A Highly Conserved Multi-Functional Viral Protein as a Hot Antiviral Drug Target.</a></h2><p>Prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection is an ongoing unmet medical need. Each year, thousands of deaths and millions of hospitalizations are attributed to influenza virus infection, which poses a tremendous health and economic burden to the society. Aside from the annual influenza season, influenza viruses also lead to occasional influenza pandemics as a result of emerging or re-emerging influenza strains. Influenza viruses are RNA viruses that exist in quasispecies, meaning that they have a very diverse genetic background. Such a feature creates a grand challenge in devising therapeutic intervention strategies to inhibit influenza virus replication, as a single agent might not be able to inhibit all influenza virus strains. Both classes of currently approved anti-influenza drugs have limitations: the  channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine are no longer recommended for use in the U.S. due to predominant drug resistance, and resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir is continuously on the rise. In pursuing the next generation of antiviral drugs with broad-spectrum activity and higher genetic  of drug resistance, the influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) stands out as a high-profile drug target. This review summarizes recent developments in designing inhibitors targeting influenza NP and their mechanisms of action.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957932>Microthrombus-Targeting Micelles for Neurovascular Remodeling and Enhanced Microcirculatory Perfusion in Acute Ischemic Stroke.</a></h2><p>Reperfusion injury exists as the major obstacle to full recovery of neuron functions after ischemic stroke onset and clinical thrombolytic therapies. Complex cellular cascades including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain vascular impairment occur within neurovascular units, leading to microthrombus formation and ultimate neuron death. In this work, a multitarget micelle system is developed to simultaneously modulate various cell types involved in these events. Briefly, rapamycin is encapsulated in self-assembled micelles that are consisted of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive and fibrin-binding polymers to achieve micelle retention and controlled drug release within the ischemic lesion. Neuron survival is reinforced by the combination of micelle facilitated ROS elimination and antistress signaling pathway interference under ischemia conditions. In vivo results demonstrate an overall remodeling of neurovascular unit through micelle polarized  microglia repair and blood-brain  preservation, leading to enhanced neuroprotection and blood perfusion. This strategy gives a proof of concept that neurovascular units can serve as an integrated target for ischemic stroke treatment with nanomedicines.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Experiment 1, the time course of mTOR activation in the cortex following SAH. Experiment 2, the role of mTOR in SAH-induced EBI. Adult SD rats were divided into four groups: sham group (n=18), SAH+vehicle group (n=18), SAH+rapamycin group (n=18), SAH+AZD8055 group (n=18). Experiment 3, we incubated enriched microglia with OxyHb. Rapamycin and AZD8055 were also used to demonstrate the mTOR's role on microglial polarization in vitro. The phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its substrates were significantly increased and peaked at 24h after SAH. Rapamycin or AZD8055 markedly decreased the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its substrates and the activation of microglia in vivo, and promoted the microglial polarization from M1 phenotype to  phenotype. In addition, administration of rapamycin and AZD8055 following SAH significantly ameliorated EBI, including neuronal apoptosis, neuronal necrosis, brain edema and blood-brain  permeability. Our findings suggested that the rapamycin and AZD8055 could attenuate the development of EBI in this SAH model, possibly through inhibiting the activation of microglia by mTOR pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the rate gammaopt, associated with the flipping of conformational states of DBDs beyond which the maximum search efficiency of DBPs is achieved, varies with the one-dimensional sliding length L as gammaopt proportional, L(-2) and with the number of roadblock protein molecules present on the same DNA m as gammaopt proportional, .

Microglial/macrophage activation/polarization was assessed by flow cytometry, Western blot, RT-qPCR, and ELISA. Neuronal and EC survival was measured by TUNEL, flow cytometry, MTT and LDH assays. Transmission electron microscopy, EB extravasation, brain water content, TEER measurement and Western blot were used to detect blood-brain  (BBB) integrity and . Interestingly, NOSH-NBP significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume and ameliorated neurological deficit, with superior effects compared with NO-NBP and/or HS-NBP in mice after tMCAO. Both NO and HS-releasing groups contributed to protection by NOSH-NBP. Additionally, NOSH-NBP decreased neuronal death and attenuated BBB dysfunction in tMCAO-treated mice. Furthermore, NOSH-NBP promoted microglia/macrophage switch from an inflammatory M1 phenotype to the protective  phenotype  and . Moreover, the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome were involved in the inhibitory effects of NOSH-NBP on M1 polarization, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma signaling contributed to NOSH-NBP induced  polarization.

We tested the neurorestorative effects of delayed human umbilical cord blood cell (HUCBC) treatment of stroke in type-2 diabetes (T2DM). db/db-T2DM and db/+-non-DM mice were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) and were treated 3 days after dMCAo with: (a) non-DM + Phosphate buffered saline (PBS); (b) T2DM + PBS; (c) T2DM + naïve-HUCBC; (d) T2DM + miR-126(-/-) HUCBC. Functional evaluation, vascular and white-matter changes, neuroinflammation, and miR-126 effects were measured in vivo and in vitro. T2DM mice exhibited significantly decreased serum and brain tissue miR-126 expression compared with non-DM mice. T2DM + HUCBC mice exhibited increased miR-126 expression, increased tight junction protein expression, axon/myelin, vascular density, and -macrophage polarization. However, decreased blood-brain  leakage, brain hemorrhage, and miR-126 targeted gene vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 expression in the ischemic brain as well as improved functional outcome were present in HUCBC-treated T2DM mice compared with control T2DM mice. MiR-126(-/-) HUCBC-treatment abolished the benefits of naïve-HUCBC-treatment in T2DM stroke mice. In vitro, knock-in of miR-126 in primary cultured brain endothelial cells (BECs) or treatment of BECs with naïve-HUCBCs significantly increased capillary-like tube formation, and increased axonal outgrowth in primary cultured cortical neurons; whereas treatment of BECs or cortical neurons with miR-126(-/-) HUCBC attenuated HUCBC-treatment-induced capillary tube formation and axonal outgrowth.

An EMS-mutagenized population was generated using common wheat cv. SM126 consisting of 10,600  plants. One Wx-A1 null mutant was identified through analyses of 390 grains produced from 130  plants using electrophoresis analyses. The Wx-A1 sequences of parental line SM126 and -31 mutant were determined as 2781 bp, and there was only one SNP mutation between them. The SNP was a mutation from G to A at nucleotide sequence position 2168 bp (G2168A) downstream of the start codon which was located at the splicing site within the eighth intron. All 52 cDNA transcripts were found to be incorrectly spliced and can be summarized as five types of variations. The deletion of the exon and the exclusion of intron were structural features in abnormal splicing RNA. Together with the prediction of potential splice regulatory motifs, the mutation G2168A happened within the 5' splice site of the eighth intron and destroyed the splice donor site from GU to AU, which may have brought about a  against correct RNA splice, and generated abnormal mRNA, which was the mechanism of the inactivation of Wx-A1 in -31. The lack of Wx-A1 has resulted in changes in starch properties in the -31 mutant, with the reduction in amylose and starch contents. The increased grains hardness was observed in -31, which may be related to the lower expression level of Pinb-D1 gene.

For less-fit patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies frequently affecting the central nervous system, we designed a radiation-free regimen with fludarabine (25 mg//day on days -6 to -4), carmustine (400 mg/ on day -6), and thiotepa (5 mg/kg twice daily on days -5 and -4), all of which readily penetrate the blood-brain  and have potent antileukemic and lymphotoxic activity. Here we present a series of 30 consecutive patients with high-risk or relapsed disease who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with this protocol. The median patient age was 60 years (range, 42-70 years), and the median follow-up was 968 days (range, 58-1989 days). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and alemtuzumab (10-20 mg). At 2 years, overall survival was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-71%), event-free survival was 39% (95% CI, 22%-57%), cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 30% (95% CI, 17%-52%), and treatment-related mortality was 31% (95% CI, 18%-53%). Neurologic toxicity is a concern, especially in older and heavily pretreated patients. Our experience indicates the feasibility of this regimen as an alternative to total body irradiation and a potentially curative option for less-fit patients who need a highly central nervous system-active conditioning.Copyright © 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Amyloid β (Aβ), a critical cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), promotes M1 microglial polarization, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal death.  microglia play important roles in anti-inflammatory effects, Aβ clearance, and memory recovery in AD. Therefore, increasing of  microglia is expected to recover from AD. We previously found that naringenin, a blood-brain  penetrating compound, decreased Aβ deposits and recovers memory  in transgenic AD model mice. Naringenin reportedly showed anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we aim to investigate potential effects of naringenin on microglial polarization and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Aβ reduction. Primary cultured cortical microglia were treated with Aβ , following administration of naringenin. Naringenin remarkably promoted  microglia polarization and inhibited Aβ -induced M1 microglia activation. Because microglia reportedly played a critical role in cerebral Aβ clearance through Aβ degradation enzymes after phagocytosis, we investigated the expression of Aβ degradation enzymes, such as neprilysin and insulin degradation enzyme. After naringenin treatment, these Aβ degradation enzymes were downregulated in M1 microglia and upregulated in  microglia. Taken together, our results showed that naringenin increased Aβ degradation enzymes in  microglia, probably leading to Aβ plaque reduction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20703311>The combination of immunosuppression and carrier cells significantly enhances the efficacy of oncolytic poxvirus in the pre-immunized host.</a></h2><p>Pre-existing antipoxvirus immunity in cancer patients presents a severe  to poxvirus-mediated oncolytic virotherapy. We have explored strategies of immunosuppression (IS) and/or immune evasion for efficient delivery of an oncolytic double-deleted vaccinia virus (vvDD) to tumors in the pre-immunized mice. Transient IS using immunosuppressive drugs, including tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone sodium succinate, have been used successfully in organ transplantation. This drug cocktail alone did not enhance viral recovery from subcutaneous tumor after systemic viral delivery. Using B-cell knockout mice, we confirmed that the neutralizing antibodies had a significant role in preventing poxvirus infection. Using a MC38 peritoneal carcinomatosis model, we found that the combination of IS and tumor cells as carriers led to the most effective viral delivery, viral replication and viral spread inside the tumor mass. We found that our immunosuppressive drug cocktail facilitated recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and conversion into an immunosuppressive  phenotype (interleukin (IL)-10(hi)/IL-12(low)) in the tumor microenvironment. A combination of IS and carrier cells led to significantly prolonged survival in the tumor model.

Current strategies to overcome tumor resistance focus on tumor cell-intrinsic resistance. However, the extrinsic mechanisms, especially the tumor microenvironment, also play important roles in modulating the therapeutic response and resistance of the Ab. In this study, we demonstrate that tumor progression is highly associated with TAMs with immune-suppressive  phenotypes, and deletion of TAMs markedly enhanced the therapeutic effects of anti-Her2/neu Ab in a HER2/neu-dependent breast cancer cell TUBO model. Tumor local delivery of IL-21 can skew TAM polarization away from the  phenotype to a tumor-inhibiting M1 phenotype, which rapidly stimulates T cell responses against tumor and dramatically promotes the therapeutic effect of anti-Her2 Ab. Skewing of TAM polarization by IL-21 relies substantially on direct action of IL-21 on TAMs rather than stimulation of T and NK cells. Thus, our findings identify the abundant TAMs as a major extrinsic  for anti-Her2/neu Ab therapy and present a novel approach to combat this extrinsic resistance by tumor local delivery of IL-21 to skew TAM polarization. This study offers a therapeutic strategy to modulate the tumor microenvironment to overcome tumor-extrinsic resistance.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328743>Acetylcholine-Atropine Interactions: Paradoxical Effects on Atrial Fibrillation Inducibility.</a></h2><p>Atropine (ATr) is well known as a cholinergic antagonist, however, at low concentrations ATr could paradoxically accentuate the parasympathetic actions of acetylcholine (ACh). In 22 pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, via a left and right thoracotomy, a leak-proof  was attached to isolate the atrial appendages (AAs) from the rest of the atria. In group 1 (Ach+ATr+Ach), ACh, 100 mM, was placed on the AA followed by the application of ATr, 2 mg/mL. The average atrial fibrillation (AF) duration was 17 ± 7 minutes.

Despite many previous experimental and computational studies, the mechanism of the activating process in which proton permeation acidifies the virion to release the viral RNA and core proteins is not well understood. Herein the AM2 proton permeation process has been systematically characterized using multiscale computer simulations, including quantum, classical, and reactive molecular dynamics methods. We report, to our knowledge, the first complete free-energy profiles for proton transport through the entire AM2 transmembrane domain at various pH values, including explicit treatment of excess proton charge delocalization and shuttling through the His37 tetrad. The free-energy profiles reveal that the excess proton must overcome a large free-energy  to diffuse to the His37 tetrad, where it is stabilized in a deep minimum reflecting the delocalization of the excess charge among the histidines and the cost of shuttling the proton past them. At lower pH values the His37 tetrad has a larger total charge that increases the channel width, hydration, and solvent dynamics, in agreement with recent 2D-IR spectroscopic studies. The proton transport  becomes smaller, despite the increased charge repulsion, due to backbone expansion and the more dynamic pore water molecules. The calculated conductances are in quantitative agreement with recent experimental measurements. In addition, the free-energy profiles and conductances for proton transport in several mutants provide insights for explaining our findings and those of previous experimental mutagenesis studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27788150>Calciotropic and Phosphaturic Hormones in End-Stage Heart Failure Patients Supported by a Left-Ventricular Assist Device.</a></h2><p>Calcium and phosphate are central for myocardial contractility and energy metabolism, and low levels of the calciotropic hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), as well as high levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, are independently associated with poor clinical outcome in heart failure (HF) patients. We therefore aimed to investigate the postoperative time course of the aforementioned hormones in HF patients supported with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant.For the present study, stored biobank plasma samples of 69 patients, collected before LVAD implantation (t0) and 12 days (t1), 30 days (t2), 83 days (t3), and 300 days (t4) post-intervention, were used to measure circulating FGF-23, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), 1,25(OH)2D, and kidney function.Most patients were male and had baseline INTERMACS levels and cardiac index values ≤ 3 and ≤ 2.7 L/min/, respectively. There were significant time effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), FGF-23 and 1,25(OH)2D, but not on PTH or 25OHD. Notably, eGFR values increased and FGF-23 levels decreased only transiently, whereas 1,25(OH)2D increased continuously until t4. The rise in 1,25(OH)2D was largely influenced by those patients who survived the first post-implant year, and was not seen in non-survivors. Variations in 1,25(OH)2D levels could only partly be explained by eGFR values or FGF-23, 25OHD, and PTH levels (multiple R2 = 0.305;P<0.001).The present study indicates that LVAD implantation has only transient effects on circulating FGF-23 levels, but is associated with a continuous increase in circulating 1,25(OH)2D levels, especially in survivors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30305328>Androgen and Androgen Receptor as Enhancers of  Macrophage Polarization in Allergic Lung Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Allergic asthma is a disease initiated by a breach of the lung mucosal  and an inappropriate Th2 inflammatory immune response that results in  polarization of alveolar macrophages (AM). The number of  macrophages in the airway correlates with asthma severity in humans. Sex differences in asthma suggest that sex hormones modify lung inflammation and macrophage polarization. Asthmatic women have more  macrophages than asthmatic men and androgens have been used as an experimental asthma treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that although androgen (dihydrotestosterone) reconstitution of castrated mice reduced lung inflammation in a mouse model of allergic lung inflammation, it enhanced  polarization of AM. This indicates a cell-specific role for androgens. Dihydrotestosterone also enhanced IL-4-stimulated  macrophage polarization in vitro. Using mice lacking androgen receptor (AR) in monocytes/macrophages (ARLysMCre), we found that male but not female mice exhibited less eosinophil recruitment and lung inflammation due to impaired  polarization. There was a reduction in eosinophil-recruiting chemokines and IL-5 in AR-deficient AM. These data reveal an unexpected and novel role for androgen/AR in promoting  macrophage polarization. Our findings are also important for understanding pathology in diseases promoted by  macrophages and androgens, such as asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prostate cancer, and for designing new approaches to treatment.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20863559>The healing of bony defects by cell-free collagen-based scaffolds compared to stem cell-seeded tissue engineered constructs.</a></h2><p>One of the key challenges in tissue engineering is to understand the host response to scaffolds and engineered constructs. We present a study in which two collagen-based scaffolds developed for bone repair: a collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) and biomimetic collagen-calcium phosphate (CCP) scaffold, are evaluated in rat cranial defects, both cell-free and when cultured with MSCs prior to implantation. The results demonstrate that both cell-free scaffolds showed excellent healing relative to the empty defect controls and somewhat surprisingly, to the tissue engineered (MSC-seeded) constructs. Immunological analysis of the healing response showed higher M1 macrophage activity in the cell-seeded scaffolds. However, when the  macrophage response was analysed, both groups (MSC-seeded and non-seeded scaffolds) showed significant activity of these cells which are associated with an immunomodulatory and tissue remodelling response. Interestingly, the location of this response was confined to the construct periphery, where a capsule had formed, in the MSC-seeded groups as opposed to areas of new bone formation in the non-seeded groups. This suggests that matrix deposited by MSCs during in vitro culture may adversely affect healing by acting as a  to macrophage-led remodelling when implanted in vivo.

We investigated the neurorestorative effects and mechanisms of stroke treatment with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats.Adult male Wistar rats were induced with T2DM, subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated via tail-vein injection with (1) PBS (n=8) and (2) hMSCs (n=10; 5×10) at 3 days after MCAo.In T2DM rats, hMSCs administered at 3 days after MCAo significantly improves neurological  without affecting blood glucose, infarct volume, and incidence of brain hemorrhage in comparison to T2DM-MCAo PBS-treated rats. Delayed hMSC treatment of T2DM stroke significantly improves blood-brain  integrity, increases vascular and arterial density and cerebral vascular perfusion, and promotes neuroblast cell migration and white matter remodeling as indicated by increased doublecortin, axon, myelin, and neurofilament density, respectively. Delayed hMSC treatment significantly increases platelet-derived growth factor expression in the ischemic brain, decreases proinflammatory M1 macrophage and increases anti-inflammatory  macrophage compared to PBS-treated T2DM-MCAo rats. In vitro data show that hMSCs increase subventricular zone explant cell migration and primary cortical neuron neurite outgrowth, whereas inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor decreases hMSC-induced subventricular zone cell migration and axonal outgrowth.In T2DM stroke rats, delayed hMSC treatment significantly improves neurological functional outcome and increases neurorestorative effects and  macrophage polarization.

A total of 480 one-day-old Cherry Valley ducks were randomly divided into 4 dietary treatments, which each had 12 replicates; therefore, each replicate consisted of 10 ducks. Experimental diets included the basal diet supplemented with ZnSO4 (control group) and 3 different treatments of specific surface area micronized ZnO, in which the specific surface area was either 11.30 /g (S-mZnO), 20.90 /g (M-mZnO), or 34.02 /g (L-mZnO). The amount of Zn extra supplementation in the 4 diets was 120 mg/kg of diet. The experiment lasted for 35 D. The results showed that supplementation of M-mZnO significantly increased (P < 0.05) the BW (35 D), the BW gain (14 to 35 and 1 to 35 D), the jejunal crypt depth, and mRNA expression of zonula occludens-3, mucin 2, and secretory immunoglobulin A of ducks, while the feed-to-gain ratio (14 to 35 and 1 to 35 D) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) when compared to the control and the other 2 supplementation groups.

Microglia colonize the central nervous system (CNS) in utero and play essential roles in brain development. Once neural development is completed, microglia  as the resident innate immune cells of the CNS by surveying their microenvironment and becoming activated when the CNS is challenged by infection, injury, or disease. Despite the traditional view of microglia as being destructive in neurological diseases, recent studies have shown that microglia maintain CNS homeostasis and protect the CNS under various pathological conditions. Microglia can be prophylactically activated by modeling infection with systemic lipopolysaccharide injections and these activated microglia can protect the brain from traumatic injury through modulation of neuronal synapses. Microglia can also protect the CNS by promoting neurogenesis, clearing debris, and suppressing inflammation in diseases such as stroke, autism, and Alzheimer's.

Among the two classes of FDA-approved antiviral drugs, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, are currently the only choice for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. Due to the antigenic drift and antigenic shift, it will only be a matter of time before influenza viruses become completely resistant to these NA inhibitors. In pursuing the next generation of antiviral drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to those of the NA inhibitors, we have identified a natural product, cyclosporine A (CsA) (1), as a desired drug candidate. In this study, we discovered that CsA (1) and its analogs have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple influenza A and B strains, including strains that are resistant to either NA or  inhibitors or both. Moreover, CsA (1) displays a high in vitro genetic  of drug resistance than oseltamivir carboxylate Mechanistic studies revealed that CsA (1) acts at the intermediate step of viral replication post viral fusion. Its antiviral mechanism is independent of inhibiting the isomerase activity of cyclophilin A (CypA), and CsA (1) has no effect on the viral polymerase activity The potent antiviral efficacy of CsA (1), coupled with the high in vitro genetic  of drug resistance and novel mechanism of action, renders CsA (1) a promising anti-influenza drug candidate for further development.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These granulomas consist of highly differentiated mononuclear phagocytes--epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs)--surrounded by a proinflammatory infiltrate. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an inflammatory cytokine that is constitutively expressed in  tissues such as skin and lung and up-regulated in inflammation. Because sarcoidosis occurs most frequently in lung and skin, we studied the expression of this cytokine by immunohistochemistry in these tissues from patients with sarcoidosis, with foreign body granulomas, with other granulomatous diseases, and in corresponding normal tissues. We identified nuclear IL-33 staining of epithelioid cells and MNGCs in biopsies of skin (18/25 patients, 72%) and lung (10/19 patients, 53%) sarcoidosis. In contrast, sarcoidal granulomas in lymph nodes did not show IL-33 expression. Other granulomatous diseases showed only occasional and weak IL-33 expression. In sarcoidosis, we found a strong correlation between IL-33 expression and systemic disease, presence of MNGCs, and an -like macrophage phenotype as assessed by CD163 staining. Therefore, we propose that IL-33 plays a critical role in pathogenesis and disease progression of sarcoidosis. Because IL-33 is less commonly and only weakly expressed in other granulomatous diseases, the detection of IL-33 might serve as an adjunctive diagnostic marker. IL-33 expression in sarcoidosis seems to be dependent on the specific tissue microenvironment of sarcoidal granulomas and represents a novel biomarker for systemic involvement.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Further experiments revealed that EndMT induced by CCL-4 was reversed by treatment with CCR-5 antagonist and the RNA-mediated knockdown of TGF-β. On the whole, the data of the present study suggest that M1-FCs induce EndMT by upregulating CCL-4, and increase endothelial permeability and monocyte adhesion. These data may help to elucidate the important role of EndMT in the development of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339173>Deoxycholic acid disrupts the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet, which leads to an increased level of deoxycholic acid (DCA) in the intestine, is a major environmental factor in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of  macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19095760>Relationship between cerebrospinal fluid visfatin (PBEF/Nampt) levels and adiposity in humans.</a></h2><p>Observations of elevated circulating concentrations of visfatin (PBEF/Nampt) in obesity and diabetes suggest that this recently described adipokine is involved in the regulation of body weight and metabolism. We examined in humans whether visfatin is found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if so, how CSF visfatin concentrations relate to adiposity and metabolic parameters.We measured visfatin concentrations in the plasma and CSF of 38 subjects (18 men and 20 women; age 19-80 years) with a wide range of body weight (BMI 16.24-38.10 kg/). In addition, anthropometric parameters and endocrine markers were assessed. Bivariate correlation coefficients were determined and stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to detect associations of CSF and plasma visfatin levels with relevant parameters.Plasma visfatin levels increased with rising BMI (P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (P < 0.0001). In contrast, CSF visfatin levels decreased with increasing plasma visfatin concentrations (P < 0.03), BMI (P < 0.001), body fat mass (P < 0.0001), and insulin resistance (P < 0.05). Body fat was the only factor independently associated with CSF visfatin, explaining 58% of the variation of CSF visfatin levels (P < 0.0001). Neither plasma (P > 0.13) nor CSF (P > 0.61) visfatin concentrations differed between men and women.Our data indicate that visfatin concentrations in human CSF decrease with rising body fat, supporting the assumption that visfatin transport across the blood-brain  is impaired in obesity and that central nervous visfatin insufficiency or resistance are linked to pathogenetic mechanisms of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30498493>Hofbauer Cells: Their Role in Healthy and Complicated Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Hofbauer cells are placental villous macrophages of fetal origin that are present throughout pregnancy. Although Hofbauer cell populations are antigenically and morphologically heterogeneous, their epigenetic, antigenic, and functional profiles most closely resemble alternatively activated macrophages or what are referred to as M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d polarity subtypes. Consistent with an -like profile, these cells play an important role in placental development including vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. During placental inflammation Hofbauer cells may produce pro-inflammatory cytokines or mediators that damage the villous cell , and induce fibrotic responses within the villi as a continuum of chronic inflammation. However, to date, there is no evidence that Hofbauer cells become classically activated or adopt an M1 polarity phenotype that is able to kill microbes. To the contrary, their predominant  like qualities may be why these cells are ineffective in controlling most TORCH infections. Moreover, Hofbauer cells may contribute to vertical transmission of various pathogens to the fetus since they can harbor live virus and serve as reservoirs within the placenta. The goal of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the role of Hofbauer cells in normal and complicated pregnancies that involve immunologic disorders, inflammation, and/or infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26180083>Serum exosomes and cytokines promote a T-helper cell type 2 environment in the peripheral blood of glioblastoma patients.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive infiltrative brain tumor with a particularly poor prognosis that is characterized by microvascular proliferation, necrotic tissue, and significant infiltration of -like monocytes. Compromised   in tumor vasculature might be expected to permit communication between the tumor microenvironment and peripheral blood.To ascertain whether tumor-derived vesicles and/or factors might reach the bloodstream and what effects these molecules have on the peripheral compartment, we analyzed blood samples collected from primary GBM patients.Notably, a significant number of patient sera samples contained tumor exosome-reactive immunoglobulin (Ig)G2 and IgG4 antibody isotypes, which are consistent with Th2 immunity. -like monocytes expressing CD14+ and CD163+, another indicator of Th2 bias, are elevated in GBM patient blood and associated with high serum concentrations of colony-stimulating factor 2 and 3, as well as interleukin-2, -4, and -13, the latter 2 cytokines being hallmarks of Th2 immunity. GBM patient sera samples induce high levels of CD163 expression when added to normal monocytes, providing mechanistic evidence of a basis for Th2 bias. Fractionation of GBM patient sera into samples enriched for exosomes or soluble factors proved that both fractions are capable of inducing CD163 expression in normal monocytes.The results of the current study indicate a Th2 bias in the periphery of GBM patients, likely as a result of products elaborated by the tumor. Consequentially, through immune modulation these brain tumors exert systemic effects beyond the confines of the CNS.© The Author(s) 2015.

Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis. Deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal microbiota and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal microbiota was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal , gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal microbiota from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited  phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal microbiota transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407575>Anti-inflammatory effects of anisalcohol on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia via selective modulation of microglia polarization and down-regulation of NF-κB p65 and JNK activation.</a></h2><p>Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. The inhibition of inflammation appears to be a potential therapeutic strategy for neuro-inflammatory injury after ischemic stroke. In response to cerebral ischemia, resident microglia and infiltrated macrophages from the damaged blood-brain  are activated. Microglia activation appears to be a double-edged sword. Activated microglia migrate to the damaged neuron, change their phenotype to M1 or , and become involved in nerve damage and repair. M1 phenotype microglia express multiple inflammatory factors to exacerbate secondary brain injury, while those of  phenotype release anti-inflammatory factors to promote brain recovery after ischemic stroke. Therefore, the regulation of microglia M1/ phenotype after ischemic stroke is crucial for brain repair. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of anisalcohol (p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, PMBA), a phenolic compound from Gastrodia elata Blume, which has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemic injury in rodents. However, no studies have specifically addressed whether PMBA can selectively modulate microglia polarization. In this study, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia were used to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of PMBA. The results revealed that PMBA significantly reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumour necrosis factor α, prostaglandin E, and nitric oxide, without causing cell toxicity. In addition, it increased anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β. Phenotypic analysis of LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia showed that PMBA significantly down-regulated the expression of the M1 marker CD16/32 and up-regulated that of the  marker CD206. Moreover, PMBA suppressed NF-κB activation and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PMBA can inhibit M1 transformation and promote  transformation of microglia, thus attenuating the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The modulation of microglia M1/ polarization may involve multiple mechanisms, mainly, the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK activation. These findings suggest that PMBA acts as an anti-inflammatory factor and is a possible therapeutic candidate for diseases such as ischemic stroke, where inflammation is a central hallmark.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is characterized by parasite sequestration, a breakdown of the blood-brain , and a strong inflammation in the brain. We investigated the role of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), an important modulator of neuroinflammatory responses, in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Strikingly, mice with a deletion of the CB2-encoding gene (Cnr2(-/-)) inoculated with Plasmodium berghei ANKA erythrocytes exhibited enhanced survival and a diminished blood-brain  disruption. Therapeutic application of a specific CB2 antagonist also conferred increased ECM resistance in wild type mice. Hematopoietic derived immune cells were responsible for the enhanced protection in bone marrow (BM) chimeric Cnr2(-/-) mice. Mixed BM chimeras further revealed that CB2-expressing cells contributed to ECM development. A heterogeneous CD11b(+) cell population, containing macrophages and neutrophils, expanded in the Cnr2(-/-) spleen after infection and expressed macrophage mannose receptors, arginase-1 activity, and IL-10. Also in the Cnr2(-/-) brain, CD11b(+) cells that expressed selected anti-inflammatory markers accumulated, and expression of inflammatory mediators IFN-γ and TNF-α was reduced. Finally, the  macrophage chemokine CCL17 was identified as an essential factor for enhanced survival in the absence of CB2, because CCL17 × Cnr2 double-deficient mice were fully susceptible to ECM. Thus, targeting CB2 may be promising for the development of alternative treatment regimes of ECM.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29776446>Valproic acid attenuates traumatic spinal cord injury-induced inflammation via STAT1 and NF-κB pathway dependent of HDAC3.</a></h2><p>Microglial polarization with M1/ phenotype shifts and the subsequent neuroinflammatory responses are vital contributing factors for spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced secondary injury. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is considered the central transcription factor of inflammatory mediators, which plays a crucial role in microglial activation. Lysine acetylation of STAT1 seems necessary for NF-kB pathway activity, as it is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). There have been no studies that have explained if HDAC inhibition by valproic acid (VPA) affects the NF-κB pathway via acetylation of STAT1 dependent of HDAC activity in the microglia-mediated central inflammation following SCI. We investigated the potential molecular mechanisms that focus on the phenotypic transition of microglia and the STAT1-mediated NF-κB acetylation after a VPA treatment.The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotion scale, the inclined plane test, the blood-spinal cord , and Nissl staining were employed to determine the neuroprotective effects of VPA treatment after SCI. Assessment of microglia polarization and pro-inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon (INF)-γ was used to evaluate the neuroinflammatory responses and the anti-inflammatory effects of VPA treatment. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were used to detect HDAC3 nuclear translocation, activity, and NF-κB signaling pathway activation to evaluate the effects of VPA treatment. The impact of STAT1 acetylation on NF-kB pathway and the interaction between STAT1 and NF-kB were assessed to evaluate anti-inflammation effects of VPA treatment and also whether these effects were dependent on a STAT1/NF-κB pathway to gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of the neuroinflammatory response after SCI.The results showed that the VPA treatment promoted the phenotypic shift of microglia from M1 to  phenotype and inhibited microglial activation, thus reducing the SCI-induced inflammatory factors. The VPA treatment upregulation of the acetylation of STAT1/NF-κB pathway was likely caused by the HDAC3 translocation to the nucleus and activity. These results indicated that the treatment with the VPA suppressed the expression and the activity of HDAC3 and enhanced STAT1, as well as NF-κB p65 acetylation following a SCI. The acetylation status of NF-kB p65 and the complex with NF-κB p65 and STAT1 inhibited the NF-kB p65 transcriptional activity and attenuated the microglia-mediated central inflammatory response following SCI.These results suggested that the VPA treatment attenuated the inflammatory response by modulating microglia polarization through STAT1-mediated acetylation of the NF-κB pathway, dependent of HDAC3 activity. These effects led to neuroprotective effects following SCI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436428>Urothelial  Deficits, Suburothelial Inflammation and Altered Sensory Protein Expression in Detrusor Underactivity.</a></h2><p>The pathophysiology of detrusor underactivity remains unclear and impaired bladder afferent  is considered one of the important etiologies. We investigated urothelial  deficits, suburothelial inflammation and sensory proteins expressed in the bladder mucosa of patients with detrusor underactivity.Bladder mucosa biopsies were performed in 34 patients with videourodynamic proven detrusor underactivity as the study group and in 10 women with stress urinary incontinence as controls. The expression of zona occuldens-1, E-cadherin in the urothelium, tryptase and apoptosis levels in the suburothelium, β3-adrenoceptor,  and M3 muscarinic receptors, P2X3 receptor, and inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were compared between study patients and controls.Study patients included 22 women and 12 men with a mean ± SD age of 56.3 ± 19.7 years, of whom 15 had a history of diabetes. Study patients had significantly lower E-cadherin expression, and a higher number of mast cells and apoptotic cells than controls. Additionally, lower expression of  and M3 muscarinic receptors, P2X3 receptors and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was detected in study patients but higher expression of β3-adrenoceptor. In study patients a positive correlation was noted between tryptase and apoptosis levels (r = 0.527) and between the expression of  muscarinic receptor and P2X3 receptor (r = 0.403). However, β3-adrenoceptor expression negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression (r = -0.490, each p <0.05).Urothelial dysfunction, increased suburothelial inflammation and altered sensory protein expressions in bladder mucosa were prominent in patients with detrusor underactivity. Impaired urothelial signaling and sensory transduction pathways appear to reflect the pathophysiology of detrusor underactivity.Copyright Â© 2017 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ileal bacteria in modulating local and systemic immune responses in AS.Ileal biopsies were obtained from 50 HLA-B27 patients with AS and 20 normal subjects. Silver stain was used to visualise bacteria. Ileal expression of tight and adherens junction proteins was investigated by TaqMan real-time (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LPS-BP), intestinal fatty acid-BP (iFABP) and zonulin were assayed by ELISA. Monocyte immunological functions were studied in in vitro experiments. In addition the effects of antibiotics on tight junctions in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic (TG) rats were assessed.Adherent and invasive bacteria were observed in the gut of patients with AS with the bacterial scores significantly correlated with gut inflammation. Impairment of the gut vascular barrier (GVB) was also present in AS, accompanied by significant upregulation of zonulin, and associated with high serum levels of LPS, LPS-BP, iFABP and zonulin. In in vitro studies zonulin altered endothelial tight junctions while its epithelial release was modulated by isolated AS ileal bacteria. AS circulating monocytes displayed an anergic phenotype partially restored by ex vivo stimulation with LPS+sCD14 and their stimulation with recombinant zonulin induced a clear  phenotype. Antibiotics restored tight junction function in HLA-B27 TG rats.Bacterial ileitis, increased zonulin expression and damaged intestinal mucosal barrier and GVB, characterises the gut of patients with AS and are associated with increased blood levels of zonulin, and bacterial products. Bacterial products and zonulin influence monocyte behaviour.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The major goal of this work was to assess whether MSNs can penetrate the blood-brain  in a glioblastoma rat model. Synthesized MSNs nanomaterials were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, measurements of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy. For the detection of the MSNs by MR and for biodistribution studies MSNs were labeled with zero-valent Fe. Subsequent magnetometry and nonlinear-longitudinal-response- (NLR-) measurements confirmed the MR negative contrast enhancement properties of the nanoparticles. After incubation of different tumor (C6 glioma, U87 glioma, K562 erythroleukemia, HeLa cervix carcinoma) and normal cells such as fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) MSNs rapidly get internalized into the cytosol. Intracellular residing MSNs result in an enhanced cytotoxicity as Fe(0) @ MCM-41 promote the reactive oxygen species production. MRI and histological studies indicated an accumulation of intravenously injected Fe(0) @ MCM-41 MSNs in orthotopic C6 glioma model. Biodistribution studies with measurements of second harmonic of magnetization demonstrated an increased and dose-dependent retention of MSNs in tumor tissues.

LPS was unilaterally injected into the substantia nigra (SN) in the absence or presence of CAP or capsazepine (CZP, a TRPV1 antagonist). The SN tissues were prepared for immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, western blot analysis, blood-brain  (BBB) permeability evaluation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection. We found that CAP prevented the degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the LPS-lesioned SN. CAP shifted the proinflammatory M1 microglia/macrophage population to an anti-inflammatory  state as demonstrated by decreased expression of M1 markers (i.e., inducible nitric oxide synthase; iNOS and interleukin-6) and elevated expression of  markers (i.e., arginase 1 and CD206) in the SN. RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated decreased iNOS expression and increased arginase 1 expression in the CAP-treated LPS-lesioned SN. Peroxynitrate production, reactive oxygen species levels and oxidative damage were reduced in the CAP-treated LPS-lesioned SN. The beneficial effects of CAP were blocked by CZP, indicating TRPV1 involvement. The present data indicate that CAP regulated the M1 and  activation states of microglia/macrophage in the LPS-lesioned SN, which resulted in the survival of dopamine neurons. It is therefore likely that TRPV1 activation by CAP has therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases, that are associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, such as PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28351483>Surface modified nano-lipid drug conjugates of positive allosteric modulators of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Acetyl Cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as Donepezil, Rivastigmine and Galantamine are approved by US-FDA as first line drugs to treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their beneficial effects are attributed to their ability to elevate endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) at the M muscarinic receptor in the brain. However, their side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, loss of appetite and altered heart rate are related to non-specific activation of M-M muscarinic subtypes in various tissues. It is logical, therefore, to develop agonists with M receptor selectivity. Unfortunately, this is limited due to a high degree of orthosteric site homology among the receptor subtypes. In contrast, their allosteric sites are unique and, therefore, allow selective targeting using positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs of M receptors are devoid of agonist activity, however, when bound they enhance the binding affinity of orthosteric ligand, ACh. The major limitation of these PAMs is their bioavailability in the brain. In the current hypothesis, we propose surface modified nano-lipid drug conjugates (LDC-NPs) of PAMs of M receptors to improve their bioavailability in brain. When co-administered with AChE inhibitors they are expected to increase their efficacy and reduce their therapeutic dose and side effects.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the therapeutic window and anti-inflammatory effects of G-CSF in a rAION model have yet to be elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to determine the therapeutic window of G-CSF and investigate the mechanisms of G-CSF via regulation of optic nerve (ON) inflammation in a rAION model. Rats were treated with G-CSF on day 0, 1, 2 or 7 post-rAION induction for 5 consecutive days, and a control group were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Visual  was assessed by flash visual evoked potentials at 4 weeks post-rAION induction. The survival rate and apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells were determined by FluoroGold labeling and TUNEL assay, respectively. ON inflammation was evaluated by staining of ED1 and Iba1, and ON vascular permeability was determined by Evans Blue extravasation. The type of macrophage polarization was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were analyzed by western blotting. A therapeutic window during which G-CSF could rescue visual  and retinal ganglion cell survival was demonstrated at day 0 and day 1 post-infarct. Macrophage infiltration was reduced by 3.1- and 1.6-fold by G-CSF treatment starting on day 0 and 1 post-rAION induction, respectively, compared with the PBS-treated group (P<0.05). This was compatible with 3.3- and 1.7-fold reductions in ON vascular permeability after G-CSF treatment compared with PBS treatment (P<0.05). Microglial activation was increased by 3.8- and 3.2-fold in the early (beginning treatment at day 0 or 1) G-CSF-treated group compared with the PBS-treated group (P<0.05). Immediate (within 30 mins of infarct) treatment with G-CSF also induced  microglia/macrophage activation. The cytokine levels were lower in the group that received immediate G-CSF treatment compared to those in the later G-CSF treatment group (P<0.05). Early treatment with G-CSF stabilized the blood-ON  to reduce macrophage infiltration and induced  microglia/macrophage polarization to decrease the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in this rAION model.© 2016.

Here, we report the structural rearrangements underlying gating transitions in membrane-embedded GLIC, a prokaryotic homologue, using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We particularly probed the conformation of pore-lining second transmembrane segment () under conditions that favor the closed and the ligand-bound desensitized states. The spin label mobility, intersubunit spin-spin proximity, and the solvent-accessibility parameters in the two states clearly delineate the underlying protein motions within . Our results show that during activation the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes major changes involving an outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in the pore diameter, whereas the lower end of  remains relatively immobile. Most notably, during desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of  move closer to form a solvent-occluded  and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison with the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of  in the closed state.

We previously showed that the structural integrity of a glomerular endothelial glycocalyx is required to prevent albuminuria. Therefore we tested the potential of atrasentan to stabilize the endothelial glycocalyx in diabetic apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice in relation to its antialbuminuric effects. Treatment with atrasentan (7.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks reduced urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios by 26.0 ± 6.5% (P < 0.01) in apoE knockout (KO) mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes consuming an atherogenic diet, without changes in gross glomerular morphology, systemic blood pressure, and blood glucose concentration. Endothelial cationic ferritin surface coverage, investigated using large-scale digital transmission electron microscopy, revealed that atrasentan treatment increases glycocalyx coverage in diabetic apoE KO mice from 40.7 ± 3.2% to 81.0 ± 12.5% (P < 0.05). This restoration is accompanied by increased renal nitric oxide concentrations, reduced expression of glomerular heparanase, and a marked shift in the balance of M1 and  glomerular macrophages. In vitro experiments with endothelial cells exposed to laminar flow and cocultured with pericytes confirmed that atrasentan reduced endothelial heparanase expression and increased glycocalyx thickness in the presence of a diabetic milieu. Together these data point toward a role for the restoration of endothelial  and tissue homeostasis through the antialbuminuric effects of atrasentan, and they provide a mechanistic explanation for the clinical observations of reduced albuminuria with atrasentan in diabetic nephropathy.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

Based on previous studies showing that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus was neurotropic, induced CNS inflammation and a transient parkinsonism, we examined the neurotropic and inflammatory potential of the CA/09 H1N1 virus in mice. Following intranasal inoculation, we found no evidence for CA/09 H1N1 virus neurotropism in the enteric, peripheral or central nervous systems. We did, however, observe a robust increase in microglial activity in the brain characterized by an increase in the number of activated Iba-1-positive microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and the hippocampus, despite the absence of virus in the brain. qPCR analysis in SN tissue showed that the induction of microgliosis was preceded by reduced gene expression of the neurotrophic factors bdnf, and gdnf and increases in the immune modulatory chemokine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (ccl4). We also noted changes in the expression of transforming growth factor-1 (tgfβ1) in the SN starting at 7 days post-infection (dpi) that was sustained through 21 dpi, coupled with increases in arginase-1 (arg1) and csf1,  markers for microglia. Given that neuroinflammation contributes to generation and progression of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, these findings have significant implications as they highlight the possibility that influenza and perhaps other non-neurotropic viruses can initiate inflammatory signals via microglia activation in the brain and contribute to, but not necessarily be the primary cause of, neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27052416>Activated protein C protects against renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury, independent of its anticoagulant properties.</a></h2><p>Acute renal failure, a serious condition characterised by a drastic decline in renal , often follows ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) episodes.

C57BL/6j mice subjected to renal I/R were treated with intraperitoneally injected exogenous human APC, or two mutant forms of APC (200 µg/kg) which specifically lack anticoagulant or signalling properties. In a different experiment mice received specific monoclonal antibodies (20 mg/kg) that block the cytoprotective and/or anticoagulant properties of endogenous APC. Treatment with APC reduced tubular injury and enhanced renal  without altering the inflammatory response and did reduce renal fibrin deposition. Administration of APC mutant lacking anticoagulant properties reduced renal damage and enhanced renal . Blocking the anticoagulant and cytoprotective functions of endogenous APC resulted in elevated tubular damage and reduced tubular cell proliferation, however, without influencing renal  or the inflammatory response. Furthermore, blocking both the anticoagulant and cytoprotective effects of APC resulted in dramatic renal interstitial haemorrhage, indicative of impaired vascular integrity. Blocking only the anticoagulant  of APC did not result in interstitial bleeding. In conclusion, the renoprotective effect of APC during I/R is independent of its anticoagulant properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22068140>An evaluation of the skin stripping of wound dressing adhesives.</a></h2><p>This study looks at six different modern wound dressings to investigate how likely they are to cause skin stripping and impairment of the skin's  .Healthy volunteers had each dressing applied, removed and reapplied to the skin on their back over the study period of 15 days. Skin   was investigated using the amount of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and then related to the amount of skin stripping, investigated by measuring stained skin removal, the thickness of the stratum corneum after treatment, and the amount of skin attached to the removed dressings. General signs of trauma, such as skin dryness and erythema, were investigated by subjective and objective parameters.TEWL values measured on the untreated test area, as well as after application of Urgotul Trio, remained relatively unchanged and Mepilex Border decreased slightly (?1g//h), while all other dressings displayed an increased in TEWL: Allevyn Adhesive (5g//h), Versiva XC (14g//h), Comfeel Plus (22g//h) and Biatain (28g//h). By the end of the study, only the untreated area (mean 43% dye remaining), Mepilex Border (76%) and Urgotul Trio (34%) areas had visible dye remaining. It is interesting to note that the untreated site had a colour change, suggesting loss of stratum corneum, due to the shedding of skin cells from the surface. The increase in total skin colour for Comfeel Plus and Biatain after day 8 might be assigned to an increased redness due to erythema. All the dressings showed evidence of stratum corneum attached to the adhesive, except Mepilex Border, which appeared to be free of any attached stratum corneum.Overall the best performance in terms of skin protection and failure to cause skin trauma was found to be for Mepilex Border.This project was funded by a grant from Mölnlycke Healthcare Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29352300>5-aminosalicylic acid improves lipid profile in mice fed a high-fat cholesterol diet through its dual effects on intestinal PPARγ and PPARα.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with a series of metabolic complications, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR) that lack effective therapies. In recent years, intestinal inflammation has been suggested to contribute to obesity related metabolic syndrome and targeting gut inflammation with 5-ASA improves diet induced IR, however, its role in dyslipidemia is unknown and has never been explored. In the present study, we reported for the first time that administration of 5-ASA for 12 weeks significantly improved lipid profile by repressing plasma triglycerides and free cholesterol levels in mice fed high-fat cholesterol diet (HFC). In addition, liver lipids were significantly reduced by 5-ASA treatment in HFC-fed mice. Mechanistically, anti-inflammatory genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparγ) and  marker, such as Mrc1 and Ym1, were remarkably upregulated, while pro-inflammation gene monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) were downregulated in small intestine of mice treated by 5-ASA. Further, 5-ASA improved gastrointestinal  by increasing the expression of the tight junction marker ZO-1. 5-ASA also enhanced cholesterol translocation by elevating genes expression of Npc1l1 and Abcg5/8. Moreover, mice fed HFC 5-ASA expressed increased Pparα in small intestinal and its target genes  in lipid oxidation and hydrolysis were remarkable elevated. Taken together, we reported a novel role of 5-ASA which may serve as a therapy target intestinal inflammation induced dyslipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22569297>Alterations in the non-neuronal acetylcholine synthesis and release machinery in esophageal epithelium.</a></h2><p>A non-neuronal cholinergic system has been described in epithelial cells including that of the urinary bladder (urothelium) and the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus). Epithelial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of persistent pain conditions such as painful bladder syndrome as well as functional heartburn. For example, alterations in the ability to synthesize and release acetylcholine may contribute to changes in epithelial sensory and   associated with a number of functional genitourinary and intestinal disorders.We examined using immunoblot, acetylcholine (ACh)-synthesis and release components in cat esophageal mucosa and whether elements of these components are altered in a naturally occurring model of chronic idiopathic cystitis termed feline interstitial cystitis (FIC).We identified proteins involved in ACh synthesis and release (high affinity choline transporter, CHT1; ACh synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase ChAT and carnitine acetyltransferase CarAT; vesicular ACh transporter VAChT and the organic cation transporter isoforms 1-3 or OCT-1-3) in cat esophageal mucosa. Significant alterations in CHT, ChAT, VAChT and OCT-1 were detected in the esophageal mucosa from FIC cats. Changes in the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) and the junctional protein pan-cadherin were also noted.Taken together, these findings suggest that changes in the non-neuronal cholinergic system may contribute to alterations in cell-cell contacts and possibly communication with underlying cells that may contribute to changes in sensory  and visceral hyperalgesia in functional esophageal pain.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

They are foremost controllers of both innate and acquired immunity, healthy tissue homeostasis, vasculogenesis and congenital metabolism. Two hallmarks of macrophages are diversity and plasticity due to which they acquire a wobbling array of phenotypes. These phenotypes are appropriately synchronized responses to a variety of different stimuli from either the tissue microenvironment or - microbes or their products. Based on the phenotype, macrophages are classified into classically activated/(M1) and alternatively activated/() which are further sub-categorized into M2a, M2b, M2c and M2d based upon gene expression profiles. Macrophage phenotype metamorphosis is the regulating factor in initiation, progression, and termination of numerous inflammatory diseases. Several transcriptional factors and other factors controlling gene expression such as miRNAs contribute to the transformation of macrophages at different points in different diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of macrophage polarization and modulation of their phenotypes to adjust to the micro environmental conditions might provide us a great prospective for designing novel therapeutic strategy. In view of the above, this review summarises the activation of macrophages, the factors intricated in activation along with benefaction of macrophage polarization in response to microbial infections, pulmonary toxicity, lung injury and other inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dysplasia (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma and sepsis, along with the existing efforts to develop therapies targeting this facet of macrophage biology.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Morbidly obese patients may be at increased risk of delayed graft , higher postoperative complications, and inferior graft outcomes. Nevertheless, mortality on the waiting list remains significantly higher than after transplant. We have applied minimally invasive surgery to perform kidney transplant in individuals with body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m or greater. We compared our results to the national United Network of Organ Sharing database.The United Network of Organ Sharing registry was reviewed for adult living donor kidney transplant recipients with BMI of 40 kg/m or greater performed from September 2009 to December 2014. We compared transplants performed with robotic technique (RKT) versus patients performed with open surgery at all US centers including our own (open kidney transplant). Subgroup analysis in patients with BMI of 45 kg/m or greater was conducted. We compared outcomes including patient and graft survival, renal , and technical complications.Robotic kidney transplantation group had a significantly higher mean BMI overall. The 1-year patient and graft survival rates were similar between groups. Renal  was also similar at 6, 12, and 36 months. Thrombosis caused 1.3% of the graft losses in open kidney transplant and 0% in the RKT group. Interestingly, 52.8% of the overall experience in patients with BMI of 45 kg/m or greater was performed with the robotic technique.Robotic surgery offers similar patient and graft survivals with comparable renal  to open technique. Robotic kidney transplantation permits transplantation in extreme BMI categories without additional technical complications. Further studies are required to establish the role of RKT for obese candidates but preliminary data are encouraging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28746408>Microwave & magnetic proteomics of macrophages from patients with HIV-associated cognitive impairment.</a></h2><p>HIV-infected monocytes can infiltrate the blood brain  as differentiated macrophages to the central nervous system, becoming the primary source of viral and cellular neurotoxins. The final outcome is HIV-associated cognitive impairment (HACI), which remain prevalent today, possibly due to the longer life-span of the patients treated with combined anti-retroviral therapy. Our main goal was to characterize the proteome of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from HACI patients, and its association with their cognitive status, to find novel targets for therapy.MDM were isolated from the peripheral blood of 14 HIV-seropositive women characterized for neurocognitive , including: four normal cognition (NC), five asymptomatic (A), and five with cognitive impaired (CI). Proteins from macrophage lysates were isobaric-labeled with the microwave and magnetic () sample preparation method followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based protein identification and quantification. Differences in protein abundance across groups classified by HACI status were determined using analysis of variance.A total of 2,519 proteins were identified with 2 or more peptides and 28 proteins were quantified as differentially expressed. Statistical analysis revealed increased abundance of 17 proteins in patients with HACI (p<0.05), including several enzymes associated to the glucose metabolism. Western blot confirmed increased expression of 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and L-Plastin in A and CI patients over NC and HIV seronegatives.This is the first quantitative proteomics study exploring the changes in protein abundance of macrophages isolated from patients with HACI. Further studies are warranted to determine if these proteins may be target candidates for therapy development against HACI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064788>Polychlorinated biphenyls disrupt blood-brain  integrity and promote brain metastasis formation.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) comprise a ubiquitous class of toxic substances associated with carcinogenic and tumor-promoting effects as well as neurotoxic properties in the brain. However, the effects of PCBs on the development of tumor metastases are not fully understood.We evaluated the hypothesis that exposure to individual PCB congeners can facilitate the development of brain metastases in immunocompetent mice via the disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB).C57/Bl6 mice were exposed to individual PCBs by oral gavage, and 48 hr later they were injected with luciferase-labeled K1735  melanoma cells into the internal carotid artery. The development of metastatic nodules was monitored by bioluminescent imaging. In addition, we evaluated the functional permeability of the BBB by measuring permeability of sodium fluorescein across the brain microvessels. Expression and colocalization of tight junction (TJ) proteins were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy.Oral administration of coplanar PCB126, mono-ortho-substituted PCB118, and non-coplanar PCB153 (each at 150 micromol/kg body weight) differentially altered expression of the TJ proteins claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 in brain capillaries. These alterations were associated with increased permeability of the BBB. Most importantly, exposure to individual PCB congeners enhanced the rate of formation and progression of brain metastases of luciferase-tagged melanoma cells.Our results show for the first time that exposure to individual PCBs can facilitate the formation of bloodborne metastases via alterations of the integrity of the brain capillary endothelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262845>Single-cell profiling of human gliomas reveals macrophage ontogeny as a basis for regional differences in macrophage activation in the tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in gliomas and immunosuppressive TAMs are a  to emerging immunotherapies. It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue.We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated () genes in individual cells.We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285073>Development of an UPLC-MS/MS method for quantification of Avitinib (AC0010) and its five metabolites in human cerebrospinal fluid: Application to a study of the blood-brain  penetration rate of non-small cell lung cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Avitinib (AC0010) is a mutant-selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), designed to be a targeted therapeutic agent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR active and T790M resistant mutations. A rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of Avitinib and its five metabolites (M1, , M4, M7, MII-6) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The samples were purified by protein precipitation and separated on a BEH C column (2.1×50mm, 1.7μm).

Currently, there is no effective treatment to increase the survival rate or improve the quality of life after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in the subacute to chronic phases. Therefore, it is necessary to establish therapeutic strategies to facilitate functional recovery in patients with stroke during both phases. Cell-based therapies, using microglia and monocytes/macrophages preconditioned by optimal stimuli and/or any therapies targeting these cells, might be an ideal therapeutic strategy for managing stroke. Microglia and monocytes/macrophages polarize to the classic pro-inflammatory type (M1-like) or alternative protective type (-like) by optimal condition. Cell-based therapies using -like microglia and monocytes/macrophages might be protective therapeutic strategies against stroke for three reasons. First, -like microglia and monocytes/monocytes secrete protective remodeling factors, thus prompting neuronal network recovery via tissue (including neuronal) and vascular remodeling. Second, these cells could migrate to the injured hemisphere through the blood-brain  or choroid-plexus. Third, these cells could mitigate the extent of inflammation-induced injuries by suitable timing of therapeutic intervention. Although future translational studies are required, -like microglia and monocytes/macrophages therapies are attractive for managing stroke based on their protective functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22543156>Adipokines from local fat cells shape the macrophage compartment of the creeping fat in Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The creeping fat in Crohn's disease (CD) is infiltrated by macrophages; local adipokine levels are increased. This study aimed to link these observations to define a role for macrophages in the pathology of human CD.Human peripheral blood CD14 cells were polarised in vitro into M1 and  macrophages. The effects on adipokine receptors, phenotypic surface markers, cytokines and chemokines were assessed after treatment with leptin and adiponectin. Immunohistochemistry visualised macrophage subtypes in samples of mesenteric fat tissue from patients with CD. The chemotactic potential of secreted macrophage products was determined by T cell migration and chemokine production in vitro.Although both adipokines altered the phenotype and  of M1 and  macrophages,  macrophages were more susceptible. M1 responded to leptin by increased cytokine production, but the stronger effect was seen in  macrophages with high expression of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor α. Adiponectin exerted similar effects and led to upregulated mannose receptor expression by  macrophages. Large macrophage numbers within the mesenteric fat tissue of patients with CD comprise a unique infiltration predominantly of  macrophages, leading to an IL-10-rich environment. While leptin increased the potency of both subtypes to attract CD3 T cells, adiponectin only affected  macrophages.The adipocyte-dependent microenvironment within the creeping fat of patients with CD modulates the local macrophage compartment to a preference for the  subtype. The findings in this study with human cells suggest a protective role for the mesenteric fat in CD in terms of an enveloping  with the potential to limit intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27611738>Molecular epidemiology of Rotavirus A, causing acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations among children in Nha Trang, Vietnam, 2007-2008: Identification of rare G9P[19] and G10P[14] strains.</a></h2><p>Rotavirus A (RVA) causes acute diarrhea in children as well as animals. As part of a cross-sectional study of children less than 5 years of age hospitalized for acute diarrhea in Vietnam during a 15-month period (2007-2008), 322 (43.5%) of 741 fecal specimens contained RVA with 92% either G1P[8] or G3P[8]. This study was undertaken to further characterize strains that remained untypeable to complete the G and P genotypes of the 322 rotavirus-positive specimens. While 307 (95.3%) strains possessed the common human RVA genotypes: G1P[8] (45.0%), G2P[4] (2.8%), G3P[8] (46.9%), and G9P[8] (0.6%), sequencing of initially untypeable specimens revealed the presence of two unusual strains designated NT0073 and NT0082 possessing G9P[19] and G10P[14], respectively. The genotype constellation of NT0073 (G9-P[19]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1) and the phylogenetic trees suggested its origin as a porcine RVA strain causing diarrhea in a 24-month-old girl whereas the genotype constellation of NT0082 (G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2--A3-N2-T6-E2-H3) and the phylogenetic trees suggested its origin as an RVA strain of artiodactyl origin (such as cattle, sheep and goats) causing diarrhea in a 13-month-old boy. This study showed that RVA strains of animal host origin were not necessarily attenuated in humans. A hypothesis may be postulated that P[19] and P[14] VP4 spike proteins helped the virus to replicate in the human intestine but that efficient onward human-to-human spread after crossing the host species  may require the virus to obtain some additional features as there was no evidence of widespread transmission with the limited sampling performed over the study period.

Considering the differences from adult skin, the neonatal skin is more prone to damage by environmental factors; therefore, skin care regimens should be age adapted to ensure a good epidermal maturation. The effects of two different skin care practices were evaluated by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement in 94 newborns aged ≤ 10 days: group 1 (G1), newborns washed only with a cotton washcloth moistened with water; group 2 (G2), newborns washed with liquid baby cleansers and hydrated with moisturizers. These recordings were compared to TEWL baseline values of the same neonates and to adults' values.A prospective study was conducted in healthy full-term newborns, measuring TEWL with TEWAMETER® TM300. The areas tested were the volar forearm and the popliteal fossa.In G1 (52 subjects), TEWL mean values were 6.65 ± 2.81 SD (g//h) at volar forearm and 7.49 ± 2.47 SD (g//h) at popliteal fossa.

Here, we investigated the impacts of triterpenoid saponins isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS) on gut microbiome, mucosal environment, and the preventive effect on tumor growth. Six-week old ApcMin/+ mice and their wild-type littermates were fed either with vehicle or GpS daily for the duration of 8 weeks. The fecal microbiome was analyzed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Study showed that GpS treatment significantly reduced the number of intestinal polyps in a preventive mode. More importantly, GpS feeding strikingly reduced the sulfate-reducing bacteria lineage, which are known to produce hydrogen sulfide and contribute to damage the intestinal epithelium or even promote cancer progression. Meanwhile, GpS also boosted the beneficial microbes. In the gut  of the ApcMin/+ mice, GpS treatment increased Paneth and goblet cells, up-regulated E-cadherin and down-regulated N-cadherin. In addition, GpS decreased the pro-oncogenic β-catenin, p-Src and the p-STAT3. Furthermore, GpS might also improve the inflamed gut epithelium of the ApcMin/+ mice by upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, while downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18. Intriguingly, GpS markedly stimulated  and suppressed M1 macrophage markers, indicating that GpS altered mucosal cytokine profile in favor of the M1 to  macrophages switching, facilitating intestinal tissue repair. In conclusion, GpS might reverse the host's inflammatory phenotype by increasing beneficial bacteria, decreasing sulfate-reducing bacteria, and alleviating intestinal inflammatory gut environment, which might contribute to its cancer preventive effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25673840>Secreted ectodomain of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-9 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 promote recovery after rat spinal cord injury by altering macrophage polarity.</a></h2><p>Engrafted mesenchymal stem cells from human deciduous dental pulp (SHEDs) support recovery from neural insults via paracrine mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that the conditioned serum-free medium (CM) from SHEDs, administered intrathecally into rat injured spinal cord during the acute postinjury period, caused remarkable functional recovery. The ability of SHED-CM to induce recovery was associated with an immunoregulatory activity that induced anti-inflammatory -like macrophages. Secretome analysis of the SHED-CM revealed a previously unrecognized set of inducers for anti-inflammatory -like macrophages: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the secreted ectodomain of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-9 (ED-Siglec-9). Depleting MCP-1 and ED-Siglec-9 from the SHED-CM prominently reduced its ability to induce -like macrophages and to promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). The combination of MCP-1 and ED-Siglec-9 synergistically promoted the -like differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, and this effect was abolished by a selective antagonist for CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) or by the genetic knock-out of CCR2. Furthermore, MCP-1 and ED-Siglec-9 administration into the injured spinal cord induced -like macrophages and led to a marked recovery of hindlimb locomotor  after SCI. The inhibition of this  induction through the inactivation of CCR2  abolished the therapeutic effects of both SHED-CM and MCP-1/ED-Siglec-9. Macrophages activated by MCP-1 and ED-Siglec-9 extended neurite and suppressed apoptosis of primary cerebellar granule neurons against the neurotoxic effects of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Our data suggest that the unique combination of MCP-1 and ED-Siglec-9 repairs the SCI through anti-inflammatory -like macrophage induction.Copyright © 2015 the authors 0270-6474/15/352452-13$15.00/0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477737>Recruitment of beneficial  macrophages to injured spinal cord is orchestrated by remote brain choroid plexus.</a></h2><p>Monocyte-derived macrophages are essential for recovery after spinal cord injury, but their homing mechanism is poorly understood.

Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a master regulator of macrophage  and is essential for proinflammatory M1 macrophage polarization. Our previous data indicated that M1 macrophages promote NEC injury. Here, we investigated whether IRF5 is involved in the pathogenesis of NEC. First, we found that IRF5 was upregulated in infiltrated macrophages in human neonates with NEC compared to controls. We further confirmed IRF5 upregulation in macrophages in experimental murine NEC and that the infiltrated macrophages were predominantly polarized into the M1 but not the  phenotype. Myeloid-specific deficiency of Irf5, which was associated with reduced M1 macrophage polarization and systematic inflammation, dramatically prevented experimental NEC. Moreover, we found that the ablation of Irf5 in myeloid cells markedly suppressed intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and further prevented intestinal  dysfunction in experimental NEC. Bioinformatic and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis further showed that IRF5 binds to the promoters of the M1 macrophage-associated genes Ccl4, Ccl5, Tnf, and Il12b. Overall, our study provides evidence that IRF5 participates in the pathogenesis of NEC, while the deletion of Irf5 in myeloid cells prevents NEC via inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966251>Mechanisms of proton conduction and gating in influenza  proton channels from solid-state NMR.</a></h2><p>The  protein of influenza viruses forms an acid-activated tetrameric proton channel. We used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the structure and functional dynamics of the pH-sensing and proton-selective histidine-37 in  bound to a cholesterol-containing virus-envelope-mimetic membrane so as to better understand the proton conduction mechanism. In the high-pH closed state, the four histidines form an edge-face π-stacked structure, preventing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded water chain to conduct protons. In the low-pH conducting state, the imidazoliums hydrogen-bond extensively with water and undergo microsecond ring reorientations with an energy  greater than 59 kilojoules per mole. This  is consistent with the temperature dependence of proton conductivity, suggesting that histidine-37 dynamically shuttles protons into the virion. We propose a proton conduction mechanism in which ring-flip-assisted imidazole deprotonation is the rate-limiting step.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20385042>Barriers to weight loss in obese patients with knee osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>Obesity contributes to the development of knee osteoarthritis and complicates its surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to explore barriers to effective weight management in obese patients with knee osteoarthritis.A cross-sectional questionnaire study was performed in an elective out-patient setting and on an orthopaedic ward on patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/ or over and knee osteoarthritis.Of 47 patients approached, 45 agreed to participate. Forty of 45 patients (89%) had tried to lose weight at some point, 35 of 40 (87.5%) by adjusting their diet. Forty of 45 (89%) patients considered lack of motivation to be the greatest  to weight loss and only 13 of 45 (28%) pain in the knee. Patients with a BMI of less than 40 kg/ expressed a preference for dietary advice to help with weight loss, compared with those with a BMI of over 40 kg/ who expressed a preference for an NHS or other support group.Obesity is a significant problem for many patients with knee osteoarthritis. Attendance at an orthopaedic clinic is an opportunity to address obesity, by providing information about diet and possibly support groups for morbidly obese patients. Patients may be motivated to lose weight to improve their symptoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678169>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid attenuates the inflammatory response by modulating microglia polarization through SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of the HMGB1/NF-κB pathway following experimental traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Microglial polarization and the subsequent neuroinflammatory response are contributing factors for traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced secondary injury. High mobile group box 1 (HMGB1) mediates the activation of the NF-κB pathway, and it is considered to be pivotal in the late neuroinflammatory response. Activation of the HMGB1/NF-κB pathway is closely related to HMGB1 acetylation, which is regulated by the sirtuin (SIRT) family of proteins. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) are known to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. We previously demonstrated that ω-3 PUFA inhibited TBI-induced microglial activation and the subsequent neuroinflammatory response by regulating the HMGB1/NF-κB signaling pathway. However, no studies have elucidated if ω-3 PUFA affects the HMGB1/NF-κB pathway in a HMGB1 deacetylation of dependent SIRT1 manner, thus regulating microglial polarization and the subsequent neuroinflammatory response.The Feeney DM TBI model was adopted to induce brain injury in rats. Modified neurological severity scores, rotarod test, brain water content, and Nissl staining were employed to determine the neuroprotective effects of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. Assessment of microglia polarization and pro-inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and HMGB1, were used to evaluate the neuroinflammatory responses and the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. Immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis were used to detect HMGB1 nuclear translocation, secretion, and HMGB1/NF-κB signaling pathway activation to evaluate the effects of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. The impact of SIRT1 deacetylase activity on HMGB1 acetylation and the interaction between HMGB1 and SIRT1 were assessed to evaluate anti-inflammation effects of ω-3 PUFAs, and also, whether these effects were dependent on a SIRT1-HMGB1/NF-κB axis to gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of the neuroinflammatory response after TBI.The results of our study showed that ω-3 PUFA supplementation promoted a shift from the M1 microglial phenotype to the  microglial phenotype and inhibited microglial activation, thus reducing TBI-induced inflammatory factors. In addition, ω-3 PUFA-mediated downregulation of HMGB1 acetylation and its extracellular secretion was found to be likely due to increased SIRT1 activity. We also found that treatment with ω-3 PUFA inhibited HMGB1 acetylation and induced direct interactions between SIRT1 and HMGB1 by elevating SIRT1 activity following TBI. These events lead to inhibition of HMGB1 nucleocytoplasmic translocation/extracellular secretion and alleviated HMGB1-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway following TBI-induced microglial activation, thus inhibiting the subsequent inflammatory response.The results of this study suggest that ω-3 PUFA supplementation attenuates the inflammatory response by modulating microglial polarization through SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of the HMGB1/NF-κB pathway, leading to neuroprotective effects following experimental traumatic brain injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880314>Tuftsin-driven experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis recovery requires neuropilin-1.</a></h2><p>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of demyelinating autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which is characterized by central nervous system white matter lesions, microglial activation, and peripheral T-cell infiltration secondary to blood-brain  disruption. We have previously shown that treatment with tuftsin, a tetrapeptide generated from IgG proteolysis, dramatically improves disease symptoms in EAE. Here, we report that microglial expression of Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is required for tuftsin-driven amelioration of EAE symptoms. Nrp1 ablation in microglia blocks microglial signaling and polarization to the anti-inflammatory  phenotype, and ablation in either the microglia or immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) reduces extended functional contacts between them and Treg activation, implicating a role for microglia in the activation process, and more generally, how immune surveillance is conducted in the CNS. Taken together, our findings delineate the mechanistic action of tuftsin as a candidate therapeutic against immune-mediated demyelinating lesions.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465430>Role of macrophages in the altered epithelial  during a type 2 immune response induced by enteric nematode infection.</a></h2><p>Parasitic enteric nematodes induce a type 2 immune response characterized by increased production of Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, and recruitment of alternatively activated macrophages () to the site of infection. Nematode infection is associated with changes in epithelial permeability and inhibition of sodium-linked glucose absorption, but the role of  in these effects is unknown. Clodronate-containing liposomes were administered prior to and during nematode infection to deplete macrophages and prevent the development of  in response to infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. The inhibition of epithelial glucose absorption that is associated with nematode infection involved a macrophage-dependent reduction in SGLT1 activity, with no change in receptor expression, and a macrophage-independent down-regulation of GLUT2 expression. The reduced transport of glucose into the enterocyte is compensated partially by an up-regulation of the constitutive GLUT1 transporter consistent with stress-induced activation of HIF-1α. Thus, nematode infection results in a "lean" epithelial phenotype that features decreased SGLT1 activity, decreased expression of GLUT2 and an emergent dependence on GLUT1 for glucose uptake into the enterocyte. Macrophages do not play a role in enteric nematode infection-induced changes in epithelial  . There is a greater contribution, however, of paracellular absorption of glucose to supply the energy demands of host resistance. These data provide further evidence of the ability of macrophages to alter glucose metabolism of neighboring cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25563977>Brain and Testis Accumulation of Regorafenib is Restricted by Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2) and P-glycoprotein (P-GP/ABCB1).</a></h2><p>Regorafenib is a novel multikinase inhibitor, currently approved for the treatment of metastasized colorectal cancer and advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We investigated whether regorafenib is a substrate for the multidrug efflux transporters ABCG2 and ABCB1 and whether oral availability, brain and testis accumulation of regorafenib and its active metabolites are influenced by these transporters.We used in vitro transport assays to assess human (h)ABCB1- or hABCG2- or murine (m)Abcg2-mediated active transport at high and low concentrations of regorafenib. To study the single and combined roles of Abcg2 and Abcb1a/1b in oral regorafenib disposition and the impact of Cyp3a-mediated metabolism, we used appropriate knockout mouse strains.Regorafenib was transported well by mAbcg2 and hABCG2 and modestly by hABCB1 in vitro. Abcg2 and to a lesser extent Abcb1a/1b limited brain and testis accumulation of regorafenib and metabolite  (brain only) in mice. Regorafenib oral availability was not increased in Abcg2(-/-);Abcb1a/1b(-/-) mice. Up till 2 h, metabolite M5 was undetectable in plasma and organs.Brain and testis accumulation of regorafenib and brain accumulation of metabolite  are restricted by Abcg2 and Abcb1a/1b.

Optimization of the drug formulation is crucial for the successful delivery in living cells. We demonstrated earlier that packaging of catalase into a polyion complex micelle ('nanozyme') with a synthetic polyelectrolyte block copolymer protected the enzyme against degradation in macrophages and improved therapeutic outcomes. We now report the manufacture of nanozymes with superior structure and therapeutic indices.Synthesis, characterization and therapeutic efficacy of optimal cell-based nanoformulations are evaluated.A formulation design for drug carriers typically works to avoid entrapment in monocytes and macrophages focusing on small-sized nanoparticles with a polyethylene glycol corona (to provide a stealth effect). By contrast, the best nanozymes for delivery in macrophages reported in this study have a relatively large size (≈ 200 nm), which resulted in improved loading capacity and release from macrophages. Furthermore, the cross-linking of nanozymes with the excess of a nonbiodegradable linker ensured their low cytotoxicity, and efficient catalase protection in cell carriers. Finally, the 'alternatively activated' macrophage phenotype () utilized in these studies did not promote further inflammation in the brain, resulting in a subtle but statistically significant effect on neuronal regeneration and repair in vivo.The optimized cross-linked nanozyme loaded into macrophages reduced neuroinflammatory responses and increased neuronal survival in mice. Importantly, the approach for nanoformulation design for cell-mediated delivery is different from the common requirements for injectable formulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329115>Effect of stocking density and sex on growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current experiment was to investigate the effect of stocking density and sex on growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement consisting of sex and four different stocking densities in battery cages. A total of 540 1-d-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were allotted to one of eight treatments with five replicates. Within each sex, birds were raised at four different stocking densities of 15.2, 20.2, 25.3, or 30.4 birds/ from 1 to 28 d of age. Different stocking densities were achieved by raising a different number of birds per battery cage with identical floor size (0.76 m × 0.78 m). At the end of the experiment, two birds per replicate were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that no interactions between sex and stocking density were observed for all measurements except for serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. Increasing stocking density decreased (linear, P < 0.01) body weight gain and feed intake, but had no negative effects on meat quality. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance values, a measure of intestinal permeability, were decreased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing stocking density, regardless of sex. Accordingly, serum LPS concentrations were increased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing stocking density. However, increasing stocking density increased serum LPS concentrations in male broiler chickens, but had no effects on female broiler chickens, showing an interaction (P < 0.01). The expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and junctional adhesion molecule B (JAM-2) was decreased (linear, P < 0.05) with increasing stocking density. In conclusion, increasing stocking density decreases broiler performance regardless of sex and this negative effect is likely associated with decreased intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160142>Avian influenza A virus adaptation to the equine host and identification of host-specific markers.</a></h2><p>Avian influenza A viruses (IAVs) are able to overcome the interspecies  and adapt to the new non-avian host.

Currently, effective medical countermeasures for SM are lacking. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) possess self-renewal and multipotent differentiation capacity. BMSCs can also migrate to inflammation and injury sites and exert anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions. Here, we report the curative effect of BMSCs on SM-induced ALI in a mouse model.Mice BMSCs were injected into mice via the tail vein 24 h after SM exposure. The distribution of BMSCs in mice was detected by fluorescence imaging. The therapeutic potential of BMSCs was evaluated by the calculating survival rate. The effects of BMSCs on lung tissue injury and repair assessment were examined by staining with H&E and measuring the lung wet/dry weight ratio, BALF protein level, and respiratory . The effects of BMSCs on the infiltration and phenotypic alteration of inflammatory cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The levels of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines were examined using the Luminex Performance Assay and ELISA. RNA interference, western blotting, and ELISA were applied to explore the role of the TLR4 signaling pathway in the anti-inflammatory effects of BMSCs. The extent of tissue repair was analyzed by ELISA, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.Fluorescence imaging indicated that the lung is the major target organ of BMSCs after injection. The injection of BMSCs significantly improved the survival rate (p < 0.05), respiratory , and related lung damage indexes (wet/dry weight ratio, total proteins in BALF, etc.) in mice. BMSC administration also reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as affected the balances of M1/ and Th17/Treg. Furthermore, solid evidence regarding the effects of BMSCs on the increased secretion of various growth factors, the differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells, and the enhancement of cell  functions was also observed.BMSCs displayed protective effects against SM-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and promoting tissue repair. The present study provides a strong experimental basis in a mouse model and suggests possible application for future cell therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473048>Identification of combinatorial host-specific signatures with a potential to affect host adaptation in influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes.</a></h2><p>The underlying strategies used by influenza A viruses (IAVs) to adapt to new hosts while crossing the species  are complex and yet to be understood completely. Several studies have been published identifying singular genomic signatures that indicate such a host switch. The complexity of the problem suggested that in addition to the singular signatures, there might be a combinatorial use of such genomic features, in nature, defining adaptation to hosts.We used computational rule-based modeling to identify combinatorial sets of interacting amino acid (aa) residues in 12 proteins of IAVs of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. We built highly accurate rule-based models for each protein that could differentiate between viral aa sequences coming from avian and human hosts. We found 68 host-specific combinations of aa residues, potentially associated to host adaptation on HA, M1, , NP, NS1, NEP, PA, PA-X, PB1 and PB2 proteins of the H1N1 subtype and 24 on M1, , NEP, PB1 and PB2 proteins of the H3N2 subtypes. In addition to these combinations, we found 132 novel singular aa signatures distributed among all proteins, including the newly discovered PA-X protein, of both subtypes. We showed that HA, NA, NP, NS1, NEP, PA-X and PA proteins of the H1N1 subtype carry H1N1-specific and HA, NA, PA-X, PA, PB1-F2 and PB1 of the H3N2 subtype carry H3N2-specific signatures. M1, , PB1-F2, PB1 and PB2 of H1N1 subtype, in addition to H1N1 signatures, also carry H3N2 signatures. Similarly M1, , NP, NS1, NEP and PB2 of H3N2 subtype were shown to carry both H3N2 and H1N1 host-specific signatures (HSSs).To sum it up, we computationally constructed simple IF-THEN rule-based models that could distinguish between aa sequences of avian and human IAVs. From the rules we identified HSSs having a potential to affect the adaptation to specific hosts. The identification of combinatorial HSSs suggests that the process of adaptation of IAVs to a new host is more complex than previously suggested. The present study provides a basis for further detailed studies with the aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms providing the foundation for the adaptation process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409770>mTORC2 activation protects retinal ganglion cells via Akt signaling after autophagy induction in traumatic optic nerve injury.</a></h2><p>Traumatic optic neuropathy is an injury to the optic nerve that leads to vision loss. Autophagy is vital for cell survival and cell death in central nervous system injury, but the role of autophagy in traumatic optic nerve injury remains uncertain. Optic nerve crush is a robust model of traumatic optic nerve injury. p62 siRNA and rapamycin are autophagy inducers and have different neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. In this study, p62 and rapamycin induced autophagy, but only p62 siRNA treatment provided a favorable protective effect in visual  and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival. Moreover, the number of macrophages at the optic nerve lesion site was lower in the p62-siRNA-treated group than in the other groups. p62 siRNA induced more  macrophage polarization than rapamycin did. Rapamycin inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, whereas p62 siRNA inhibited only mTORC1 activation and maintained mTORC2 and Akt activation. Inhibition of mTORC2-induced Akt activation resulted in blood-optic nerve  disruption. Combined treatment with rapamycin and the mTORC2 activator SC79 improved RGC survival. Overall, our findings suggest that mTORC2 activation after autophagy induction is necessary for the neuroprotection of RGCs in traumatic optic nerve injury and may lead to new clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25374107>Bone marrow-derived macrophages from AβPP/PS1 mice are sensitized to the effects of inflammatory stimuli.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are key cells in tissue defense in the periphery and, under certain circumstances, infiltrate the central nervous system, where they may play a similar role in the brain, perhaps supporting the  of microglia. Macrophages have been shown to adopt different activation states in response to various stimuli. Specifically, when exposed to inflammatory stimuli such as interferon (IFN)γ, the cells adopt the M1 phenotype, whereas when exposed to anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13, the  phenotype is adopted. While M1 macrophages are associated with tissue defense and destruction of invading pathogens,  macrophages are involved in tissue repair and in terminating inflammation. It is well known that an inflammatory microenvironment exists in the brain of aged animals and also in the brain of mice that overexpress amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and presenilin 1 (PS1; AβPP/PS1 mice), a commonly-used model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have revealed that immune cells, including macrophages, infiltrate the brain in both circumstances raising the possibility that these cells adopt the M1 activation state and contribute to the already-existing neuroinflammation. We set out to examine the responses of bone marrow-derived macrophages prepared from wildtype and AβPP/PS1 mice and demonstrate that cells from AβPP/PS1 mice, even after several days in culture, respond more profoundly to IFNγ than those from wildtype mice. We suggest that this propensity to respond to M1-polarizing stimuli, together with the described changes in the brain of AβPP/PS1 mice, contribute to the development of chronic neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19770098>[P-glycoprotein functional activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes in ulcerative colitis].</a></h2><p>P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by MDR-1, is a transmembrane efflux pump that has been involved in relevant clinical drug transport.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of P-gp in therapeutic response of ulcerative colitis by studying its functionality in lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. Samples were taken from 27 patients with active colitis classified clinically in refractory (n = 16) and responders (n = 11) to treatment. Rhodamine 123 (a fluorescent P-glycoprotein substrate) efflux was studied by flow cytometry as absence and presence of an inhibitor (verapamil, 100 uM). Data were expressed evaluating the behaviour of two markers defined based on % of cells with maximum (M1)/minimum () intracellular fluorescence, reflecting inactivity/activity of the pump. Results were compared with a group of healthy individuals (n = 68). Significant differences were observed in absence and presence of Verapamil inhibition, when comparing refractory vs. responders (p < 0.05) as well as refractory vs. healthy controls (p < 0.01). No differences were observed when comparing responders vs. controls (p > 0.05) (Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn post-test). Rhodamine efflux assay was also performed in 12 patients who required therapeutic change; a significant diminish of rhodamine transport (p < 0.01) was observed without inhibitor when patients achieved clinical response. Finally, our results suggest a possible relevant role of P-gp in ulcerative colitis treatment response and a possible usefulness of P-gp functional assay in the early detection of individual therapeutic response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26289519>Self-reported physical activity among health care professionals in South-West Nigeria.</a></h2><p>Physical activity (PA) is a key requirement for maintaining good health.

A  to PA counseling by health care providers (HCPs) is personal PA habits. Information regarding PA among HCPs in Nigeria is limited. We aimed to determine the adequacy and predictors of PA among HCPs of a tertiary health care facility in Lagos, Nigeria.A cross-sectional study was carried out with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Using the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, PA was categorized as adequate or inadequate. Predictors of PA were explored with multivariate logistic regression.A total of 300 HCPs were recruited, comprising 47.7% doctors and dentists, 43.3% nurses and 9.0% other HCPs. Mean age was 39.9 (9.0 years), 79.2%, 9.7% and 11.1% of the HCPs had low, moderate or high PA levels respectively. Thus, only 20.8% had adequate PA. 71.3% had body mass index (BMI) above the recommended value. BMI of ≥25 kg/ was associated with inadequate PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio-2.1,P=0.018).Majority of the HCPs had inadequate PA levels according to WHO guidelines. BMI≥25 kg/ was associated with inadequate physical inactivity. The low level of PA implies that these HCPs are at risk for NCDs. This will have a negative impact on availability of human resource for health.

Because of its rapid hydrolysis, however, the compensatory and neuroprotective effect of 2-AG is short-lived. Although inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase, a principal enzyme for 2-AG degradation, causes a robust increase of brain levels of 2-AG, it also leads to cannabinoid receptor desensitization and behavioral tolerance. Alpha/beta hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) is a novel 2-AG hydrolytic enzyme that accounts for a small portion of 2-AG hydrolysis, but its inhibition is believed to elevate the levels of 2-AG within the therapeutic window without causing side effect. Using a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we found that post-insult chronic treatment with a selective ABHD6 inhibitor WWL70 improved motor coordination and working memory performance. WWL70 treatment reduced lesion volume in the cortex and neurodegeneration in the dendate gyrus. It also suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and enhanced the expression of arginase-1 in the ipsilateral cortex at 3 and 7 days post-TBI, suggesting microglia/macrophages shifted from M1 to  phenotypes after treatment. The blood-brain  dysfunction at 3 and 7 days post-TBI was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of WWL70 involved up-regulation and activation of cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptors and were attributable to the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase and the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT. This study indicates that the fine-tuning of 2-AG signaling by modulating ABHD6 activity can exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803689>Fesoterodine: Pharmacological properties and clinical implications.</a></h2><p>Fesoterodine (as one of three drugs: dutasteride, finasteride and fesoterodine) was classified B (beneficial) by LUTS-FORTA 2014, indicating that it is a medicinal product with proven or obvious efficacy in the elderly, with limited side effects and/or safety concerns. A systematic literature review was undertaken in January 2018 using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases with the following individual and combined keywords: "fesoterodine", "pharmacology", "overactive bladder" and "antimuscarinics". The aim of the review was to determine which of fesoterodine's pharmacological properties explains its clinical benefits in general patient populations with OAB and the elderly in particular. The articles in the results were then selected by publication language (English and French only), methodology (off-topic studies, reported cases and literature reviews were excluded), relevance to the subject matter and publication date prior to 31 January 2018. A total of 205 articles was initially obtained, with 115 read and 45 selected. It appears that the association of four pharmacological properties specific to fesoterodine can explain that this drug has a good balance between efficacy and tolerability. These properties are namely the drug's high and nearly equal affinity for both the  and M3 muscarinic receptors, poor penetration of the blood-brain , lack of hepatic first-pass activation -fesoterodine being rapidly and extensively converted to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, by ubiquitous esterases-, and its extended-release formulation. Fesoterodine's pharmacological profile is optimal for the treatment of overactive bladder.

The mechanism of PM-mediated pathophysiology remains unknown. However, PM is proinflammatory to the endothelium and increases vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo via ROS generation.We explored the role of tight junction proteins as targets for PM-induced loss of lung endothelial cell (EC)  integrity and enhanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction.Changes in human lung EC monolayer permeability were assessed by Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER) in response to PM challenge (collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore, MD, particle size >0.1 μm). Biochemical assessment of ROS generation and Ca2+ mobilization were also measured.PM exposure induced tight junction protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) relocation from the cell periphery, which was accompanied by significant reductions in ZO-1 protein levels but not in adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin and β-catenin). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) reduced PM-induced ROS generation in ECs, which further prevented TER decreases and atteneuated ZO-1 degradation. PM also mediated intracellular calcium mobilization via the transient receptor potential cation channel  (TRPM2), in a ROS-dependent manner with subsequent activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain. PM-activated calpain is responsible for ZO-1 degradation and EC  disruption. Overexpression of ZO-1 attenuated PM-induced endothelial  disruption and vascular hyperpermeability in vivo and in vitro.These results demonstrate that PM induces marked increases in vascular permeability via ROS-mediated calcium leakage via activated TRPM2, and via ZO-1 degradation by activated calpain.

To diminish the sequelae of TBI, it is important to decrease haemorrhage and alleviate inflammation. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of 2-carba-cyclic phosphatidic acid (2ccPA) on the repair mechanisms after a stab wound injury as a murine TBI model. The administration of 2ccPA suppressed serum immunoglobulin extravasation after the injury. To elucidate the effects of 2ccPA on inflammation resulting from TBI, we analysed the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. We found that 2ccPA prevents a TBI-induced increase in the mRNA expression of Il-1β, Il-6, Tnf-α and Tgf-β1. In addition, 2ccPA reduces the elevation of Iba1 levels. These data suggest that 2ccPA attenuates the inflammation after a stab wound injury via the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release from microglial cells. Therefore, we focused on the  of 2ccPA in microglial polarisation towards M1 or  phenotypes. The administration of 2ccPA decreased the number of M1 and increased the number of  type microglial cells, indicating that 2ccPA modulates the microglial polarisation and shifts them towards  phenotype. These data suggest that 2ccPA treatment suppresses the extent of BBB breakdown and inflammation after TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22691872>Self-reported dietary intake and appetite predict early treatment outcome among low-BMI adults initiating HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa.</a></h2><p>Low BMI is a major risk factor for early mortality among HIV-infected persons starting antiretrovial therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa and the common patient belief that antiretroviral medications produce distressing levels of hunger is a  to treatment adherence. We assessed relationships between appetite, dietary intake and treatment outcome 12 weeks after ART initiation among HIV-infected adults with advanced malnutrition and immunosuppression.A prospective, observational cohort study. Dietary intake was assessed using a 24 h recall survey. The relationships of appetite, intake and treatment outcome were analysed using time-varying Cox models.A public-sector HIV clinic in Lusaka, Zambia.One hundred and forty-two HIV-infected adults starting ART with BMI <16 kg/ and/or CD4+ lymphocyte count <50 cells/μl.Median age, BMI and CD4+ lymphocyte count were 32 years, 16 kg/ and 34 cells/μl, respectively. Twenty-five participants (18%) died before 12 weeks and another thirty-three (23%) were lost to care. A 500 kJ/d higher energy intake at any time after ART initiation was associated with an approximate 16% reduction in the hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.84; P = 0.01), but the relative contribution of carbohydrate, protein or fat to total energy was not a significant predictor of outcome. Appetite normalized gradually among survivors and hunger was rarely reported.Poor early ART outcomes were strikingly high in a cohort of HIV-infected adults with advanced malnutrition and mortality was predicted by lower dietary intake. Intervention trials to promote post-ART intake in this population may benefit survival and are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961695>Ageing, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>During ageing, different iron complexes accumulate in specific brain regions which are associated with motor and cognitive dysfunction. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, changes in local iron homoeostasis result in altered cellular iron distribution and accumulation, ultimately inducing neurotoxicity. The use of iron chelators which are able to penetrate the blood brain  and reduce excessive iron accumulation in specific brain regions have been shown to reduce disease progression in both Parkinson's disease and Friedreich's Ataxia. Neuroinflammation often occurs in neurodegenerative diseases, which is mainly sustained by activated microglia exhibiting the M1 phenotype. Such inflammation contributes to the disease progression. Therapeutic agents which reduce such inflammation, e.g. taurine compounds, may ameliorate the inflammatory process by switching the microglia from a M1 to a  phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283837>Vascular hyperpermeability as a hallmark of phacomatoses: is the etiology angiogenesis related to or comparable with mechanisms seen in inflammatory pathways? Part II: angiogenesis- and inflammation-related molecular pathways, tumor-associated macrophages, and possible therapeutic implications: a comprehensive review.</a></h2><p>Phacomatoses are a special group of familial hamartomatous syndromes with unique neurocutaneous manifestations as well as characteristic tumors. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representatives of this family. A vestibular schwannoma (VS) and subependymal giant cell tumor (SGCT) are two of the most common intracranial tumors associated with these syndromes, related to NF2 and TSC, respectively. These tumors can present with an obstructive hydrocephalus due to their location adjacent to or in the ventricles. Remarkably, both tumors are also known to have a unique association with elevated protein concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sometimes in association with a non-obstructive (communicating) hydrocephalus. Of the two, SGCT has been shown to be associated with a predisposition to CSF clotting, causing a debilitating recurrent shunt obstruction. However, the exact relationship between high protein levels and clotting of CSF remains unclear, nor do we understand the precise mechanism of CSF clotting observed in SGCT. Elevated protein levels in the CSF are thought to be caused by increased vascular permeability and dysregulation of the blood-brain . The two presumed underlying pathophysiological processes for that in the context of tumorigenesis are angiogenesis and inflammation. Both these processes are correlated to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway which is tumorigenesis related in many neoplasms and nearly all phacomatoses. In this review, we discuss the influence of angiogenesis and inflammation pathways on vascular permeability in VSs and SGCTs at the phenotypic level as well as their possible genetic and molecular determinants. Part I described the historical perspectives and clinical aspects of the relationship between vascular permeability, abnormal CSF protein levels, clotting of the CSF, and communicating hydrocephalus. Part II hereafter describes the different cellular and molecular pathways involved in angiogenesis and inflammation observed in both tumors and explores the existing metabolic overlap between inflammation and coagulation. Interestingly, while increased angiogenesis can be observed in both tumors, inflammatory processes seem significantly more prominent in SGCT. Both SGCT and VS are characterized by different subgroups of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs): the pro-inflammatory M1 type is predominating in SGCTs, while the pro-angiogenetic  type is predominating in VSs. We suggest that a lack of NF2 protein in VS and a lack of TSC1/TSC2 proteins in SGCT significantly influence this fundamental difference between the two tumor types by changing the dominant TAM type. Since inflammatory reactions and coagulation processes are tightly connected, the pro-inflammatory state of SGCT may also explain the associated tendency for CSF clotting. The underlying cellular and molecular differences observed can potentially serve as an access point for direct therapeutic interventions for tumors that are specific to certain phacomatoses or others that also carry such genetic changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28551928>[ABO INCOMPATIBLE KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION].</a></h2><p>With the introduction of new therapies, the ABO  for kidney transplantation has been breached. In the recent decade the reported results with ABO incompatible (ABOi) kidney transplantation are similar to ABO compatible transplantation. We report on our initial experience with ABOi kidney transplantation performed at the Rabin Medical Center.During the period 3/2010 to 4/2015, 22 patients with PRA 0% underwent ABOi living-donor kidney transplantation. This group was compared to 325 non-sensitized live-donor transplant recipients of ABO-match transplants performed at the same period. The desensitization protocol included rituximab (375mg/kg/) and three sets of plasmapheresis every other day with IVIG (0.5g/kg) after each plasmapheresis. We compared graft and patient survivals, antibody mediated rejection (AMR) and graft  between the two groups.Graft survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years in the ABOi group were 95.5% at all intervals and 99.4% for the 1st year and 97.9% at 3 and 5 years after transplant (p=ns). Patient survival rates were 100% at all intervals and 100%, 98.3% and 97.5% at 1,3, and 5 years (p=ns). Two patients (9.1%) in the ABOi group experienced antibody mediated rejection (AMR), one lost his graft. In the ABO-matched group only two patients (0.85%) experienced AMR (p<0.05). Creatinine levels at followup were not statistically different between the groups.ABO incompatible kidney transplantation provides an additional option for transplant with excellent results. Strict monitoring of antibody levels should be conducted after ABOi transplantation to timely intervene and prevent AMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28926118>C/EBP homologous protein-induced loss of intestinal epithelial stemness contributes to bile duct ligation-induced cholestatic liver injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal   promotes the progression of various liver diseases, including cholestatic liver diseases. The close association of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with inflammatory bowel disease highlights the importance of the gut-liver axis. It has been reported that bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis is significantly reduced in C/EBP homologous protein knockout (CHOP ) mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we demonstrate that BDL induces striking and acute hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses after 1 day, which return to normal after 3 days. No significant hepatocyte apoptosis is detected 7-14 days following BDL. However, the inflammatory response is significantly increased after 7 days, which is similar to what we found in human PSC liver samples. BDL-induced loss of stemness in intestinal stem cells (ISCs), disruption of intestinal  , bacterial translocation, activation of hepatic inflammation,  macrophage polarization and liver fibrosis are significantly reduced in CHOP mice. In addition, intestinal organoids derived from CHOP mice contain more and longer crypt structures than those from wild-type (WT) mice, which is consistent with the upregulation of stem cell markers (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5, olfactomedin 4, and SRY [sex determining region Y]-box 9) and in vivo findings that CHOP mice have longer villi and crypts as compared to WT mice. Similarly, mRNA levels of CD14, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 are increased and stem cell proliferation is suppressed in the duodenum of patients with cirrhosis.Activation of ER stress and subsequent loss of stemness of ISCs plays a critical role in BDL-induced systemic inflammation and cholestatic liver injury. Modulation of the ER stress response represents a potential therapeutic strategy for cholestatic liver diseases as well as other inflammatory diseases.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that extensive first-pass elimination and abundant tissue distribution of berberine may be its specific pharmacokinetic properties. For that, four different dosing routes, intragastric, intraduodenal, intraportal, and intravenous, were used to investigate the gastric, intestinal, and hepatic first-pass elimination of berberine. After intragastric dosing, approximately half of berberine ran intact through the gastrointestinal tract and another half was disposed of by the small intestine, leading to an extremely low extent of absolute oral bioavailability in rats (0.36%). Moreover, the major berberine metabolites were identified and quantified in rat enterocyte S9 fractions, portal vein plasma, and intestinal perfusates; plasma concentrations and tissue distribution of berberine and its major metabolites were determined as well. Data indicated that M1,  glucuronide, and M3 were the major metabolites generated from the small intestine and that there was a 70-fold increase in the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve value for berberine (liver versus plasma). We conclude that intestinal first-pass elimination of berberine is the major  of its oral bioavailability and that its high extraction and distribution in the liver could be other important factors that lead to its low plasma levels in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445446>A Molecular Targeted Immunotherapeutic Strategy for Ulcerative Colitis via Dual-targeting Nanoparticles Delivering miR-146b to Intestinal Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a promising therapeutic target for intestinal mucosal repair. MiR-146b appears to control macrophage activation and cell proliferation.By loading miR-146b mimic on mannose-modified trimethyl chitosan [MTC]-conjugated nanoparticles [NPs] [MTC-miR146b], a molecular targeted immunotherapeutic approach was developed to selectively target intestinal macrophages for mucosal regeneration and tumourigenesis in mouse models.We first confirmed that miR-146b expression was significantly enhanced during mucosal regeneration in a murine colitis model. Moreover， after mucosal damage, MTC-miR146b mimic-treated wild-type mice had dramatically restored body weight and mucosal   compared with MTC-NC treated mice. Strikingly, MTC-miR146b mimic oral administration protected miR-146b-deficient mice from dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] injury and the colitis-associated cancer process. Mechanistically, miR-146b strongly inhibited M1 macrophage activation by suppressing the Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] signalling pathway, resulting in the repression of the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. More importantly, miR-146b overexpression in bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] in M1 differentiation conditions induced a phenotype similar to  macrophages and improved the proliferation of co-cultured colonic epithelial cells via STAT3-dependent IL-10 production.MTC-miR146b should be regarded as an effective candidate for oral delivery and could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies for ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated cancer.Copyright © 2018 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

In contrast, the role of PKM2 in nontransformed cells is little studied, and nearly nothing is known of its role, if any, in quiescent cells. We show here that endothelial cells express PKM2 almost exclusively over PKM1. In proliferating endothelial cells, PKM2 is required to suppress p53 and maintain cell cycle progression. In sharp contrast, PKM2 has a strikingly different role in quiescent endothelial cells, where inhibition of PKM2 leads to degeneration of tight junctions and barrier function. Mechanistically, PKM2 regulates barrier function independently of its canonical activity as a pyruvate kinase. Instead, PKM2 suppresses NF-kB and its downstream target, the vascular permeability factor angiopoietin 2. As a consequence, loss of endothelial cell PKM2 in vivo predisposes mice to VEGF-induced vascular leak, and to severe bacteremia and death in response to sepsis. Together, these data demonstrate new roles of PKM2 in quiescent cells, and highlight the need for caution in developing cancer therapies that target PKM2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21277851>Eosinophils express muscarinic receptors and corticotropin-releasing factor to disrupt the mucosal  in ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Altered intestinal   has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) in genetic, functional, and epidemiological studies. Mast cells and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) regulate the mucosal  in human colon. Because eosinophils are often increased in colon tissues of patients with UC, we assessed interactions among mast cells, CRF, and eosinophils in the mucosal  of these patients.Transmucosal fluxes of protein antigens (horseradish peroxidase) and paracellular markers ((51)Cr-EDTA, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000) were studied in noninflamed, colonic mucosal biopsy samples collected from 26 patients with UC and 53 healthy volunteers (controls); samples were mounted in Ussing chambers. We also performed fluorescence and electron microscopy of human tissue samples, assessed isolated eosinophils, and performed mechanistic studies using in vitro cocultured eosinophils (15HL-60), mast cells (HMC-1), and a colonic epithelial cell line (T84).Colon tissues from patients with UC had significant increases in permeability to protein antigens compared with controls. Permeability was blocked by atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist), α-helical CRF(9-41) (a CRF receptor antagonist), and lodoxamide (a mast-cell stabilizer). Eosinophils were increased in number in UC tissues (compared with controls), expressed the most  and M3 muscarinic receptors of any mucosal cell type, and had immunoreactivity to CRF. In coculture studies, carbachol activation of eosinophils caused production of CRF and activation of mast cells, which increased permeability of T84 epithelial cells to macromolecules.We identified a neuroimmune intercellular circuit (from cholinergic nerves, via eosinophils to mast cells) that mediates colonic mucosal  dysfunction in patients with UC. This circuit might exacerbate mucosal inflammation.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The three-dimensional microstructure of NFC films made of Pinus radiata (Radiata Pine) kraft pulp fibres has been assessed in this study, considering the structural development as a  of relative humidity (RH). The surface roughness, micro-porosity, thickness and their correlations were analyzed using X-ray microtomography (X-μCT) and computerized image analysis. The results are compared to those from scanning electron microscopy and laser profilometry. Based on a series of films having varying amounts of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated oxidated nanofibrils, it was demonstrated that X-μCT is suitable for assessing the surface and bulk 3D microstructure of the cellulose films. Additionally, one of the series was assessed at varying humidity levels, using the non-destructive capabilities of X-μCT and a newly developed humidity chamber for in-situ characterization. The oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the films (20 g=) was below 3:7 mL m⁻² day⁻¹ at humidity levels below 60% RH. However, the OTR increased considerably to 12:4 mL m⁻² day⁻¹ when the humidity level increased to 80% RH. The increase in OTR was attributed to a change of the film porosity, which was reflected as an increase in local thickness. Hence, the characterization techniques applied in this study shed more light on the structures of NFC films and how they are affected by varying humidity levels. It was demonstrated that in increasing relative humidity the films swelled and the oxygen  properties decreased.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24330081>Enhanced nicotinic receptor mediated relaxations in gastroesophageal muscle fibers from Barrett's esophagus patients.</a></h2><p>Increased nicotinic receptor mediated relaxation in the gastroesophageal antireflux  may be involved in the pathophysiology of reflux. This study is designed to determine whether the defects we previously identified in gastroesophageal reflux disease patients in- vivo are due to abnormalities of the gastric sling, gastric clasp, or lower esophageal circular (LEC) muscle fibers.Muscle strips from whole stomachs and esophagi were obtained from 16 normal donors and 15 donors with histologically proven Barrett's esophagus. Contractile and relaxant responses of gastric sling, gastric clasp, or LEC fibers were determined to increasing concentrations of carbachol and to nicotine after inducing maximal contraction to bethanechol. Muscarinic receptor density was measured using subtype selective immunoprecipitation.Barrett's esophagus gastric sling and LEC fibers have decreased carbachol-induced contractions. Barrett's esophagus sling fibers have decreased  -muscarinic receptors and LEC fibers have decreased M3 receptors. Relaxations of all three fiber types are greater in Barrett's esophagus specimens to both high carbachol concentrations and to nicotine following bethanechol precontraction. The maximal response to bethanechol is greater in Barrett esophagus sling and LEC fibers.The increased contractile response to bethanechol in Barrett's specimens indicates that the defect is likely not due to the smooth muscle itself. The enhanced nicotinic receptor mediated response may be involved in greater relaxation of the muscles within the high-pressure zone of the gastroesophageal junction during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and during deglutitive inhibition and may be involved in the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30843911>Exosomes from LPS-stimulated macrophages induce neuroprotection and functional improvement after ischemic stroke by modulating microglial polarization.</a></h2><p>Inflammation occurs throughout the progression of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and mediates myriads of pathological events following an ischemic insult. After ischemic stroke, inflammation was significantly triggered and microglia were activated to phenotypes (M1) typically releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, thus inducing neuron apoptosis and exacerbating brain injury. Therefore, shifting the polarization of microglia from the detrimental pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the beneficial anti-inflammatory  phenotype seems a promising therapeutic strategy in ischemic stroke. In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of exosomes (Ex) secreted from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage RAW264.7 cell line (LPS-Ex) on inducing neuroprotection and functional improvement after ischemic stroke by enhancing microglial  polarization. The results showed that LPS-Ex treatment exhibited more potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro; furthermore it significantly reduced the brain infarct volume and improved neurological  in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. The beneficial effects of LPS-Ex in ischemic stroke were associated with enhancing microglial polarization from the M1 phenotype to the  phenotype and inhibiting inflammation response. In conclusion, LPS-Ex protected against cerebral ischemia by skewing the microglial functional polarity from M1 toward an anti-inflammatory  phenotype. It may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection and functional recovery upon ischemic stroke onset.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27894304>Brain inflammation is accompanied by peripheral inflammation in Cstb  mice, a model for progressive myoclonus epilepsy.</a></h2><p>Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is an autosomal recessively inherited childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by myoclonus, seizures, and ataxia. Mutations in the cystatin B gene (CSTB) underlie EPM1. The CSTB-deficient (Cstb  ) mouse model recapitulates key features of EPM1, including myoclonic seizures. The mice show early microglial activation that precedes seizure onset and neuronal loss and leads to neuroinflammation. We here characterized the inflammatory phenotype of Cstb  mice in more detail. We found higher concentrations of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of Cstb  mice and higher CXCL13 expression in activated microglia in Cstb  compared to control mouse brains. The elevated chemokine levels were not accompanied by blood-brain barrier disruption, despite increased brain vascularization. Macrophages in the spleen and brain of Cstb  mice were predominantly pro-inflammatory. Taken together, these data show that CXCL13 expression is a hallmark of microglial activation in Cstb  mice and that the brain inflammation is linked to peripheral inflammatory changes, which might contribute to the disease pathology of EPM1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329969>Effect of stocking density and dietary tryptophan on growth performance and intestinal   in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the effect of stocking density (SD) and dietary supplementation of crystalline tryptophan (Trp) on growth performance and intestinal   in broiler chickens raised in a floor pen. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of 2 different SD and 2 supplemental levels of dietary Trp. A total of 1,140 Ross 308 broiler chickens at 21 d of age were allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 5 replicates. Low SD (9 birds/) and high SD (18 birds/) were achieved by raising different number of birds per identical floor pen (2.0 m × 2.4 m). The basal diet was formulated with no supplemental Trp in diets to meet or exceed nutrient recommendation of the Ross 308 manual. The calculated concentrations of total Trp and digestible Trp in the basal diet were 0.19 and 0.16%, respectively. The other diet was prepared by adding 0.16% crystalline Trp to the basal diet. Diets were fed to birds for 21 d. At the end of the experiment, 2 birds per replicate were euthanized to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that there were no interactions between SD and dietary Trp for all measurements. For the main effects, birds raised at a low SD had greater (P < 0.01) body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency than those raised at a high SD. However, supplementation of dietary Trp had no effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, there were no main effects of SD and dietary Trp on intestinal  functions. In conclusion, broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with a high SD (18 birds/) have decreased growth performance with little changes in intestinal  functions. Supplementation of dietary Trp at 0.16% has no positive effect on broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with either a low or high SD.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28855861>Regulation of Microglia and Macrophage Polarization via Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase 1 Silencing after Ischemic/Hypoxic Injury.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is implicated in ischemic stroke and is involved in abnormal homeostasis. Activation of the immune system leads to breakdown of the blood-brain  and, thereby, infiltration of immune cells into the brain. Upon cerebral ischemia, infiltrated macrophages and microglia (resident CNS immune cell) are activated, change their phenotype to M1 or  based on the microenvironment, migrate toward damaged tissue, and are involved in repair or damage. Those of M1 phenotype release pro-inflammatory mediators, which are associated with tissue damage, while those of  phenotype release anti-inflammatory mediators, which are related to tissue recovery. Moreover, late inflammation continually stimulates immune cell infiltration and leads to brain infarction. Therefore, regulation of M1/ phenotypes under persistent inflammatory conditions after cerebral ischemia is important for brain repair. Herein, we focus on apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which is involved in apoptotic cell death, brain infarction, and production of inflammatory mediators after cerebral ischemia. We hypothesized that ASK1 is involved in the polarization of M1/ phenotype and the  of microglia and macrophage during the late stage of ischemia/hypoxia. We investigated the effects of ASK1 in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and on BV2 microglia and RAW264.7 macrophage cell lines subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results showed that ASK1 silencing effectively reduced Iba-1 or CD11b-positive cells in ischemic areas, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased anti-inflammatory mediator levels at 7 days after cerebral ischemia. In cultured microglia and macrophages, ASK1 inhibition, induced by NQDI-1 drug, decreased the expression and release of M1-associated factors and increased those of -associated factors after hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R). At the gene level, ASK1 inhibition suppressed M1-associated genes and augmented -associated genes. In gap closure assay, ASK1 inhibition reduced the migration rate of microglia and macrophages after H/R. Taken together, our results provide new information that suggests ASK1 controls the polarization of M1/ and the  of microglia and macrophage under sustained-inflammatory conditions. Regulation of persistent inflammation via M1/ polarization by ASK1 is a novel strategy for repair after ischemic stroke.</p></html>
