However, it is not known whether similar responses occur in / patients receiving long-acting beta2-agonists.We sought to evaluate the effects of variation in the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) on clinical response to salmeterol administered with fluticasone propionate.Subjects (n = 183) currently receiving short-acting beta2-agonists were randomized to twice-daily therapy with salmeterol, 50 microg, administered with fluticasone propionate, 100 microg, in a single inhaler or daily therapy with montelukast for 12 weeks, followed by a 2- to 4-day run-out period.There was sustained and significant improvement (P < .001) over baseline in all measures of asthma control in subjects receiving salmeterol, regardless of Arg16Gly genotype. Morning peak expiratory flow in subjects with the / genotype showed 89.0 +/- 16.1 L/min improvement over baseline compared with 93.7 +/- 12.7 L/min for / subjects and 92.5 +/- 11.9 L/min for / subjects. Pairwise changes were similar for / compared with / or / genotypes (estimated differences, 4.7 L/min and 3.5 L/min, respectively). Responses did not appear to be modified by haplotype pairs. During the run-out period, all subjects had predictable and similar decreases in measures of asthma control, with no differences between genotypes.Response to salmeterol does not vary between ADRB2 genotypes after chronic dosing with an inhaled corticosteroid.Analyses from this study indicate that genetic polymorphisms leading to Arg16Gly sequence changes within the beta2-adrenergic receptor do not affect patients' responses to recommended asthma therapy with salmeterol and fluticasone propionate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681963>The effects of a Gly16Arg ADRB2 polymorphism on responses to salmeterol or montelukast in Japanese patients with mild persistent asthma.</a></h1><p>Long-acting β2-agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists are two principal agents that can be added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with asthma that is not adequately controlled by ICS alone. The Gly16Arg genotype of the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene may influence the bronchodilator effects of β2-agonists. We hypothesized that differential responses to long-acting β2-agonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists might be determined partly by the Gly16Arg polymorphism in Japanese asthma patients.This randomized, genotype-stratified, two-period crossover study included 80 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma (35 / and 45 / individuals). The primary study outcome was the difference in peak expiratory flow (ΔPEF) (ΔPEF, l/min) by genotype after 16 weeks of treatment with salmeterol (ΔPEFsal) or montelukast (ΔPEFmon). In addition, multivariate analyses were used to identify independent factors that were predictive of responses to each treatment.The mean ΔPEFsal-ΔPEFmon was 19.3±46.6 among / individuals and 16.8±51.5 among / individuals, indicating that the Gly16Arg genotype did not influence the differential bronchodilator effect of the two agents. Multivariate analysis showed that higher peripheral eosinophil counts were associated with better response to salmeterol (P<0.05).The Gly16Arg genotype did not influence the differential bronchodilator effect of salmeterol or montelukast as an add-on therapy to ICS within 16 weeks of follow-up. Higher peripheral eosinophil counts may be associated with better responses to salmeterol in combination with ICS.</p></html>
