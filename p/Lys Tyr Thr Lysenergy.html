Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk fat. Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids,  and  decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of Phe+, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other  metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, Val,  and , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9263881>A model of scorpion toxin binding to voltage-gated K+ channels.</a></h1><p>Mutational studies have identified part of the S5-S6 loop of voltage-dependent K+ channels (P region) responsible for tetraethylammonium (TEA) block and permeation properties. Several scorpion peptide toxins-charybdotoxin (ChTX), kaliotoxin (KITX), and agitoxin (AgTX)-also block the channel with high affinity and specificity. Here, we examine the interaction predicted when the toxins are docked onto the molecular model of the K+ channel pore that we recently proposed. Docking with the model of the Kv1.3 channel started by location of -27 side chain into the central axis of the pore, followed by  minimization. In the optimal arrangement, Arg-24 of KITX or AgTX forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp-386 carboxyl of one subunit, and Asn-30 is in immediate contact with Asp-386 of the opposing subunit in the tetramer. Toxin residues in proximity to the side chain of -27 (Phe-25, -36, Met-29, and Ser-11 in KITX) interact with the four C-end His-404s. For ChTX the interaction with Asp-386 is reduced, but this is compensated by additional nonbonded interactions formed by -36 and Arg-34. Comparison of calculated  of interaction of these specific toxin-channel residues with experimental studies reveals good agreement. The similar total calculated  of interaction is consistent with the similar IC50 for Kv1.3 block by KITX and AgTX. Steric contacts of residues in position 380 of the S5-P linker with residues on the upper part of toxins permit reconstruction of the K+ channel outer vestibule walls, which are about 30 A apart and about 9 A high. Molecular modeling shows complementarity of the pore model to toxin spacial structures, and supports the proposal that the N-terminal borders of the P regions surround residues of their C-terminal halves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8601843>Amino acid pair interchanges at spatially conserved locations.</a></h1><p>Here we study the pattern of amino acid interchanges at spatially, locally conserved regions in globally dissimilar and unrelated proteins. By using a method which completely separates the amino acid sequence from its respective structure, this work addresses the question of which properties of the amino acids are the most crucial for the stability of conserved structural motifs. The proteins are taken from a structurally non-redundant dataset. The spatially conserved substructural motifs are defined as consisting of a "large enough" number of Calpha atoms found to provide a geometric match between two proteins, regardless of the order of the Calpha atoms in the sequence, or of the sequence composition of the substructures. This approach can apply to proteins with little or no sequence similarity but with sufficient structural similarity, and is unique in its ability to handle local, non-topological matches between pairs of dissimilar proteins. The method uses a computer-version based algorithm, the Geometric Hashing. Since the Geometric Hashing ignores sequence information it lends itself to answer the question posed above. The interchanges at geometrically similar positions that have been obtained with our method demonstrate the expected behaviour. Yet, a closer inspection reveals some distant characteristics, as compared with interchanges based upon sequence-order based techniques, or from -contact-based considerations. First, a pronounced division of the amino acids into two classes is displayed: , Glu, Arg, Gln, Asp, Asn, Pro, Gly, , Ser and His on the one hand, and Ile, Val, Leu, Phe, Met, , Trp, Cys and Ala on the other. These groups further cluster into subgroups: , Glu, Arg, Gln; Asp Asn; Pro, Gly; Ile, Val, Leu, Phe. The other amino acids stand alone. Analysis of the conservation among amino acids indicates proline to be consistently, by far, the most conserved. Next are Asp, Glu,  and Gly. Cys is also highly conserved. Interestingly, oppositely charged amino acids are interchanged roughly as frequently as those of the same charge. These observations can be explained in terms of the three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Most of all, there is a clear distinction between residues which prefer to be on the protein surfaces, compared to those frequently buried in the interiors. Analysis of the interchanges indicates their low information content. This, together with the separation into two groups, suggest that the predictive value of the spatial positions of the Calpha+ atoms is not much greater than the sequence alone, aside from their hydrophobicity/hydrophillicity classification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7410430>Allophycocyanin from Nostoc sp. phycobilisomes. Properties and amino acid sequence at the NH2 terminus of the alpha and beta subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III.</a></h1><p>Allophycocyanin from Nostoc sp. phycobilisomes was separated into four spectrally distinct components designated allophycocyanin I, B, II, and III by adsorption chromatography on brushite columns. Allophycocyanins I and B had red-shifted fluorescence emission maxima, and on this basis, may function in transfer of excitation  from phycobilisomes to chlorophyll a. Allophycyanins II and III, which together comprise 70% of the total allophycocyanin, have absorption maxima at 648 nm and 650 nm, respectively, and probably transfer excitation  from phycocyanin to allophycocyanins I and B, in addition to serving a structural function. Allophycocyanin I was resolved into alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000, 17,000, and 35,000, respectively, whereas allophycocyanin B was resolved into two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 16,100 and 15,300, using a modified Weber and Osborn gel electrophoresis system (Brown, A. S., and Troxler, R. F. (1977) Biochem. J. 163, 571-581). In the same gel system, allophycocyanins II and III were each resolved into alpha and beta subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 17,000, respectively. The subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and the amino acid compositions determined. Automated sequence analysis demonstrated that the first 30 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of alpha subunits, and the beta subunits, of allophycocyanins I to III were identical. alpha Subunits: Ser-Ile-Val---Ser-Ile-Val-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg--Leu-Ser-Pro-Gly -Glu-Leu-Asp-Arg-Ile--Ser-Phe-Val-- beta Subunits: Ala-Gln-Asp-Ala-Ile--Ala-Val-Ile-Asn-Ala-Ala-Asp-Val-Gln-Gly---Leu-Asp-Ala--Ala-Leu-Ser--Leu--Ala-- The gamma subunit of allophycocyanin I and both subunits of allophycocyanin B appeared to be blocked at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that the allophycocyanin B subunits may be different gene products than those of allophycocyanins I to III, or if the same, the subunits of allophycocyanin B undergo proteolytic modification after initial synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460665>Metabolizable  and standardized ileal digestible amino acid contents of expeller-extracted canola meal fed to broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestible amino acid (AA) and AMEn contents of expeller-extracted canola meal (EECM) fed to broiler chicks. One hundred forty-four broiler chicks were divided into 24 groups of 6 birds balanced for BW and fed 4 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups per diet) from d 14 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal-based basal diet formulated to meet NRC nutrient requirements, the basal diet with - and AA-yielding ingredients replaced by 30% of either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM, and a low-protein casein-cornstarch-based diet. The SECM, which is commonly used in formulating poultry diets, was fed for comparison with EECM, whereas the casein-cornstarch-based diet was fed to estimate basal endogenous AA losses for determining standardized ileal digestibility of AA. All 4 diets contained titanium oxide (0.3%) as an indigestible marker, and nutrient digestibility and retention were determined by the substitution method. From d 19 to 21, excreta samples were collected for AMEn determination. On d 21, the birds were killed by cervical dislocation, and contents of the whole ileum were obtained for determination of AA digestibility. Expeller-extracted canola meal had greater (P<0.05) standardized ileal digestible contents of Gly, Leu, Ser, , Asp, and Glu and tended to have greater (P<0.10) standardized ileal digestible contents of Ile, , Phe, Ala, and  than SECM. Compared with SECM, EECM had greater (P<0.001) AMEn (2,694 vs. 1,801 kcal/kg). The results show that the EECM evaluated in the current study had greater standardized ileal digestible AA and AMEn contents than SECM, and hence, it may be a better source of protein and  for broiler chicks than SECM. The standardized ileal digestible AA and AMEn values of EECM used in the current study could be used when formulating broiler chicken diets using the same to minimize the N excretion and feeding cost.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h1><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, , Phe, Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615519>Stereochemical studies of the monocyclic agouti-related protein (103-122) Arg-Phe-Phe residues: conversion of a melanocortin-4 receptor antagonist into an agonist and results in the discovery of a potent and selective melanocortin-1 agonist.</a></h1><p>The agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of the centrally expressed melanocortin receptors. The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in  homeostasis, food intake, sexual function, and obesity. The endogenous hAGRP protein is 132 amino acids in length, possesses five disulfide bridges at the C-terminus of the molecule, and is expressed in the hypothalamus of the brain. We have previously reported that a monocyclic hAGRP(103-122) peptide is an antagonist at the melanocortin receptors expressed in the brain. Stereochemical inversion from the endogenous l- to d-isomers of single or multiple amino acid modifications in this monocyclic truncated hAGRP sequence resulted in molecules that are converted from melanocortin receptor antagonists into melanocortin receptor agonists. The Asp-Pro-Ala-Ala--Ala--cyclo[Cys-Arg-DPhe-DPhe-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]--Ala-Arg--Leu peptide resulted in a 60 nM melanocortin-1 receptor agonist that is 100-fold selective versus the mMC4R, 1000-fold selective versus the mMC3R, and ca. 180-fold selective versus the mMC5R. In attempts to identify putative ligand-receptor interactions that may be participating in the agonist induced stimulation of the MC4R, selected ligands were docked into a homology molecular model of the mMC4R. These modeling studies have putatively identified hAGRP ligand DArg111-mMC4RAsn115 (TM3) and the hAGRP DPhe113-mMC4RPhe176 (TM4) interactions as important for agonist activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013793>In Silico Screening of Antibacterial Compounds from Herbal Sources Against Vibrio cholerae.</a></h1><p>The prolonged use of antibiotic viz., tetracycline, quinolones, ampicillin, etc., to reduce the infection of cholera, may failed due to the emergence of new Vibrio cholerae antibiotics resistant strains. Moreover, these antibiotics even restricted for patient suffering from severe dehydration. Hence, there is a call to find an alternative therapeutics against V. cholerae. The natures serve different herbs in its lap which might contain several natural therapeutic compounds almost all diseases. Computer-aided designing is the initial steps for screening the novel inhibitors.To identify and evaluate natural compounds with low side effects with high efficacy against V. cholerae has been done.In silico screening, absorption, digestion, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and docking of herbal compounds have been performed on to the target ToxT (transcriptional activator of V. cholerae). The compound with good ADME properties and drug-likeness property were subjected to docking.From 70 herbal compounds, some compounds such as aloin, campesterol, lupeol, and ursolic acid showed a violation of the rule of five and compounds such as lupeol and beta carotene showed negative binding . Luteolin, catechin, brevifolin, etc., compounds were selected based on ADME, drug-likeness property, and docking studies.Two compounds named catechin and luteolin showed better inhibition properties against ToxT and good ADME and drug-likeness property were selected as a better lead molecule for drug development in future. The Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking fitness score for catechin is 48.74 kcal/mol and luteolin 38.12 kcal/mol.Vibrio cholerae became antibiotic resistance and associated with several cholera epidemic and pandemic. Hence, there is a need to find an alternative therapeutics against V. cholerae. Many herbal compounds present in nature having high medicinal value.

This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-, Asn, Gln, , Glu, Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, , Trp, and His. The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573843>Triennial Lactation Symposium: Mammary metabolism of amino acids in dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met, Phe (+), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, , , and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of Phe+ uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling Phe supply did not result in mammary oxidation of Phe+ and either limited or no contribution of peptides to Phe and  mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and ) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing  supply decreased  U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and , does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the  U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than  supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for  provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and  supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9271505>Functional effects on the acetylcholine receptor of multiple mutations of gamma Asp174 and delta Asp180.</a></h1><p>Residues gamma Asp174 and delta Asp180, previously implicated in the binding of acetylcholine (ACh) by the mouse muscle ACh receptor, were each mutated to nine other residues, Asn, Glu, , Ala, Cys, His, Val, , and . The effects of the mutations on ACh-induced current was determined on surface receptors containing wild-type alpha and beta subunits and mutant gamma and delta subunits. The mutations increased the concentration of ACh eliciting half-maximal current (EC50) by factors from 22 for the Glu mutant to 660 for the  mutant. Analysis of the effects in terms of the difference in the accessible surface areas of the mutant and wild-type side chains and the difference in side-chain charges indicated that, per binding site, Delta DeltaG0 for activation was a sum of 10 cal mol-1 A-2 of change in side-chain accessible surface area and of 0.95 kcal mol-1 positive step-1 in side-chain charge, equivalent to 1 mol of charge falling through 42 mV. The effects on the concentration of ACh (IC50, ACh) and of d-tubocurarine (IC50,dTC) causing half-maximal retardation of alpha-bungarotoxin binding were determined on complexes containing wild-type alpha and beta subunits and either mutant gamma or mutant delta subunit. The effects on IC50,ACh correlated well with the effects on EC50, with a similar magnitude for the influence of side-chain charge on the free  of binding (in this case to the desensitized state) and on the electrostatic potential at the binding site. The effects on IC50,dTC were in all cases less than the effects on IC50,ACh, and the two sets of effects were poorly correlated. In line with the higher ACh affinity and lower d-tubocurarine affinity of the alpha-delta binding site compared to the alpha-gamma binding site, mutations of delta Asp180 had a greater effect on IC50,ACh than did the same mutations of gamma Asp174, and vice versa for effects on IC50,dTC. Consequently, all mutations decreased the asymmetry in the binding properties of the two types of sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23781980>Amino acid/water interactions study: a new amino acid scale.</a></h1><p>Partition ratios of 8 free l-amino acids (Gln, Glu, His, , Met, Ser, , and ) were measured in 10 different polymer/polymer aqueous two-phase systems containing 0.15 M NaCl in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.

The correlation between wettability and adhesion with the alternative substitution by hydrophobic Ala and hydrophilic  in the synthetic RMAPs in aqueous solution and as films on high and low surface free  (sfe) surfaces has been investigated by surface chemical approaches. The side chain moieties of RMAPs arrange their local conformation to adapt to the inherent surface character, and they orientate on high and low sfe surfaces. On a high sfe glass the hydrophilic side chains of the RMAP molecules face toward the surface, and on a low sfe polyethylene (HDPE) the hydrophobic side chains face toward the surface. The bonding strengths of synthetic RMAPs on glass and HDPE with and without enzymatic oxidation have been examined. Increased starting concentration exhibited the strongest adhesive capability (7.5 kgf/cm2) on alumina due to the increased cohesion among RMAP molecules. As another factor to increase adhesive ability, the intermolecular cross-linking among RMAP molecules by tyrosinase increases their adhesive capability by about 20% on HDPE, glass, and alumina except iron.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10413483>Effects of structure on alpha C-H bond enthalpies of amino acid residues: relevance to H transfers in enzyme mechanisms and in protein oxidation.</a></h1><p>The bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) of all of the amino acid residues, modeled by HC(O)NHCH(R)C(O)NH(2) (PH(res)), were determined at the B3LYP/6-31G//B3LYP/6-31G level, coupled with isodesmic reactions. The results for neutral side chains with phi, psi angles approximately 180 degrees, approximately 180 degrees in ascending order, to an expected accuracy of +/-10 kJ mol(-)(1), are Asn 326; cystine 330; Asp 332; Gln 334; Trp 337; Arg 340;  340; Met 343; His 344; Phe 344;  344; Leu 344; Ala 345; Cys 346; Ser 349; Gly 350; Ile 351; Val 352; Glu 354;  357; Pro-cis 358; Pro-trans 369. BDEs calculated at the ROMP2/6-31G//B3LYP/6-31G level exhibit the same trends but are approximately 7 kJ mol(-)(1) higher. All BDEs are smaller than those of typical secondary or tertiary C-H bonds due to the phenomenon of captodative stabilization. The stabilization is reduced by changes in the phi,psi angles. As a result the BDEs increase by about 10 kJ mol(-)(1) in beta-sheet and 40 kJ mol(-)(1) in alpha-helical environments, respectively. In effect the alpha C-H BDEs can be "tuned" from about 345 to 400 kJ mol(-)(1) by adjusting the local environment.

Solvation followed by MD studies of the ternary protein complex revealed the presence of seven water molecules in the interfacial region of the interacting proteins. Three of the seven water molecules (W 79, W 437, and W 606) bridged the three proteins by forming the hydrogen bonded network (with the distances approximately 2.10-2.95 A) between the  81 (RCy), Glu 61 (Cyt c4), and Asp 135 (CcO). Another water molecule W 603 was H-bonded to  122 (CcO) and interconnected the  81 (RCy) and Asp 135 (CcO) through the water molecules W 606 and W 437.

Molecular dynamic simulation results revealed that complex 2 (-ethyl-5'-carboxamido adenosine and kiss2r protein is better than complex 1 (2-(4-(2-Carboxyethyl) phenethylamino)-5'--ethylcarboxamidoadenosine and kiss2r protein) and its connotation in drug designing. The outcome of this work sheds light on the protein modeling, molecular docking and virtual screening of agonist ligands against kiss2 and thus may significantly contribute in designing and optimizing therapeutic strategies to cure various reproductive dysfunctions in fish.

On d 43, 240 broiler chickens were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicate cages per diet in a completely randomized design. Each experimental diet was fed for 5 d (d 43-48). All diets were free of nitrogen with 2 ratios of corn starch-to-dextrose (0.31 and 1.04) and 2 levels of DEB (108 and 219 mEq/kg of diet). Final BW and BW loss between birds fed the 2 corn starch-to-dextrose ratios and between birds fed 2 levels of DEB were not different (P > 0.05). Birds fed the diet containing a high level of DEB consumed less (P < 0.05) feed than birds on the low-DEB diet. Birds on the high-corn starch-to-dextrose (1.04) diet showed a tendency for higher (P = 0.08) feed intake. High dietary dextrose level (corn starch-to-dextrose ratio of 0.31) resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal DM and  digestibility. A high level of DEB resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal endogenous nitrogen loss. Arginine, Ile, Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, Glu, Gly, Pro, and  secretion into the gut increased (P ≤ 0.05) with an increasing level of DEB. Endogenous His, , , Asp, Cys, and Ser showed a tendency for increased (P ≤ 0.1) losses with a high level of DEB. Mean ileal EAA losses for the indispensable and dispensable amino acids for the low-DEB diet were 81 and 82%, respectively, that of the birds fed the high-DEB diet. The 4 amino acids with the lowest endogenous flow were Met, His, , and Cys, whereas the highest endogenous flow was found in Glu, Asp, Val, and Leu. Data from the current study showed that EAA losses in the ileum of broiler chickens are significantly affected by DEB, but not by the ratio of corn starch to dextrose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566595>Effect of inclusion level of corn germ meal on the digestible and metabolizable  and evaluation of ileal AA digestibility of corn germ meal fed to growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of inclusion level of corn germ meal (CGM) on the DE and ME values of CGM and to evaluate the ileal AA digestibility of CGM fed to growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 42 barrows (63.8 ± 2.1 kg BW) were allotted to seven diets in a completely randomized design with six replicates per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and six additional diets containing 4.85%, 9.70%, 19.40%, 29.10%, 38.80%, or 48.50% CGM. Pigs were fed twice daily, at 0730 and 1630 hours, at a level of 4% of BW, and feces and urine were collected for 5 d. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, CP, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract, and the DE and ME in diets linearly decreased (P < 0.01) as dietary CGM increased. Inclusion level of CGM had no effect on the DE and ME values of CGM. On a DM basis, the concentration of DE and ME varied from 3,396 to 3,747 kcal/kg and 3,107 to 3,502 kcal/kg, respectively. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (30.4 ± 2.9 kg BW) with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were allotted to an 11 × 6 Youden square design with 11 diets and 6 period, which included an N-free diet and 10 CGM test diets. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was included in all diets as an indigestible marker. Pigs were fed daily at 4% of BW during each period, which consisted of 5 d of diet adaptation followed by 2 d of digesta collection. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of Ile, , and Ala and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and Ile varied (P < 0.01) among the 10 CGM. The AID of CP and all AA except Pro and , and the SID of all AA except Pro were the greatest (P < 0.05) in sample 7. The AID and SID of CP averaged 40.47% and 64.75%, respectively, and varied from 32.30% to 54.87% and from 57.48% to 72.15%, respectively. The average SID of , Met, , and Trp was 65.61%, 76.15%, 65.29%, and 60.17%, respectively, with a SEM of 4.49, 2.40, 5.95, and 6.82, respectively. The average SID of Pro was 101.76%, with an SEM of 17.26. Increasing dietary CGM decreased the ATTD of nutrients, the DE and ME values of diets but CGM. The AID and SID of AA in CGM are low but source dependent, and CGM may be fed to pigs as an protein-rich feedstuff.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26170631>Adaptive evolution and elucidating the potential inhibitor against schizophrenia to target DAOA (G72) isoforms.</a></h1><p>Schizophrenia (SZ), a chronic mental and heritable disorder characterized by neurophysiological impairment and neuropsychological abnormalities, is strongly associated with D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA, G72). Research studies emphasized that overexpression of DAOA may be responsible for improper functioning of neurotransmitters, resulting in neurological disorders like SZ. In the present study, a hybrid approach of comparative modeling and molecular docking followed by inhibitor identification and structure modeling was employed. Screening was performed by two-dimensional similarity search against selected inhibitor, keeping in view the physiochemical properties of the inhibitor. Here, we report an inhibitor compound which showed maximum binding affinity against four selected isoforms of DAOA. Docking studies revealed that Glu-53, -54, -58, Val-85, Ser-86, -87, Leu-88, Glu-90, Leu-95, Val-98, Ser-100, Glu-112, -116, -120, Asp-121, and Arg-122 are critical residues for receptor-ligand interaction. The C-terminal of selected isoforms is conserved, and binding was observed on the conserved region of isoforms. We propose that selected inhibitor might be more potent on the basis of binding  values. Further analysis of this inhibitor through site-directed mutagenesis could be helpful for exploring the details of ligand-binding pockets. Overall, the findings of this study may be helpful in designing novel therapeutic targets to cure SZ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23976829>Three dimensional (3D) structure prediction and substrate-protein interaction study of the chitin binding protein CBP24 from B. thuringiensis.</a></h1><p>Bacillus thuringiensis is an insecticidal bacterium whose chitinolytic system has been exploited to improve insect resistance in crops. In the present study, we studied the CBP24 from B. thuringiensis using homology modeling and molecular docking. The primary and secondary structure analyses showed CBP24 is a positively charged protein and contains single domain that belongs to family CBM33. The 3D model after refinement was used to explore the chitin binding characteristics of CBP24 using AUTODOCK. The docking analyses have shown that the surface exposed hydrophilic amino acid residues -103, -112 and Ser-162 interact with substrate through H-bonding. While, the amino acids resides Glu-39, -46, Ser-104 and Asn-109 were shown to have polar interactions with the substrate. The binding  values evaluation of docking depicts a stable intermolecular conformation of the docked complex. The functional characterization of the CBP24 will elucidate the substrate-interaction pathway of the protein in specific and the carbohydrate binding proteins in general leading towards the exploration and exploitation of the prokaryotic substrate utilization pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28657434>Quick elucidation of cyclodepsipeptide sequence from sacoglossan Elysia grandifolia using electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Butanol fraction of sacoglossan Elysia grandifolia was investigated for identifying peptides using electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Without prior isolation, the structural determination is achieved on the basis of mass fragmentation pattern and comparison with the previously established data. The ESI-MS of the fraction in the positive ion mode gave clusters of singly and doubly charged molecular ion peaks. The ESI-MS spectrum showed peaks for the presence of the peptides kahalalides F, G, R and S reported earlier. In addition, it also showed molecular ion peaks at m/z 1557.8 [M+H] and doubly charged ions at m/z 779.4 [M+2H], 790.4 [M+Na] and 796.4 [M+K]. The MS/MS at m/z 779.4 [M+2H] at collision  40 V obtained series of b and y fragment ions. The MS/MS spectrum showed identical fragment ion y at m/z 643 which revealed that cyclic part is identical with kahalalide F, R and S. Careful examination of the fragment ions b to b with their corresponding y fragment ions y to y, respectively and by comparison of MS/MS pattern of kahalalide S, established that proline can be replaced by tyrosine amino acid residue. The mass difference between b ( m/z 511) and b ( m/z 674) is equal to 163 which is equivalent to mass residue of tyrosine. Their y fragment ions also quickly helped in fixing the puzzle. This resulted in the identification of the peptide sequence cyclo-[Val-(5-MeHex-Val--Val-Val---Ile)-Ile-Val-Phe-Dhb)] for the new cyclodepsipeptide, kahalalide Z. Thus, ESI-MS/MS has set a trend in quick identification of new marine molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537772>Effect of feed intake on endogenous losses and amino acid and  digestibility by growing pigs.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of feed intake (FI) on endogenous losses and the digestibility of CP and AA by growing pigs. Six growing barrows (initial BW = 70.3 kg) had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum and were used in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. A soybean meal cornstarch-based diet and a N-free diet were formulated. Chromic oxide (0.25%; as-fed basis) was included in both diets as an inert marker. Each diet was provided at three different levels of FI. Feed intake level 1 was equal to the estimated  requirement for maintenance of the pigs, whereas levels 2 and 3 were two or three times this amount, respectively. Each experimental period lasted 7 d. The initial 4 d of each period comprised an adaptation period to the experimental diets. On d 5, fecal samples were collected, while ileal digesta were collected during two 10-h periods on d 6 and 7. Between each experimental period, a corn-soybean meal-based diet (16% CP) was fed to all pigs for 7 d. The basal ileal endogenous losses (IAA(end)) of CP and AA were measured for each level of FI from pigs fed the N-free diet. Likewise, the apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility coefficients for CP and AA in soybean meal were calculated for each level of FI. The total-tract digestibility coefficient of  in the soybean meal-based diet also was calculated. The AID for CP and all indispensable AA except , Met, and  increased (P < or =0.055) as FI increased. The IAA(end) of CP and all AA except Pro decreased linearly (P < 0.05) as FI increased when expressed as g/kg of DMI; however, the total daily IAA(end) increased as FI increased (linear, P < or =0.056) for all AA, except for Phe, , Trp, Val, Cys, Gly, and Ser. The AA composition (% of CP) of endogenous protein was not affected by the level of FI, except for Arg, , Pro, and Ser. As FI increased, the SID decreased linearly (P < 0.04) for CP and all AA, except Arg, Trp, Asp, Pro, and . The total-tract digestibility of  was not influenced by the FI level. These results demonstrate that the FI level significantly influenced AID, SID, and IAA(end) for CP and AA. Therefore, pigs used to measure AA digestibility coefficients and IAA(end) should be fed at a level that is close to what is used under commercial conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14691219>Effect of the N3 residue on the stability of the alpha-helix.</a></h1><p>N3 is the third position from the N terminus in the alpha-helix with helical backbone dihedral angles. All 20 amino acids have been placed in the N3 position of a synthetic helical peptide (CH(3)CO-[AAX AAAAKAAAAKAGY]-NH(2)) and the helix content measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 273 K. The dependence of peptide helicity on N3 residue identity has been used to determine a free  scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix coil theory that includes a parameter for the N3  (n3). The most stabilizing residues at N3 in rank order are Ala, Glu, Met/Ile, Leu, , Ser, Gln, , , Phe, Asp, His, and Trp. Free energies for the most destabilizing residues (Cys, Gly, Asn, Arg, and Pro) could not be fitted. The results correlate with N1, N2, and helix interior energies and not at all with N-cap preferences. This completes our work on studying the structural and energetic preferences of the amino acids for the N-terminal positions of the alpha-helix. These results can be used to rationally modify protein stability, help design helices, and improve prediction of helix location and stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854661>Are acidic and basic groups in buried proteins predicted to be ionized?</a></h1><p>Ionizable residues play essential roles in proteins, modulating protein stability, fold and function. Asp, Glu, Arg, and  make up about a quarter of the residues in an average protein. Multi-conformation continuum electrostatic (MCCE) calculations were used to predict the ionization states of all acidic and basic residues in 490 proteins. Of all 36,192 ionizable residues, 93.5% were predicted to be ionized. Thirty-five percent have lost 4.08 kcal/mol solvation  (DeltaDeltaG(rxn)) sufficient to shift a pK(a) by three pH units in the absence of other interactions and 17% have DeltaDeltaG(rxn) sufficient to shift pK(a) by five pH units. Overall 85% of these buried residues (DeltaDeltaG(rxn)>5DeltapK units) are ionized, including 92% of the Arg, 86% of the Asp, 77% of the Glu, and 75% of the . Ion-pair interactions stabilize the ionization of both acids and bases. The backbone dipoles stabilize anions more than cations. The interactions with polar side-chains are also different for acids and bases. Asn and Gln stabilize all charges, Ser and  stabilize only acids while  rarely stabilize . Thus, hydroxyls are better hydrogen bond donors than acceptors. Buried ionized residues are more likely to be conserved than those on the surface. There are 3.95 residues buried per 100 residues in an average protein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8289284>Determination of alpha-helix propensity within the context of a folded protein. Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h1><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, Asn, Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and  the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, , Trp and Phe prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free  values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1518799>NMR docking of a substrate into the X-ray structure of staphylococcal nuclease.</a></h1><p>The conformation of the staphylococcal nuclease-bound metal-dTdA complex, previously determined by NMR methods [Weber, D.J., Mullen, G.P., Mildvan, A.S.

(1989) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 5:183-201] by superimposing the metal ions, taking into account intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects from assigned aromatic proton resonances of -85, -113, and -115 to proton resonances of the leaving dA moiety of dTdA, and  minimization to relieve small overlaps. The proton resonances of the Phe, , and Trp residues of the enzyme in the ternary enzyme-La(3+)-dTdA complex were sequence specifically assigned by 2D phase-sensitive NOESY, with and without deuteration of the aromatic protons of the  residues, and by 2D heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) spectroscopy and 3D NOESY-HMQC spectroscopy with 15N labeling. While resonances of most Phe,  and Trp residues were unshifted by the substrate dTdA from those found in the enzyme-La(3+)-3',5'-pdTp complex and the enzyme-Ca(2+)-3',5'-pdTp complex, proton resonances of -85, -113, -115, and Phe-34 were shifted by 0.08 to 0.33 ppm and the 15N resonance of -113 was shifted by 2.1 ppm by the presence of substrate. The optimized position of enzyme-bound dTdA shows the 5'-dA leaving group to partially overlap the inhibitor, 3',5'-pdTp (in the X-ray structure). The 3'-TMP moiety of dTdA points toward the solvent in a channel defined by Ile-18, Asp-19, -22, -45, and His-46. The phosphate of dTdA is coordinated by the metal, and an adjacent inner sphere water ligand is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the general base Glu-43 and to attack the phosphorus with inversion. Arg-35 and Arg-87 donate monodentate hydrogen bonds to different phosphate oxygens of dTdA, with Arg-87 positioned to protonate the leaving 5'-oxygen of dA, thus clarifying the mechanism of hydrolysis. Model building of an additional 5'-dGMP onto the 3'-oxygen of dA placed this third nucleotide onto a surface cleft near residues Glu-80, Asp-83, -84, and -115 with its 3'-OH group accessible to the solvent, thus defining the size of the substrate binding site as accommodating a trinucleotide.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706905>Interaction of Quercetin of Onion with Axon Guidance Protein Receptor, NRP-1 Plays Important Role in Cancer Treatment: An In Silico Approach.</a></h1><p>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor whose distinct sites bind semaphorins and vascular endothelial growth factor family members to mediate the role of these ligands in neuronal axon guidance and angiogenesis, respectively. Similarly, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands play critical roles in various biological functions, and deregulated activation of Eph/ephrin signaling in humans is thought to lead to tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate the inhibition potential of nine bioactive compounds from four different native spices of Bangladesh against this couple of receptors via molecular docking study. The molecular docking study was carried out using Vina docking protocol. Finally, the receptor-ligand interaction analysis was carried out using the Discovery Studio Client package. Quercetin and diosgenin of onion showed favorable binding with NRP-1 with low binding  of -7.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in comparison with the control inhibitor (-6.1 kcal/mol).

In Expt. 1 and 3, metabolizable  (AME) content was evaluated for 2 batches of bean starch concentrate (BSC) that differed in physical and chemical characteristics. Standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) was determined for BSC in Expt. 2, and for corn, soybean meal (SBM), organic and conventional faba beans, and quinoa (Expt. 4). The growth performance response of broiler chickens to partial replacement of wheat and SBM with various legumes was investigated in Expt. 5. The AME of the BSC assayed in Expt. 1 was lower (P < 0.01) than that of the BSC assayed in Expt. 3. The SIAAD was generally high for BSC in Expt. 2 although the content and digestibility of sulfur amino acids were low. In Expt. 4, there was no difference in SIAAD of Arg, Phe, Asp, and Gly among the different feedstuffs assayed. SIAAD was largely similar for both conventional and organic faba bean. The SIAADs of Met, , Ser, and  were lower (P < 0.05) for quinoa compared with SBM or corn. In Expt. 5, FCR was greater (P < 0.05) for broiler chickens receiving faba beans+barley mix or lupins compared with the wheat-SBM control diet. Amino acid digestibility was greater (P < 0.01) for the diets containing lupins compared with the other diets except for , Met, , Ala, Asp, and Ser. On the other hand, amino acid digestibility in diet with faba beans+barley mix was lower (P < 0.05) compared with all the other diets, except for Arg, Asp, , and . It was concluded from the current studies that there is scope for using the assayed legumes, co-products, and quinoa in broiler chickens to partly replace SBM as protein feedstuffs.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6298211>Evidence for a repeating 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine- and hydroxyproline-containing decapeptide in the adhesive protein of the mussel, Mytilus edulis L.</a></h1><p>Previous work has shown that the permanent adhesive of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis is a protein containing large amounts of hydroxyproline (13%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa, 11%). The protein also known as the polyphenolic protein is produced and stored in the exocrine phenol gland of the mussel and deposited onto marine surfaces by the animal's foot during the formation of new adhesive plaques. The adhesive protein has been purified by a combination of ion exchange on sulfonylpropyl-Sephadex and gel filtration on low surface  chromatographic media.

Treatment of the protein with clostridial collagenase reduced the molecular weight by less than 10%. The collagenase-resistant fragment contains most or all of the Hyp and Dopa. Trypsin treatment of the polyphenolic protein results in extensive degradation. The major tryptic peptide (80%) contains 10 amino acids including Hyp and Dopa and was shown by sequence analysis to be H2N-Ala--Pro-Ser--Hyp-Hyp--Dopa--COOH.

The method is not restricted to proteins and can be applied without modification to nonpolar hydrogens and to nucleic acids. The method has been applied to the neutron diffraction structures of trypsin, ribonuclease A, and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.

The purification steps consisted of (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, Blue Sepharose affinity chromatography and gel filtration. A typical procedure provided 685-fold purification with 58% yield. The Mr of the holoenzyme was estimated to be 322,000 by gel filtration and 316,000 by ultracentrifugation. The enzyme migrated as a single polypeptide spot on two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis with an Mr of 38,500, suggesting that the holoenzyme consists of eight identical subunits. This is the first case where malate dehydrogenase has been shown to be a homo-octamer; malate dehydrogenases from other sources are predominantly homodimers, with two homotetramers reported so far. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined and the N-terminal sequence of the subunit polypeptide was found to be Arg--Val-Ala-Val-Met-Gly-Ala-Ala-Gly-Gly-Ile-Gly-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ser-Leu- Leu-Leu - -Leu-Ser-Pro-Gln-Val--Glu-Leu-Ser---. For the first 21 amino acid residues, near-identical sequences were reported for the enzymes isolated from pig heart, Escherichia coli, yeast and watermelon.

The MS/MS data are required for the analysis of those peptides in ovine plasma in a study to determine the placental transfer of the peptide to the fetus. The synthetic enkephalin-related peptides were: -D-Arg-Phe--NH2, (DALDA), N,N-diallyl--Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH, (ICI 174,864), -D--Gly-Phe-Leu-, (DTLET), -D-Pen-Gly-Phe-D-Pen-OH, (DPDPE), and D-Phe-Cys--D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2, (CTAP). Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) was used for sample desorption-ionization, and a hybrid (E1BE2qQ) tandem mass spectrometer was used to collect the product-ion spectra. A protonated molecule ion, [M + H]+, was observed for each peptide. Amino acid sequence-determining fragment ion were produced by CID and collected by MS/MS for the three linear peptides, and also for the two disulfide-bond-containing peptides in their unreduced and dithiothreitol (DTT)-reduced forms. The detection level for the [M + H]+ ion of DTLET was ca. 3 pmol; and the stabilities of the CTAP and ICI analogs in plasma were studied.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16803886>Importance in catalysis of the 6-phosphate-binding site of 6-phosphogluconate in sheep liver 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.</a></h1><p>The 6-phosphate of 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) is proposed to anchor the sugar phosphate in the active site and aid in orientating the substrate for catalysis. In order to test this hypothesis, alanine mutagenesis was used to probe the contribution of residues in the vicinity of the 6-phosphate to binding of 6PG and catalysis. The crystal structure of sheep liver 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase shows that -191, -260, -262, Arg-287, and Arg-446 contribute a mixture of ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the 6-phosphate, and these interactions are likely to provide the majority of the binding  for 6PG. All mutant enzymes, with the exception of T262A, exhibit an increase in K(6PG) that ranges from 5- to 800-fold. There is also a less pronounced increase in K(NADP), ranging from 3- to 15-fold, with the exception of T262A. The R287A and R446A mutant enzymes exhibit a dramatic decrease in V/E(t) (600- and 300-fold, respectively) as well as in V/K(6PG)E(t) (10(5) - and 10(4)-fold), and therefore no further characterization was carried out with these two mutant enzymes. No change in V/E(t) was observed for the Y191A mutant enzyme, whereas 20- and 3-fold decreases were obtained for the K260A and T262A mutant enzymes, respectively, resulting in a decrease in V/K(6PG)E(t) range from 3- to 120-fold. All mutant enzymes also exhibit at least an order of magnitude increase in 13C-isotope effect -1, indicating that the decarboxylation step has become more rate-limiting. Data are consistent with significant roles for -191, -260, -262, Arg-287, and Arg-446 in providing the binding  for 6PG. In addition, these residues also likely ensure proper orientation of 6PG for catalysis and aid in inducing the conformation change that precedes, and sets up the active site for, catalysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8085828>Growth requirements of hyperthermophilic sulfur-dependent heterotrophic archaea isolated from a shallow submarine geothermal system with reference to their essential amino acids.</a></h1><p>Three hyperthermophilic sulfur-dependent heterotrophs were isolated from a shallow submarine hydrothermal system at an inlet of Kodakara-jima island, Kagoshima, Japan. The isolates grew at 60 to 97 degrees C, with the optimum temperatures at 85 to 90 degrees C. Sensitivity to rifampin and the existence of ether lipids indicated that the isolates are hyperthermophilic archaea. Partial sequencing of the genes coding for 16S rRNA showed that the three isolates are closely related to the genus Thermococcus. They grew on proteinaceous mixtures, such as yeast extract, Casamino Acids, and purified proteins (e.g., casein and gelatin), but not on carbohydrates or organic acids as sole carbon and  sources. Nine amino acids were essential for growth of isolate KS-1 (, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe, His, , and Arg). Isolate KS-2 required  in addition to the nine amino acids, and KS-8 required  instead of . In comparative studies, it was shown that Thermococcus celer DSM 2476 required 10 amino acids (, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe, , Trp, , and Arg) while Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638 required only Ile and Val. The hyperthermophilic fermentative eubacterium Thermotoga neapolitana DSM 4359 did not require any amino acids for growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12214994>Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of protein amino acids on growth rate and efficiency of mixed ruminal bacteria.</a></h1><p>Mixed ruminal bacteria were incubated in vitro with glucose, xylose, cellobiose, and various protein amino acids replaced isonitrogenously with 25% (i.e., 25 mg of N/L) of ammonia-N, to determine the growth rate and the amount of sugar consumed in the exponential growth phase. The growth rate and efficiency (grams of bacteria per gram of sugars) increased by 46 and 15%, respectively, when a mixture of 20 amino acids was added. On the other hand, neither growth rate nor efficiency increased when any one of these amino acids was added singly, except for Glu and Gln, each of which produced significant but small improvements. The stimulatory effect of the combined amino acids on bacterial growth declined when each of Leu, Trp, , Glu, Met, Phe, and Val was removed from the original group of 20. When a mixture of only these seven amino acids was used as a supplement, their stimulatory effects on growth rate and efficiency were only 21 and 25%, respectively, of the effects that the mixture of 20 amino acids showed. The effects increased to 76 and 72% on growth rate and efficiency, respectively, when Gly, Cys, and His were supplied in addition to the seven amino acids. The growth rate and efficiency of the ruminal bacteria were inhibited by an addition of each of Ile, , Cys, Phe, Leu, , or Val to ammonia-N, and the effects of the first five of these amino acids were highly significant. Isoleucine, threonine, and phenylalanine were each inhibitory even at a low concentration (1 mg of NL), while cysteine and leucine showed inhibitory effects at higher concentrations (more than 10 mg of N/L). A higher growth rate of the ruminal bacteria when supplemented with amino acid mixtures was accompanied with a higher growth efficiency, which was attributable to a relatively smaller proportion of  expended on maintenance according to the Pirt derivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423885>Effect of fermented biogas residue on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the effect of fermented biogas residue (FBR) of wheat on the performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.We selected 128 pigs (the mean initial body weight was 40.24±3.08 kg) and randomly allocated them to 4 groups (1 control group and 3 treatment groups) with 4 replicates per group and 8 pigs per pen in a randomized complete block design based on initial body weight and sex. The control group received a corn-soybean meal-based diet, the treatment group fed diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% FBR, respectively (abbreviated as FBR5, FBR10, and FBR15, respectively). Every group received equivalent- and nitrogen diets. The test lasted 60 days and was divided into early and late stages. Blood and carcass samples were obtained on 60 d. Meat quality was collected from two pigs per pen.During the late stage, the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the treatment groups was greater than that of the control group (p<0.05). During the entire experiment, the average daily gain of the treatment groups was higher than that of the control group (p<0.05). Fermented biomass residue did not significantly affect serum biochemical parameters or meat quality, but did affect amino acid profiles in pork. The contents of Asp, Arg, , Phe, Leu, , Ser, , Pro, Ala, essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, and total amino acids in pork of FBR5 and FBR10 were greater than those of the control group (p<0.05).These combined results suggest that feeding FBR could increase the average daily gain and average daily feed intake in pigs and the content of several flavor-promoting amino acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10398816>Tumour uptake of the radiolabelled somatostatin analogue [DOTA0, TYR3]octreotide is dependent on the peptide amount.</a></h1><p>Radiolabelled tumour receptor-binding peptides can be used for in vivo scintigraphic imaging. Recently, the somatostatin analogue [Tyr3]octreotide (D-Phe-c(Cys--D-Trp---Cys)-(ol)) was derivatized with the chelator DOTA (tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic acid), enabling stable radiolabelling with both the high- beta particle-emitter yttrium-90 and the Auger electron-emitter indium-111. The thus produced radiolabelled compounds are promising for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Our previous in vitro and in vivo (rat) experiments with these radiolabelled compounds showed favourable binding and biodistribution characteristics with high uptake and retention in the target organs. We also demonstrated receptor-specific, time- and temperature-dependent internalization of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2)-positive rat pancreatic tumour cell lines. In this study we have investigated the effects of differences in the amount of injected peptide on tissue distribution of 111In-labelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide in normal, i.e. non-tumour-bearing, and CA20948 tumour-bearing rats. This was done in order to find the amount of peptide at which the highest uptake in target tissues is achieved, and thereby to increase the potential of radionuclide therapy while simultaneously ensuring the lowest possible radiotoxicity in normal organs. Uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in sst2-positive organs showed different bell-shaped functions of the amount of injected peptide, being highest at 0.05 (adrenals), 0.05-0. 1 (pituitary and stomach) and 0.25 (pancreas) microg. Uptake in the tumour was highest at 0.5 microg injected peptide. The highest uptake was found at peptide amounts that were lower than those reported for [111In-DTPA0]octreotide ((D-Phe-c(Cys-Phe-D-Trp---Cys)-(ol), DTPA = diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid), consistent with the higher receptor affinity of the first compound. Our observations of mass-dependent differences in uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide, being the resultant of a positive effect of increasing amounts of peptide on, for example, receptor clustering and a negative effect of receptor saturation, are of consequence for rat radionuclide therapy studies with radiolabelled peptides and may also be of consequence for human radionuclide therapy studies with this compound.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6487083>[Effect of the content of crude plant protein in feed on the utilization of urea in dairy cattle. 4. Passage of amino acids through the duodenum].</a></h1><p>Model investigations carried out by means of a re-entrant method at the duodenum with dairy cows and with -equivalent rations (600 EFU cattle/kg DM), which after the supplementation of 11 g urea/kg DM (150 g/animal and day) contained 13.8 (I), 16.7 (II) and 20.2 (III)% crude protein, had the following results: The amino acid profile of the duodenal protein differed from that of the applied rations and was similar to the microbial protein in the rumen. It only changed inconsiderably with the protein level of the ration. There were differences between the amino acids of the feed as to their apparent rate of fermentation in the rumen. Ser, , , and leu apparently proved to be most resistent whereas arg, asp, met, ile and phe were apparently fermented for the most part or completely. The passage rate of amino acids at the duodenum related to intake were, from I ... III 126, 102 and 87%. With all rations there were always net losses of some amino acids (his, arg) and net gains (, , ser, gly, val, met and ) at the duodenum in comparison intake. 15N from urea was incorporated into all the amino acids determined in the duodenal protein, most intensively into glu, ser, asp, ile, gly, his and leu. The apparent digestibility of the total amino acids in the intestines was independent of the crude protein level of the rations and reached 69 ... 71% with a deviation range of 59 ... 81% for the individual amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074782>Available  and amino acid digestibility of yellow dent corn fed to growing pigs1.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the DE and ME as well as the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in corn fed to growing pigs. All corn was yellow dent corn collected from different areas in China. In Exp. 1, 60 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 40.7 ± 3.5 kg BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 10 diets to determine the DE and ME of corns. Diets were formulated to contain 96.8% of 1 of the 10 corn samples and 3.2% of other microingredients. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 30.5 ± 2.3 kg) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were assigned to a 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. Diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets formulated with 96.6% 1 of the 10 corns as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was added to each diet as an indigestible marker for calculating the AA digestibility. On a DM basis, the starch, ether extract (EE), CP, NDF, and ADF contents of corns averaged 74.05% (69.98 to 78.59%), 3.83% (2.04 to 4.73%), 9.63% (7.74 to 10.43%), 10.80% (10.27 to 11.46%), and 2.27% (2.03 to 2.57%), respectively. The CV of EE, CP, and ADF was 22.59, 8.22, and 8.21%, respectively. The DE and ME of corns averaged 4,087 and 3,981 kcal/kg, respectively, and ranged from 3,999 to 4,161 kcal/kg and from 3,898 to 4,067 kcal/kg, respectively. The DE and ME values were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the EE content. Optimal prediction equations of ME were ME = 940.35 + (0.72 × DE) + (21.88 × EE) (R2 = 0.94) or ME = 1,051.50 + (0.82 × DE) - (282.05 × ash) (R2 = 0.99). In Exp. 2, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the SID of Arg, His, Phe, Ala, Pro, Cys, and . The SID of  (average 73.79%), Met (average 87.32%), and  (average 80.06%) ranged from 61.45 to 78.47%, from 74.09 to 90.91%, and from 79.19 to 85.79%, respectively. The standardized ileal digestible Met was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with the Met and CP contents. The obtained prediction equations were standardized ileal digestible Met = 31.34 + (3.43 × CP) + (116.04 × Met) and standardized ileal digestible Met = 104.92 + (294.71 × Met) - (7.03 × NDF). In conclusion, sources had an effect on the  values and ileal digestibility of most AA in corn. The ME can be predicted by the DE combined with either the EE or ash content. The AA concentrations and SID of AA in corn varied largely.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

Current data suggest that cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD harness pmf . Transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions between TonB and ExbD allow the ExbD C terminus to modulate conformational rearrangements of the periplasmic TonB C terminus in vivo. These conformational changes somehow allow energization of high-affinity TonB-gated transporters by direct interaction with TonB. While ExbB is essential for  transduction, its role is not well understood. ExbB has N-terminus-out, C-terminus-in topology with three TMDs. TMDs 1 and 2 are punctuated by a cytoplasmic loop, with the C-terminal tail also occupying the cytoplasm. We tested the hypothesis that ExbB TMD residues play roles in proton translocation. Reassessment of TMD boundaries based on hydrophobic character and residue conservation among distantly related ExbB proteins brought earlier widely divergent predictions into congruence. All TMD residues with potentially function-specific side chains (, Cys, Ser, , , Glu, and Asn) and residues with probable structure-specific side chains (Trp, Gly, and Pro) were substituted with Ala and evaluated in multiple assays. While all three TMDs were essential, they had different roles: TMD1 was a region through which ExbB interacted with the TonB TMD. TMD2 and TMD3, the most conserved among the ExbB/TolQ/MotA/PomA family, played roles in signal transduction between cytoplasm and periplasm and the transition from ExbB homodimers to homotetramers. Consideration of combined data excludes ExbB TMD residues from direct participation in a proton pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7332615>Myocardial infarction.

By preparing a series of single-residue substitution peptides, the importance to antigenicity of individual residues within this octapeptide has been determined. Here, we investigated a simple and rapid computational analysis to test for correlations between the observed antigenicity of the substitution analogue peptides and the calculated conformational preferences in local regions of the peptides. Conformational  analyses were carried out on all dipeptide combinations represented in the wild-type octapeptide and in the single-residue substitution analogue peptides. Conformational similarities and differences between wild-type and substitution dipeptide pairs were determined. The results of these computational analyses were then compared with the data on the relative antigenicity of the wild-type octapeptide and the substitution analogues. This comparison revealed a positive correlation. Substitution peptides showing changes in antigenicity possessed significant changes in the calculated backbone conformation relative to wild type in the dipeptides encompassing the residue substitution. Substitution peptides showing no change in antigenicity similarly showed no significant changes in dipeptide conformation. The potential utility of dipeptide conformational  analyses and this preliminary structure-activity correlation are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568365>The efficacy of a new 6-phytase obtained from Buttiauxella spp. expressed in Trichoderma reesei on digestibility of amino acids, , and nutrients in pigs fed a diet based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers' dried grains with solubles.</a></h1><p>Sixteen cannulated pigs were used to evaluate the effect of a new 6-phytase derived from Buttiauxella spp. and expressed in Trichoderma reesei on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, N, Ca, P, Na, Mg, K, Cl, and . Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, , total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and . Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , Phe, , and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and ), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, Ile, Leu, , Phe, and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and ) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA. The results from this study showed that in addition to increasing P and Ca utilization, the new Buttiauxella 6-phytase expressed in Trichoderma reesei enhanced ileal digestibility of N and several AA in growing pigs in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29359223>Optical backbone-sidechain charge transfer transitions in proteins sensitive to secondary structure and modifications.</a></h1><p>The absorption of light by proteins can induce charge transfer (CT) transitions in the UV-visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Metal-ligand complexes or active site prosthetic groups which absorb in the visible region exhibit prominent CT transitions. Furthermore, the protein backbone also exhibits CT transitions in the far UV range. In this manuscript, we present a detailed computational study of new near UV-visible CT transitions that involve amino acids with charged side chains. Specifically, using time dependent density functional theory calculations, we examine the absorption spectra of naturally charged amino acids (, Glu, Arg, Asp and His), extracted from solution phase protein structures generated by classical molecular dynamics simulations, and phosphorylated amino acids (,  and Ser) from experimentally determined protein structures. We show that amino acids with charged sidechains present a directed electronic donor-bridge-acceptor paradigm, with the lowest  optical excitations demonstrating peptide backbone-sidechain charge separations. The UV-visible spectral range of the backbone-sidechain CT transitions is determined by the chemical nature of the donor, bridge and acceptor groups within each amino acid, amino acid conformation and the protein secondary structure where the amino acids are located. Photoinduced CT occurs in opposite directions for the anionic and cationic amino acids along the ground state dipole moment vector for the chromophores. We find that photoinduced charge separation is more facile for the anionic amino acids (Asp, Glu, pSer, pThr and pTyr) relative to that for the cationic amino acids (, Arg and Hsp). Our results provide a foundation for the development of spectroscopic markers based on the recently proposed Protein Charge Transfer Spectra (ProCharTS) which are relevant for the study of DNA-binding or intrinsically disordered proteins that are rich in charged amino acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11420432>Effect of the N2 residue on the stability of the alpha-helix for all 20 amino acids.</a></h1><p>N2 is the second position in the alpha-helix. All 20 amino acids were placed in the N2 position of a synthetic helical peptide (CH(3)CO-[AXAAAAKAAAAKAAGY]-NH(2)) and the helix content was measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 273K. The dependence of peptide helicity on N2 residue identity has been used to determine a free- scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory that includes a parameter for the N2  (n2). The rank order of DeltaDeltaG((relative to Ala)) is Glu(-), Asp(-) > Ala > Glu(0), Leu, Val, Gln, , Ile, Ser, Met, Asp(0), His(0), Arg, Cys, , Phe > Asn, > Gly, His(+), Pro, . The results correlate very well with N2 propensities in proteins, moderately well with N1 and helix interior preferences, and not at all with N-cap preferences. The strongest energetic effects result from interactions with the helix dipole, which favors negative charges at the helix N terminus. Hydrogen bonds to side chains at N2, such as Gln, Ser, and , are weak, despite occurring frequently in protein crystal structures, in contrast to the N-cap position. This is because N-cap hydrogen bonds are close to linear, whereas N2 hydrogen bonds have poor geometry. These results can be used to modify protein stability rationally, help design helices, and improve prediction of helix location and stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545767>213 nm Ultraviolet Photodissociation on Peptide Anions: Radical-Directed Fragmentation Patterns.</a></h1><p>Characterization of acidic peptides and proteins is greatly hindered due to lack of suitable analytical techniques. Here we present the implementation of 213 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) in high-resolution quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer in negative polarity for peptide anions. Radical-driven backbone fragmentation provides 22 distinctive fragment ion types, achieving the complete sequence coverage for all reported peptides. Hydrogen-deficient radical anion not only promotes the cleavage of Cα-C bond but also stimulates the breaking of N-Cα and C-N bonds. Radical-directed loss of small molecules and specific side chain of amino acids are detected in these experiments. Radical containing side chain of amino acids (, Ser, , and Asp) may possibly support the N-Cα backbone fragmentation. Proline comprising peptides exhibit the unusual fragment ions similar to reported earlier. Interestingly, basic amino acids such as Arg and  also stimulated the formation of abundant b and y ions of the related peptide anions. Loss of hydrogen atom from the charge-reduced radical anion and fragment ions are rationalized by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculation, locating the potential  surface (PES) of ππ* and repulsive πσ* excited states of a model amide system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2599773>Correlation of beta-bend conformations of tetrapeptides with their activities in CD4-receptor binding assays.</a></h1><p>Conformational analysis, based on ECEPP (Empirical Conformational  Program for Peptides) using the chain build-up procedure, was applied to determine the low- conformations for a series of tetrapeptides. The tetrapeptides are components of larger peptides which have been found to bind to the CD4 receptor of monocytes. Several previous studies have implicated the tetrapeptide units investigated here as being critical to the biological activities of the full peptides. Five such tetrapeptides were studied: Ser-Ser-Asn- (from ribonuclease A), --Asn- (from peptide T, known to block human immunodeficiency virus from attaching to CD4+ T cells), -Ile-Asn- (from polio virus coat protein, which is less active than the other peptides in binding to CD4 receptors), Ser-Ser-Ala- (from the gp 120 coat protein of human immunodeficiency virus, a variant of the peptide T sequence, active in blocking viral attachment to CD4+ cells), and the tetrapeptide from an active synthetic pentapeptide, Asn--- (from Asn----). Using a 7 kcal/mol cutoff, the low- conformations for each peptide were computed. Approximately 20,000 conformations were computed for each tetrapeptide. Residue probability profiles were determined for each tetrapeptide. All tetrapeptides except for the polio sequence showed flexibility in the sense that many low- conformations were possible. In previous studies, it was postulated that the critical tetrapeptide units would adopt conformations similar to the one observed in a segment of ribonuclease A, residues 22-25, a beta-bend, which is part of an octapeptide segment (residues 19-26) that is homologous to the sequence of peptide T.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28798365>Mass & secondary structure propensity of amino acids explain their mutability and evolutionary replacements.</a></h1><p>Why is an amino acid replacement in a protein accepted during evolution? The answer given by bioinformatics relies on the frequency of change of each amino acid by another one and the propensity of each to remain unchanged. We propose that these replacement rules are recoverable from the secondary structural trends of amino acids. A distance measure between high-resolution Ramachandran distributions reveals that structurally similar residues coincide with those found in substitution matrices such as BLOSUM: Asn ↔ Asp, P™he ↔ ,  ↔ Arg, Gln ↔ Glu, Ile ↔ Val, Met → Leu; with Ala, Cys, His, Gly, Ser, Pro, and , as structurally idiosyncratic residues. We also found a high average correlation ([Formula: see text] = 0.85) between thirty amino acid mutability scales and the mutational inertia (I  ), which measures the energetic cost weighted by the number of observations at the most probable amino acid conformation. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions follow two optimally-efficient principles: (a) amino acids interchangeability privileges their secondary structural similarity, and (b) the amino acid mutability depends directly on its biosynthetic  cost, and inversely with its frequency. These two principles are the underlying rules governing the observed amino acid substitutions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25893548>Computational studies of pandemic 1918 and 2009 H1N1 hemagglutinins bound to avian and human receptor analogs.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this work was to study the binding properties of two pandemic influenza A virus 1918 H1N1 (SC1918) and 2009 H1N1 (CA09) hemagglutinin (HA) with avian and human receptors.

The residues  95, Ala 138,  145, Trp 153, Gln 192, and Gln 226 of HA of CA09 virus have found more interaction energies with human than avian receptors. Due to mutations in the active residues of HA of CA09 virus comparing with SC1918, the binding capabilities of HA with human have been increased. The molecular dynamics simulation was made to understand the different dynamical properties of HA and molecular interactions between HA of these two viruses with sialo-trisaccharide receptors of avian and human receptors. The interaction  of HA of CA09 virus with human receptor decreases due to the human receptor far away from conserved residue region of HA protein. This reveals that the conserved residues particularly  145 play major contribution to interaction with human receptor in HA of CA09 virus.</p></html>
